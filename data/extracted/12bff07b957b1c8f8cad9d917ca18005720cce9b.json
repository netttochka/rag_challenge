This is to ensure that coming out \nof the pandemic into a new retail world \nour Group will return to the growing \nbusiness that it was for the ﬁve years prior \nto the pandemic starting.\n \nFY22 was the most diﬃcult period of the \npandemic to date for the Group, with 8 \nmonths of the year being severely \nimpacted. Initially due to government \nmandated lockdowns in the ﬁrst half, \ncausing 50,000 lost trading days and \nfurther impacted with the arrival of the \nOmicron variant for the ﬁrst four months \nof the second half.\nToday we have built a very diﬀerent \nbusiness to that of 2019. A business that \nnow generates $223m or 36% of its \nrevenue through its digital channels, oﬀers \n5,000,000 SKUS covering \n30 categories and attracting approx. \n8,000 new customers weekly through \nits digital powerhouse.\n \nIt has rightsized its store portfolio to a \n952-store network by closing over 400 \nstores where landlords held \npre-pandemic expectations. Our lease \nexpiry proﬁle has also radically shifted \nand provides the group with great \nﬂexibility and negotiation strength.\nThe Group has also reduced its cost of \ndoing business by a further $87m \nagainst the prior year normalising for \nJobKeeper and closing the year with a \nclean stock inventory level.\n \nThe above changes whilst still \nfocussed on our unique mature \ncustomer segment, ensures we are \nstrongly positioned to take advantage \nof the deep shifts in consumer \nbehaviour and demographics in the \nretail sector across both the physical \nand digital channels. This year will see \nthe return to delivering sustainable \nproﬁts as we enter FY23 with stores \ntrading unimpeded for the ﬁrst time in \ntwo and a half years.\nMANAGING DIRECTOR’S\nREPORT\nMosaic Brands has endured the many challenges that have arisen as a result of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, we have stayed focussed on rapidly implementing a \nset strategy for the long-term beneﬁt of the Group.\nGROUP ONLINE REVENUE $M\nLore\n2016\n2017\n2018\n160\n240\n80\n30%\n45%\n15%\n0%\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\nOnline Revenue $\nOnline Contribution %\n8          EVERYTHING SHE WANTS, WHERE SHE WANTS IT, WHEN SHE WANTS IT."

      "text": "A UNIQUE MARKET\nWhile Mosaic Brands has undertaken signiﬁcant structural \nchange across the business, we continued over the past \n12 months to ensure the safety of our customers and teams \ncome ﬁrst. During this pandemic we have stayed ﬁrm on \nthis point.\nThe arrival of the Omicron variant further tested our resolve \non this and I am proud that we again did not waver from \nputting safety before ﬁnancials.\n \nAs Richard has highlighted in his report, those customers are \nthe greatest risk segment, the most cautious and had the \nleast access to Government stimulus, most notably \nJobKeeper, during this pandemic.\n \nThe Group lost just under 50,000 trading days during\nthe ﬁrst half of the year with up to 650 stores closed every\nweek from July to end October.\nAs we had seen with previous lockdowns, the Group \nrebounded swiftly as the customer quickly returned resulting \nin the Group achieving comparable store growth of +1% for \nthe half. This was the third half in a row to post positive \ncomp store growth seeing the Group deliver an $8 million \nEBITDA* proﬁt for the half.\n \nPost the lockdowns ending in October the Group delivered a \nstrong Christmas result and carried positive momentum as it \nentered 2022 calendar year and looked forward to a solid \nand somewhat normalised second half.\n \nHowever, the onset of the Omicron variant at the end of \nDecember was by far the most diﬃcult episode of the \npandemic as our customers in particular entered a \nself-imposed lockdown.\n \nThe rapid spread of this variant created enhanced concern \nacross our customer segment and impacted January to April \nheavily. This self-imposed lockdown slowly starting to \nalleviate as May progressed but not to the level needed to \noﬀset the impacts seen in the January to April period. \nHowever this positive trend continued to gain momentum \nwith June growing to be the strongest month for the half \nand delivered a 11% comparable growth for the month.\n \nDuring the second half, the Group reduced margins to drive \nsales in order to stimulate conversion and ensure a clean \nand correct stock position to enter FY23. As a result, the \nGroup delivered -4.5% comparable store growth for the half \nand -1.7% for the full year.\n \nAlthough our customer sector has been the most impacted \nby the pandemic, they still remain an inﬂuential part of the \nretail sector.\n \nAverage consumption per Australian household aged 55 \nyears and above has grown nearly twice as fast as the \naverage of other households in recent years.\n \nHouseholds aged 55-64 consumed more on average \n($123,000) than those aged 35-44 ($111,000).\nIn the United States people over 50 are now responsible for \nhalf of all consumer spending but less than 10% of marketing \nbudgets are targeted at them.\n \nDespite this spending power a McKinsey survey in March \n2022 highlighted around two-thirds of Australian consumers \nin our core market still said they were not ready to return to \nlife as normal.\n \nWhile understandable, this hibernation and cautious \ncustomer behaviour has had a signiﬁcant impact on our \noperations and proﬁtability that has gone far beyond other \nretailers simply facing inﬂation, supply chain issues or \nstore closures.\n \nIt has required the Group to not only be ﬂeet of foot in \nmanaging immediate changes but also ensuring we shape \nMosaic Brands to be strongly positioned to take advantage \nof the major shifts occurring in the retail landscape.\n \nHaving done so, we are conﬁdent these changes will not \nonly beneﬁt our existing customers but those who are \ncoming into our demographic sector of the fashion industry.\n \nA BIG STRATEGY SHIFT\nMosaic Brands puts our customers at the heart of everything \nwe do and in doing so we’ve been able to anticipate and \n$223M\nGROUP ONLINE SALES\nUP 7%\nSHOP NOW\n400,000\n300,000\n200,000\n100,000\nJul\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJuly - October \nGovernment COVID Lockdown\nDecember - February\nOmincron COVID Variant\nRETURNED SHOPPERS TO STORE LTM\nMOSAIC BRANDS LIMITED  ANNUAL REPORT 2022          9"

Mosaic also owns and operates EziBuy, a New Zealand \nOnline digital apparel brand.\nDIVIDENDS PAID, DECLARED OR RECOMMENDED\nDue to the continuing impact and challenges caused by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic on the Group’s results, no dividends were \ndeclared or paid during the current financial year from the \ndividend profit reserve.\nSIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE STATE OF AFFAIRS\nEziBuy acquisition\nOn 14 April 2022 the Group gained shareholder approval through \nan extraordinary general meeting to exercise the option granted \nby Alceon Retail in the prior year to acquire the remaining 49.9% \nof shares in EziBuy for the exercise price of $11,000,000. The \ncompletion payment was subsequently made on 20 June 2022. \nThe purchase of EziBuy will see the Group continue its online \ngrowth as customers move towards online channels which has \nseen a significant shift over the past 2 years.\nConvertible notes\nDuring the period the Group completed a capital raising of \n$32,017,808 by issuing 32,017,808 secured convertible notes \nat a value of $1.00 per note with a cash bearing interest rate \nof 8% per annum (payable quarterly in arrears). 25,642,668 of \nthe convertible notes were issued on 13 October 2021, and \na further 6,375,140 notes were issued on 22 November 2021. \nNoteholders may convert the notes in whole or in part into \nordinary shares at any time from 30 September 2022 until \nmaturity on 30 September 2024. The $32,018,000 capital raise \nprovides the Group with additional balance sheet and cash flow \nsupport following the impact from the 2021 Government imposed \nlockdowns from the coronavirus pandemic and impacts caused \nfrom both the delta and omicron variant. The debt component of \nthe convertible notes is measured at amortised cost. The equity \nconversion feature of the convertible notes is measured at fair \nvalue through profit or loss as set out in note 22 and note 26. The \nincrease in market volatility experienced during the COVID-19 \npandemic may cause significant fluctuations in the fair value of \nthe equity conversion feature between measurement dates. \nCredit facility completed\nIn December 2021 the Group completed its finance facility with \nthe Commonwealth Bank which will see the Group available \nto $49,000,000 in funding. The terms of the facility include a \n‘Trade Finance Facility’ of $25,000,000 (previously this included \na seasonal $10,000,000 step-up which has been removed with a \nnew step-up facility currently being finalised), a ‘Working Capital \nFacility’ of $20,000,000 and a ‘Guarantee and credit facility’ of \n$4,000,000. The facility comes with a term ending August 2024. \nThere were no other significant changes in the state of affairs of \nthe Group during the financial year.\nMATTERS SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE \nFINANCIAL YEAR\nAs noted in the Company’s market update dated 8 June 2022, \nthe Group withdrew guidance, due to adverse trading conditions \nexperienced throughout the third quarter and the key Mother’s \nDay trading period, both of which were impacted by ongoing \ndisruptions caused by Omicron. The Group has worked with its \nbank to ensure that it remains appropriately capitalised and that \nappropriate covenants are in place whilst earnings continue to \nbe adversely affected. During this review period, the Group’s \naccess to a seasonal working capital facility of up of $10,000,000 \nhas been removed and a new step up facility is currently being \nfinalised. This is not expected to have a material impact on the \nGroup’s operations. \nApart from the above, no other matter or circumstances has \narisen since 3 July 2022 that has significantly affected, or may \nsignificantly affect the Groups operations, the results of those \noperations, or the state of affairs in future financial years.\nLIKELY FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND \nEXPECTED RESULTS\nThe likely developments in the operations of the Group and the \nexpected results of those operations in financial years subsequent \nto the year ended 3 July 2022 is included in the operational and \nfinancial highlights section of this report. The Group aims to focus \non its 'Big Growth Strategy’ which centres on ‘Big Digital’ with \nSKU and category expansion with an international presence and \nincreased market acquisition as well as ‘Big Stores’ strategy which \nis focused on larger formatted stores which will provide a bigger \noffering and better experience for the customer.\nENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION\nThe Group’s operations are not subject to any significant \nenvironmental obligations or regulations under Australian \nCommonwealth or State Law. \nDIRECTORS' REPORT\n40         EVERYTHING SHE WANTS, WHERE SHE WANTS IT, WHEN SHE WANTS IT."

      "text": "NOTE \u0015. SIGNIFICANT \nACCOUNTING POLICIES \nThe financial report of Mosaic Brands Limited for the 53 weeks \nended 3 July 2022 was authorised for issue in accordance with a \nresolution of the Directors on 31 August 2022.\nMosaic Brands is a for-profit company limited by shares \nincorporated and domiciled in Australia whose shares are publicly \ntraded on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX: MOZ). The \nConsolidated Entity owns and operates nine retail clothing brands \npredominantly within the women’s apparel and accessories within \nAustralia and New Zealand sold through its store network and \nonline digital department platforms. \n(a)\t Basis of preparation \nThese general purpose financial statements have been prepared \nin accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, Australian \nAccounting Standards and Interpretations of the Australian \nAccounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting \nStandards as issued by the International Accounting Standards \nBoard. Material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of \nthese financial statements are presented below and have been \nconsistently applied unless stated otherwise.\nExcept for cash flow information, the financial statements have \nbeen prepared on an accruals basis and are based on historical \ncosts, modified, where applicable, by the measurement at \nfair value of selected non-current assets, financial assets and \nfinancial liabilities.\nGoing concern evaluation\nDuring the 2022 financial year the Group continued to manage \nthe operations effectively in order to weather the global impacts \nand Government mandated shutdowns caused by the COVID-19 \npandemic including its subsequent Delta and Omicron variants. \nThere continues to remain risk of new variants which could impact \nthe Group’s customer which could impact trade in the future \nand can cause further disruptions. The management process and \nactions in the current period resulted in the Group ending with \na net current liability position of $153,646,000 as at 3 July 2022 \n(June 2021: $152,922,000). Whilst the Group ended the year with \ncash on hand of $42,763,000 the Group posted a net loss after \ntax of $11,154,000 for the year ended 3 July 2022. \nThe Directors believe it is appropriate to prepare the financial \nreport on a going concern basis after considering the \nfollowing factors: \n\t\n●During the period the Group completed the capital raising \nprocess by raising $32,018,000 from issuing 32,018,000 in \nsecured convertible notes at a value of $1.00 per note 22. \nEach note has a cash bearing interest rate of 8% per annum \nand may be converted in whole or in part into ordinary shares \nat any time from 30 September 2022 until the earlier of the \nmaturity date 30 September 2024. The $32,018,000 capital \nraise provides the Group with additional balance sheet and \ncash flow support following the impact from the Government \nimposed lockdowns as restrictions begin to ease and stores \nre-open for trade. This sets the Group with a positive step \nforward post the coronavirus virus pandemic and impacts \ncaused from both the delta and omicron variant.\n\t\n●Despite recording a net current liability position of \n$153,646,000, current liabilities include $47,627,000 in current \nlease liabilities (June 2021: $64,636,000), contract liabilities \nof $12,015,000 (June 2021: $13,408,000), derivative financial \ninstruments of $1,970,000 (June 2021: $109,000), borrowings \nof $32,861,000 (2021: $16,450,000) and employee benefit \nprovisions which may not be settled in cash over the next \ntwelve months of $6,402,000 (June 2021: $6,792,000). \n\t\n●The Group completed during the year its new finance facility \nwith the Commonwealth Bank which sees the Group having \naccess to $49,000,000 in funding (previously $25,000,000 \nwith the ANZ Bank). The terms of the facility include a ‘Trade \nFinance Facility’ of $25,000,000, a ‘Working Capital Facility’ \nof $20,000,000 and a ‘Guarantee and credit facility’ of \n$4,000,000. The facility is classified as a current liability and \ncomes with a term ending August 2024 which provides the \nGroup with additional funding should it need as restrictions \nease and stores begin to re-open. \n\t\n●Following a successful renegotiation of its covenants with the \nCommonwealth Bank, the Group is confident of complying \nwith its reset covenants and that the facilities mentioned \nabove will continue to be available for at least the next \n12 months from the date of signing this report.\n\t\n●The Group’s cash flow forecast for the next 12 months \nsuggests there is sufficient cash available for it to be able to \npays its debts as and when they become payable.\n\t\n●Management were able to successfully manage working \ncapital during COVID-19 pandemic across the 2020 and 2021 \nfinancial years which has continued into the 2022 financial \nyear. These periods included Government imposed lockdowns \nacross the states which involved management following the \nbelow strategies:   \n\t\n●\ncancelling or delaying inventory orders\n\t\n●\ncontinuing to pursue operating efficiencies including \nstore wages and operating hours\n\t\n●\nre-negotiating and extending payment terms with \nkey suppliers \n\t\n●\nnegotiating rental concessions and modified rental \nagreements with landlords\nShould the cash flow forecast not proceed as planned, the Group \nin all events, retains the ability to take alternative measures, \nwhich may include capital raisings, renegotiation of financing \ncovenants and facilities, additional debt financing or further cost \ncurtailment, which the Group has a history of achieving.\nThe Directors have concluded that there are reasonable grounds \nto believe that the Group will be able to pay its debts as and \nwhen they fall due. On this basis the financial report has been \nprepared on a going concern basis.\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nMOSAIC BRANDS LIMITED  ANNUAL REPORT 2022          57"

      "text": "NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(b)\t New or amended Accounting Standards and \nInterpretations adopted\nThe consolidated entity has adopted all of the new or \namended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by \nthe Australian Accounting Standards Board ('AASB') that are \nmandatory for the current reporting period.\nAny new or amended Accounting Standards or Interpretations \nthat are not yet mandatory have not been early adopted.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets \nand liabilities of all subsidiaries of Mosaic Brands Limited as \nat 3 July 2022. Mosaic Brands Limited and its subsidiaries \ntogether are referred to in these financial statements as the \n‘Consolidated Entity’. \nSubsidiaries are all those entities over which the consolidated \nentity has control. The consolidated entity controls an entity \nwhen the consolidated entity is exposed to, or has rights to, \nvariable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the \nability to affect those returns through its power to direct the \nactivities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the \ndate on which control is transferred to the consolidated entity. \nThey are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.\nIntercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on \ntransactions between entities in the consolidated entity are \neliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the \ntransaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset \ntransferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been \nchanged where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies \nadopted by the consolidated entity\n(c)\t Fair value measurement\nThe Group measures some of its assets and liabilities at fair value \non either a recurring or non-recurring basis, depending on the \nrequirements of the applicable Accounting Standard.\nFair value is the price the Group would receive to sell an asset \nor would have to pay to transfer a liability in an orderly (i.e. \nunforced) transaction between independent, knowledgeable and \nwilling market participants at the measurement date.\nAs fair value is a market-based measure, the closest equivalent \nobservable market pricing information is used to determine fair \nvalue. Adjustments to market values may be made having regard \nto the characteristics of the specific asset or liability. The fair \nvalues of assets and liabilities that are not traded in an active \nmarket are determined using one or more valuation techniques. \nThese valuation techniques maximise, to the extent possible, the \nuse of observable market data.\nTo the extent possible, market information is extracted from either \nthe principal market for the asset or liability (i.e. the market with \nthe greatest volume and level of activity for the asset or liability) \nor, in the absence of such a market, the most advantageous \nmarket available to the entity at the end of the reporting period \n(i.e. the market that maximises the receipts from the sale of the \nasset or minimises the payments made to transfer the liability, \nafter taking into account transaction costs and transport costs).\nFor non-financial assets, the fair value measurement also takes \ninto account a market participant’s ability to use the asset in its \nhighest and best use or to sell it to another market participant \nthat would use the asset in its highest and best use.\nThe fair value of liabilities and the entity’s own equity instruments \n(excluding those related to share-based payment arrangements) \nmay be valued, where there is no observable market price in \nrelation to the transfer of such financial instruments, by reference \nto observable market information where such instruments are \nheld as assets. Where this information is not available, other \nvaluation techniques are adopted and, where significant, are \ndetailed in the respective note to the financial statements.\n(d)\t Financial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at \nfair value. Transaction costs are included as part of the initial \nmeasurement, except for financial instruments at fair value \nthrough profit or loss. \nFinancial assets are subsequently measured at either amortised \ncost or fair value depending on their classification. Classification is \ndetermined based on both the business model within which such \nassets are held and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the \nfinancial asset. The consolidated entity’s cash and cash equivalents \nand other receivables are classified as at amortised cost. \nCertain investments qualify to be recognised and measured \nsubsequently at fair value through other comprehensive income \n(‘OCI’) on exercise of an irrevocable election at the time of initial \nrecognition, otherwise they are recognised at fair value through \nprofit or loss. \nFinancial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost. \nDerivatives are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. \nAmortised cost is calculated as the amount at which the financial \nasset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition less \nprincipal repayments and any reduction for impairment, and \nadjusted for any cumulative amortisation of the difference \nbetween that initial amount and the maturity amount calculated \nusing the effective interest method.\nThe consolidated entity recognises a loss allowance for expected \ncredit losses on debt instruments which are either measured \nat amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive \nincome. The measurement of the loss allowance depends \nupon the consolidated entity's assessment at the end of each \nreporting period as to whether the financial instrument's credit \nrisk has increased significantly since initial recognition, based on \nreasonable and supportable information that is available, without \nundue cost or effort to obtain. For financial assets measured \nat fair value through other comprehensive income, the loss \nallowance is recognised within other comprehensive income. In \nall other cases, the loss allowance is recognised in profit or loss. \nNOTE \u0015.

At the date of issue, the equity conversion feature of \nthe convertible notes was classified as an embedded derivative \nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss (refer to note \n26). The debt component was classified as a financial liability \nmeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest method \nuntil extinguished upon conversion or at the instrument’s \nmaturity date.\nTransaction costs that relate to the issue of the convertible \nnotes are allocated to the debt and embedded derivative \n(equity conversion option) components in proportion to the \nallocation of the gross proceeds. Transaction costs relating to \nequity conversion option are recognised directly in profit or loss. \nTransaction costs relating to the debt component are included in \nthe carrying amount of the debt component and are amortised \nover the life of the convertible notes using the effective \ninterest method.\n(e)\t Foreign currency translation\nThe financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, \nwhich is the functional and presentation currency for Mosaic \nBrands Limited. \nForeign currency transactions\nForeign currency transactions are translated into Australian \ndollars using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the \ntransactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from \nthe settlement of such transactions and from the translation \nat financial year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and \nliabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in \nprofit or loss.\nForeign operations\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into \nAustralian dollars using the exchange rates at the reporting date. \nThe revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated \ninto Australian dollars using the average exchange rates, which \napproximate the rates at the dates of the transactions, for the \nperiod. All resulting foreign exchange differences are recognised \nin other comprehensive income through the foreign currency \nreserve in equity.\nThe foreign currency reserve is recognised in profit or loss when \nthe foreign operation or net investment is disposed of.\n(f)\t\nEmployee benefits \nEmployees of the Group receive defined contribution \nsuperannuation entitlements for which the Group pays the \nfixed superannuation guarantee contribution (2022: 10% of the \nemployee’s average ordinary salary, 10.5% from 1st July 2022) to \nthe employee’s superannuation fund of choice. All contributions \nin respect of employees’ defined contribution entitlements \nare recognised as an expense when they become payable. \nThe Group’s obligation with respect to employees’ defined \ncontribution entitlements is limited to its obligation for any \nunpaid superannuation guarantee contributions at the end of \nthe reporting period. All obligations for unpaid superannuation \nguarantee contributions are measured at the (undiscounted) \namounts expected to be paid when the obligation is settled and \nare presented as current liabilities in the Group’s statement of \nfinancial position.\n(g)\t Goods and Services Tax (GST) \nRevenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount \nof goods and services tax (GST) except where the amount of GST \nincurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office \n(ATO) and New Zealand Inland Revenue Department (IRD).\nReceivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount \nof GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST \nrecoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority is included \nin Trade and other receivables or payables in the statement of \nfinancial position.\nCash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components \nof cash flows arising from investing or financing activities \nwhich are recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority are \npresented as operating cash flows included in receipts from \ncustomers or payments to suppliers.\nCommitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount \nof GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority.\n(h)\t Period \nWhen required by Accounting Standards, comparative figures \nhave been adjusted to conform to changes in presentation for the \ncurrent financial year. The current reporting period, 28 June 2021 \nto 3 July 2022, represents 53 weeks and the comparative \nreporting period is from 29 June 2020 to 27 June 2021 which \nrepresents 52 weeks. \n(i)\t\nRounding of amounts \nThe company is of a kind referred to in Corporations Instrument \n2016/191, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments \nCommission, relating to 'rounding-off'.

This \nconsideration extends to the nature of the products offered, \ncustomers, supply chain, staffing and geographic regions in \nwhich the consolidated entity operates, and the resulting \nfinancial impacts and disclosures. The estimates and judgments \nmade in the financial statements following the impacts from the \nCoronavirus (COVID-19) is in Inventories (note 8) and Right-of-use \nassets (note 12). \n(k) \t Parent entity information \nIn accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, these financial \nstatements present the results of the consolidated entity only. \nSupplementary information about the parent entity is disclosed in \nnote 30.\n(l)\t\nNew Accounting Standards and Interpretations \nnot yet mandatory or early adopted\nAustralian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have \nrecently been issued or amended but are not yet mandatory, \nhave not been early adopted by the consolidated entity for the \nannual reporting period ended 30 June 2022. The consolidated \nentity has not yet assessed the impact of these new or amended \nAccounting Standards and Interpretations. \n(m)\t Leases \nRight-of-use assets\nA right-of-use asset is recognised at the commencement date \nof a lease. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which \ncomprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted \nfor, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the \ncommencement date net of any lease incentives received, any \ninitial direct costs incurred, and, except where included in the \ncost of inventories, an estimate of costs expected to be incurred \nfor dismantling and removing the underlying asset, and restoring \nthe site or asset.\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over \nthe unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of \nthe asset, whichever is the shorter. Where the consolidated entity \nexpects to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of \nthe lease term, the depreciation is over its estimated useful life. \nRight-of-use assets are subject to impairment or adjusted for any \nre-measurements of lease liabilities.\nLease liabilities\nA lease liability is recognised at the commencement date of a \nlease. The lease liability is initially recognised at the present value \nof the lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, \ndiscounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that \nrate cannot be readily determined, and the consolidated entity's \nincremental borrowing rate. Lease payments comprise of fixed \npayments less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease \npayments that depend on an index or a rate, amounts expected \nto be paid under residual value guarantees, exercise price of a \npurchase option when the exercise of the option is reasonably \ncertain to occur, and any anticipated termination penalties. The \nvariable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a \nrate are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Lease \nliabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective \ninterest method. The carrying amounts are remeasured if there is \na change in the following: future lease payments arising from a \nchange in an index or a rate used; residual guarantee; lease term; \ncertainty of a purchase option and termination penalties. When \na lease liability is remeasured, an adjustment is made to the \ncorresponding right-of-use asset, or to profit or loss if the carrying \namount of the right-of-use asset is fully written down.\nDuring the year, certain lease agreements were varied or lease \nobligations relieved due to COVID-19. Where a lease agreement \nis amended prospectively, the consolidated entity recognises the \namendment as a modification and remeasures the lease liability \nand right-of-use asset accordingly. Where the consolidated entity \nenters into an agreement which relieves the consolidated entity \nfrom existing lease payable obligations, this is recognised as \nan extinguishment of the rent payable liability and recognised \nimmediately in profit or loss. \n(n)\t Current and non-current classification \nAssets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial \nposition based on current and non-current classification.\nAn asset is classified as current when: it is either expected to be \nrealised or intended to be sold or consumed in the consolidated \nentity's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose \nof trading; it is expected to be realised within 12 months after the \nreporting period; or the asset is cash or cash equivalent unless \nrestricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for \nat least 12 months after the reporting period.

Deferred tax assets recognised \nare reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that \nfuture taxable profits will be available for the carrying amount \nto be recovered. Previously unrecognised deferred tax assets are \nrecognised to the extent that it is probable that there are future \ntaxable profits available to recover the asset.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only where there is \na legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against \ncurrent tax liabilities and deferred tax assets against deferred tax \nliabilities; and they relate to the same taxable authority on either \nthe same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend \nto settle simultaneously.\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary \ndifferences and losses only if the Group considers it is probable \nthat future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those \ntemporary differences and losses. \nRecoverability of deferred tax assets\nThe Group has recorded a deferred tax asset relating to the \nfuture benefit of tax losses of $17,979,000 (2021: $4,863,000). \nThe Group assesses the impairment of deferred tax assets \nby taking into account its projected profitability over the \nforeseeable future and hence its ability to recover the value of \nthe deferred tax asset by reducing future liabilities for income tax. \nManagement’s forecasts project that the deferred tax asset is \nfully recoverable based on the below:\n\t\n●Growth in sales and margin in the 2023 and future \nfinancial years\n\t\n●Continuation of the tight cost management and inventory \nintake strategies which has proven to be successful over the \npast 8 years\n\t\n●Continued availability of the Group’s financing facilities\nWhere actual results are lower than expectations as described \nabove a proportion of the deferred tax asset may not be used, \nand a write-off of the deferred tax asset may be required. \nTax consolidation\nMosaic Brands Limited (the ‘head entity’) and its wholly-owned \nAustralian controlled entities formed an income tax consolidated \ngroup under the tax consolidation regime as of 1 July 2005.

Depreciation is \ncalculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives covering a period of three to six years. The residual values, useful lives \nand depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.\nKey estimate and judgement\nThe carrying values of store assets include plant and equipment and right-of-use assets are reviewed for impairment annually for \nevents or changes in circumstances that may indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If an indication of impairment exists, \nand where the carrying values exceeds the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount. \nImpairment indicators are assessed at the store level.\nThe Group determines the estimated useful lives and related depreciation and amortisation charges for its plant and equipment and \nfinite life intangible assets. The useful lives could change significantly as a result of technical innovations or some other event. The \ndepreciation and amortisation charge will increase where the useful lives are less than previously estimated lives, or technically obsolete \nor non-strategic assets that have been abandoned, sold, written off or written down.\nNOTE \u0015\u0016.

During the year the Group \nhad an additional $22,539,000 of new leases. \nKey estimate and judgement\nThe carrying values of store assets include plant and equipment and right-of-use assets are reviewed for impairment annually for events \nor changes in circumstances that may indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If an indication of impairment exists, and \nwhere the carrying values exceeds the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount. An \nimpairment loss recognised in prior periods shall be reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine \nthe asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset \nshall be increased to its recoverable amount as measured by AASB 16. That increase is a reversal of an impairment loss. The increased \ncarrying amount of an asset attributable to a reversal of an impairment loss shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have \nbeen determined (net of depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Impairment indicators are \nassessed at the store level, which includes a review of a store’s performance over the past 3 years and management’s estimate on the \nlikelihood of the stores closure. For the period ended 3 July 2022 the right-of-use assessment, after considering the market outlook \nwith Government imposed lockdowns removed and foot traffic returning to centres and the effect this had on management’s estimate \nfor stores previously earmarked for closure, resulted in a Group impairment loss reversal of $16,676,000 (2021: impairment loss of \n$11,684,000). This reflects a positive outlook for the Groups assets than what was assessed in the prior year during the pandemic.\nNOTE \u0015\u0015.

Goodwill is the excess of the \ncost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in \nthe net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities \nand contingent liabilities. Goodwill on acquisition is included in \nintangible assets along with Brand names and is allocated to \ncash generating units (CGUs) for the purposes of impairment \ntesting. Goodwill and Brand names are assessed as having an \nindefinite useful life and are tested annually for impairment or \nmore frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate \nthat it might be impaired. Goodwill and Brand names are \ncarried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment \nlosses are taken to the profit or loss and are, for Goodwill, not \nsubsequently reversed. \nImpairment of brand names is determined comparing the \nrecoverable amount of brand calculated using the relief from \nroyalty method to the carrying value of the brand. The relief from \nroyalty method is a calculation of the amount of the hypothetical \nroyalty that would be paid if the brands were licensed from \nan independent third party. When the recoverable amount of \nthe brand is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss \nis recognised.\nImpairment of goodwill is determined by assessing the \nrecoverable amount of the CGUs, which is done at the brand \nlevel. Each brand is a fashion and retail brand selling both \nin stores and online. When the recoverable amount of the \nCGU is less than the carrying amount of the CGU (after any \nimpairment of individual assets is recognised), an impairment \nloss is recognised. The recoverable amount of the CGU has been \ndetermined based upon the value in use approach.\nTrademarks were acquired through the acquisition of the \nMillers, Autograph, Katies, Crossroads and Rivers brands. These \ntrademarks are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period \nof their expected benefit, being their finite life of 3 years, and are \ntested annually for impairment.\nMOSAIC BRANDS LIMITED  ANNUAL REPORT 2022          69"

The brands within \nthe Pretty Girl Fashion Group include Rockmans, W. Lane and \nbeme. An independent valuation of the brand names acquired \nas part of the transaction resulted in a total brand valuation \nof $36,300,000. \nOn 2 July 2018, the Group acquired the Millers, Autograph, Rivers, \nCrossroads and Katies brands from the Specialty Fashion Group \nthrough a business combination (collectively known as MARCK). \nAn independent valuation of the brand names acquired as part of \nthe transaction resulted in a total brand valuation of $20,900,000 \nwith value attributable to all brands except Crossroads.\nThe fair value of the acquired Brands was determined based upon \nthe relief from royalty method at acquisition date. The royalty \nrates used in the valuation were based on rates observed in the \nmarket. Brand names are assessed as having an indefinite useful \nlife. The indefinite useful life reflects management’s intention to \ncontinue to operate these brands to generate net cash inflows \ninto the foreseeable future.\nImpairment indicators\nDuring the 2022 financial year, the global Coronavirus (COVID-19) \npandemic continued to have economic consequences through \nboth the delta and omicron variants creating market uncertainty \nwithin the retail industry. The impacts included Government \nimposed lockdowns, store closures for the non-performing \nstores and delays in the logistic supply-chain for the sourcing \nand delivery for new and seasonally core products. During the \nsecond half of the 2022 financial year, the east coast of Australia \nexperienced flood events impacting regions and certain stores \nheld by the Group. This had a further impact on the Group which \nin addition to the coronavirus pandemic contributed downward \ntrends in revenue, gross margin and financial performance, which \nhave had an impact on the royalty rates and discount rates used \nin management’s impairment assessment. On the basis of these \nfactors management determined that impairment losses should \nbe recognised totalling $5,813,000 for brand names (2021: \n$8,419,000). More detail on the calculation of these impairment \nlosses is included below.\nDetermination of key assumptions and inputs\nForecasts\nManagement has prepared forecasts for a four-year period \nderived from the approved budget for FY2023. These forecasts \ninclude assumptions around sales prices and volumes, operating \ncosts and working capital movements. Management assesses \nthe reasonableness of its forecasting by reviewing historical \nprojections as well as future growth objectives. \nRisk adjusted discount rates\nThe discount rates are derived from the Group’s weighted \naverage cost of capital as adjusted for the specific risks related to \neach brand.\nLong-term growth rate\nTo forecast into perpetuity beyond the discrete forecast period, \na long-term growth rate is used. To establish an appropriate rate, \nmanagement considers long-term inflation and GDP forecasts and \nadjusts for industry specific impacts.\nRoyalty rate\nRoyalty rates have been reviewed by management with reference \nto the rates which were determined on initial recognition of \nthe brands. Where considered necessary these rates have \nbeen revised to factor in subsequent changes in the economic \nenvironment that impact the ability of a market participant to \nderive the same level of royalties.\nSensitivity analysis\nThe results of the Group’s impairment tests are dependent upon \nestimates and judgements made by management, particularly in \nrelation to the key assumptions described above. A reasonably \npossible change in key assumptions could lead to a change of \nthe amount of impairment recognised by the Group. The Group \nhas therefore conducted an analysis of the sensitivity of the \nimpairment conclusions to changes in the key assumptions used \nto determine the recoverable amount for each brand name. This is \nincluded below.\nImpairment of brand names \nThe relief from royalty calculation is based on the discrete cash \nflow projections as at June 2022 for a period of four years, and a \nterminal value. The key assumptions utilised within the model are:\n\t\n●Projections based on the FY2023 budget approved by the \nboard and projected for a further three years based on a \ngrowth rate estimated by management of 5.5% to 10.6% in \nFY2024 (2021: 3.5%), 3.8% to 10.2% in FY2025 (2021: 2.3%) \nand 3.8% to 10.2% in FY2026 (2021: 1.0%). \n\t\n●A terminal growth rate of 1.0% (2021: 1.0%)\n\t\n●A tax rate applied of 30% is based on the corporate tax rate \nin Australia (2021: 30%)\nNOTE \u0015\u0017.

The Consolidated Entity applies judgment in \nevaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether leases will be extended beyond the contracted period. \nHoldover leases\nThe Consolidated Entity has historically always had several lease contracts in holdover. The Consolidated Entity applies judgment in \nevaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether leases will be extended beyond the contracted period. Given the current economic \nenvironment the Consolidated Entity does not consider the extension of the lease term beyond 12 months to be reasonably certain and \ntherefore recognises these leases as short term. A range of one to ten years’ extension is estimated based on average lease terms. \nIncremental borrowing rate\nWhere the interest rate implicit in a lease cannot be readily determined, an incremental borrowing rate is estimated to discount future \nlease payments to measure the present value of the lease liability at the lease commencement date. Such a rate is based on what the \nconsolidated entity estimates it would have to pay a third party to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to \nthe right-of-use asset, with similar terms, security and economic environment.\nNOTE \u0015\u001d.

During the year the Directors decided to transfer the profit for the period ended 26 December 2021 of \n$14,340,000 (2021: $13,003,000) to the dividend profit reserve which will enable the declaration of a future dividend. The transfer \ninto the dividend profit reserve was recorded based on the profit recognised for the period ended 26 December 2021. No dividends \nwere declared or paid during the 2022 financial year.

The \nGroup uses different methods to measure the different types of risk to which it is exposed. These methods include monitoring interest \nrates, foreign exchange rates and ageing analysis for credit risk. Risk management is carried out by senior finance executives under \npolicies approved by the Board which includes identification and analysis of the risk exposure. \nCapital Risk Management \nManagement controls the capital of the Group in order to maintain a sustainable debt to equity ratio, generate long-term shareholder \nvalue and ensure that the Group can fund its operations and continue as a going concern.\nThe Group’s debt and capital include ordinary share capital and financial liabilities, supported by financial assets.

These responses include the management of debt levels, distributions to \nshareholders and share issues.\nThere have been no changes in the strategy adopted by management to control the capital of the Group since the prior year.

It also reviews the effectiveness of internal \ncontrols relating to commodity price risk, counterparty credit risk, \ncurrency risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk. \nThe Boards overall risk management strategy seeks to assist the \nGroup in meeting its financial targets, while minimising potential \nadverse effects on financial performance. Its functions include the \nreview of the use of hedging derivative instruments, credit risk \npolicies and future cash flow requirements.\nSpecific Financial Risk Exposures and Management\nThe main risks the Group is exposed to through its financial \ninstruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, and market risk \nconsisting of interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and other \nprice risk (commodity and equity price risk). There have been no \nsubstantive changes in the types of risks the Group is exposed \nto, how these risks arise, or the Board’s objectives, policies \nand processes for managing or measuring the risks from the \nprevious period.\nCredit Risk \nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on \nits contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. \nCredit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivatives and \ndeposits with banks. As sales to retail customers are settled in \ncash or using major credit cards within 24 hours, the Group is \nmitigated from any material credit risk exposure to any single \ndebtor or group of debtors. Current trade account receivables are \nnon-interest bearing loans and are generally on 45 day terms. \nMarket Risk\nForeign currency risk \nThe Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in \nforeign currency and is exposed to foreign currency risk through \nforeign exchange rate fluctuations. \nForeign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions \nand recognised financial assets and financial liabilities \ndenominated in a currency that is not the entity's functional \ncurrency. The risk is measured using sensitivity analysis and cash \nflow forecasting.\nIn order to protect against exchange rate movements, the Group \nhas entered into forward foreign exchange contracts. These \ncontracts are hedging highly probable forecasted cash flows for \nthe ensuing financial year. \nThe contracts are timed to mature when payments for certain \nshipments of inventory are scheduled to be made. The fair value \nof forward exchange contracts is determined using forward \nexchange market rates at reporting date.\nThe maturity, settlement amounts and the average contractual \nexchange rates of the Group's outstanding forward foreign \nexchange contracts at the reporting date was as follows:\nBuy US dollars\nSell AUD dollars\nAverage exchange rate\n2022 \n$'000 \n2021 \n$'000\n2022 \n$\n2021 \n$\nMaturity:\nLess than 1 year\n47,444\n42,391\n0.7020\n0.7623\nThe derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss. \nMOSAIC BRANDS LIMITED  ANNUAL REPORT 2022          79"

In addition, the agreed classification of the equity conversion feature is a Level 2 financial instrument (and therefore no \nsensitivity analysis is required to be disclosed on unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement).\nInterest Rate Risk \nThe Group’s main interest rate risk arises from loans and borrowings.

The fair value hierarchy is as follows:\n\t\n●Level 1 – the fair value is calculated using quoted prices in \nactive markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\t\n●Level 2 – the fair value is estimated using inputs other than \nquoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for \nthe asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly \n(derived from prices). \n\t\n●Level 3 – the fair value is estimated using inputs for the asset \nor liability that are not based on observable market data.\nThe fair values of assets and liabilities that are not traded in \nan active market are determined using one or more valuation \ntechniques. These valuation techniques maximise, to the extent \npossible, the use of observable market data. If all significant \ninputs required to measure fair value are observable, the asset \nor liability is included in Level 2. If one or more significant inputs \nare not based on observable market data, the asset or liability is \nincluded in Level 3.\n80         EVERYTHING SHE WANTS, WHERE SHE WANTS IT, WHEN SHE WANTS IT."

The carrying value of inventories \nwas reduced by obsolescence and shrinkage \nfactors, which are judgemental in nature.   \nSignificant management judgements include \ncategorisation of inventories, fragmentation and \nsell through rates and shrinkage, which form the \nbasis of management’s calculation to determine \nthe net realisable value of inventory.  The \nvaluation of inventory is a key audit matter due to \nthe judgements and estimates required in \ncalculating the provision for obsolescence and \nshrinkage, the deterioration of trading due to \nCOVID-19, and the material nature of the inventory \nbalance. \nOur audit procedures included, amongst others: \n• \nConsidering and testing the design and operating \neffectiveness of key inventory controls; \n• \nDiscussing with management the Group’s current \nperformance and future strategies to assist in \nevaluating the underlying assumptions applied in the \ncalculation of the inventory obsolescence and \nshrinkage provision; \n• \nRecalculating the arithmetical accuracy of the \nprovision for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage \ncalculation; \n• \nChallenging management’s assumptions by testing \nthe classifications of the underlying data used within \nthe calculation, performing inventory turnover \nanalysis and analysing the accuracy of historical \nobsolescence provisions;  \n• \nAgreeing a sample of inventory items on hand at \nyear-end to initial purchase invoices and subsequent \nsales invoices and comparing the carrying amount to \nthe net realisable value; and \n• \nAssessing the adequacy of the disclosures in the \nfinancial report around the key judgements and \nestimates in relation to inventory. \n \nReversal of impairment loss for right-of-use assets \nKey audit matter  \nHow the matter was addressed in our audit \nThe Group has recognised a reversal of impairment \nloss of $16.7m (2021: impairment loss of $11.7m) in \nrelation to right-of-use assets as disclosed in Notes \n4 and 12 of the financial report. \nThe assessment for impairment of the Group’s \nright-of-use assets incorporates significant \njudgements and estimates, specifically concerning \nfactors such as loss-making stores and the market \noutlook with Government imposed lockdowns \nremoved and foot traffic returning to centres. \nThis was considered to be a key audit matter due \nto the significance of the reversal of impairment \nloss recognised and the judgements and estimates \nexercised in the impairment testing. \nOur audit procedures included, amongst others: \n• \nEvaluating the Group’s assumptions and estimates \nused in their impairment calculation and assessing \nthe loss-making stores as well as the management’s \nestimate of the stores earmarked for closure as \ncompared to the prior year; \n• \nTesting the completeness and accuracy of the data \nused by management in assessing loss-making stores; \n• \nTesting the mathematical accuracy of the \nimpairment model used; and \n• \nAssessing the adequacy of the disclosures in light of \nthe requirements of Australian Accounting Standards."
