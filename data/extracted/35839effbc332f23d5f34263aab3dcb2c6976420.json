All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans, and objectives of\nmanagement for future operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important factors\nthat may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or\nimplied by the forward-looking statements.\nIn some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,”\n“target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. The\nforward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current\nexpectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These\nforward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions\ndescribed in the “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and\nuncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events\nand circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the\nforward-looking statements.

      "text": "Table of Contents\nSUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully the risks described under the \"Risk Factors\" section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks, which\ninclude the following, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, and prospects, which could cause the\ntrading price of our Class A common stock to decline and could result in a partial or total loss of your investment:\n•\nOur consolidated financial statements contain a statement regarding a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern because\nfunding of the remaining amounts due to us in connection with the liquidity transactions (as defined below) has not yet occurred and we have not yet\nraised sufficient alternative funds through our at-the-market offerings or otherwise. If such transactions, as described below, do not close and we do not\nsecure sufficient amounts of alternative financing, and/or we do not realize the anticipated benefits of our identified and to be identified cost savings,\nwe will be unable to meet our current obligations and we will be unable to continue as a going concern as early as the second quarter of 2023.\n•\nOur indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. In particular, any failure to comply with the covenants in the\nnote purchase agreement or failure to timely pay the accelerated payment obligations agreed to in March 2023 would materially adversely affect our\nbusiness. Furthermore, the restrictive covenants in our note purchase agreement may limit our ability to pursue our business strategies, which would\nmaterially adversely affect our operating results, and the failure to comply with such restrictions could materially adversely affect our business.\n•\nWe have a history of losses, and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\n•\nWe may be unable to successfully continue to execute our strategy. If we fail to cost effectively acquire new customers or retain our existing customers\nor if we fail to derive profitable net revenue from our customers, our business would be materially adversely affected.\n•\nIf we fail to effectively attain or manage any future revenue growth, or if we fail to effectively manage costs, our business could be materially\nadversely affected.\n•\nIf we do not successfully maintain, operate and optimize our fulfillment centers and logistics channels, and manage our ongoing real property and\noperational needs, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\n•\nOur business depends on a strong and trusted brand, and any failure to maintain, protect or enhance our brand, including as a result of events outside\nour control, could materially adversely affect our business.\n•\nIncreased competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\n•\nChanges in consumer tastes and preferences or in consumer spending due to inflation or otherwise, and other economic or financial market conditions\ncould materially adversely affect our business.\n•\nOur ability to source quality ingredients and other products is critical to our business, and any disruption to our supply or supply chain could materially\nadversely affect our business.\n•\nFood safety and food-borne illness incidents or advertising or product mislabeling may materially adversely affect our business by exposing us to\nlawsuits, product recalls or regulatory enforcement actions, increasing our operating costs and reducing demand for our product offerings.\n•\nIf we lose key management or fail to meet our need for qualified employees, with specialized skills, our business, financial condition and operating\nresults could be materially adversely affected.\n•\nWe rely on our proprietary technology and data to forecast customer demand and to manage our supply chain, and any failure of this technology, or the\nquality of our data, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n•\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulations which require significant expenditures and ongoing compliance efforts. Even inadvertent, non-\nnegligent or unknowing violations of federal, state or local regulatory requirements could expose us to adverse governmental action and materially\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Further, changes to law, regulation or policy applicable to food could leave us\nvulnerable to adverse governmental action and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n5"

Founded in 2012, we are on a mission to spark discovery, connection and joy through\ncooking. We offer fresh, chef-designed recipes that empower our customers to embrace their culinary curiosity and challenge their abilities to see what a difference\ncooking quality food can make in their lives.\nOur core product is the meal experience we help our customers create. These experiences extend from discovering new recipes, ingredients, and cooking\ntechniques to preparing meals with families and loved ones to sharing photos and stories of culinary triumphs. Central to these experiences are the original recipes\nwe design with fresh, seasonally-inspired produce and high-quality ingredients sent directly to our customers. We also sell wine, which can be paired with our meals\nor can be purchased à la carte, through Blue Apron Wine, our direct-to-consumer wine delivery service. Through Blue Apron Market, our e-commerce platform, we\nsell a curated selection of cooking tools, utensils, pantry items, and add-on products for different culinary occasions, which are tested and recommended by our\nculinary team. Our products are available to purchase through our website, mobile app, and beginning in the second quarter of 2022, our meal kits are also available\nfor sale on third-party sales platforms. Our customers span ages, geographies, income brackets, and levels of culinary expertise. They include young couples,\nfamilies, singles, and empty nesters. Our passionate community of home cooks tell us, through emails, phone calls, and social media, how much Blue Apron has\nchanged their lives.\nCentral to our operations, we have developed an integrated network that employs technology and expertise across many disciplines. Our supply-demand\ncoordination activities––demand planning, recipe creation, procurement, recipe merchandising, fulfillment operations, distribution, customer service, and\nmarketing––drive our end-to-end value chain.\nOur Products\nMeals\nOn our direct-to-consumer platform, we strive to offer our customers a balanced mix of ingredients, cuisines, familiarity, discovery, and preparation times.\nWe are focused on offering a variety of choices every week, including a range of recipes designed for a healthy lifestyle, so that customers can make selections\nbased on their individual or household needs and preferences. We currently offer our customers four weekly meal plans - a Two-Serving Signature Plan, a Two-\nServing Vegetarian Plan, a Two-Serving Wellness Plan, and a Four-Serving Signature Plan.\nFor meal plans, customers have the flexibility to choose any combination of the core recipes offered in any week, regardless of their plan. For each Order\nper week, this includes a minimum of two recipes with up to sixteen choices on the Two-Serving Plan and a minimum of two recipes with up to fourteen choices on\nthe Four-Serving Plan. Beginning in 2022, the weekly main course recipe options also include two Ready to Cook recipes, which are shipped with a recyclable\ncooking tray and require no knife work or chopping. In addition, each week customers can add unlimited Add-ons recipes to each Order, which includes breakfast,\nappetizers, side dishes, desserts, à la carte proteins, and/or Heat & Eat meals, which are microwavable meals ready in minutes.\nCustomers are also able to purchase a second Order each week, allowing them to select additional recipes per week at staggered times, or double recipes to\nserve up to eight people per meal on the Four-Serving Plan. In 2021, Blue Apron also introduced a select number of meal kits that are available for purchase on Blue\nApron Market, our e-commerce market, without a subscription. In 2022, we expanded the optionality to purchase non-subscription boxes to third-party e-commerce\nchannels.\nBased on the number of Orders in 2022 per plan type, approximately 80% of our meal orders were for the Two-Serving Plan, and approximately 20% were\nfor the Four-Serving Plan. Our customers can tailor their orders to complement their individual tastes and lifestyles. Some customers prefer to let our recipe\nrecommendation algorithm choose their recipes based on the food preferences they have provided to us, while other customers actively choose several weeks in\nadvance of delivery which recipes to receive. Customers can choose to receive orders each week, or less frequently if that better suits their schedules. Customers can\nmake their weekly order selections on our website or through our mobile application.\n6"

We also offer Premium recipes, including our Craft offering, that introduce our\ncustomers to specialty protein combinations, advanced culinary techniques, and unique flavor twists. Both our customized options and Premium recipes are priced\nat a premium to our standard rates. We also sell seasonally-inspired occasion-based offerings throughout the year consisting of multiple recipes for six to eight\npeople, which we sell as part of our subscription meal plan, along with the Blue Apron Market and third-party e-commerce channels.\nOur culinary team, including chefs who are alumni of some of the best restaurants in the world, such as Michelin-starred Per Se and Blue Hill at Stone\nBarns, begins the recipe creation process with various seasonally-inspired ingredients. Our chefs apply to these raw ingredients their expertise and insights from our\ncustomer feedback and recipe ratings to create our recipe offerings, with an eye towards what is delicious and accessible for individuals and families to eat week in\nand week out.\nWe merchandise our recipes through various campaigns geared toward seasonality, dietary preferences, ingredients, and healthy lifestyles. Our approach to\nmenu design seeks to balance ingredient supply and cost while appealing to a variety of customer lifestyles and cooking attitudes across a broad range of\ndemographics and taste profiles.\nWe are committed to sourcing fresh produce and other high-quality ingredients year-round from our supplier network that includes farmers, ranchers,\nfisheries, and artisans. Our recipes change every week based on the season and often feature specialty ingredients not readily available elsewhere. By merchandising\nthese ingredients into carefully crafted recipes, we are able to introduce our customers to ingredients they may have never experienced before. We also collaborate\nwith suppliers to create ingredients specifically for our recipes, such as custom sauces, unique spice blends, or, for example, bespoke ramen noodles from a third-\ngeneration noodle maker.\nOur ingredient standards are critically important to us and our customers. We source only ingredients that are as sustainable as possible. All of our beef,\npoultry, and pork comes from animals not treated with added hormones or sub-therapeutic antibiotics, and our eggs are Certified Humane Raised and Handled\npasture raised. Similarly, we source high-quality seafood consistent with the standards established by Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch, one of the world’s\nmost respected sustainable seafood organizations, and we prioritize sourcing seafood with additional third-party verified sustainability certifications.\nWine\nBlue Apron Wine, our direct-to-consumer wine delivery service, uses an integrated supply chain and direct sourcing relationships to deliver high-quality\nwines at compelling values. We work directly with vineyards and consult with acclaimed winemakers to create custom Blue Apron wines that are specially crafted\nfor our customers and uniquely curated to pair with our meals. Our wines included in our monthly wine delivery service are sized for a dinner for two (in 500ml\nbottles, rather than traditional 750ml bottles). Customers have the flexibility to customize their box, choosing six bottles from a monthly selection of wines that best\nmeet their taste preferences. A pairing key system provides insight into the wine profiles, and enables customers to pair their Blue Apron meals and wines. Our wine\nofferings include curated red, white, rosé and sparkling wines, tasting notes, pairing tips, and the story behind each wine. We are a licensed winery, and currently\nship directly to customers in 31 states and Washington, D.C.\nAs with our meals, customers may choose to actively manage their monthly wine orders by adjusting deliveries to fit their schedules, or they may simply\nsign up and receive one or two deliveries each month. Wine customers can also order a second box per monthly cycle. In addition to our monthly wine service,\ncustomers have the ability to order curated assortments and wine by 500ml and 750ml bottles, half-case, case, or other bundles on the Blue Apron Market, outside of\nthe monthly subscription model.\nMarket\nBlue Apron Market, our e-commerce market, features a curated selection of cooking tools, utensils, pantry items, and add-on products for different culinary\noccasions, which are tested in our test kitchen and recommended by our culinary team. A number of these items are not available elsewhere, and we regularly\nevaluate expanding our exclusive items and partnerships. Our recipe cards feature cooking tools and utensils from Blue Apron Market, creating an integrated brand\nexperience for our community of home cooks and repeated merchandising opportunities for our company. A selection of non-subscription meal kit boxes and our\nwines are also sold on the Blue Apron Market website.\n®\n7"

Our digital customer experience is immersive: we offer how-to cooking videos, stories about our suppliers, a step-by-step interactive cook\nalong, and our collection of thousands of recipes that customers can access on their own.\nHow We Do It\nWe have created an integrated network that enables us to source high quality, differentiated ingredients, design original recipes around those ingredients,\nand combine them into meaningful cooking experiences that we deliver to customers across the contiguous United States. Our interconnected end-to-end value\nchain allows us to execute cost-effectively and at scale. Coordination between our culinary team, procurement and operations teams, our marketing practices, and\ntechnology tools help us pair customer demand with supply, as well as to work with our suppliers to deliver high quality food at compelling values. Our kitchen\nmanufacturing, fulfillment and logistics operations are built to support our ongoing product innovation.\nSupply-Demand Coordination\nOur supply-demand coordination activities include demand planning, recipe development, recipe merchandising, and marketing. We use near-term and\nlong-term demand forecasting based on proprietary data and software to inform decisions along our value chain, including fulfillment center capacity and ingredient\npurchasing. This process continues through recipe development, and merchandising, as we craft recipes around available ingredients, and have the ability to make\nadjustments up to just a few weeks prior to fulfillment. We have also tailored our marketing strategies based on these demand forecasts and planning to optimize our\nmarketing return on investment.\nSupplier Relationships\nOur deep supplier relationships provide us the ability to source high quality ingredients. This enables us to collaborate on demand planning to manage\ninventories and optimize yields in effort to reduce waste and cost while minimizing our supply chain footprint. Blue Apron often aims to work directly with farmers\nwhen practicable to ensure customers receive high quality, seasonally-inspired produce at optimal freshness, at the best value. We source from farmers, ranchers,\nfisheries, and other suppliers of meat, seafood, and poultry products that meet our animal welfare standards, enabling us to provide premium ingredients to our\ncustomers such as pasture raised beef and Certified Humane Raised and Handled  pasture raised eggs.\nOperations\nOur purchasing, production, fulfillment, and logistics operations are integrated with our demand management and supplier relationships. Successfully\nintegrating these disparate activities requires us to possess a variety of competencies: a team with deep, ingredient-specific expertise; a technology-enabled platform\nthat connects our end-to-end operations; and a scalable architecture that adapts to surges in demand as well as variations in available supply. Our enhanced planning\nand process-driven strategies enable us to make informed purchasing decisions and provide opportunities to better manage food costs, allocate labor and reduce\nwaste in our fulfillment centers.\nInformed Purchasing\nWhile we work directly with our suppliers months in advance to plan our supply needs, we place purchase orders closer to the expected fulfillment, after\ncoordinating supply and demand through processes such as recipe merchandising and analyzing the outputs of our demand planning and forecasting tools.\nProduction and Fulfillment\nAs of December 31, 2022, we operated two fulfillment centers. Our fulfillment centers are designed to effectively manage our variable, high-throughput,\nperishable inventory, as well as flexible production and labor needs. We have invested extensively in our fulfillment centers, including the opening of our Linden,\nNew Jersey center in 2017 and the implementation of automation equipment in our Linden and Richmond, California fulfillment centers, and continue to optimize\nour network with a focus on maximizing efficiencies.\n®\n8"

Our\nLinden and Richmond fulfillment centers are certified under the Safe Quality Food (SQF) Food Safety Code for Manufacturing nationwide, a globally recognized,\nindependent food safety standard administered by the Safe Quality Food Institute.\nTo support our fulfillment operations we have developed proprietary technology, such as our proprietary inventory management tools to assess incoming\ningredients for quality and our proprietary kitchen prep software that demonstrates to fulfillment center associates how to prep ingredients for each recipe, and\nprovides instructions on selecting the correct type of packaging for each ingredient. We also use third-party technology in fulfillment operations to complement our\nproprietary systems.\nLogistics\nOur logistics team designs, manages, and optimizes a ground-based delivery network of several third-party service providers capable of delivering within\nthe contiguous United States. We analyze outbound logistics on a zip code by zip code basis to enable cost-effective and timely delivery of orders, while also\nadjusting the packaging of our ingredients and other components of our fulfillment operations based on the expected delivery route, weather, or ultimate destination.\nAll of our packaging materials are chosen with environmental impact in mind. We select packaging that is recyclable or biodegradable when practicable. Our\npackaging innovation team, with the support of third-party sustainability experts, is focused on innovating to improve our packaging design, lower overall costs, and\nreduce our carbon footprint.\nOur Brand and Marketing\nWe are continuing to build a consumer lifestyle brand that empowers our customers to embrace their culinary curiosity and challenge their abilities to see\nwhat a difference cooking quality food can make in their lives. Several nights a week, our customers invite us into their homes. We take part in some of the most\njoyful parts of their days, helping them create a meal for themselves, their families and their loved ones. Their challenges are opportunities for us to learn together,\nand their accomplishments are among our proudest achievements. We hear their success stories every day. Unlike a purely transactional e-commerce platform, we\nbelieve the emotional connection that customers have with our brand will enable us to have a more meaningful role in their lives.\nWe believe in utilizing a strategic mix of marketing channels to efficiently add new customers as well as to engage and create value for our existing\ncustomers. This includes a diverse mix of online and offline channels, as well as strategic partnerships that enable us to expand our brand to new segments of\ncustomers. We deliberately focus on the marketing channels we believe to be the most efficient and on customer segments that have demonstrated stronger affinity\nand retention. We believe our customers continue to be some of our best marketers, and we see them share their Blue Apron moments through social media, blogs,\nand referrals. We also have a customer referral program through which certain existing customers may invite others to receive a single complimentary meal kit box.\nFor all of our products, we use a combination of paid, earned, and owned media to increase the awareness of our brand and attract new customers. Our\ncontent enables customers to connect and interact with our brand even when they are not cooking with us. For example, we leverage both our digital channels and\nprinted content within deliveries to highlight specific ingredients, provide general cooking tips and techniques and foster conversation within our community of\nhome cooks.\nIn addition, strategic brand partnerships are an important opportunity for us to leverage the platform we are building to add value for our existing\ncustomers and showcase our brand to new customer segments.\nFinally, as we continue to promote our brand to attract new customers, we are focused on investments in marketing technology, especially in response to\nthe ongoing elimination of cookie-based tracking. This work includes building out a customer data platform to better manage our first party data and investing in\nour engineering capabilities to improve overall user experience.\n9"

Federal statutes applicable to food production include, for example,\nthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the\nNutrition Labeling and Education Act, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, and the Federal Trade\nCommission Act. Federal regulators have promulgated extensive regulatory schemes to implement these and other relevant statutes. These evolving regulatory\nstructures govern matters including manufacturing, formulating, labeling, advertising, packaging, storing, and implementing safety measures for our food products.\nIn particular, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, continues its implementation of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act by promulgating substantial\nnumbers of new regulations and introducing multiple versions of non-binding, draft guidance documents suggesting new compliance measures for the food industry.\nUnderstanding within the food industry of how to apply these regulations and the suggestions offered in FDA guidance documents continues to evolve.\nState and local jurisdictions also regulate U.S. food manufacturing facilities. For example, we currently produce and fulfill products in the states of\nCalifornia and New Jersey. State and local governments exert regulatory authority over our operations in these jurisdictions. The states and localities in which a\nfood production facility is located can impose registration, licensing, and inspection requirements in addition to those imposed by federal law. Some also enforce\nsignificant consumer protection-focused statutory schemes, which can impose additional costs and complexity on food producers.\nFood companies in the United States are subject to government inspection with or without notice at any time, with concomitant responsibility to provide\naccess to facilities and equipment, produce extensive operational documentation, and furnish product, packaging, and labeling samples for governmental\nexamination. Federal, state, and local governmental agencies enjoy extensive discretion to determine whether, when and how to conduct these activities. Food\ncompanies are therefore vulnerable to unexpected business interruptions and publicity.\nAll food companies in the United States bear legal responsibility for any violation of applicable food laws or regulations, whether that violation is\nnegligent, non-negligent, or deliberate. Any U.S. company found to have violated food laws or regulations may have its products seized, its operations enjoined, its\ngoods recalled from the market and destroyed, and its business exposed to significant adverse publicity. It is also possible that new laws or regulations, or changes\nin the enforcement of existing requirements, might require us to change our compliance policies, incur additional cost, or result in unexpected liabilities that could\nbe significant.\nFood Safety and Quality Assurance\nWe maintain a food safety and quality program to verify that the food products supplied to our customers are processed in a safe and sanitary environment\nand are in compliance with applicable food safety and regulatory requirements and standards. All meat and poultry products that we source are processed in\nfacilities inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, or by the equivalent agencies in countries deemed eligible by USDA for exporting meat and\npoultry to the United States. Accordingly, these products must conform to USDA requirements. All food and packaging suppliers are prequalified and have agreed to\ncomply with our requirements. While we perform supplier inspections and conduct product audits to evaluate suppliers and products for compliance with our\ncompany standards and specifications, we may not be able to prevent individual suppliers from failing to comply with food safety laws or our requirements, and we\nmay not be able to locate each failure to comply with food safety laws or our requirements prior to receiving food products. Our customer experience team captures\nand addresses customer feedback, including inquiries and complaints about the safety and quality of our food products.\nGovernment Regulation of Our Wine Business\nThe production, sale, and shipment of wine in the United States is regulated by the federal government and by each state government. State laws are not\nuniform, so business models that are national in scope must account for the state-by-state rules to achieve compliance.\n12"

Various regulations control production, excise tax, labeling, alcohol content and recordkeeping. In\naddition, the promotion and marketing of wine, including pricing, is subject to federal or state regulations. For example, wine marketing cannot be targeted to\nchildren, and some states restrict excessive discounts on wine. To assist with federal and state regulatory compliance, BAW relies on various internal and external\npersonnel with relevant experience.\nAlcohol distribution in the United States is traditionally conducted through a “three tier” system, in which alcohol passes from manufacturer to wholesaler\nto retailer in each state, before it can be sold to a consumer. However, applicable state regulations permit manufacturers to ship wine directly to consumers around\nthe country. As a licensed California winery, BAW relies on such regulations to sell and ship wine to the residents of 31 states plus the District of Columbia. Each\nstate permit held by BAW has specific compliance requirements, such as monthly reporting, limits on the amount of wine that can be shipped to a given household,\nand obtaining an adult signature on delivery.\nHuman Capital Management\nOverview of Human Capital Management\nOur human capital management plan is designed to meet the diverse needs of our employee population. Our employee base includes management\nprofessionals, engineers, culinary and food safety professionals, fulfillment center employees, and customer service employees in multiple locations across the\nUnited States.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we employed 1,549 full- and part-time employees, of which a little over 80% were based in our fulfillment centers in Linden,\nNew Jersey, and Richmond, California. From time to time, we also supplement our hourly fulfillment and customer service staffing with temporary personnel.\nIn addition, on December 8, 2022, to better align internal resources with strategic priorities, we announced a reduction in corporate personnel. This action\nresulted in a reduction of approximately 10% of our total corporate workforce, inclusive of both then current and vacant roles.\nExpanding and evolving our human capital management plan continues to be at the forefront of how we attract and retain qualified talent. Our people\nstrategy is overseen by our Chief People Officer, our executive and senior leadership team, and senior human resource professionals, and management regularly\nprovides updates to our board of directors. Our employees are not represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not\nexperienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.\nAttraction, Retention, and Development of Talent\nOur human capital management strategy is focused on building a culture of accountability, high performance, and inclusion for our employees. We strive to\nrecruit and retain the best people for the job regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or other differences.\nIn 2022, as a result of an increase in our hourly pay rate to $18.00 per hour in the fourth quarter of 2021, we were able to attract and retain more talent into\nour fulfillment centers through large-scale onsite hiring events. We continue to work on enhanced attraction and retention opportunities in our fulfillment centers,\nincluding a more robust onboarding process and ongoing training programs.\nIn 2022, we also strengthened our benefits offerings across the company with the introduction of a new 401(k) matching program as of January 1, 2022.\nWe also continue to assess and review all components of our compensation and benefit programs to ensure these programs are competitive and aligned against the\nmarkets in which we operate.\nInvesting in our employee’s growth and development has been and remains a key focus area. In 2022, we implemented multiple programs throughout the\nyear to support those efforts, including:\n•\nEstablishing a leadership development program, “At Our Best,” that provided our senior leaders with tools to operate at their best individually and\ncollectively, with inclusion and empathy at the core, and to lead meaningful and sustainable change within the company;\n•\nInstituting a culture of accountability and implementing best-practice foundations to support better talent planning for our people which is designed to\nallow us to more effectively and efficiently deliver against our strategy, drive performance and accountability; and\n13"

The EHS team coordinates health and safety matters at all of our locations, including safety training at our\nfulfillment centers. Our team regularly evaluates injury rates, safety observations and near-misses, as well as other proactive actions taken at our fulfillment centers\nto enhance worker safety. In addition to this team, we also have a Food Safety and Quality Assurance team which focuses on maintaining good manufacturing\npractices at our fulfillment centers in accordance with FDA guidance.\nIn addition, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed and implemented new procedures and protocols to minimize the risk to the health and\nsafety of our employees while allowing us to continue to operate our facilities and provide high quality products to our customers on a timely basis. Throughout the\npandemic, we were able to continue to service our customers, while at the same time making investments to prioritize the health, safety, and welfare of our\nemployees.

Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operation. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, and in our other filings with the SEC. Our business,\nfinancial condition, operating results, cash flow and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties. In that case, the\ntrading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur consolidated financial statements contain a statement regarding a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern because funding of\nthe remaining amounts due to us in connection with the liquidity transactions (as defined below) has not yet occurred and we have not yet raised sufficient\nalternative funds through our at-the-market offerings or otherwise. If such transactions, as described below, do not close and we do not secure sufficient\namounts of alternative financing and/or we do not realize the anticipated benefits of our identified and to be identified cost savings, we will be unable to meet\nour current obligations and we will be unable to continue as a going concern as early as the end of the second quarter of 2023.\nIn connection with the second closing contemplated by that certain purchase agreement between us and RJB, an affiliate of Joseph N. Sanberg, one of our\nexisting stockholders, dated as of April 29, 2022, as amended in August 2022 and September 2022 (the “RJB Purchase Agreement”), we agreed to issue and sell to\nRJB, and RJB agreed to purchase from us 10,000,000 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $56.5 million (or $5.65 per share) (such\namount, the “outstanding obligated amount”) (the “RJB Second Closing”). As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have received $1.0\nmillion of the outstanding obligated amount and we have not yet received the remaining $55.5 million from RJB, and the RJB Second Closing as contemplated by\nthe RJB Purchase Agreement has not closed. Additionally, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, while we have received $5.8 million of a gift card\nreceivable, we have not received the remaining $12.7 million gift card receivable owed to us from an affiliate of Mr. Sanberg, pursuant to that certain gift card\nsponsorship agreement dated as of May 5, 2022 (as amended or modified, the “Sponsorship Gift Cards Agreement” and together with the RJB Second Closing, the\n“liquidity transactions”). Mr. Sanberg has agreed to personally guarantee (i) the payment of the outstanding obligated amount under the RJB Purchase Agreement\nand (ii) the payment of $12.7 million owed under the Sponsorship Gift Cards Agreement.\nOn November 6, 2022, we and an affiliate of Mr. Sanberg (the “pledgor”) entered into a Guaranty and Pledge Agreement (the “pledge agreement”),\npursuant to which the pledgor (i) agreed to guarantee the payment of RJB’s outstanding obligated amount and (ii) to secure its obligation to pay the outstanding\nobligated amount, granted us a security interest in pledgor’s interests in certain equity securities (the \"pledged shares\"), of certain privately-held issuers (the\n\"pledged entities\"), including the certificates (if any) representing the pledged shares, and all dividends, distributions cash, instruments and other property or\nproceeds from time to time received, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of or in exchange for any or all of the pledged shares, or collectively, the pledge\ncollateral. Because the outstanding obligated amount remained unpaid after November 30, 2022, we are permitted to exercise remedies in respect of the pledged\nshares. In particular, we have the right to foreclose on and take ownership of the pledged shares and we are evaluating our options to monetize the pledged shares.\nThere is no assurance that the outstanding obligated amount will be paid by pledgor, RJB or Mr. Sanberg.\nBecause the pledged entities are privately-held companies, there is no public trading market for the pledged shares. As a result, the value of the pledged\nshares could be less than the outstanding obligated amount, and, if we seek to foreclose upon the pledged shares to satisfy pledgor’s obligation to pay the remaining\noutstanding obligated amount, the proceeds of any private sale of the pledged shares, to the extent any such private sale is permissible and effected subject to\nregulatory and contractual limitations that may apply, may be less than could have been obtained from a sale in a public trading market and may be less than the\nremaining outstanding obligated amount.\nBecause we have agreed under the note purchase agreement amendment (as defined below) to repay our $30.0 million of outstanding senior secured notes\nin full by the end of the second quarter of 2023, if we do not receive the remaining $68.2 million due to us in connection with the liquidity transactions, and if we\nare unable to raise additional capital from other financing sources, including from the February 2023 ATM (as defined below), the disposition of the pledged\ncollateral, or otherwise, and/or achieve the anticipated benefits of our identified and to be identified cost savings and working capital management, including our\ncorporate workforce reduction announced in December 2022 and any additional cost reduction initiatives, we expect that we will be unable to meet our current\nobligations and that we will be unable to continue as a going concern, as early as the end of the second quarter of 2023.\n15"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nOur ability to continue as a going concern requires us to have sufficient capital to meet our minimum liquidity covenant, as applicable, as well as to\ncontinue to make investments and to fund our operations. As discussed more below, because we have agreed to repay our $30.0 million of outstanding senior\nsecured notes in full by the end of the second quarter of 2023, our operating cash flows alone are not expected to provide us with sufficient capital to continue to\nmake investments and to fund our operations for the twelve months following the date of this report, and as early as the end of the second quarter of 2023 based on\nour current operating plans and programs, we are dependent upon our ability to receive the remaining $68.2 million due to us in connection with the liquidity\ntransactions, any cash proceeds from the disposition of the pledged collateral, if any, our ability to obtain additional funding and raise additional capital, including as\na result of the February 2023 ATM or otherwise, and our ability to achieve the anticipated savings through the implementation of expense reductions in areas\nidentified and to be identified by us in product, technology, general and administrative costs and marketing expenditures. In addition to the foregoing, we may also\nseek to pursue and execute financing opportunities, a business combination or other strategic transaction, although there is no assurance that we can identify or\nconsummate any such transaction.\nAbsent additional debt or equity funding or expense and operating adjustments, we cannot assure you that our future cash and cash equivalents, together\nwith cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to allow us to fund our operations or any future growth, including to attract and retain customers. If such\nfinancing is not available and such expense and operating adjustments cannot be made, we will be unable to operate our business, develop new business or execute\non our strategic plan, and our operating results would suffer. Additionally, any new debt financing may increase expenses, contain covenants that further restrict the\noperation of our business, and will need to be repaid regardless of operating results. For example, covenants contained in our senior secured notes include\nlimitations on our ability to pay dividends; create, incur or assume indebtedness or liens; consummate a merger, sale, disposition or similar transaction; engage in\ntransactions with affiliates; and make investments. Additional equity financing, debt financing that is convertible into equity, or debt or equity financing in which we\nissue equity or derivative securities, including any shares of Class A common stock issuable in connection with the liquidity transactions, other financing\ntransactions, business combinations or strategic transactions would result in dilution to our existing stockholders.\nIf we are not able to secure adequate additional funding, we may be forced to make additional reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers,\nliquidate assets where possible, and/or suspend or curtail planned programs. Any of these actions could materially harm our business, results of operations, and\nfuture prospects. In addition, we could also be forced to commence a bankruptcy or take other defensive action, which would materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and\nCapital Resources.”\nOur indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. In particular, any failure to comply with the covenants in the note\npurchase agreement or failure to timely pay the accelerated payment obligations agreed to in March 2023 would materially adversely affect our business\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $30.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our senior secured notes pursuant to the note purchase agreement. Our\ndebt could have important consequences for our business, including: making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the senior secured notes or to\nour trade or other creditors; increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our\nexisting operations or any future expansion of our business, including our strategic plan to achieve and maintain net revenue growth, particularly when the\navailability of financing in the capital markets may be limited; requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for payments on our\nindebtedness and thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, business development, acquisitions and general\ncorporate or other requirements; increasing our vulnerability to and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries\nin which we operate; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse conditions; restricting us from making acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic\ndivestitures; placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less-leveraged competitors; and limiting our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing for\nworking capital, capital expenditures, business development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes.\nIn addition, on March 15, 2023, we entered into a waiver, consent, and amendment to the note purchase agreement (the “note purchase agreement\namendment”), pursuant to which we agreed to pay the full outstanding principal balance on the senior secured notes in four amortization installments, including all\naccrued and unpaid interest, as follows: $7.5 million paid in connection with the signing of the note purchase agreement amendment; $7.5 million on April 15,\n2023; $7.5 million on May 15, 2023; and $7.5 million on June 15, 2023. Under the note purchase agreement amendment, the noteholder also agreed to reduce the\nminimum liquidity covenant amount on a dollar-for-dollar basis equal to the amount of the amortization payments (subject to a $10.0 million floor until the debt is\nrepaid in full). Further, conditioned upon the\n16"

      "text": "Table of Contents\ntimely payment of all of the amortization payments, the noteholder agreed to waive all prepayment premiums and the ESG KPI Fee (as defined below) that would\notherwise have been owing by us at maturity. Furthermore, in connection with the note purchase agreement amendment, the noteholder consented to the surrender\nof ownership to us, by the pledgor, of certain pledged shares, in satisfaction of certain obligations of the pledgor under the pledge agreement, should such a\nsurrender of collateral be agreed by us and the pledgor. The note purchase agreement amendment also clarified that such pledged shares, when surrendered, would\nbecome collateral for our obligations under the note purchase agreement. The note purchase agreement amendment also contains additional and modified reporting\nand information requirements, including the removal of a requirement to deliver an audit opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm relating to\nour financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 that does not include a “going concern” explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about\nour ability to continue as a going concern. The note purchase agreement amendment also clarifies that to the extent, if any, that certain prior events related to the\nPledge Agreement or amendments to the RJB Purchase Agreement constituted defaults under the note purchase agreement, such defaults are waived, although it is\nour position that no such defaults existed at any time.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on the accelerated terms agreed to under the note purchase agreement amendment, or to refinance our debt\nobligations, including the senior secured notes, depends on our financial condition and operating performance and the condition of the debt and capital markets,\nwhich are subject to prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions, as well as certain financial, business, legislative, political, regulatory and other\nfactors beyond our control. We expect to use cash flow from operations to meet our current and future financial obligations, including funding our operations, debt\nservice requirements and capital expenditures. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, which could result in our being\nunable to repay indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. In addition, the note purchase agreement governing the senior secured notes contains covenants that\nwill limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of\ndefault, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness.\nWe have a history of losses, and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have experienced net losses in each year since our inception. In the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we incurred net losses of $109.7\nmillion, $88.4 million, and $46.2 million, respectively. In December 2022, we identified multiple initiatives to both reduce expense and streamline decision-making\nand organization structure, including a plan for meaningful reduction on marketing and consulting expenses, including a reduction of approximately 10% of our\ntotal corporate workforce, inclusive of both then current and vacant roles, of up to an aggregate of approximately $50.0 million. We may also increase marketing\nexpenses in the future in the event we are able to receive the remaining $68.2 million due to us in connection with the liquidity transactions, raise additional capital,\nincluding from the February 2023 ATM, the disposition of the pledged collateral, if any, or other financing sources. Our decision to decrease marketing spending\nstarting in December 2022 and in 2023 may negatively impact our ability to continue to attract new and retain existing customers, enhance our technology and\ninfrastructure, our ability to invest to optimize and drive efficiency in our distribution and fulfillment capabilities, and expand our product offerings and we may not\nsucceed in achieving margins sufficient to offset our expenses which may require us to further reduce certain expenditures that could be important to maintaining or\nincreasing our net revenue and margins. If we are able to receive the remaining $68.2 million due to us in connection with the liquidity transactions, raise capital\nfrom alternative sources, including from the February 2023 ATM, the disposition of the pledged collateral, if any, or other financing sources, we anticipate that we\nmay again incur substantial operating expenses in the future, including later in 2023, to continue to attract new and retain existing customers, enhance our\ntechnology and infrastructure invest to optimize and drive efficiency in our distribution and fulfillment capabilities, and expand our product offerings. If we are able\nto increase marketing expenditures in the future, our efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our customer\ncount, net revenue and margins sufficiently to offset these expenses or at all, which may require us to further reduce certain expenditures that could be important to\nmaintaining or increasing our net revenue and margins. We also incur significant expenses in operating our fulfillment centers, including personnel costs, obtaining\nand storing ingredients and other products, and developing our technology and we have seen, and may continue to see, as a result of inflation or other factors, higher\ningredient, shipping and labor costs, which have, and could continue to have, a negative impact on margins. In addition, many of our expenses, including the costs\nassociated with our fulfillment centers, are fixed. Accordingly, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability, maintain efficient variable margins, and we\nmay incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe may be unable to successfully execute our strategy. If we fail to cost-effectively acquire new customers or retain our existing customers or if we fail to derive\nprofitable net revenue from our customers, our business would be materially adversely affected.\n17"

If we are unable to cost-effectively acquire new\ncustomers, retain our existing customers, or keep customers engaged, our business, financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected.\nFor example, the number of our customers declined to approximately 298,000 in the three months ended December 31, 2022 from approximately 336,000 in the\nthree months ended December 30, 2021, and our net revenue declined slightly to $106.8 million from $107.0 million in that same period.

Further, to meet increased\ndemand and eliminate complexity in our operations during 2020, we cut back on or delayed certain product offerings and we delayed the launch of other new\nproduct offerings that are part of our strategy, and if we need to cut back or delay certain product offerings in the future as a result of, supply chain issues, the\npandemic or otherwise, there could be an adverse effect on our ability to retain or attract customers.\nWe have historically spent significant amounts on advertising and other marketing activities, such as digital and social media, television, radio and\npodcasts, direct mail, and email, to acquire new customers, retain and engage existing customers, and promote our brand. While we have reduced our marketing\nexpenditures from historic levels, in late 2019, during parts of 2020 and 2021, we increased marketing expenditures to more normal levels. For example, in the\nfourth quarter of 2021, using a portion of the proceeds from the November 2021 capital raise we significantly increased our marketing expenses. Furthermore, in\nDecember 2022, in connection with cost-savings actions, we announced that we were significantly reducing marketing expenses for 2023, and our ability to increase\nmarketing expenses in the future is dependent upon our ability to receive the remaining $68.2 million due to us in connection with the liquidity transactions, our\nability to raise additional capital, including from the February 2023 ATM, the disposition of the pledged collateral, if any, or other financing sources. For the years\nended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, our marketing expenses were $84.1 million, $72.1 million, and $49.9 million, respectively, representing approximately\n18.3%, 15.3%, and 10.8% of net revenue, respectively. If we are unable to deliver results from our new marketing strategy, or otherwise effectively manage\nexpenses and cash flows, we may further reduce spending, to the extent needed in order to comply with the liquidity covenant or accelerated premium payment\nobligations we agreed to in March 2023 under our senior secured notes or to preserve cash, which may materially adversely impact net revenue and our ability to\nexecute our strategy. For example, in late 2018, we significantly reduced marketing expenditures as part of our efforts to deliberately prioritize operational stability\nwhich led to a sustained decrease in the number of customers and revenues in the years thereafter prior to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect a\nreduction in customers and revenues in 2023 as a result of our new marketing strategy, and we cannot assure you that we will not see a significant decrease in\ncustomers and revenues. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nIn addition, if we are able to receive the remaining $68.2 million due to us in connection with the liquidity transactions, secure additional financing or raise\nadditional capital, including from the February 2023 ATM, the disposition of the pledged collateral, if any, or other financing sources, we may fail to identify or\nexecute cost efficient marketing opportunities as we adjust our investments in marketing, including our ability to successfully make new marketing technology\ninvestments, or fail to fully understand or estimate the conditions, characteristics and behaviors that drive customer behavior. As we continue to refine our marketing\nstrategy to strategically prioritize customer acquisition channels that we believe will be more successful at attracting high affinity customers, we may fail to identify\nchannels that accomplish this objective or fail to understand or mitigate continuing and new negative effects of reducing our marketing expenses or of limiting our\ninvestment in historical marketing channels. Any of these failures may adversely impact our ability to attract or retain potential customers, including by making us\nless competitive relative to competitors. Additionally, our decision to strategically invest in new and existing customers who we believe have high potential to be\nvaluable to the business may fail to properly identify such customers or retain customers who generate the value that we anticipate. In addition, the increased\ndemand we saw as a result of the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on consumer behaviors resulted in us, at times, temporarily reducing marketing spend for\nportions of 2020 in order to manage capacity. If any of our marketing activities prove less successful than anticipated in attracting new customers or retaining\nexisting customers, we may not be able to recover our marketing spend, our cost to acquire new customers may increase, and our existing customers may reduce the\nfrequency or size of their purchases from us. In addition, our third-party marketing partners may not provide adequate value for their services. Any of the foregoing\nevents could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results, as well as present a risk that we fail to comply with certain\ncovenants under our senior secured notes, which could lead to an event of default under our senior secured notes.\nOur net revenue in any period is essentially a function of our ability to attract and retain customers and the frequency and size of the orders placed by those\ncustomers. If customers do not perceive our product offerings to be of\n18"

Many of our new customers originate from referrals from existing customers, and therefore we must ensure that\nour existing customers remain loyal to us in order to continue receiving those referrals. Our new customers typically evaluate whether our product offerings fit their\nlifestyles, tastes and preferences before deciding whether to continue purchasing our product offerings and, if so, the frequency at which they make purchases.\nWhile an increase in order frequency or size could potentially offset losses of customers and, similarly, an increase in the number of customers could potentially\noffset a reduction in the frequency or size of the orders placed by our customers, our continued failure to attract and retain customers would materially adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we fail to effectively attain or manage any future net revenue growth, or if we fail to effectively manage costs, our business could be materially adversely\naffected.\nOur net revenue increased from $460.6 million in 2020 to $470.4 million in 2021 and decreased to $458.5 million in 2022. The number of our full-time\nemployees declined from 1,934 at December 31, 2020 to 1,795 at December 31, 2021 and to 1,541 at December 31, 2022. Our ability to grow net revenue in the\nfuture is dependent upon our ability to receive the remaining $68.2 million due to us in connection with the liquidity transactions, our ability to secure additional\nfunding and raise additional capital, including from the February 2023 ATM, the disposition of the pledged collateral, if any, or other financing sources. As such, we\nexpect that our current marketing reduction plans and any future reductions in marketing investments will impact our net revenue. If our net revenues continue to\ndecline faster than we anticipate or if we do not effectively manage our costs, or if we fail to recognize the benefits of past or any future price increases, or if we fail\nto accurately forecast net revenue to plan operating expenses, our business, financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected. In\naddition, any future growth and expansion of our business and our product offerings may place additional demands on our operations teams and require significant\nadditional financial, operational, human capital, technological and other resources to meet our needs, which may not be available in a cost-effective manner or at all.\nWe are also required to manage relationships with various suppliers and other third parties, and expend time and effort to integrate new suppliers into our fulfillment\noperations. If we do not effectively manage costs, including as a result of inflation or our ability to realize the benefits of the non-marketing cost reductions we\nidentified in December 2022, we may not be able to execute on our business plan, respond to competitive pressures, take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy\ncustomer requirements, maintain high quality product offerings, or maintain compliance with our accelerated payment obligations and certain covenants in our\nsenior secured notes. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nIn addition, changes to our actual or projected operating results may indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable, which\nmay require us to recognize impairment charges on any of our assets, or require us to reduce investment in the business or engage in additional business\nrestructurings and incur additional restructuring charges. These changes may include any deterioration of operating results, changes in business plans or changes in\nanticipated cash flows. Any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in net revenue resulting from our inability to resume and sustain net revenue growth or to\neffectively manage our net revenue or any future growth could lead to an indication that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable, which\ncould result in an impairment. Any such charges could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nChanges in food costs and availability could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe success of our business depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs and availability. We are susceptible to\nincreases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, inflation, market changes, increased competition, exchange\nrate fluctuations, seasonal fluctuations, shortages or interruptions, weather conditions, changes in global climates, global demand, food safety concerns, public\nhealth crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, generalized infectious diseases, changes in law or policy, wars, declines in fertile or arable lands, product recalls\nand government regulations. For example, any prolonged negative impact of inflationary periods, such as the current inflationary environment, on food, supply and\nlogistics costs and availability could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, deflation in food prices\ncould reduce the attractiveness of our product offerings relative to competing products and thus impede our ability to maintain or increase overall sales, while food\ninflation, particularly periods of rapid inflation, have and could continue to reduce our operating margins as there may be a lag between the time of the price\nincrease and the time at which we are able to increase the price of our product offerings. We generally do not have long term supply contracts or guaranteed\npurchase commitments with our food suppliers, and we do not hedge our commodity risks. In limited circumstances, we may enter into strategic purchasing\ncommitment contracts with certain suppliers, but many of these contracts are relatively short in duration and may provide only limited protection from price\nfluctuations, and the use of these arrangements may limit our ability to benefit from favorable price movements. As a result, we may not be able to anticipate, react\nto or mitigate against cost fluctuations which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n19"

As a result, we may introduce significant changes to our existing product offerings, develop and\nintroduce new and unproven product offerings, revise our customers’ digital experiences and/or offer our products through new distribution channels. If our new or\nenhanced product offerings are unsuccessful, including because they fail to generate sufficient net revenue or operating profit to justify our investments in them, or\nif we are unable to timely develop enhancements to our technology infrastructure, we may be unable to attract or retain customers, and our business and operating\nresults could be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, new or shifting customer demands, tastes or interests, superior competitive offerings or a deterioration\nin our product quality or our ability to bring new or enhanced product offerings to market quickly and efficiently could negatively affect the attractiveness of our\nproducts and the economics of our business and require us to make substantial changes to and additional investments in our product offerings or business model. In\naddition, we frequently experiment with and test different product offerings and marketing and pricing strategies, such as our implementation of a shipping charge\non all subscription meal kit and wine orders in 2021 and our new meal and wine price increase implemented in the second quarter of 2022, as well as our customers’\ndigital experiences, including by updating our online and mobile platforms. If these experiments, tests and updates are unsuccessful, or if the product offerings and\nstrategies we introduce based on the results of such experiments, tests and updates do not perform as expected, our ability to retain existing customers, attract new\ncustomers, and increase customer engagement may be adversely affected.\nDeveloping and launching new product offerings or enhancements to our existing product offerings involves significant risks and uncertainties, including\nrisks related to the reception of such product offerings by our existing and potential future customers, increases in operational complexity, unanticipated delays or\nchallenges in implementing such offerings or enhancements, increased strain on our operational and internal resources (including an impairment of our ability to\naccurately forecast demand and related supply), inability to adequately support new offerings or enhancements with sufficient technology and marketing investment\nand negative publicity in the event such new or enhanced product offerings are perceived to be unsuccessful. In addition, as a result of both the increased demand\nwe saw as a result of the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on consumer behaviors and due to pandemic-related labor shortages, in 2020 we delayed, and may in\nthe future delay, launching certain new product offerings or cut back on certain weekly cycles in order to remove some operational complexities to meet demand\nlevels, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to retain or attract new customers. In addition, in connection with our expense reduction efforts introduced in\nDecember 2022, we expect to be less focused on new product development in 2023.\nSignificant new initiatives have in the past resulted in, and any new initiatives may in the future result in, operational challenges affecting our business. In\naddition, developing and launching certain new product offerings and enhancements to our existing product offerings may involve significant capital investments\nand such investments may not prove to be justified. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain\ncustomers as well as our visibility into expected operating results, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we do not successfully maintain, operate and optimize our fulfillment centers and logistics channels, and manage our ongoing real property and operational\nneeds, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we do not successfully maintain, operate and optimize our fulfillment centers, or if we vacate these facilities, or repurpose parts of these facilities as part\nof our operating efficiency initiatives or otherwise, we may experience insufficient or excess fulfillment capacity, increased costs, impairment charges or other harm\nto our business. For example, following the closure of the Arlington, Texas fulfillment center in the first half of 2020, we temporarily reopened it in January 2021 to\nleverage existing assets to meet forecasted demand while we continued to identify and implement other operating efficiencies in our other fulfillment centers; we\nthen closed the Arlington fulfillment center in April 2021, consolidating production volume at our other fulfillment centers. We have encountered in the past, and\nmay encounter in the future, both as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and otherwise, higher levels of worker absenteeism and difficulty in hiring a sufficient\nnumber of employees to adequately staff our fulfillment centers, causing us to use higher levels of temporary workers through third parties, generally at greater cost\nand providing lower levels of performance, and to cancel or delay customer orders and close some weekly offering cycles early to manage demand. If we do not\nhave sufficient fulfillment capacity or experience problems or delays in fulfilling orders, our customers may experience delays in receiving their meal deliveries,\nreceive deficient orders and/or have their orders canceled, which could harm our reputation and our customer relationships and could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results. In addition, any disruption in, or the loss of operations at, one or more of our fulfillment centers, even on a short-\nterm basis, whether as a result of COVID-19 or otherwise, could delay or postpone production of our products, which could materially adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and operating results.\nIf events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable, we may be required to recognize impairment\ncharges on any of our assets.

We also rely on fixed duration leases for our other real properties, including for our headquarters in New York, New York, which we entered into in October\n2019 and expires in December 2024. If we are unable to timely enter into suitable lease agreements or extensions for any of our real properties, we may incur\nadditional unanticipated costs associated with identifying and securing an alternative premise, suffer disruptions to our operations as a result of any necessary\ntransition, face employee attrition or experience other harm to our business. In May 2021, we entered into an agreement to sublease the remainder of our Arlington\nfulfillment center, which sublease is expected to continue through the duration of our existing lease for the fulfillment center. See “We have implemented significant\nreorganization activities in our business, including the closure of our fulfillment center in Arlington, Texas in 2020. These and other reorganization activities could\nhave long-term adverse effects on our business, including additional attrition in personnel and the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits and savings from these\nactivities” for more information.\nWe have designed and built our own fulfillment center infrastructure, including customizing third-party inventory and package handling software systems,\nwhich is tailored to meet the specific needs of our business. Furthermore, we are continuing to expand the use of automated production equipment and processes in\nour fulfillment centers. To the extent we add capacity, capabilities and automated production equipment and processes to our fulfillment centers, our fulfillment\noperations will become increasingly complex and challenging. Any failure to hire, train and/or retain employees capable of operating our fulfillment centers could\nmaterially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We also may be unable to procure and implement automated production\nequipment and processes on a timely basis, and they may not operate as intended or achieve anticipated cost efficiencies. For example, suppliers could miss their\nequipment delivery schedules, new production lines and operations could improve less rapidly than expected, or not at all, the equipment or processes could require\nlonger design time than anticipated or redesigning after installation, and new production technology may involve equipment and processes with which we are not\nfully experienced. Difficulties we experience in further automating our fulfillment processes could impair our ability to reduce costs and could materially adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, we currently, and may in the future continue to, contract with third parties to conduct\ncertain of our fulfillment processes and operations on our behalf. Interruptions or failures in these services, or operational impacts arising from transitioning\nbetween these third-party providers, could delay or prevent the delivery of our products and adversely affect our ability to fulfill our customers’ orders. In addition,\nany disruption in the operation of our fulfillment centers, including due to factors such as earthquakes, extreme weather, fires, floods, public health crises, such as\npandemics and epidemics, government-mandated closures, power losses, telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, human errors and similar events or\ndisruptions, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may incur future capital expenditures in our fulfillment centers in order to optimize and drive efficiency in our operations. For a discussion of our\nprojected future capital expenditures and risks related to such capital expenditures, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” If we expand our product offerings in the future, we may be unable to effectively increase our fulfillment capacity\nor effectively control expansion related expenses. In addition, as we continue to execute our strategy, we may experience problems fulfilling orders in a timely\nmanner or in a manner our customers expect, or our customers may experience delays in receiving their purchases, or, if in the future we grow faster than\nanticipated, we may exceed our fulfillment center capacity sooner than we anticipate, any of which could harm our reputation and our relationships with our\ncustomers. Many of the expenses and investments with respect to our fulfillment centers are fixed, and any expansion of such fulfillment centers will require\nadditional investment of capital. We expect to continue to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for our fulfillment center operations. We may incur such\nexpenses or make such investments in advance of expected sales, and such expected sales may not occur. The timing and amount of our projected capital\nexpenditures is dependent upon a number of factors and may vary significantly from our estimates. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital\nresources to fund future capital expenditures or if any future capital expenditures will be timely or effectively integrated into our existing operations, any\nadjustments to production volume, including transitions between fulfillment centers, will be completed on an efficient and timely basis without adversely impacting\nour operations, that our fulfillment software systems will continue to meet our business needs, or that we will be able to execute on our strategic plans or recruit\nqualified managerial and operational personnel necessary to support our strategic plans. In addition, we intend to reduce spending on capital expenditures, to the\nextent needed, if we are unable to deliver results from our strategy, or otherwise effectively manage expenses and cash flows, in order to manage our business and\ncomply with the financial covenants in our senior secured notes, which will negatively and materially impact net revenue and our ability to execute our strategy.\nAny changes to our overall fulfillment capacity or existing fulfillment center operations will put pressure on our managerial, financial, operational, technological\nand other resources.\nOur business depends on a strong and trusted brand, and any failure to maintain, protect or enhance our brand, including as a result of events outside our\ncontrol, could materially adversely affect our business.\n22"

Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand and reputation will depend on, among other factors, the success of our food safety, quality assurance,\nmarketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. Any negative publicity, regardless of its accuracy,\ncould materially adversely affect our business. Brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities, and any incident that erodes the loyalty of\nour customers or suppliers, including adverse publicity or a governmental investigation or litigation, could significantly reduce the value of our brand and\nsignificantly damage our business.\nWe believe that our customers hold us and our products to a high food safety standard. Therefore, real or perceived quality or food safety concerns or\nfailures to comply with applicable food regulations and requirements, whether or not ultimately based on fact and whether or not involving us (such as incidents\ninvolving our competitors), could cause negative publicity and lost confidence in our company, brand or products, which could in turn harm our reputation and\nsales, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, social media platforms and other forms of Internet-based communications provide individuals with access to broad audiences, and the\navailability of information on social media platforms is virtually immediate, as can be its impact. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their\nparticipants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. Furthermore, other Internet-based or traditional media outlets may in turn\nreference or republish such social media content to an even broader audience. Information concerning us, regardless of its accuracy, may be posted on such\nplatforms at any time. Information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, each of which may materially harm our brand, reputation,\nperformance, prospects and business, and such harm may be immediate and we may have little or no opportunity to respond or to seek redress or a correction.\nThe value of our brand also depends on effective customer support to provide a high-quality customer experience, which requires significant personnel\nexpense. If not managed properly, this expense could impact our profitability. Failure to manage or train our own or outsourced customer support representatives\nproperly, or our inability to hire and/or retain sufficient customer support representatives in sufficient numbers could result in lower-quality customer support and/or\nincreased customer response times, compromising our ability to handle customer complaints effectively. For example, we have experienced labor shortages in the\npast and, if we experience any future labor shortages, we may have difficulty hiring and retaining customer support representatives, resulting in increased customer\nresponse times.\nAs we have seen disruptions in labor availability from time to time, whether as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, general market trends or otherwise, we\nhave had to, and may in the future have to, cancel or delay some customer orders, and we have closed, and may continue to close, some weekly offering cycles early\nto manage demand.\nEnvironmental, social and governance matters may impact our business and reputation.\nThere has been increased focus, including by consumers, investors and other stakeholders, as well as by governmental and non-governmental\norganizations, on ESG matters. We have and plan to continue undertaking ESG initiatives. Any failure to meet our ESG commitments could negatively impact our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results. These impacts could be difficult and costly to overcome. We are also subject to an ESG covenant under our\nsenior secured notes which may require us to pay a 1% fee upon repayment of the senior secured notes at maturity if we fail to meet that covenant, however, if we\ntimely repay the senior secured notes on the accelerated payment schedule agreed to in March 2023, this fee would be waived.\nIn addition, achieving our ESG initiatives may result in increased costs in our supply chain, fulfillment, and/or corporate business operations, and could\ndeviate from our initial estimates and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In addition, standards and research regarding ESG\ninitiatives could change and become more onerous for both for us and our third-party suppliers and vendors to meet successfully. Evolving data and research could\nundermine our claims and beliefs that we have made in reliance on current research, which could also result in costs, a decrease in net revenue, and negative market\nperception that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIncreased competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\nWe expect competition in food sales generally, and with companies providing food delivery in particular, to continue to increase. We compete with other\nmeal kit, food and meal delivery companies, the supermarket industry, including online supermarket retailers, and a wide array of food retailers (including natural\nand organic, specialty, conventional, mass, discount and other food retail formats). We also compete with a wide array of casual dining and quick service restaurants\nand other food service businesses in the restaurant industry, as well as a broad range of online wine retailers, wine specialty stores and retail liquor stores.

In addition, business combinations\nand consolidation in and across the industries in which we compete could further increase the competition we face and result in competitors with significantly\ngreater resources and customer bases than us. Further, some of our other current or potential competitors may be smaller, less regulated, and have a greater ability to\nreposition their product offerings than companies that, like us, operate at a larger scale. These factors may allow our competitors to derive greater sales and profits\nfrom their existing customer base, acquire customers at lower costs, respond more quickly than we can to changes in consumer demand and tastes, or otherwise\ncompete with us effectively, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These competitors may engage in more extensive\nresearch and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow them to build\nlarger customer bases or generate additional sales more effectively than we do.\nOur deliberate decision to reduce marketing expenses for 2023 may negatively impact our ability to compete which may have a material adverse impact on\nour ability to acquire or retain customers. In addition, as the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on consumer behaviors has tapered, and consumers seek out other dining\noptions or resume traveling, we have and may continue to see an increase in competition, which may be significant, and which could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results.\nFood safety and food-borne illness incidents or advertising or product mislabeling may materially adversely affect our business by exposing us to lawsuits,\nproduct recalls or regulatory enforcement actions, increasing our operating costs and reducing demand for our product offerings.\nSelling food for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, and there is increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness\nregarding food safety. Unexpected side effects, illness, injury or death related to allergens, food borne illnesses or other food safety incidents (including food\ntampering or contamination) caused by products we sell, or involving suppliers that supply us with ingredients and other products, could result in the discontinuance\nof sales of these products or our relationships with such suppliers, or otherwise result in increased operating costs or harm to our reputation. Shipment of adulterated\nproducts, even if inadvertent, can result in criminal or civil liability. Such incidents could also expose us to product liability, negligence or other lawsuits brought by\nconsumers, consumer agencies or others. Any claims brought against us may exceed or be outside the scope of our existing or future insurance policy coverage or\nlimits. Any judgment against us that is in excess of our insurance policy limits or not covered by our policies or not subject to insurance would have to be paid from\nour cash reserves, which would reduce our capital resources, which could impact our ability to execute our strategy and/or comply with the accelerated repayment\nobligations or minimum liquidity covenant in our senior secured notes.\nThe occurrence of food borne illnesses or other food safety incidents could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting\nin higher costs, disruptions in supply and a reduction in our sales. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination, whether or not caused by our products, could\nsubject us or our suppliers\n24"

The risk of\nfood contamination may be also heightened further due to changes in government funding or a government shutdown. Our meat and poultry suppliers may operate\nonly under inspection by the United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA. While USDA meat and poultry inspections are considered essential services, a\ngovernment shutdown or lapse in funding may increase the risk that inspectors perform their duties inadequately, fail to report for work, or leave their positions\nwithout prompt replacement, potentially compromising food safety.\nWe have been in the past, and could be in the future, subject to food recalls. Food recalls could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction\nof product inventory, lost net revenues due to customer credits and refunds, lost future sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time and potential\nloss of existing customers and a potential negative impact on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers due to negative consumer\nexperiences or as a result of an adverse impact on our brand and reputation.\nIn addition, food companies have been subject to targeted, large-scale tampering as well as to opportunistic, individual product tampering, and we could be\na target for product tampering. Forms of tampering could include the introduction of foreign material, chemical contaminants and pathological organisms into\nconsumer products as well as product substitution. Beginning in July 2019, FDA requirements require companies like us to analyze, prepare and implement “food\ndefense” mitigation strategies specifically to address tampering designed to inflict widespread public health harm. If we do not adequately address the possibility, or\nany actual instance, of product tampering, we could face possible seizure or recall of our products and the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, which could\nmaterially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nChanges in consumer tastes and preferences or in consumer spending due to inflation or otherwise, and other economic or financial market conditions could\nmaterially adversely affect our business.\nOur operating results may be materially adversely affected by changes in consumer tastes and preferences. Our future success depends in part on our ability\nto anticipate the tastes, eating habits and lifestyle preferences of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer tastes and preferences. Consumer tastes\nand preferences may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors that are beyond our control. For example, our\nnet revenue could be materially adversely affected by changes in consumer demand in response to nutritional and dietary trends, dietary concerns regarding items\nsuch as calories, sodium, carbohydrates or fat, or concerns regarding food safety. Our competitors may react more efficiently and effectively to these changes than\nwe can. We cannot provide any assurances regarding our ability to respond effectively to changes in consumer health perceptions or our ability to adapt our product\nofferings to trends in eating habits. If we fail to anticipate, identify or react to these changes and trends, or to introduce new and improved products on a timely\nbasis, or if we cease offering such products or fail to maintain partnerships that react to these changes and trends, we may experience reduced demand for our\nproducts, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, the business of selling food products over the Internet is dynamic and continues to evolve. The market segment for food delivery has grown\nsignificantly, and this growth may not continue or may decline, including specifically with respect to the meal solutions sector. If customers cease to find value in\nthis model or otherwise lose interest in our product offerings or our business model generally, we may not acquire new customers in numbers sufficient to sustain\ngrowth in our business or retain existing customers at rates consistent with our business model, which could be materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nFurthermore, preferences and overall economic conditions, such as inflation, that impact consumer confidence and spending, including discretionary\nspending, could have a material impact on our business. Economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business\nconditions, higher rates of inflation, slower growth or recession, market volatility, negative financial news, changes in housing market conditions, the availability of\ncredit, interest rates, tax rates, new or increased tariffs, fuel and energy costs, the effect of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other matters, could reduce\nconsumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to lower priced alternatives, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nIn addition, the business of selling food products over the Internet is dynamic and continues to evolve.

These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and\noperating results.\nOur ability to source quality ingredients and other products is critical to our business, and any disruption to our supply or supply chain could materially\nadversely affect our business.\nWe depend on frequent deliveries of ingredients and other products from a variety of local, regional, national and international suppliers, and some of our\nsuppliers may depend on a variety of other local, regional, national and international suppliers to fulfill the purchase orders we place with them. The availability of\nsuch ingredients and other products at competitive prices depends on many factors beyond our control, including the number and size of farms, ranches, vineyards\nand other suppliers that provide crops, livestock and other raw materials that meet our quality and production standards.\nWe rely on our suppliers, and their supply chains, to meet our quality and production standards and specifications and supply ingredients and other\nproducts in a timely and safe manner. We have developed and implemented a series of measures to ensure the safety and quality of our third-party supplied products,\nincluding using contract specifications, certificates of identity for some products or ingredients, sample testing by suppliers and sensory based testing. However, no\nsafety and quality measures can eliminate the possibility that suppliers may provide us with defective or out of specification products against which regulators may\ntake action or which may subject us to litigation or require a recall. Suppliers may provide us with food that is or may be unsafe, food that is below our quality\nstandards or food that is improperly labeled. In addition to a negative customer experience, we could face possible seizure or recall of our products and the\nimposition of civil or criminal sanctions if we incorporate a defective or out of specification item into one of our deliveries.\nFurthermore, there are many factors beyond our control which could cause shortages or interruptions in the supply of our ingredients and other products,\nincluding adverse weather, environmental factors, natural disasters, prolonged utility outages, unanticipated demand, shipping and distribution issues, labor\nproblems, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, changes in law or policy, food safety issues by our suppliers and their supply chains, and the\nfinancial health of our suppliers and their supply chains. For example, any future negative impact on our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19, or other,\npandemic, weather, gas prices or otherwise, could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. Production of the\nagricultural products used in our business may also be materially adversely affected by drought, water scarcity, temperature extremes, scarcity of agricultural labor,\nchanges in government agricultural programs or subsidies, import restrictions, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, crop conditions, crop or animal diseases or crop\npests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential effect of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may materially\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results, particularly in circumstances where an ingredient or product is sourced from a single\nsupplier or location.\nIn addition, unexpected delays in deliveries from suppliers that ship directly to our fulfillment centers or increases in transportation costs, including\nthrough increased fuel costs, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Labor shortages or work stoppages in the\ntransportation industry, long term disruptions to the national transportation infrastructure, reduction in capacity and industry specific regulations such as hours of\nservice rules that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe currently source certain of our ingredients from suppliers located outside of the United States. Any event causing a disruption or delay of imports from\nsuppliers located outside of the United States, including weather, drought, crop related diseases, the imposition of import or export restrictions, restrictions on the\ntransfer of funds or increased tariffs, destination based taxes, value added taxes, quotas or increased regulatory requirements, could increase the cost or reduce the\nsupply of our ingredients and the other materials required by our product offerings, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and\noperating results. Furthermore, our suppliers’ operations may be adversely affected by political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from\nexporting countries, restrictions on the transfer of funds or other trade disruptions, each of which could adversely affect our access or ability to source ingredients\nand other materials used in our product offerings on a timely or cost-effective basis.\nWe have implemented significant reorganization activities in our business.

For example, in December 2022, to better align internal resources with strategic priorities, we announced a reduction in corporate personnel,\nwhich resulted in a reduction of approximately 10%, our corporate workforce, inclusive of both then current and vacant roles. As a result, we incurred\napproximately $1.5 million of employee-related expenses, primarily consisting of severance payments, substantially all of which are cash expenditures to be paid in\nthe first half of 2023. In addition, in February 2020, we announced a plan to close our fulfillment center in Arlington, Texas. As part of this plan, in the first and\nsecond quarters of 2020 we transferred all of the remaining production volume from our Arlington, Texas fulfillment center to our Linden, New Jersey and\nRichmond, California fulfillment centers. These actions resulted and could result in the future in the loss of employees across various functions through attrition or\nthe need for further reductions, the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise and the reallocation and combination of certain roles and responsibilities across our\norganization, all of which could adversely affect our operations. In addition, there is a risk of reduced employee morale and, as a result, we could face further\nemployee attrition following a reorganization activity. We may also be unable to efficiently transition the production volume between our fulfillment centers or\nmaintain our production efficiencies during or after any such transfer. For example, we temporarily reopened the Arlington fulfillment center in January 2021 to\nleverage existing assets to meet forecasted demand while we continued to identify and implement other operating efficiencies in our other fulfillment centers; we\nthen closed the Arlington fulfillment center in April 2021, consolidating production volume at our other fulfillment centers.\nOther reorganization activities in which we may engage in the future, as well as other ongoing or future cost reduction activities, may reduce our available\ntalent, assets, capabilities and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to competition and\nlimit our ability to satisfy customer demands. As a result, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day\nstrategic and operational activities, and devote a substantial amount of time to managing the organizational changes brought about by our reorganization. If we do\nnot have sufficient resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the changes in our business operations resulting from the reorganization, which may result\nin weaknesses in our operations, risks that we may not be able to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees\nand reduced productivity among remaining employees. If we are unable to effectively manage these activities, our expenses may be higher than expected, and we\nmay not be able to implement our business strategy or achieve the anticipated benefits and savings from any such activities.\nWe may also determine to take additional measures to reduce costs, especially if we do not receive the remaining $68.2 million due to us in connection\nwith the liquidity transactions, secure alternative funding or raise additional capital, including from our the February 2023 ATM, the disposition of the pledged\ncollateral, if any, or other financing sources which could result in further disruptions to our operations and present additional challenges to the effective management\nof our company. For example, if we are unable to deliver results from our strategy, or otherwise effectively manage expenses and cash flows, we intend to further\nreduce spending, particularly in marketing and capital expenditures, to the extent needed in order to comply with the minimum liquidity covenant in our senior\nsecured notes, which will negatively and materially impact net revenue and our ability to execute our strategy. In addition, delays in implementing planned\nrestructuring activities, unexpected costs, or the failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we realize from such\nactions. Any of the circumstances described above could materially adversely affect our business and operating and financial results.\nIf we lose key management or fail to meet our need for qualified employees with specialized skills, our business, financial condition and operating results could\nbe materially adversely affected.\nOur future success is dependent upon our ability to retain key management. Our executive officers and other management personnel are employees “at\nwill” and could elect to terminate their employment with us at any time. For example, since 2017, we have had three different chief executive officers and since\n2018 we have had four chief financial officers and three individuals serving in the role of chief operating officers/chief supply chain officer. We do not maintain\n“key person” insurance on the lives of any of our executive officers.\nOur future success is also dependent upon our ability to attract, retain and effectively deploy qualified employees, including management, possessing a\nbroad range of skills and expertise. We may need to offer higher compensation and other benefits in order to attract and retain key personnel in the future, and, to\nattract top talent, we must offer competitive compensation packages before we have the opportunity to validate the productivity and effectiveness of new employees.\nAdditionally, from time to time we have not been, and we may not in the future be, able to hire sufficient workforce quickly enough or to retain sufficient\nworkforce, or if we do not receive the remaining $68.2 million due to us in connection with the liquidity transactions or raise additional capital, including through\nthe February 2023 ATM, the disposition of the pledged collateral, if any, or other financing sources, we may not have adequate resources to meet our hiring needs,\nand we must effectively deploy our workforce in order to efficiently allocate our internal resources.

If we fail to hire or retain qualified employees, or effectively deploy our\nexisting personnel, our efficiency and ability to meet our forecasts, our ability to successfully execute on our strategic plan and our employee morale, productivity\nand retention could all suffer. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur past net revenue growth masked seasonal fluctuations in our operating results. If our net revenue declines or if it begins to increase at a more moderate\nrate, or as seasonal patterns become more pronounced, seasonality could have a material impact on our results.\nOur business is seasonal in nature, which impacts the levels at which customers engage with our products and brand, and, as a result, the trends of our\nrevenue and our expenses fluctuate from quarter to quarter. For example, prior to the effect of the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we\nhistorically anticipated that the first quarter of each year would generally represent our strongest quarter in terms of customer engagement. Conversely, during the\nsummer months and the end of year holidays, when people are vacationing more often or have less predictable weekly routines, we historically anticipated lower\ncustomer engagement. In addition, our marketing strategies and expenditures, which may be informed by these seasonal trends, will impact our quarterly results of\noperations. These seasonal trends may cause our net revenue and our cash requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume\nand timing of sales. We believe that these seasonal trends have affected and will continue to affect our quarterly results in the future. However, we cannot predict the\nimpact that macroeconomic trends such as inflation may have on seasonality. Our past net revenue growth, due in part to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on\nconsumer behaviors, masked seasonality, but if our net revenue continues to decline or if it increases at a moderate rate, or if seasonal spending by our customers\nbecomes more pronounced, seasonality could have a more significant impact on our operating results from period to period. In addition, in the first and second\nquarters of 2022, we entered into sponsorship agreements with a related party under which we agreed to issue $27.5 million of gift cards (net of promotional\ndiscounts), which may result in higher levels of card breakage revenue which may inflate net revenue or mask seasonality in future periods. As of the date of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, we have not yet received the remaining $12.7 million relating to the Sponsorship Gift Cards Agreement. See Note 14 to the\nconsolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe rely on our proprietary technology and data to forecast customer demand and to manage our supply chain, and any failure of this technology, or the quality\nof our data, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely on our proprietary technology and data to forecast demand and predict our customers’ orders, determine the amounts of ingredients and other\nsupply to purchase, and to optimize our in-bound and out-bound logistics for delivery and transport of our supply to our fulfillment centers and of our product\nofferings to customers. If this technology fails or produces inaccurate results at any step in this process—such as if the data we collect from customers is insufficient\nor incorrect, if we over or underestimate future demand, or if we fail to optimize delivery routes to our customers—we could experience increased food waste or\nshortages in key ingredients, the operational efficiency of our supply chain may suffer (including as a result of excess or shortage of fulfillment center capacity) or\nour customers may experience delays or failures in the delivery of our product offerings, for example by missing ingredients. Moreover, forecasts based on\nhistorical data, regardless of any historical patterns or the quality of the underlying data, are inherently uncertain, and unforeseen changes in consumer tastes or\nexternal events could result in material inaccuracy of our forecasts, which could result in disruptions in our business and our incurrence of significant costs and\nwaste. Furthermore, any interruptions or delays in our ability to use or access our proprietary technology could lead to interruptions or delays in our supply chain.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe reliable and cost-effective storage, transport and delivery of ingredients and other products and our product offerings is critical to our business, and any\ninterruptions, delays or failures could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe maintain arrangements with third parties to store ingredients and other products, to deliver ingredients and other products from our suppliers to our\nfulfillment centers and to transport ingredients and other products between our fulfillment centers. Interruptions or failures in these services could delay or prevent\nthe delivery of these ingredients and other products to us and therefore adversely affect our ability to fulfill our customers’ orders. These interruptions may be due to\nevents that are beyond our control or the control of the third parties with whom we contract.\nWe also maintain arrangements with third-party transport carriers to deliver the food products we sell to our customers. Interruptions, delays or failures in\nthese carrier services could prevent the timely or proper delivery of these products, which may result in significant product inventory losses given the highly\nperishable nature of our food products.\n28"

If these carriers experience performance problems or other difficulties, we may not be able to deliver orders in a timely\nmanner and meet customer expectations, and our business and reputation could suffer. For example, carrier interruptions and delays as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic or otherwise have in the past, and could again in the future impact our ability to deliver orders to our customers which could materially and adversely\nimpact our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, if we are not able to maintain acceptable pricing and other terms with these carriers,\nwhether as a result of inflation or otherwise, and we do not increase the price of our product offerings, we may experience reduced operating margins.\nWe rely on third-party transport carriers for the delivery of our wines to our customers. State and federal laws regulate the ability of transport carriers to\ntransport wine, and carriers may be required to obtain licenses in order to deliver wine to our customers. Changes in our access to those carriers, including changes\nin prices and fuel surcharges or changes in our relationships with those carriers, changes in the laws allowing third party transport of wine, or regulatory discipline\nagainst licenses held by those carriers, could materially adversely affect our wine business.\nDelivery of the products we sell to our customers could also be affected or interrupted by the merger, acquisition, insolvency, or government shutdown of\nthe carriers we engage to make deliveries. If the products we sell are not delivered in proper condition or on a timely basis, our business and reputation could suffer.\nUnionization activities may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.\nAlthough none of our employees is currently covered under a collective bargaining agreement, our employees may elect to seek to be represented by labor\nunions in the future. For example, in April 2018, a local labor union filed an election petition with the National Labor Relations Board seeking to represent certain\nemployees at our Linden, New Jersey facility; however, such employees subsequently voted to not be represented by the union and one of our competitors recently\nfaced a union election in three states. If a significant number of our employees were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate\nsignificantly from our current compensation and benefits structure, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. In\naddition, a labor dispute involving some or all of our employees may harm our reputation, disrupt our operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of\nlabor disputes may increase our costs.\nAny failure to adequately store, maintain and deliver quality perishable foods could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating\nresults.\nOur ability to adequately store, maintain and deliver quality perishable foods is critical to our business. We store food products, which are highly\nperishable, in refrigerated fulfillment centers and ship them to our customers inside boxes that are insulated with thermal or corrugate liners and frozen refrigerants\nto maintain appropriate temperatures in transit and use refrigerated third-party delivery trucks to support temperature control for shipments to certain locations.\nKeeping our food products at specific temperatures maintains freshness and enhances food safety. In the event of extended power outages, natural disasters or other\ncatastrophic occurrences, failures of the refrigeration systems in our fulfillment centers or third-party delivery trucks, failure to use adequate packaging to maintain\nappropriate temperatures, or other circumstances both within and beyond our control, our inability to store highly perishable inventory at specific temperatures\ncould result in significant product inventory losses as well as increased risk of food borne illnesses and other food safety risks. Improper handling or storage of food\nby a customer—without any fault by us—could result in food borne illnesses, which could nonetheless result in negative publicity and harm to our brand and\nreputation. Further, we contract with third parties to conduct certain fulfillment processes and operations on our behalf. Any failure by such third party to adequately\nstore, maintain or transport perishable foods could negatively impact the safety, quality and merchantability of our products and the experience of our customers.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nDisruptions in our data and information systems could harm our reputation and our ability to run our business.\nWe rely extensively on data and information systems for our supply chain, order processing, fulfillment operations, financial reporting, human resources\nand various other operations, processes and transactions. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between, and storage of personal data of, our\npersonnel, customers and suppliers depends on information technology. Our data and information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages,\ncomputer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches (including breaches of our transaction processing or other systems that could result\nin the compromise of confidential customer data), catastrophic events, data breaches and usage errors by our employees or third-party service providers. Our data\nand information technology systems may also fail to perform as we anticipate, and we may encounter difficulties in adapting these systems to changing technologies\nor expanding them to meet the future needs of our business.

In addition, various third parties, such as our suppliers and payment processors, also rely heavily on\ninformation technology systems, and any failure of these systems could also cause loss of sales, transactional or other data and significant interruptions to our\nbusiness.

Security\nbreaches, computer malware, computer hacking attacks and other compromises of information security measures have become more prevalent in the business world\nand may occur on our systems or those of our vendors in the future. Large Internet companies and websites have from time to time disclosed sophisticated and\ntargeted attacks on portions of their websites, and an increasing number have reported such attacks resulting in breaches of their information security. We and our\nthird-party vendors are at risk of suffering from similar attacks and breaches. Although we take steps to maintain confidential and proprietary information on our\ninformation systems, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches and we rely on our third-party vendors to take appropriate\nmeasures to protect the security and integrity of the information on those information systems. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to\nsabotage information systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent these attacks. In\naddition, we have experienced, and may experience in the future, a “credentials stuffing” incident, which is where a third party is able to illicitly obtain a customer’s\nidentification and password credentials on the dark web to access a customer’s account and certain account data.

Our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for direct\nlosses caused by any such security breach or indirect losses due to resulting customer attrition.\nWe rely on email and other messaging services to connect with our existing and potential customers.

We are also subject to payment brand operating rules,\npayment card industry data security standards and certification requirements, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it more difficult or impossible for us to\ncomply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit\ncard payments from customers, which would make our services less convenient and attractive to our customers and likely result in a substantial reduction in net\nrevenue.

As such, these suppliers could be difficult to replace if we were no longer able to rely on them. We also work with suppliers that produce specialty or\nunique ingredients for us. It can take a significant amount of time and resources to identify, develop and maintain relationships with certain suppliers, including\nsuppliers that produce specialty or unique products for us. In the event of any disruptions to our relationships with our suppliers of specialty products, the\ningredients they produce for us would be difficult to replace. The termination of, or material changes to, arrangements with key suppliers or vendors, disagreements\nwith key suppliers or vendors as to payment or other terms, or the failure of a key supplier or vendor to meet its contractual obligations to us may require us to\ncontract with alternative suppliers or vendors. For example, the failure of a key supplier to meet its obligations to us or otherwise deliver ingredients at the volumes\nthat meet our quality and production standards could require us to make purchases from alternative suppliers or make changes to our product offerings. If we have to\nreplace key suppliers or vendors, we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable than those we currently enjoy, and it may be difficult to identify and\nsecure relationships with alternative suppliers or vendors that are able to meet our volume requirements, food safety and quality or other standards. If we cannot\nreplace or engage suppliers or vendors who meet our specifications and standards in a short period of time, we could encounter increased expenses, shortages of\ningredients and other items, disruptions or delays in customer shipments or other harm. In this event, we could experience a significant reduction in sales and incur\nhigher costs for replacement goods and customer refunds during the shortage or thereafter, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nIn our wine business, we rely on the use of third-party alternating proprietorship winemaking facilities. We rely on the host or owner of such facilities to\nensure that the facilities are operational and maintained in good condition. Changes in those facilities or our access to those facilities, including changes in prices or\nchanges in our relationships with the third parties who own and operate those facilities, or regulatory discipline against licenses held by those third parties, or any\nfailure by such third parties to maintain their facilities in good condition, may impair our ability to produce wines at such facilities and could materially adversely\naffect our wine business.\nOur results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, political crises or other catastrophic events.\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, droughts and other adverse weather and climate conditions; crop pests or diseases;\nanimal diseases; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war\nand other political instability or uncertainty; or other catastrophic events, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our operations or\nthe operations of one or more of our suppliers or vendors. In particular, these types of events could impact our supply chain from or to the impacted region given our\ndependency on frequent deliveries of ingredients and other products from a variety of local, regional and national suppliers. In addition, these types of events could\nadversely affect consumer spending in the impacted regions or our ability to deliver our products to our customers safely, cost-effectively or at all. To the extent any\nof these events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting related to ineffective information technology general controls. Failure\nto establish and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the future could have a material adverse effect\non our business and stock price.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the rules of the SEC implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires\nmanagement to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of controls\nover financial reporting. We are required\n31"

In addition, as of January 1, 2023, we are no longer an emerging growth company and therefore, as an accelerated filer with annual\nrevenues greater than $100 million, our independent registered public accounting firm is now required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting pursuant to Section 404 .Our independent registered public accounting firm, and management, may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is\nnot satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.\nTo comply with the requirements of being a public company, we have undertaken various actions, and may need to take additional actions, such as\nimplementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. Testing and maintaining internal control can divert our\nmanagement’s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business.\nAdditionally, when evaluating our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify material weaknesses and significant deficiencies and, as of\nDecember 31, 2022, our management has identified a material weakness in internal controls related to ineffective information technology general controls. The\nmaterial weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to the financial statements and there were no changes to previously identified financial results.\nManagement has developed and is implementing a remediation plan to address the material weakness. However, we cannot assure you that the testing of the\noperational effectiveness of the new control will be complete within a specific timeframe.\nThere is no assurance that another material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur or that we will be able to remediate such material\nweaknesses or significant deficiencies in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. If we identify\nany material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert\nthat our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market\nprice of our Class A common stock could be materially adversely affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our\nsecurities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may be accused of infringing or violating the intellectual property rights of others.\nOther parties have claimed or may claim in the future that we infringe or violate their trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, publicity rights or\nother proprietary rights. Such claims, regardless of their merit, could result in litigation or other proceedings and could require us to expend significant financial\nresources and attention by our management and other personnel that otherwise would be focused on our business operations, result in injunctions against us that\nprevent us from using material intellectual property rights, or require us to pay damages to third parties. We may need to obtain licenses from third parties who\nallege that we have infringed or violated their rights, but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, we may not be able to\nobtain or use on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property that we do not own, which would require us to\ndevelop alternative intellectual property. To the extent we rely on open-source software, we may face claims from third parties that claim ownership of the open-\nsource software or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seek to enforce the terms of the applicable open-source license. Similar\nclaims might also be asserted regarding our in-house software. These risks have been amplified by the increase in intellectual property claims by third parties whose\nsole or primary business is to assert such claims. As knowledge of our business expands, we are likely to be subject to intellectual property claims against us with\nincreasing frequency, scope and magnitude. We may also be obligated to indemnify affiliates or other partners who are accused of violating third parties’ intellectual\nproperty rights by virtue of those affiliates or partners’ agreements with us, and this could increase our costs in defending such claims and our damages.\nFurthermore, such affiliates and partners may discontinue their relationship with us either as a result of injunctions or otherwise. The occurrence of these results\ncould harm our brand or materially adversely affect our business, financial position and operating results.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe regard our customer lists and other consumer data, trademarks, service marks, domain names, copyrights, trade dress, trade secrets, know how,\nproprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our future success. We cannot be sure that our intellectual property portfolio will not be\ninfringed, violated or otherwise challenged by third parties, or that we will be successful in enforcing, defending or combating any such infringements, violations, or\n32"

We also cannot be sure that the law might not change in a way that would affect the nature or extent of our intellectual property ownership.\nWe rely on patent, registered and unregistered trademark, copyright and trade secret protection and other intellectual property protections under applicable\nlaw to protect these proprietary rights. While we have taken steps toward procuring trademark registration for several of our trademarks in key countries around the\nworld and have entered or may enter into contracts to assist with the procurement and protection of our trademarks, we cannot assure you that our common law,\napplied for, or registered trademarks are valid and enforceable, that our trademark registrations and applications or use of our trademarks will not be challenged by\nknown or unknown third parties, or that any pending trademark or patent applications will issue or provide us with any competitive advantage. Effective intellectual\nproperty protection may not be available to us or may be challenged by third parties. Furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our\ntrademarks and other proprietary rights that may be displayed on or in conjunction with our website and other marketing media. We may be unable to prevent third\nparties from acquiring or retaining domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\nWe also rely on confidentiality, supplier, license and other agreements with our employees, suppliers and others. There is no guarantee that these third\nparties will comply with these agreements and refrain from misappropriating our proprietary rights. Misappropriation of our proprietary rights could materially\nadversely affect our business, financial position and operating results.\nWe may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use or infringement or violation of our intellectual property or proprietary\nrights. Third parties also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or our reputation. The protection of our intellectual property may require\nthe expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our\nproprietary rights or prevent third parties from continuing to infringe or misappropriate these rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently\ndevelop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.\nLitigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the\nproprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could be costly, time consuming and distracting to management,\nresult in a diversion of resources, the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property and could materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and operating results. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits\nattacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. These steps may be inadequate to protect our intellectual property. We will not be able to\nprotect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Despite our precautions, it\nmay be possible for unauthorized third parties to use information that we regard as proprietary to create product offerings that compete with ours.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation of Our Food Operations\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulations, which require significant expenditures and ongoing compliance efforts.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulations. Our food processing facilities and products are subject to inspection by the USDA, the FDA\nand various state and local health and agricultural agencies. Applicable statutes and regulations governing food products include rules for labeling the content of\nspecific types of foods, the nutritional value of that food and its serving size, as well as rules that protect against contamination of products by food borne pathogens\nand food production rules addressing the discharge of materials and pollutants and animal welfare. Many jurisdictions also provide that food producers adhere to\ngood manufacturing or production practices (the definitions of which may vary by jurisdiction) with respect to processing food. Recently, the food safety practices\nof the meat processing industry and produce industry have been subject to intense scrutiny and oversight by the USDA and FDA, respectively, and the FDA has\nbegun to evaluate the possible need for new regulations for e-commerce food delivery companies, and future food-borne illness outbreaks or other food safety\nincidents related to meat or produce could lead to further governmental regulation of our business or of our suppliers. In addition, our fulfillment centers are subject\nto various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and workplace health. Our fulfillment centers and offices, as applicable continue\nto also be subject to additional FDA, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations and guidelines and\nlocal guidelines relating to COVID-19. Failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations could subject us, our suppliers or other strategic partners to civil\nremedies, including fines, injunctions, product recalls or seizures and criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and operating results. Furthermore, compliance with current or future laws or regulations\n33"

Most state and local laws operate similarly. Consequently, almost any deviation from\nsubjective or objective requirements of the FDCA or state or local law leaves us vulnerable to a variety of civil and criminal penalties.\nIn the future, we may deploy new equipment, update our facilities or occupy new facilities. These activities require us to adjust our operations and\nregulatory compliance systems to meet rapidly changing conditions. Although we have adopted and implemented systems to prevent the production of unsafe or\nmislabeled products, any failure of those systems to prevent or anticipate an instance or category of deficiency could result in significant business interruption and\nfinancial losses to us. The occurrence of events that are difficult to prevent completely, such as the introduction of pathogenic organisms from the outside\nenvironment into our facilities, also may result in the failure of our products to meet legal standards. Under these conditions we could be exposed to civil and\ncriminal regulatory action.\nIn some instances, we may be responsible or held liable for the activities and compliance of our third-party vendors, suppliers or other strategic partners,\ndespite limited visibility into their operations. Although we monitor and carefully select our third-party vendors, suppliers, or other strategic partners, they may fail\nto adhere to regulatory standards, our safety and quality standards or labor and employment practices, and we may fail to identify deficiencies or violations on a\ntimely basis or at all. In addition, a statute in California called the Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires us to audit our suppliers with respect to\ncertain risks related to slavery and human trafficking and to mitigate any such risks in our operations, and any failure to disclose issues or other non-compliance\ncould subject us to action by the California Attorney General.\nWe cannot assure you that we will always be in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or that we will be able to comply with any future\nlaws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nChanges to law, regulation or policy applicable to foods could leave us vulnerable to adverse governmental action and materially adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and operating results.\nThe food industry is highly regulated. We invest significant resources in our efforts to comply with the local, state and federal food regulatory regimes\nunder which we operate. However, we cannot assure you that existing laws and regulations will not be revised or that new, more restrictive laws, regulations,\nguidance or enforcement policies will not be adopted or become applicable to us, our suppliers or the products we distribute. We also operate under a business\nmodel that is relatively new to the food industry, in which we rapidly source, process, store and package meal ingredients—including fresh fruits and vegetables,\nand poultry, beef and seafood, each of which may be subject to a unique regulatory regime—and ship them directly to consumers in the course of e-commerce\ntransactions. Our business model leaves our business particularly susceptible to changes in and reinterpretations of compliance policies of the FDA and other\ngovernment agencies, and some of our competitors may interpret the applicability of the same or similar laws and regulations to their businesses differently than we\ninterpret them. Furthermore, it is unclear how the FDA may interpret and enforce certain recently promulgated regulations, such as the requirements regarding food\ndefense mitigation strategies, or if the FDA will adopt new regulations for e-commerce food delivery companies, which present considerable future uncertainty.\nRecent and ongoing changes in senior federal government officials and policy priorities create additional uncertainty.\nOur existing compliance structures may be insufficient to address the changing regulatory environment and changing expectations from government\nregulators regarding our business model. This may result in gaps in compliance coverage or the omission of necessary new compliance activity.\nOur facilities and operations are governed by numerous and sometimes conflicting registration, licensing and reporting requirements.\nOur fulfillment centers are required to be registered with the federal government and, depending on their location, are also subject to the authority of state\nand local governments. In some cases, disparate registration and licensing requirements lead to legal uncertainty, inconsistent government classifications of our\noperations and unpredictable governmental actions. Regulators may also change prior interpretations of governing licensing and registration\n34"

If we misapply or misidentify licensing or registration\nrequirements, fail to maintain our registrations or licenses or otherwise violate applicable requirements, our products may be subject to seizure or recall and our\noperations subject to injunction. This could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nSimilarly, we are required to submit reports to the FDA’s Reportable Food Registry in the event that we determine a product may present a serious danger\nto consumers. The reporting requirement may be triggered based on a subjective assessment of incomplete and changing facts. Our inventory moves very rapidly\nthroughout our supply and distribution chain. Should we fail, in a timely fashion, to identify and report a potentially reportable event which, subsequently, is\ndetermined to have been reportable, government authorities may institute civil or criminal enforcement actions against us, and may result in civil litigation against\nus or criminal charges against certain of our employees. This could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nGood manufacturing process standards and food safety compliance metrics are complex, highly subjective and selectively enforced.\nThe federal regulatory scheme governing food products establishes guideposts and objectives for complying with legal requirements rather than providing\nclear direction on when particular standards apply or how they must be met. For example, FDA regulations referred to as Hazard Analysis and Risk Based\nPreventive Controls for Human Food require that we evaluate food safety hazards inherent to our specific products and operations. We must then implement\n“preventive controls” in cases where we determine that qualified food safety personnel would recommend that we do so. Determining what constitutes a food safety\nhazard, or what a qualified food safety expert might recommend to prevent such a hazard, requires evaluating a variety of situational factors. This analysis is\nnecessarily subjective, and a government regulator may find our analysis or conclusions inadequate. Similarly, the standard of “good manufacturing practice” to\nwhich we are held in our food production operations relies on a hypothesis regarding what individuals and organizations qualified in food manufacturing and food\nsafety would find to be appropriate practices in the context of our operations. Our business model, and the scale and nature of our operations, have relatively few\nmeaningful comparisons among traditional food companies. Government regulators may disagree with our analyses and decisions regarding the good manufacturing\npractices appropriate for our operations.\nDecisions made or processes adopted by us in producing our products are subject to after the fact review by government authorities, sometimes years after\nthe fact. Similarly, governmental agencies and personnel within those agencies may alter, clarify or even reverse previous interpretations of compliance\nrequirements and the circumstances under which they will institute formal enforcement activity. It is not always possible accurately to predict regulators’ responses\nto actual or alleged food production deficiencies due to the large degree of discretion afforded regulators. We may be vulnerable to civil or criminal enforcement\naction by government regulators if they disagree with our analyses, conclusions, actions or practices. This could materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nPackaging, labeling and advertising requirements are subject to varied interpretation and selective enforcement.\nWe operate under a novel business model in which we source, process, store and package meal ingredients and ship them directly to consumers. Most FDA\nrequirements for mandatory food labeling are decades old and were adopted prior to the advent of large-scale, direct to consumer food sales and e-commerce\nplatforms. Consequently, we, like our competitors, must make judgments regarding how best to comply with labeling and packaging regulations and industry\npractices not designed with our specific business model in mind. Government regulators may disagree with these judgments, leaving us open to civil or criminal\nenforcement action. This could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to detailed and complex requirements for how our products may be labeled and advertised, which may also be supplemented by guidance\nfrom governmental agencies. Generally speaking, these requirements divide information into mandatory information that we must present to consumers and\nvoluntary information that we may present to consumers. Packaging, labeling, disclosure and advertising regulations may describe what mandatory information\nmust be provided to consumers, where and how that information is to be displayed physically on our materials or elsewhere, the terms, words or phrases in which it\nmust be disclosed, and the penalties for non-compliance.\nVoluntary statements made by us or by certain third parties, whether on package labels or labeling, on websites, in print, in radio, on social media channels,\nor on television, can be subject to FDA regulation, Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, regulation, USDA regulation, state and local regulation, or any combination\nof the foregoing. These statements may be subject to specific requirements, subjective regulatory evaluation, and legal challenges by plaintiffs. FDA, FTC, USDA\nand state and local level regulations and guidance can be confusing and subject to conflicting interpretations. Guidelines, standards and market practice for, and\nconsumers’ understandings of, certain types of voluntary statements, such as those\n35"

Furthermore, in recent years the FDA has increased enforcement of its regulations with\nrespect to nutritional, health and other claims related to food products, and plaintiffs have commenced legal actions against a number of companies that market food\nproducts positioned as “natural” or “healthy,” asserting false, misleading and deceptive advertising and labeling claims, including claims related to such food being\n“all natural” or that they lack any genetically modified ingredients. Should we become subject to similar claims or actions, consumers may avoid purchasing\nproducts from us or seek alternatives, even if the basis for the claim is unfounded, and the cost of defending against any such claims could be significant. The\noccurrence of any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation of our Wine Business\nIf we do not comply with the specialized regulations and laws that regulate the alcoholic beverage industry, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nAlcoholic beverages are highly regulated at both the federal and state levels. Regulated areas include production, importation, product labeling, taxes,\nmarketing, pricing, delivery, ownership restrictions, prohibitions on sales to minors, and relationships among alcoholic beverage producers, wholesalers and\nretailers. We cannot assure you that we will always be in full compliance with all applicable regulations or laws, that we will be able to comply with any future\nregulations and laws, that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with compliance with applicable regulatory and legal requirements, or that such\nregulations and laws will not materially adversely affect our wine business. We rely on various internal and external personnel with relevant experience complying\nwith applicable regulatory and legal requirements, and the loss of personnel with such expertise could adversely affect our wine business.\nLicenses issued by state and federal alcoholic beverage regulatory agencies are required in order to produce, sell and ship wine. We have state and federal\nlicenses, and must remain in compliance with state and federal laws in order to keep our licenses in good standing. Compliance failures can result in fines, license\nsuspension or license revocation. In some cases, compliance failures can also result in cease-and-desist orders, injunctive proceedings or other criminal or civil\npenalties. If our licenses do not remain in good standing, our wine business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur wine business relies substantially on state laws that authorize the shipping of wine by out of state producers directly to in state consumers. Those laws\nare relatively new in many states, and it is common for the laws to be modified or regulators to change prior interpretations of governing licensing requirements.\nAdverse changes to laws or their interpretation allowing a producer to ship wine to consumers across state lines could materially adversely affect our wine business.\nOther Risks Related to Government Regulation\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, e-commerce and other aspects of our business is evolving, and we may experience unfavorable changes in or failure to\ncomply with existing or future regulations and laws.\nWe are subject to a number of regulations and laws that apply generally to businesses, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet\nand e-commerce and the marketing, sale and delivery of goods and services over the Internet. Existing and future regulations and laws may impede the growth and\navailability of the Internet and online services and may limit our ability to operate our business. These laws and regulations, which continue to evolve, cover\ntaxation, tariffs, privacy and data protection, data security, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile and other communications, advertising practices,\nelectronic contracts, sales procedures, automatic subscription renewals, credit card processing procedures, consumer protections, the provision of online payment\nservices, unencumbered Internet access to our services, the design and operation of websites, and the characteristics and quality of product offerings that are offered\nonline. We cannot guarantee that we have been or will be fully compliant in every jurisdiction, as it is not entirely clear how existing laws and regulations governing\nissues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, consumer protection, libel and personal privacy apply or will be enforced with respect to the Internet and e-\ncommerce, as many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and e-commerce and do not contemplate or address the unique issues they raise.\nMoreover, as e-commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation and enforcement efforts by federal and state agencies and the prospects for private litigation\nclaims related to our data collection, privacy policies or other e-commerce practices become more likely. In addition, the adoption of any laws or regulations, or the\nimposition of other legal requirements, that adversely affect our ability to market, sell, and deliver our products could decrease our ability to offer, or customer\ndemand for, our offerings, resulting in lower net revenue, and existing or future laws or regulations could impair our ability to expand our product offerings, which\ncould also result in lower net revenue and make us more vulnerable to increased competition. Future regulations, or changes in laws and regulations or their existing\ninterpretations or\n36"

We also may choose\nto comply with, or may be required to comply with, self-regulatory obligations or other industry standards with respect to our collection, use, retention, sharing or\nsecurity of customer data.\nWe strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, self-regulatory requirements, policies and legal obligations relating to privacy, data usage, and\ndata protection. It is possible, however, that these laws, regulations and other obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one\njurisdiction to another and which may conflict with other rules or requirements or our practices. We cannot guarantee that our practices have complied, comply, or\nwill comply fully with all such laws, regulations, requirements and obligations.\nWe have posted our privacy policy which describes our practice related to the collection, use and disclosure of customer data on our website and in our\nmobile application. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policy or with any federal or state laws, regulations, self-regulatory\nrequirements, industry standards, or other legal obligations could result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, customers or others, or\nother liabilities, or could result in a loss of customers, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In\naddition, a failure or perceived failure to comply with industry standards or with our own privacy policy and practices could result in a loss of customers and could\nmaterially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAdditionally, existing privacy related laws, regulations, self-regulatory obligations and other legal obligations are evolving and are subject to potentially\ndiffering interpretations. Various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current laws or enact new laws regarding privacy matters, and\ncourts may interpret existing privacy related laws and regulations in new or different manners. For example, we are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act\nof 2018, which came into effect on January 1, 2020 and its successor, the California Privacy Rights Act, which took effect on January 1, 2023, which require, among\nother things, that companies that process information on California residents to provide new disclosures to California consumers, allows such consumers to opt out\nof data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. Some other states have adopted, and many other states are considering,\nsimilar legislation. While we have invested and may continue to invest in readiness to comply with the applicable legislation, the effects of these new and evolving\nlaws, regulations, and other obligations potentially are far-reaching and may require us to further modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur\nsubstantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply.\nChanges in privacy related laws, regulations, self-regulatory obligations and other legal obligations, or changes in industry standards or consumer\nsentiment, such as our need to adjust our digital marketing in response to the ongoing elimination of cookie-based tracking, could require us to incur substantial\ncosts or to change our business practices, including changing, limiting or ceasing altogether the collection, use, sharing, or transfer of data relating to consumers.\nAny of these effects could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur failure to collect state or local sales, use or other similar taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and\ninterest, and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nIn general, we have not historically collected state or local sales, use or other similar taxes in any jurisdictions in which we do not have a tax nexus, in\nreliance on court decisions or applicable exemptions that restrict or preclude the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales, use and other similar taxes\nwith respect to online sales of our products. In addition, we have not historically collected state or local sales, use or other similar taxes in certain jurisdictions in\nwhich we do have a physical presence in reliance on applicable exemptions. On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court decided, in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.,\nthat state and local jurisdictions may, at least in certain circumstances, enforce a sales and use tax collection obligation on remote vendors that have no physical\npresence in such jurisdiction. A number of states have already begun, or have positioned themselves to begin, requiring sales and use tax collection by remote\nvendors and/or by online marketplaces. The details and effective dates of these collection requirements vary from state to state. It is possible that one or more\njurisdictions may assert that we have liability for periods for which we have not collected sales, use or other similar taxes, and if such an assertion or assertions were\nsuccessful it could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales as well as penalties and interest, which could materially adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and operating results.\n37"

New or revised federal, state, or local tax regulations may subject us or our customers to\nadditional sales, income, and other taxes. New or revised taxes and, in particular, sales taxes, value added taxes and similar taxes (including sales and use taxes that\nwe may be required to collect as a result of the Wayfair decision) are likely to increase costs to our customers and increase the cost of doing business online\n(including the cost of compliance processes necessary to capture data and collect and remit taxes), and such taxes may decrease the attractiveness of purchasing\nproducts over the Internet. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations which could subject our business to higher tax\nliability.\nWe may be limited in the portion of net operating loss carryforwards that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. federal and state income\ntax purposes. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $563.9 million and $460.9 million, respectively, and state\nnet operating loss carryforwards of $249.7 million and $197.7 million, respectively, that are available to offset future tax liabilities. Of the $563.9 million of federal\nnet operating loss carryforwards, $221.4 million was generated before January 1, 2018 and is subject to a 20-year carryforward period. The remaining $342.5\nmillion can be carried forward indefinitely, but is subject to an 80% taxable income limitation, in any future taxable year. The pre-2018 federal and all state net\noperating losses will begin to expire in 2032 and 2033, respectively, if not utilized.\nFurthermore, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“the Code”), limits the ability of a company that undergoes an “ownership\nchange” (generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point cumulative change (by value) in the equity ownership of certain stockholders over a rolling three-\nyear period) to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change.\nFuture changes in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. In\naddition, Section 383 of the Code generally limits the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by pre-ownership change tax\ncredit carryforwards. If we were to undergo an “ownership change,” it could materially limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and other\ndeferred tax assets.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nWe may not be able to remain in compliance with the New York Stock Exchange’s requirements for the continued listing of our Class A common stock on the\nexchange.\nOn December 21, 2022, we were notified by the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) that we were no longer in compliance with the NYSE’s\ncontinued listing standards set forth in Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because our average global market capitalization over a consecutive\n30 trading-day period was less than $50.0 million and, at the same time, our last reported stockholders’ equity was less than $50.0 million. If our average global\nmarket capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period drops below $15.0 million, the NYSE will initiate delisting proceedings. As required by the NYSE,\non January 6, 2023, we notified the NYSE of our intent to cure the deficiency and restore our compliance with the NYSE continued listing standards. In accordance\nwith applicable NYSE procedures, on February 6, 2023, we submitted a plan advising the NYSE of the definitive actions we have taken and are taking, that would\nbring us into compliance with the NYSE continued listing standards within 18 months of receipt of the written notice. On February 28, 2023, the NYSE accepted\nthe plan and our Class A common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE during the 18-month period from December 21, 2022, subject to our\ncompliance with other NYSE continued listing standards and continued periodic review by the NYSE of our progress with respect to our plan. We can provide no\nassurances that we will be able to satisfy any of the steps outlined in the plan approved by the NYSE and maintain the listing of our shares on the NYSE.\nIn addition, on December 21, 2022, we were notified by the NYSE that we no longer satisfied the continued listing compliance standard set forth Section\n802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because the average closing price of our Class A common stock was less than $1.00 per share over a consecutive 30-\nday trading period.

We intend to regain compliance\nwith the NYSE listing standards by pursing measures that are in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders, which could include seeking to effect a\nreverse stock split. Although we anticipate that we will regain compliance with Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual within the cure period, the\nprice of our Class A common stock is influenced by many factors, many of which are beyond our control. There is no assurance that our efforts will be successful,\nnor is there any assurance that we will remain in compliance with Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual or other NYSE continued listing\nstandards in the future.\nA delisting of our Class A common stock could negatively impact our company and holders of our Class A common stock, including by reducing the\nwillingness of investors to hold our Class A common stock because of the resulting decreased price, liquidity and trading of our Class A common stock, limited\navailability of price quotations, and reduced news and analyst coverage. These developments may also require brokers trading in our Class A common stock to\nadhere to more stringent rules and may limit our ability to raise capital by issuing additional shares of Class A common stock in the future. Delisting may adversely\nimpact the perception of our financial condition, cause reputational harm with investors, our employees and parties conducting business with us, and limit our\naccess to debt and equity financing. The perceived decrease in value of employee equity incentive awards may reduce their effectiveness in encouraging\nperformance and retention.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been and may in the future be highly volatile, and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to\nvarious factors, some of which are beyond our control, and which could result in substantial losses for investors purchasing our shares.\nThe stock market in general and the market for our Class A common stock in particular has, from time to time, and may again, experience extreme\nvolatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. For example, since our initial public offering in June 2017, the market\nprice of our Class A common stock has ranged from a high of $165.00 (adjusted for the reverse stock split that occurred in June 2019) to a low of $0.61. Some of\nthe factors that may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate include:\n•\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n•\nvolatility in the market price and trading volume of comparable companies;\n•\nactual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of securities analysts;\n•\nannouncements of new service offerings, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n•\ndeparture of key personnel;\n•\nlitigation involving us or that may be perceived as having an adverse effect on our business;\n•\nchanges in general economic, industry and market conditions and trends, including as a result of high inflationary pressures;\n•\ninvestors’ general perception of us;\n•\nsales or perceived sales of large blocks of our stock; and\n•\nannouncements regarding industry consolidation.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that\ncompany. For example, we have been subject to several putative class action lawsuits alleging federal securities law violations in connection with our initial public\noffering, or IPO. Because of the past and the potential future volatility of our stock price, we may become the target of additional securities litigation in the future.\nSecurities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources from our business.\nOur quarterly operating results or other operating metrics may fluctuate significantly, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to\ncontinue to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results and other operating metrics have fluctuated in the past and may in the future fluctuate as a result of a number of factors,\nmany of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:\n39"

If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations\nfor these or any other reasons, the market price of our Class A common stock could continue to fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including\nsecurities class action suits.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock or\nthe stock of other companies in our industry, the price of our stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our\nbusiness, our market or our competitors. If the analyst(s) covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock or the stock of other companies in our\nindustry, the price of our stock could decline.

If these analysts cease to cover our stock and other\nanalysts do not begin to cover our stock, we could lose additional visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline further.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business.\nThere can be no assurance that existing analysts will continue to cover us or that new analysts will begin to cover us. There is also no assurance that any covering\nanalyst will provide favorable coverage.

As a result, investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our\nClass A common stock.\nJoseph N. Sanberg and certain of his affiliates and other related parties beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding Class A common stock, and\ntherefore have significant influence over the outcome of matters subject to stockholder approval, including a change of control, which could make our Class A\ncommon stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price, or such parties could sell their shares into the market, which could negatively\nimpact the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nAs of February 28, 2023, Mr. Sanberg and his affiliates beneficially own an aggregate of 8,467,864 shares of our outstanding Class A common stock held\ndirectly, and Mr. Sanberg and his affiliates also beneficially own an additional 9,021,620 shares issuable upon exercise of warrants held by Mr. Sanberg’s affiliates,\nwhich collectively represents approximately 22.3% of our outstanding capital stock. The shares underlying the warrants are only entitled to voting rights upon\nexercise of such warrants. In addition, we have agreed to issue 9,823,009 additional shares of Class A common stock to RJB at the closing of the transactions\ncontemplated by the RJB Purchase Agreement (as amended). If that transaction closes, upon the issuance of the additional shares, Mr. Sanberg and his affiliates\nwould own, assuming the exercise of all warrants held by them, approximately 31.0% of our outstanding capital stock. For additional information regarding the\nbeneficial ownership of Mr. Sanberg and his affiliates, see “Substantial sales of shares of our Class A common stock could cause the market price of our Class A\ncommon stock to decline and/or result in dilution to our stockholders.”\nPursuant to a purchase agreement (the “2021 Purchase Agreement”) among us, RJB and Mr. M. Salzberg, dated September 15, 2021, RJB is subject to a\nvoting agreement, pursuant to which RJB agreed to cause all of our voting securities beneficially owned by it or certain of its affiliates, including Mr. Sanberg, in\nexcess of 19.9% of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock to be voted in proportion to, and accordance with, the vote of all of our stockholders,\nlimiting the effective voting power of the securities beneficially held by Mr. Sanberg.\nIn addition, under the August 2022 amendment to the RJB Purchase Agreement, we agreed at that time, effectively immediately following, and contingent\nupon, the RJB Second Closing, to appoint the individual designated by Joseph N. Sanberg to serve as a director on our board of directors until the expiration of the\nstandstill period in the 2021 Purchase Agreement with RJB.\nAs a result, Mr. Sanberg and his affiliates have significant influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of\ndirectors and the approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power might delay, defer or\nprevent a change in control or delay or prevent a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us on terms that other stockholders may\ndesire, which, in each case, could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nSubstantial sales of shares of our Class A common stock could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline and/or result in dilution to our\nstockholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could reduce the\nmarket price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or other securities. We are unable to\npredict the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock.\nAs of February 28, 2023, an aggregate of 4,790,732 shares of our common stock remained available for future grants under our equity incentive plans.

Shares registered under our registration statements on Form S-8 are available for sale in\nthe public market subject to vesting arrangements and exercise of options, and the restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act. If\nthese shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nAdditionally, as of February 28, 2023, the holders of an aggregate of approximately 1.9 million registrable securities have rights, subject to certain\nconditions, to include their securities in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders, inclusive of the 176,991 shares of Class A\ncommon stock issued to Remember Bruce, LLC under the RJB Purchase Agreement. If the Second RJB Closing occurs, holders of an additional 9,823,009 shares of\nClass A common stock would have rights, subject to certain conditions, to include their securities in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other\nstockholders. If we were to register these securities for resale, they could be freely sold in the public market. If these additional securities are sold, or if it is\nperceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.\n41"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nof 2002, the listing requirements of the NYSE and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations may continue to\nincrease our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources,\nparticularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company. Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that we file\nannual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet\nthis standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns,\nwhich could harm our business and operating results. Although we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire\neven more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nAs a public company, we are required to evaluate our internal controls and during the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material\nweaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we are unable to remediate before the end of the same fiscal year in which the material weakness is\nidentified, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective,\nor if our auditors are unable to attest to management’s report on the effectiveness of our internal controls, which will be required after we are no longer an emerging\ngrowth company, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our Class A common\nstock to decline. As of December 31, 2022, our management has identified a material weakness in internal controls related to ineffective information technology\ngeneral controls. For a more detailed discussion of this material weakness, see the risk factor herein entitled \"We have identified a material weakness in our internal\ncontrols over financial reporting related to ineffective information technology general controls. Failure to establish and maintain effective internal controls in\naccordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\"\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies,\nincreasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying\ninterpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by\nregulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to\ndisclosure and governance practices. To comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, we may need to invest additional resources, and this investment may\nresult in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance\nactivities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory\nauthorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business could be materially harmed.\nAs a result of being a public company and the accompanying rules and regulations, it is more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability\ninsurance, and, in the future, we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it\nmore difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and\nqualified executive officers.\nWe are a “smaller reporting company,” and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our Class A common\nstock less attractive to investors.\nWe qualify as a smaller reporting company, which allows us to take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements, including reduced\ndisclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. In general, we will qualify as a smaller reporting company for as long as we have less than $250 million\nof public float (calculated as the aggregate market value of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock held by non-affiliates, based on the closing price\nof our Class A common stock on the NYSE on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter). We cannot predict whether investors will find our Class A\ncommon stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active\ntrading market for our Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nHigher labor costs due to statutory and regulatory changes could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n45"

The following discussion contains forward-looking\nstatements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors\nthat could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section\ntitled “Risk Factors.” In this discussion, we use financial measures that are considered non-GAAP financial measures under Securities and Exchange Commission\nrules. These rules require supplemental explanation and reconciliation, which is included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Investors should not\nconsider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from or in substitution for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles. In the below discussion, we use the term basis points to refer to units of one-hundredth of one percent.\nOverview\nBlue Apron’s vision is Better Living Through Better Food™. Founded in 2012, we are on a mission to spark discovery, connection, and joy through\ncooking. We offer fresh, chef-designed recipes that empower our customers to embrace their culinary curiosity and challenge their abilities to see what a difference\ncooking quality food can make in their lives.\nOur core product is the meal experience we help our customers create. These experiences extend from discovering new recipes, ingredients, and cooking\ntechniques to preparing meals with families and loved ones to sharing photos and stories of culinary triumphs. Central to these experiences are the original recipes\nwe design with fresh, seasonally-inspired produce and high-quality ingredients sent directly to our customers.\nCentral to our operations, we have developed an integrated network that employs technology and expertise across many disciplines. Our supply-demand\ncoordination activities – demand planning, recipe creation, procurement, recipe merchandising, fulfillment operations, distribution, customer service, and marketing\n– to drive our end-to-end value chain.\nWe currently offer our customers four weekly meal plans—a Two Serving Signature Plan, a Two-Serving Vegetarian Plan, a Two-Serving Wellness Plan,\nand a Four-Serving Signature Plan. In addition, each week, customers can add unlimited Add-ons recipes to each Order, which includes breakfast, appetizers, side\ndishes, desserts, à la carte proteins, and/or Heat & Eat meals, which are microwaveable meals ready in minutes.\nWe also sell wine, which can be paired with our meals or can be purchased à la carte, through Blue Apron Wine, our direct-to-consumer wine delivery\nservice. Through Blue Apron Market, our e-commerce market, we sell a curated selection of cooking tools, utensils, pantry items, and add-on products for different\nculinary occasions, which are tested in our test kitchen and recommended by our culinary team. Our products are available to purchase through our website, mobile\napp, and beginning in the second quarter of 2022, third-party sales platforms for our meal kit products.\nKey Financial and Operating Metrics\nWe use the following key financial and operating metrics to evaluate our business and operations, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our\nbusiness, project our future performance, and make strategic decisions.

We view Average\nRevenue per Customer as a key indicator of our customers’ purchasing patterns, including their repeat purchase behavior.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined by us as net income (loss) before interest income (expense), net, other operating expense,\ngain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, other income (expense), net, benefit (provision) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and share-based\ncompensation expense. We have presented adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management and board\nof directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital.\nIn particular, we believe that the exclusion of certain items in calculating adjusted EBITDA can produce a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our\nbusiness. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating our operating results. Please see “Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures” for a discussion of the use of non-GAAP financial measures and for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most\ndirectly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure defined by us as net cash from (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We\nhave presented free cash flow in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is used by our management and board of directors as an indicator of the amount of\ncash we generate or use and to evaluate our ability to satisfy current and future obligations and to fund future business opportunities. Accordingly, we believe that\nfree cash flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our\nability to satisfy our financial obligations and pursue business opportunities, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to a key financial metric used by our\nmanagement in their financial and operational decision-making. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have\ncertain non-discretionary obligations such as debt repayments and capital lease obligations that are not deducted from the measure. Additionally, other companies,\nincluding companies in our industry, may calculate free cash flow differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Please see “Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures” for a discussion of the use of non-GAAP financial measures and for a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash from (used in) operating\nactivities, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nImpact of COVID-19 on our Business\nBeginning in late March 2020, we experienced an increase in demand due in part to changes in consumer behaviors resulting from the various restrictions\nthat had been enacted throughout much of the United States in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As restrictions were lifted and as vaccines became more widely\navailable in the United States starting in the first half of 2021, and as people have resumed pre-pandemic activities, such as travel and dining out, the increased\ndemand due to the pandemic began to decline after the first quarter of 2021. We believe there is no continuing material impact on demand, if any, from the COVID-\n19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemics may have other adverse effects on our business, operations, and financial results and condition,\nincluding, among other things, as a result of adverse impacts on labor availability, our fulfillment center operations, supply chain and logistics disruptions, consumer\nbehaviors, and on the overall economy, including recent high inflation levels impacting consumer spending.\n50"

We use various online paid advertising channels (such as digital and social\nmedia and email), offline paid advertising channels (such as direct mail, television, and radio and podcasts), and strategic brand partnerships. We typically\ncomplement our paid advertising channels by offering promotional discounts to new customers for use on their first Order. We also attract new customers by word\nof mouth, including through our customer referral program, through which certain existing customers may invite others to receive a single complimentary meal kit\nbox.\nAs part of the execution of our strategic priorities, we significantly increased marketing expenses toward the end of the fourth quarter of 2021 and\nthroughout most of 2022 to drive customer acquisition with a deliberate focus on the marketing channels we believe to be the most efficient and customer segments\nthat demonstrate stronger affinity and retention. However, in December 2022, we identified multiple cost savings initiatives, including a plan for a meaningful\nreduction in marketing expenses in 2023. Our ability to increase marketing expenses in the future, is dependent upon our ability to receive the remaining $68.2\nmillion pursuant to the liquidity transactions (as defined below) with related parties, our ability to obtain additional funding from other sources, or raise additional\ncapital, including through the February 2023 ATM (as defined below) or otherwise, receive any cash proceeds from the disposition of the Pledged Collateral (as\ndefined below), as well as macroeconomic and other factors.\nIn addition to marketing, we continue to invest in our products, brand and overall customer experience, each of which further drives customer acquisition,\ncustomer retention and customer engagement and encourages repeat purchases. We also engage with our customers through social media, our website, blog, in-box\ncontent and mobile application, including through how-to videos and visual imagery, to deepen our customers’ connection with our brand. Our flexible platform\nallows customers to interact with us by either actively managing or passively receiving orders, and we believe this flexibility drives higher customer engagement,\nloyalty and retention over the long term. Our ability to efficiently acquire new customers, retain existing customers and drive customer engagement through\nmarketing investment and other business initiatives significantly impacts our revenue and results of operations. For example, in order to maintain compliance with\nthe financial covenants under our senior secured notes, we have reduced marketing expenditures and may be required to further reduce marketing expenditures,\nwhich would negatively impact revenue, our strategy, and our business. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further discussion.\nProduct Offerings\nOur ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products impacts our revenue and results of operations. We make ongoing changes to our\nproducts intended to enhance the customer experience and strive to offer our customers a balanced mix of ingredients, cuisines, familiarity, discovery, and\npreparation times. To accommodate various customer lifestyles, we currently offer four weekly meal plans - a Two-Serving Signature Plan, a Two-Serving\nVegetarian Plan, a Two-Serving Wellness Plan, and a Four-Serving Signature Plan for our meals, each with flexibility in recipe selection. We are focused on offering\na variety of choices every week, including a range of recipes designed for a healthy lifestyle so that customers can make selections based on their individual\nhousehold needs and preferences.\nCustomers have the option to customize some of their recipe selections, such as the ability to upgrade a protein for a more premium protein, replace a meat\nwith a plant protein, or increase the serving size from two to four. We also offer Premium recipes, including our Craft offering, that introduce our customers to\nspecialty protein combinations, advanced culinary techniques, and unique flavor twists. In addition, customers can add unlimited Add-ons recipes to each Order,\nwhich includes breakfast, appetizers, side dishes or desserts, à la carte proteins and / or Heat & Eat meals, which are pre-made meals ready to heat and eat in\nminutes.\nWe are also focused on brand extensions that are complementary to our meal experience, such as Blue Apron Wine and Blue Apron Market. We sell\nseasonally-inspired occasion-based offerings throughout the year consisting of multiple recipes for 6-8 people, which we sell both on our subscription meal plan,\nalong with the Blue Apron Market and third-party e-commerce channels.

Our customers’ choices from among our\nproduct offerings will impact our revenue and results of operations, and as we introduce additional products and increase flexibility in our existing products, our\ncustomers’ behavior and engagement with us may change.\nOperational Execution\nOur ability to effectively coordinate supply and demand and execute across our end-to-end value chain impacts our customer experience and our operating\nresults. We begin by working with our suppliers, often months in advance of creating our menus. We then continue to forecast demand as well as monitor and\nevaluate our expected supply of ingredients, retaining flexibility to finalize recipes in the weeks leading up to fulfillment. As of December 31, 2022, we operated\ntwo technology-enabled, refrigerated fulfillment centers that collectively employed approximately 78% employees. Each fulfillment center includes an operation\nthat portions ingredients into exact quantities for each week’s recipes using a combination of automated methods, manual labor, and warehousing, packaging, and\nshipping operations. We utilize a company-managed, third party delivery network that optimizes outbound logistics, including packing materials and the choice of\ncarrier, on a ZIP code by ZIP code basis to ensure cost-effective, timely, and safe delivery of our orders.\nCapital Investment to Support our Strategic Initiatives\nOur strategic investments in our fulfillment center operations will continue to significantly impact our ability to successfully execute on our strategic\npriorities, introduce new products, increase variety to customers, and create efficiencies in our cost structure. We made significant investments to scale our\noperations and support the expansion of our business, including the build-out of our fulfillment center in Linden, New Jersey which we completed in 2017, which\nhave contributed to meaningful efficiencies in our fulfillment operations. In the future, to the extent we are able to raise sufficient capital, we plan to further invest\nin capital expenditures primarily related to executing our strategic priorities and to further optimize and drive efficiency in our operations and capitalized software\ncosts.\nSeasonality\nWe experience seasonality in our business that impacts the level at which customers engage with our products and brand and our quarterly results of\noperations. We anticipate that the first quarter of each year will generally represent our strongest quarter in terms of customer engagement. Conversely, during the\nsummer months and the end of year holidays, when people are vacationing more often or have less predictable weekly routines, we generally anticipate lower\ncustomer engagement. In 2020, the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic masked, in part, the seasonal fluctuations in our operating results as we\nsaw our strongest quarter in the second quarter of 2020. We believe that historical seasonal trends have affected and will continue to affect our quarterly results in\nthe future. However, we cannot predict any future impact of the COVID-19 or other pandemics or other macroeconomic factors, such as inflation, may have on\nseasonality in future periods as we saw a return to normal seasonality in 2021 and 2022. Our marketing strategies, which we significantly increased in the fourth\nquarter of 2021 and throughout most of 2022, but which we reduced in December 2022 and plan to significantly reduce in 2023, will also impact our quarterly\nresults of operations.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nNet Revenue\nWe generate net revenue primarily from the sale of meals to customers through our Two‑Serving and Four-Serving Plans, as well as our Add-On, premium,\nand customization and other up-sell offerings. We also generate net revenue through sales of Blue Apron Wine, sales on Blue Apron Market, sales of meal kits on\nthird-party sales platforms, and to a more limited extent, through enterprise bulk sales on an ad hoc basis. We generally derive substantially all of our net revenue\nfrom sales of our meal kit boxes through our direct-to-consumer platform. We deduct promotional discounts, actual customer credits and refunds as well as\ncustomer credits and refunds expected to be issued to determine net revenue. Customers who receive a damaged meal or wine order or are dissatisfied with a meal\nor wine order and contact us within seven days of receipt of the order may receive a full or partial refund, full or partial credit against future purchase, or\nreplacement, at our sole discretion. Credits only remain available for customers who maintain a valid account with us. Customers who return an unused, undamaged\nBlue Apron Market product within 30 days of receipt receive a full refund.\nOur business is seasonal in nature and, as a result, our revenue and expenses and associated revenue trends fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We anticipate\nthat the first quarter of each year will generally represent our strongest\n52"

Conversely, during the summer months and the end of year holidays, when people are vacationing more often or have less\npredictable weekly routines, we generally anticipate lower customer engagement. However, seasonal trends may be masked and impacted by marketing\ninvestments. In 2020, the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic masked, in part, the seasonal fluctuations in our operating results as we saw our\nstrongest quarter in the second quarter of 2020. We believe that historical seasonal trends have affected and will continue to affect our quarterly results in the future.\nHowever, we cannot predict any future impact, if any, that pandemics, such as COVID-19 or other macroeconomic factors, such as inflation, or our marketing\ninvestment levels, may have on seasonality in future periods and we saw a return to normal seasonality starting in 2021 and more so in 2022. We also anticipate that\nour net revenue will be impacted by the execution of strategic priorities, including our ability to develop and execute product expansion initiatives, pricing updates,\nas well as the timing and extent of the sale and issuance of gift cards and the associated revenue upon the redemption of those gift cards, which generally occurs\nwithin one year of gift card issuance. Net revenue will also be impacted by gift card breakage revenue, which is our estimate of the portion of our gift card balance\nnot expected to be redeemed. During 2022, we entered into various agreements and amendments to such agreements with related parties under which we ultimately\nagreed to issue $27.5 million (net of promotional discounts) of gift cards, which may result in higher levels of gift card breakage revenue and which may inflate net\nrevenue or mask seasonal trends in future periods. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, $12.7 million of gift card proceeds from the related party\nhave not been funded and no gift cards have yet been issued against those funds. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K for further discussion.\nIn addition, our net revenue is impacted by our marketing strategies, including the timing and amount of paid advertising and promotional activity. As part\nof the execution of our strategic priorities using the proceeds from the 2021 Capital Raise (as defined below) that closed in November 2021, we significantly\nincreased marketing expenses toward the end of the fourth quarter of 2021 and throughout most of 2022. However, in December 2022, we announced that we were\nfocused on driving towards profitability in the future and plan to significantly reduce marketing expenses in 2023, which is expected to negatively impact customers\nand net revenue in 2023. Our ability to grow net revenue and to continue to increase marketing expenses in the future, is dependent upon our ability to receive the\nremaining $68.2 million pursuant to the liquidity transactions (as defined below) with related parties or our ability to obtain additional funding from other sources or\nraise additional capital, including through our February 2023 ATM (as defined below) or otherwise, or receive any cash proceeds from the disposition of the Pledged\nCollateral (as defined below).\nCredit card charges are recorded in deferred revenue until the criteria for revenue recognition have been met. Because we generally charge credit cards in\nadvance of shipment and, historically, customers have most frequently requested delivery of their meals earlier in the week, our deferred revenue balance at the end\nof a financial reporting period may fluctuate significantly based on the day of the week on which that period ends. Consequently, large changes in deferred revenue\nat any particular time are not meaningful indicators of our financial results or future net revenue trends.\nCost of Goods Sold, excluding Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization, consists of product and fulfillment costs. Product costs include the cost of food, packaging for\nfood that is portioned prior to delivery to customers, labor and related personnel costs incurred to portion food for our meals, inbound shipping costs, and cost of\nproducts sold through Blue Apron Wine and Blue Apron Market. Fulfillment costs consist of costs incurred in the shipping and handling of inventory including the\nshipping costs to our customers, labor and related personnel costs related to receiving, inspecting, warehousing, picking inventory, and preparing customer orders\nfor shipment, and the cost of packaging materials and shipping supplies. As noted above, our business is seasonal in nature and, as a result we anticipate that the\nthird quarter of each year will generally reflect higher levels of cost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization, due to higher packaging and shipping\ncosts due to warmer temperatures. In the near-term we expect that these expenses will be higher due to higher labor costs, including our minimum wage increase for\nhourly employees in the fourth quarter of 2021, to help recruit and retain fulfillment center employees, higher food costs, due in part to inflationary pressures,\nhigher fuel and logistics costs, and ongoing investments in product innovation to provide product variety, flexibility, and additional choice for our customers. Over\ntime, we expect such expenses to decrease as a percentage of net revenue as we continue to focus on operational improvements and optimizing our fulfillment\ncenter operations.\nMarketing\nOur marketing expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to acquire new customers, retain existing customers, and build our brand awareness through\nvarious online and offline paid channels, including digital and social media, television, direct mail, radio and podcasts, email, brand activations, and certain variable\nand fixed payments to strategic brand partnerships. Also included in marketing expenses are the costs of orders through our customer referral program, in which\ncertain existing customers may invite others to receive a complimentary meal kit, as well as costs paid to third parties to market our products. The cost of the\ncustomer referral program is based on our costs incurred for fulfilling a complimentary meal delivery, including product and fulfillment costs.\n53"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nAs part of the execution of our strategic priorities in prior periods, we increased marketing expenses toward the end of the fourth quarter of 2021 and\nthroughout most of 2022. However, in December 2022, we determined to significantly reduce marketing expenditures, and we expect marketing expenses to\ndecrease meaningfully, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenue in 2023 compared to 2022, as we prioritize profitability and marketing efficiency.\nOur ability to continue to have higher marketing expenses in the future, is dependent upon our ability to receive the remaining $68.2 million pursuant to the liquidity\ntransactions (as defined below) with related parties, our ability to obtain additional funding from other sources, or raise additional capital, including from our\nFebruary 2023 ATM (as defined below), or receive any cash proceeds from the disposition of the Pledged Collateral (as defined below). We anticipate that our\nmarketing strategies, including the timing and extent of our marketing investments, will be informed by the sufficiency of our cash resources, our strategic priorities,\nour ability to execute on our strategic priorities, the seasonal trends in our business, our marketing technology capabilities, and the competitive landscape of our\nmarket, and will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and have a significant impact on our quarterly results of operations. We also anticipate that our future marketing\nstrategies and investments may continue to be impacted by macroeconomic and other factors. For example, we may further reduce marketing expenditures in future\nperiods if we experience heightened demand in a short period of time to help us manage unforeseen demand to alleviate any future capacity constraints.\nProduct, Technology, General and Administrative\nProduct, technology, general and administrative expenses consist of costs related to the development of our products and technology, general and\nadministrative expenses, and overhead expenses, which include: payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the application, production, and\nmaintenance of our platform and other technology infrastructure costs; payroll and related expenses for employees performing corporate and other managerial\nfunctions; facilities’ costs such as occupancy and rent costs for our corporate offices and fulfillment centers; professional fees; payment processing fees; carbon\noffsets, and other general corporate and administrative costs. We expect these expenses to decrease in absolute dollars in 2023 compared to 2022, as we realize\nsavings from the corporate workforce reduction announced in December 2022 and continue to focus on expense management.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization consists of depreciation expense for our property and equipment and amortization expense for capitalized software\ndevelopment costs.\nOther Operating Expense\nOther operating expense consists of a non-cash gain, net of a termination fee, on the Fairfield lease termination (as defined in Note 10 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), impairment losses on long-lived assets, charges for estimated legal settlements, and restructuring costs\nrelated to the Arlington, Texas facility closure in 2020 and the corporate workforce reduction in December 2022.\nGain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt\nGain (loss) on extinguishment of debt relates to the extinguishment loss recorded upon the amendment of the 2020 Term Loan in May 2021 and the\nextinguishment gain recorded upon the termination of the financing agreement with Blue Torch Finance LLC (\"Blue Torch\") in May 2022.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income (expense), net consists primarily of interest expense on our outstanding borrowings, capital and finance lease costs, and build-to-suit lease\nfinancings partially offset by interest income on cash and cash equivalents balances.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists of the change in fair value of the Blue Torch warrant obligation upon remeasurement as of each reporting period, as\nwell as the gain recorded upon its derecognition.\nBenefit (Provision) for Income Taxes\nOur benefit (provision) for income taxes and our effective tax rates are affected by permanent differences between GAAP and statutory tax laws, certain\none-time items, and the impact of valuation allowances. For each of the years ending December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our benefit (provision) for income taxes\nwas $(0.0) million, resulting in an effective\n54"

As a percentage of net revenue, income (loss) from operations\nwas (15.1)% and (8.4)% for 2021 and 2020, respectively. This increase was primarily driven by increases as a percentage of net revenue in marketing expenses, cost\nof goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization, and product, technology, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by decreases as a percentage\nof net revenue in other operating expense and depreciation and amortization, for the reasons set forth above.\nGain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt\nGain (loss) on extinguishment of debt for 2021 and 2020 was $(4.1) million and $0.0 million, respectively.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology\nprescribed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and are not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other\ncompanies.\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest income (expense), net, other operating expense, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt,\nother income (expense), net, benefit (provision) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and share-based compensation expense. We have presented\nadjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our\noperating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, we believe that the exclusion\nof certain items in calculating adjusted EBITDA can produce a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business.\n61"

We believe adjusted EBITDA helps identify\nunderlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA\nprovides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past\nperformance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by our management in its financial and\noperational decision-making.\nOur adjusted EBITDA is not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of adjusted EBITDA rather than net income (loss), which is the most directly\ncomparable GAAP equivalent. Some of these limitations are:\n•\nadjusted EBITDA excludes share-based compensation expense, as share-based compensation expense has recently been, and will continue to be for the\nforeseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;\n•\nadjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated may have\nto be replaced in the future;\n•\nadjusted EBITDA excludes other operating expense, as other operating expense represents non-cash impairment charges on long-lived assets, a non-\ncash gain, net of a termination fee, on a lease termination, charges for estimated legal settlements, and restructuring costs;\n•\nadjusted EBITDA excludes gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, as these primarily represent non-cash accounting adjustments;\n•\nadjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest, which reduces cash available to us;\n•\nadjusted EBITDA does not reflect other (income) expense, net as this represents changes in the fair value of the Blue Torch warrant obligation as of\neach reporting period, which must be settled either in cash, which would have harmed our liquidity, or our Class A common shares, which would have\nresulted in dilution to our stockholders;\n•\nadjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax payments that reduce cash available to us; and\n•\nother companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative\nmeasure.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash from (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We have presented free cash flow in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K because it is used by our management and board of directors as an indicator of the amount of cash we generate or use and to evaluate\nour ability to satisfy current and future obligations and to fund future business opportunities. Accordingly, we believe that free cash flow provides useful\ninformation to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our ability to satisfy our financial\nobligations and pursue business opportunities, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to a key financial metric used by our management in their financial\nand operational decision-making.\nOur free cash flow is not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of free cash flow rather than net cash from (used in) operating activities, which is the\nmost directly comparable GAAP equivalent. Some of these limitations are:\n•\nfree cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt\nrepayments and capital lease obligations that are not deducted from the measure; and\n•\nother companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate free cash flow differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these limitations, we consider, and you should consider, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow together with other financial information\npresented in accordance with GAAP.

The RJB Purchase Agreement provided for, among other things, 3,333,333 shares of Class A common stock for\nan aggregate purchase price of $40.0 million (or $12.00 per share). An affiliate of Joseph N. Sanberg was assigned RJB’s rights to 1,666,667 shares of Class A\ncommon stock for an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 million under the RJB Purchase Agreement, which was issued and sold concurrently with the execution of\nthe purchase agreement (the “first closing”). The remainder of the Class A common shares under the RJB Purchase Agreement were to be issued and sold under a\nsecond closing, initially expected to close by May 30, 2022 or such other date as agreed to by the parties.\nIn addition, on April 29, 2022, we entered into a purchase agreement with Linda Findley, one of our directors and our President and Chief Executive\nOfficer, under which we agreed to issue and sell to Ms. Findley in a separate private placement, which closed concurrently with the execution of the first closing,\n41,666 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $0.5 million (or $12.00 per share) (the “Findley Private Placement”).\nThe first closing of the RJB Purchase Agreement and the Findley Private Placement (collectively, the “April 2022 Private Placements”) resulted in $20.1\nmillion of proceeds, net of issuance costs.\nWe used the net proceeds of the April 2022 Private Placements to support the execution of our strategic priorities and for other working capital and general\ncorporate purposes.\nOn August 7, 2022, we amended the RJB Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which RJB agreed to purchase from us (i) the 1,666,667 shares of Class A\ncommon stock under the initial RJB Purchase Agreement at a price of $5.00 per share, instead of a price of $12.00 per share, and (ii) an additional 8,333,333 shares\nof Class A common stock at a price of $5.00 per share (the “RJB Second Closing”). Upon execution, the RJB Second Closing comprised in the aggregate a purchase\nprice of $50.0 million and 10,000,000 shares of Class A common stock in total, as well as agreeing to extend the date of the second closing to on or before August\n31, 2022. In addition, pursuant to the amendment, Joseph N.

Because the Outstanding Obligated Amount remained unpaid\nafter November 30, 2022, we are permitted to exercise remedies in respect to the Pledged Shares, including foreclosing on the Pledged Shares.\nOn December 14, 2022, pursuant to the RJB Purchase Agreement, we issued and sold 176,991 shares of Class A common stock to the Pledgor for an\naggregate purchase price of $1.0 million (or $5.65 per share), resulting in $0.6 million of proceeds, net of issuance costs. As of the date of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K, the remaining $55.5 million of the Outstanding Obligated Amount remains unfunded.\nBecause the Pledged Entities are privately held companies, there is no public trading market for the Pledged Shares. As a result, the value of the Pledged\nShares could have been less than the Outstanding Obligated Amount, and, if we seek to foreclose upon the Pledged Shares to satisfy the Pledgor’s obligation to pay\nthe Outstanding Obligated Amount, the proceeds of any private sale of the Pledged Shares, to the extent any such private sale is permissible and effected subject to\nregulatory and contractual limitations that may apply, may be less than could be obtained from a sale in a public trading market and may be less than the\nOutstanding Obligated Amount.\n64"

Prior to the note purchase agreement\namendment the senior secured notes amortized semi-annually in equal installments of $1.5 million beginning on December 31, 2025, with the remaining unpaid\nprincipal amount of the senior secured notes due on May 5, 2027.\nThe note purchase agreement contains two financial maintenance covenants:\n•\na minimum liquidity covenant of:\ni.\nfor any date prior to or ending on June 30, 2022, including those within required cash flow forecasts provided to the noteholders, $15.0 million;\nand\nii.\nprior to the note purchase agreement amendment (as described above) for any date thereafter, including those within required 13-week cash flow\nforecasts provided to the noteholders:\n•\n$15.0 million if our most recent Asset Valuation (as defined in the note purchase agreement) is greater than $25.0 million;\n•\n$20.0 million if our most recent Asset Valuation is greater than $20.0 million but less than $25.0 million; or\n•\n$25.0 million if our most recent Asset Valuation is less than or equal to $20.0 million, or is as of yet uncompleted; and\n•\na covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum Asset Coverage Ratio (as described below) of at least 1.25 to 1.00.\nAs a result of the initial Asset Valuation completed on August 31, 2022, and the most recent Asset Valuation completed on January 30, 2023, the minimum\nliquidity covenant was set at $25.0 million as of December 31, 2022. Subsequent to the initial report, the Asset Valuation is required to be provided to the\nnoteholders no later than 30 days after June 30 and December 31 of each fiscal year. Under the note purchase agreement amendment, the noteholder agreed to\nreduce the minimum liquidity covenant amount to $17.5 million following the first amortization payment in connection with the signing of the note purchase\nagreement amendment and to $10.0 million following the first and second amortization payments until the senior secured notes are repaid in full.\nThe Asset Coverage Ratio is measured as of each quarter-end, and represents the ratio of (a) the aggregate amount of Adjusted Eligible Collateral (as\ndefined within the note purchase agreement) to (b) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the senior secured notes at such time.\nWe have also agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause 90% of the packaging for our meal kit boxes to be recyclable, reusable, or\ncompostable (the “ESG KPI Goal”); the failure to achieve the ESG KPI Goal prior to the date on which the senior secured notes are repaid will require us to pay a\nfee equal to 1% of the principal amount of the senior secured notes. Conditioned upon the timely payment of all the amortization payments, the noteholder agreed to\nwaive the ESG KPI Fee under the note purchase agreement amendment.\nThe note purchase agreement contains additional restrictive covenants and affirmative and financial reporting covenants restricting our and our\nsubsidiaries’ activities. Restrictive covenants include limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness and liens, restrictions on affiliate transactions, restrictions on the\nsale or other disposition of collateral, and limitations on dividends and stock repurchases.\nTotal outstanding debt, net of debt issuance costs and issued letters of credit outstanding were $27.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively, as of December\n31, 2022, and $29.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2021.

However, our noteholder has alleged that we were in default with respect to certain prior events related to the Pledge Agreement or\namendments to the RJB Purchase Agreement made without their consent. We dispute that any such defaults existed or exist, but to the extent that such defaults did\nexist, we have received a waiver from our noteholder pursuant to the note purchase agreement amendment.\nSilicon Valley Bank\nOn March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as receiver. SVB’s deposits are insured by the FDIC in amounts up to $250,000 for each deposit account.\nSubstantially all of our cash and cash equivalents are held in four SVB deposit accounts and substantially all of which was not insured by the FDIC (the “uninsured\namount). On March 12, 2023, the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC announced that SVB depositors will have access to all of their money, including the\nuninsured amount, starting March 13, 2023. Starting on March 13, 2023, we regained full access to all of our cash and cash equivalents.\nKnown Liquidity Trends\nManagement considered conditions and events that could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within twelve months of\nthe issuance date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and considered our current financial condition and liquidity sources, including current funds available,\nforecasted future cash flows, and our conditional and unconditional obligations before such date.\nWe have a history of significant net losses, including $109.7 million, $88.4 million and $46.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and\n2020, respectively, and operating cash flows of $(91.6) million, $(49.0) million and $(5.4) million for each of the years ending December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. Our current operating plan indicates we will continue to incur net losses and generate negative cash flows from operating activities.\nIn addition to the financing transactions discussed above, on May 5, 2022, we entered into a gift card sponsorship agreement (the “Sponsorship Gift Cards\nAgreement”) with an affiliate of Joseph N. Sanberg, pursuant to which such affiliate agreed to pay us a $20.0 million net sponsorship fee to support a marketing\nprogram through which we will distribute gift cards, at our sole discretion, in order to support our previous growth strategy. On August 7, 2022, we amended the\nSponsorship Gift Cards Agreement to extend the funding date to on or before August 31, 2022, and pursuant to which, Joseph N. Sanberg personally guaranteed his\naffiliate’s obligation.\nOn September 7, 2022, the Sponsorship Gift Cards Agreement was further amended to reduce the net sponsorship fee to $18.5 million and extend its due\ndate to September 19, 2022. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Sanberg affiliate has paid $5.8 million of its commitment under this agreement\nwith $12.7 million remaining to be paid.\nAs we have agreed, under the note purchase agreement amendment, to repay our outstanding indebtedness in full by the end of the second quarter of 2023,\nif we do not receive the remaining amounts owed to us under the RJB Second Closing and the Sponsorship Gift Cards Agreement (collectively, the “liquidity\ntransactions”), and if we are unable to raise any additional capital, including in connection with the February 2023 ATM or receive any cash proceeds from the\ndisposition of the Pledged Collateral, our forecast of future cash flows indicates that such cash flows would not be sufficient to meet our current obligations as early\nas June 2023.\nWhile management was able to obtain personal guarantees from Joseph N. Sanberg relating to his affiliates’ obligations to fund the liquidity transactions\nvia the executed amendments above, as well as the Pledged Shares from the Pledgor, there is no assurance that the liquidity transactions will be consummated in a\ntimely manner, or that we will be able to sell the Pledged Shares in amounts that are sufficient to meet our obligations as they become due, or on terms acceptable to\nus, or at all.\nAlthough we have been reviewing a number of potential alternatives regarding our liquidity, including identified and to be identified cost reduction\ninitiatives, monetizing the Pledged Shares, and/or securing alternative sources for additional financing, such alternatives may not be achievable on favorable\nconditions, or at all, and these conditions and events in the aggregate raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition to the\nforegoing, we may also seek to pursue and execute financing opportunities, a business combination or other strategic transaction.\n68"

Cash paid for capital expenditures in\n2020 was primarily driven by acquisition of fixed assets and development of software to support business initiatives and ongoing product expansion.\nNet Cash from (used in) Financing Activities\nNet cash from (used in) financing activities primarily relates to proceeds from issuances of Class A common stock, net borrowings and repayments of debt,\npayments of debt issuance costs, proceeds from exercises of stock options, and principal payments on capital lease obligations.\nIn 2022, net cash from (used in) financing activities was $49.1 million and consisted primarily of the net proceeds relating to our debt, equity, and warrant\nissuances, partially offset by repayments of debt and payments of debt and equity issuance costs.\nIn 2021, net cash from (used in) financing activities was $90.4 million and consisted primarily of $99.6 million of the net proceeds from equity and warrant\nissuances and the deemed receipt of funds held in escrow relating to the amendment of the 2020 Term Loan in May 2021, partially offset by the release back to the\nlenders of the funds held in escrow relating to the amendment of the 2020 Term Loan, repayments of debt, payments of debt and equity issuance costs, and principal\npayments on capital lease obligations.\nIn 2020, net cash from (used in) financing activities was $10.5 million and consisted primarily of $33.0 million of proceeds from our senior secured term\nloan, net of debt issuance costs, $32.9 million of proceeds from the public offering of Class A common stock, net of offering costs, and $0.5 million of proceeds\nfrom the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $55.6 million of repayments of all outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, and principal\npayments on capital lease obligations.

As required by the\nNYSE, on January 6, 2023, we notified the NYSE of our intent to cure the deficiency and restore our compliance with the NYSE continued listing standards. In\naccordance with applicable NYSE procedures, on February 6, 2023, we submitted a plan advising the NYSE of the definitive actions we have taken and are taking,\nthat would bring us into compliance with the NYSE continued listing standards within 18 months of receipt of the written notice. On February 28, 2023, the NYSE\naccepted the plan and our Class A common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE during the 18-month period from December 21, 2022, subject to\nour compliance with other NYSE continued listing standards and continued periodic review by the NYSE of our progress with respect to our plan.\n70"

We are\nclosely monitoring the closing share price of our Class A common stock and are considering all available options. We intend to regain compliance with the NYSE\nlisting standards by pursing measures that are in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders, which could include seeking to effect a reverse stock\nsplit.\nThere can be no assurance that we regain compliance with either of the above-mentioned NYSE continued listing standards. Any potential delisting of our\nClass A common stock from the NYSE would likely result in decreased liquidity and increased volatility for our Class A common stock and would adversely affect\nour ability to raise additional capital or enter into strategic transactions. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not yet regained compliance\nwith either of the above-mentioned NYSE continued listing standards.\nContractual Obligations\nDebt\nAs of December 31, 2022, the remaining principal payments required under our senior secured notes were $30.0 million. The senior secured notes will\namortize in four equal installments of $7.5 million, with the first installment paid in connection with the signing of the note purchase agreement amendment, and the\nfinal installment due on June 15, 2023. Following the note purchase agreement amendment, the remaining interest payments required under our senior secured notes\nare $0.9 million, which are due in connection with the amortization payments. For additional information, refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Debt\nfinancing transactions” above.\nLeases\nWe lease fulfillment centers and office space under non-cancelable operating lease arrangements that expire on various dates through 2027, including non-\ncancelable operating leases for office space in New York City, New York and Austin, Texas, currently occupied fulfillment centers in Linden, New Jersey and\nRichmond, California, and a previously occupied fulfillment centers in Arlington, Texas and Jersey City, New Jersey. We also have various non-cancelable operating\nleases for certain equipment. As of December 31, 2022, we had lease payment obligations of $42.3 million, of which $13.2 million is payable within 12 months.\nWe have also entered into agreements to sublease portions of our corporate offices and fulfillment centers. The subleases continue through the duration of\nour existing leases for each location and entitle us to future minimum sublease payments of $4.7 million as of December 31, 2022, of which $2.6 million is\nreceivable within 12 months.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities that are reported in the consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying disclosures. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential\nimpact on our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nTherefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Accordingly, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results\nmay differ from these estimates and assumptions. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about\nthese critical accounting policies, as well as a description of our other accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe primarily generate revenue from the sale of our products to customers, including meals, wine and kitchen tools, and through enterprise bulk sales on an\nad hoc basis. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we derived substantially all of our Net revenue from sales of our meals.\nOur revenue contracts represent a single performance obligation to sell our products to our customers. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control,\nincluding passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to the products, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to.\nIn general, we charge credit cards in\n71"

Sales taxes imposed on our sales are presented on a net basis in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations, and therefore do not impact Net revenue or Cost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization.\nWe deduct promotional discounts, actual customer credits and refunds as well as credits and refunds expected to be issued to determine Net revenue.\nCustomers who receive a damaged meal or wine order or are dissatisfied with an order and contact us within seven days of receipt of the order may receive a full or\npartial refund, full or partial credit against future purchase, or replacement, at our sole discretion. Credits only remain available for customers who maintain a valid\naccount with us. Customers who return an unused, undamaged Blue Apron Market product within 30 days of receipt receive a full refund. We estimate and record\nexpected credits and refunds based on prior history, recent trends, and projections for credits and refunds on sales in the current period. Reserves for credits and\nrefunds are included within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe periodically enter into agreements with third parties to market our products. We record revenue from such arrangements at the gross amount as we are\nthe principal in these arrangements as we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the goods to customers, provide primary customer service for such products sold on\nits website, have latitude in establishing price and selecting such products sold on our website, and maintain inventory risk.\nWe have two types of contractual liabilities: (i) cash collections from our customers prior to delivery of products purchased, which are included in Deferred\nrevenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are recognized as revenue upon transfer of control of our products, and (ii) unredeemed gift cards and other\nprepaid orders, which are included in Deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are recognized as revenue when gift cards are redeemed and the\nproducts are delivered. Certain gift cards are not expected to be redeemed, also known as breakage, and are recognized as revenue over the expected redemption\nperiod, subject to requirements to remit balances to governmental agencies.\nInventories, Net\nInventories, net consist primarily of bulk and prepped food, products available for resale, packaging, containers, and wine products which are stated at the\nlower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory costs consist of product costs, inbound shipping and handling costs, and applicable direct labor costs. Inventories are\nvalued on a first-in, first-out cost basis. We record an inventory valuation reserve when applicable, based on currently available information, about the likely method\nof disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, donations or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each inventory category. For the years\nended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the inventory valuation reserve was $0.2 million, $0.4 million, and $0.3 million, respectively.\nLeases\nAt the inception of an arrangement, we determine whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present.\nLeases are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, lease obligations and, if applicable, long-term lease obligations. Lease\nobligations and their corresponding ROU assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term. As the interest rate implicit\nin lease contracts is typically not readily determinable, we utilize the appropriate incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized\nbasis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Certain adjustments to the ROU asset may be required for items\nsuch as initial direct costs paid or incentives received. The lease term may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will\nexercise that option. The components of a lease should be split into three categories: lease components, including land, building, or other similar components; non-\nlease components, including common area maintenance, maintenance, consumables, or other similar components; and non-components, including property taxes,\ninsurance, or other similar components. However, we have elected to combine lease and non-lease components as a single component. The lease expense is\nrecognized over the expected term on a straight-line basis.\nShare-Based Payments\nWe recognize share-based compensation for share-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock units, based on the estimated fair value of the\nawards, on a straight-line basis over the period in which the employee is required to provide services, generally up to four years.\nIn February 2022, we granted 247,161 shares of performance-based restricted stock units for our Class A common stock to certain employees, including\nour executive officers. Such units are subject to vesting conditions that are tied to the performance of our stock price relative to the performance of a peer group of\npublicly traded companies’ stock price over a\n72"

As this grant was determined to include a market condition, we utilized the Monte\nCarlo simulation valuation model to value the grant. The total grant date fair value was $1.3 million, and will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nperformance period of three years.\nIn February 2021, we granted 1,190,250 shares of performance-based restricted stock units for our Class A common stock to certain employees, including\nour executive officers. Such units are subject to vesting conditions that are tied to the achievement of certain stock price targets and time-based requirements\nbeginning February 25, 2021 and continuing through February 25, 2024. As this grant was determined to include a market condition, we utilized the Monte Carlo\nsimulation valuation model to value the grant. The total grant date fair value was $7.7 million, and will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the derived\nservice periods, which range from 0.99 to 2.99 years, as determined by the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model.\nIn 2020, we did not grant any performance stock units.\nWarrant Obligation\nThe Blue Torch warrant obligation in conjunction with the Amendment, as discussed in “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Debt financing transactions”\nabove, was accounted for in accordance with ASC 815-40, Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, as a liability recognized at fair value, and was remeasured as of\neach balance sheet date with changes in fair value recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The amount of each\nwarrant to be issued under the obligation set forth in the financing agreement was based upon 0.50% of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully-\ndiluted basis on the first day of each quarter beginning on or after July 1, 2021, so long as the 2020 Term Loan remained outstanding. As such, the fair value of the\nBlue Torch warrant obligation was calculated using the estimated amount of warrants to be issued over the life of the financing agreement multiplied by the closing\nprice of our stock as of the balance sheet date, less $0.01 per share to represent each warrant’s exercise price. The estimated amount of shares to be issued was\nderived from our estimate of shares of our common stock on a fully-diluted basis over the life of the financing agreement.\nOn May 5, 2022, we fully repaid the 2020 Term Loan with the proceeds of our senior secured notes and cash on hand and terminated our financing\nagreement with Blue Torch effective as of the same date, which also resulted in the termination of the warrant obligation. As of May 5, 2022, all warrants that had\nbeen issued under the Blue Torch warrant obligation had been exercised in full, resulting in no liability-classified warrants outstanding.\nIn 2022, we recorded a non-cash gain in Other income (expense) of $2.0 million in our Statement of Operations resulting from the change in the fair value\nof the Blue Torch warrant obligation upon remeasurement as of each reporting period, as well as the gain recognized upon derecognition. In 2021, we recorded a\nnon-cash loss in Other income (expense) of $(5.0) million in our Statement of Operations resulting from the change in the fair value of the Blue Torch warrant\nobligation upon remeasurement as of each reporting period.\nRecoverability of Long-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs. We periodically evaluate whether events and\ncircumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be\nrecoverable. These factors may include a significant deterioration of operating results, changes in business plans, or changes in anticipated cash flows.\nRecoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the\nasset and its eventual disposition, where applicable. If future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment is recognized in earnings to\nthe extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value. In determining future cash flows, we use industry accepted valuation models and engage third party valuation\nspecialists, as needed. When multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately. In addition to the recoverability assessment, we\nroutinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets. If we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining balance\nwould be depreciated over the revised estimated useful life.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no impairments of long-lived assets. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded\nimpairment charges of $7.6 million in Other operating expense on long-lived assets related to our Arlington, Texas fulfillment center. See Note 7 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\n73"

If the\nreasonable estimate of the loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate, the minimum amount of the range is recorded as a liability. If a\nprobable loss is not reasonably estimable, or we determine that a loss is reasonably possible, but not probable, we disclose the matter, and the amount or range of the\npossible losses, if estimable, in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we had accruals of $0.0 million, $0.0\nmillion, and $1.1 million in Other operating expense for estimated legal settlements for which we concluded the loss was probable and reasonably possible.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information about recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nWe are a “smaller reporting company,” as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide information under\nthis item.\nITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\nThe information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the financial statements set forth in Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement\nSchedule.”\nITEM 9.    CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nNone.\nITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, as defined by Rules 13a-15€ and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2022. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective\nas of December 31, 2022 at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weakness described below.\nNotwithstanding the ineffective disclosure controls and procedures as a result of the identified material weakness, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim\nChief Financial Officer have concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting\nis defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and\nprincipal financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those\npolicies and procedures that:\n•\npertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the\n74"

Therefore, even those systems\ndetermined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, our\nmanagement used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework\n(2013). Based on its assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to\nthe material weakness described below.\nMaterial Weakness\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility\nthat a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified a material\nweakness in our information technology general controls and IT dependent controls related to revenue and inventory. Our manage access information technology\ngeneral controls over certain key IT systems were not designed and did not operate effectively. Specifically, user access recertifications were not complete and\nprecise to validate permissions granted to the user/system account continue to be appropriate. As a result of these deficiencies, the related process-level IT\ndependent manual and automated application controls could not be relied upon. As a result, we did not have effective controls over the completeness and accuracy\nof data used to support accounts related to the revenue and inventory processes.\nIn order to remediate this material weakness, we are implementing the following measures:\n•\nProviding training of internal controls to key stakeholders within the IT process\n•\nEnhancing user access review procedures to ensure completeness and precision around user access permission validations\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included below.\nAttestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe attestation report of the independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nis included below under the heading “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.”\nPreviously Identified Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nNone.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nExcept as disclosed above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules\n13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.    OTHER INFORMATION.\nNone.\n75"

(the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related\nconsolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes\nand financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the\nconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 16, 2023 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.\nAdoption of New Accounting Standard\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for its leases in 2022 due to its modified\nretrospective adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).\nThe Company’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, has a working capital deficiency, and has stated that substantial doubt\nexists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management's evaluation of the events and conditions and management’s plans regarding these\nmatters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the\nrisks of material misstatements of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits\nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nF-2"

The resulting net impact to opening accumulated\ndeficit from the adoption was $0.5 million. Operating lease liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets are\nrecorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term, utilizing the Company’s\nestimated incremental borrowing rate. At December 31, 2022, the Company’s operating lease right-of-use assets and\noperating lease liabilities were $32.3 million and $32.3 million, respectively.\nAuditing management’s initial recognition of the operating lease liabilities and operating lease right-of-use assets\nupon adoption of ASC 842 was especially complex and challenging as the Company’s estimated incremental\nborrowing rate is highly sensitive and had a significant effect on the measurement of the operating lease liabilities\nand the operating lease right-of use assets recognized upon adoption.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our\nAudit\nWe tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the Company’s initial recognition of the operating lease\nliabilities and operating lease right-of-use assets. Our audit procedures included, among others, comparing lease\ninformation including lease term, commencement date and payment terms in a sample of lease agreements to the\nCompany’s analysis. We also tested the completeness of the lease population through the evidence obtained from\ninquiries of Company personnel and an assessment of leases based on our knowledge of the Company’s building\nand warehouse locations. We involved our internal valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the key assumptions\nand methodologies management used to develop the estimated incremental borrowing rate. We independently\ncalculated a range of incremental borrowing rates, compared it to the rates used by the Company and evaluated the\nsensitivity of the model.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2015.\nNew York, New York\nMarch 16, 2023\nF-3"

In our opinion,\nbecause of the effect of the material weakness described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Blue Apron Holdings, Inc. (the\nCompany) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a\nmaterial misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness\nhas been identified and included in management’s assessment. Management has identified a material weakness in the Company’s information technology general\ncontrols and IT dependent controls related to revenue and inventory processes.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance\nsheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to\nas the “consolidated financial statements”). This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of\nthe 2022 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 16, 2023, which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and\nF-4"

Organization and Description of Business\nWhen used in these notes, Blue Apron Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Company.”\nThe Company designs original recipes with fresh, seasonally-inspired produce and high-quality ingredients, which are sent directly to customers for them\nto prepare, cook, and enjoy. The Company creates meal experiences around original recipes every week based on what’s in-season with farming partners and other\nsuppliers. Customers can choose which recipes they would like to receive in a given week, and the Company delivers those recipes to their doorsteps along with the\npre-portioned ingredients required to cook or prepare those recipes.\nIn addition to meals, the Company sells wine through Blue Apron Wine, a direct-to-consumer wine delivery service. The Company also sells a curated\nselection of cooking tools, utensils, pantry items, and add-on products for different culinary occasions, as well as non-subscription meal kits and wine products,\nthrough Blue Apron Market, its e-commerce market.\nBlue Apron Holdings, Inc., was incorporated in Delaware in December 2016 to enable Blue Apron, Inc. to implement a holding company organizational\nstructure, effected by a merger conducted pursuant to Section 251(g) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The Company refers to this\ntransaction as its “Corporate Reorganization.” In December 2016, immediately after the merger, Blue Apron, Inc. converted into Blue Apron, LLC, a Delaware\nlimited liability company.

Certain reclassifications were made to prior year amounts to conform\nto current year presentation.\nLiquidity and Going Concern Evaluation\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 205-40, Going Concern, the Company is required to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt\nregarding its ability to continue as a going concern each reporting period, including interim periods.\nIn this evaluation, management considered the conditions and events that could raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern within twelve months of the issuance date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and considered the Company’s current financial condition and liquidity\nsources, including current funds available, forecasted future cash flows, and the Company’s conditional and unconditional obligations due during this period.\nResults and Liquidity\nThe Company has a history of significant net losses, including $109.7 million, $88.4 million and $46.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022,\n2021 and 2020, respectively, and operating cash flows of $(91.6) million, $(49.0) million and $(5.4) million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and\n2020, respectively. The Company's current operating plan indicates it will continue to incur net losses and generate negative cash flows from operating activities.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $33.5 million and total outstanding debt of $27.5 million, net of unamortized\ndebt issuance costs, all of which was classified as current portion of long-term debt.\nF-10"

Under the agreement, the Company agreed to issue and sell 3,333,333 shares of Class A\ncommon stock for an aggregate purchase price of $40.0 million (or $12.00 per share), of which 1,666,666 shares of Class A common stock were issued and sold to\nan affiliate of Joseph N. Sanberg for an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 million concurrently with the execution of the agreement, and with the remainder to be\nissued and sold under a second closing, initially expected to close by May 30, 2022 or such other date as agreed to by the parties.\nOn August 7, 2022, the Company amended the RJB Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which RJB agreed to purchase from the Company (i) the 1,666,667\nshares of Class A common stock remaining to be issued and sold under the initial RJB Purchase Agreement at a $5.00 price per share, instead of a price of $12.00\nper share, and (ii) an additional 8,333,333 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $5.00 price per share (the “RJB Second Closing”). Upon execution, the RJB\nSecond Closing comprised in the aggregate a purchase price of $50.0 million and 10,000,000 shares of Class A common stock to be issued and sold, as well as\nagreeing to extend the date of the second closing to on or before August 31, 2022. In addition, pursuant to the amendment, Joseph N. Sanberg agreed to personally\nguarantee the payment of the aggregate purchase price.\nOn September 7, 2022, the Company further amended the RJB Purchase Agreement to extend the RJB Second closing date to September 30, 2022 or such\nearlier date as may be agreed to by the Company and RJB, and to change the price per share to $5.65 for the purchase of the 10,000,000 shares of Class A common\nstock remaining to be sold and issued, for an aggregate purchase price of $56.5 million (the “Outstanding Obligated Amount”).\nOn November 6, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Pledge Agreement”) with an affiliate of Joseph N. Sanberg (the “Pledgor”), pursuant\nto which the Pledgor (i) guaranteed the Outstanding Obligated Amount and (ii) to secure its obligation to pay the Outstanding Obligated Amount, granted the\nCompany security interests in the Pledgor’s equity interests in securities (the “Pledged Shares”) of certain privately-held issuers (the “Pledged Entities”), the\ncertificates (if any) representing the Pledged Shares, and all dividends, distributions, cash, instruments and other property or proceeds from time to time received,\nreceivable or otherwise distributed in respect of or in exchange for any or all of the Pledged Shares (collectively, the “Pledged Collateral”). Because the Outstanding\nObligated Amount remained unpaid after November 30, 2022, the Company is permitted to exercise remedies in respect to the Pledged Shares, including\nforeclosing on the Pledged Shares.\nOn December 14, 2022, pursuant to the RJB Purchase Agreement, RJB funded $1.0 million of the Outstanding Obligated Amount in exchange for which\nthe Company issued and sold 176,991 shares of its Class A common stock, resulting in $0.6 million of proceeds, net of issuance costs. As of the date of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, the remaining $55.5 million of the Outstanding Obligated Amount remains unfunded.\nF-11"

Sanberg (the “Sponsorship Gift Cards\nAgreement”), pursuant to which such affiliate agreed to pay the Company a $20.0 million net sponsorship fee to support a marketing program through which the\nCompany will distribute gift cards (the “May Sponsorship Gift Cards”), at the Company’s sole discretion, in order to support its previous growth strategy. On\nAugust 7, 2022, the Company amended the Sponsorship Gift Cards Agreement to extend the funding date to on or before August 31, 2022, and pursuant to which,\nJoseph N. Sanberg personally guaranteed his affiliate’s obligation.\nOn September 7, 2022, the Sponsorship Gift Cards Agreement was further amended to reduce the net sponsorship fee to $18.5 million and extend its due\ndate to September 19, 2022. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Sanberg affiliate has paid $5.8 million of its commitment under said agreement,\nwith $12.7 million remaining to be paid.\nDebt Covenants\nOn May 5, 2022, the Company entered into a note purchase and guarantee agreement (the “note purchase agreement”), the proceeds of which were used,\ntogether with cash on hand, to repay in full and terminate its previous financing agreement. The note purchase agreement contains two financial maintenance\ncovenants: (i) a minimum liquidity covenant that is set between $15.0 million and $25.0 million, depending on the results of the most recently performed Asset\nValuation (as defined in the note purchase agreement), for any date subsequent to June 30, 2022, including within required cash flow forecasts provided to the\nnoteholders, and (ii) a covenant requiring a minimum Asset Coverage Ratio (as defined in the note purchase agreement) of at least 1.25 to 1.00.\nAs a result of the Company’s initial Asset Valuation completed on August 31, 2022, and the most recent Asset Valuation completed on January 30, 2023,\nthe minimum liquidity covenant was set at $25.0 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company believes it was in compliance with all of the covenants under the\nnote purchase agreement as of December 31, 2022. The noteholder has alleged that the Company was in default with respect to certain prior events related to the\nPledge Agreement or amendments to the RJB Purchase Agreement made without their consent. The Company has disputed that any such defaults existed or exist,\nbut to the extent that such defaults did exist, the Company obtained a waiver from its noteholder pursuant to the note purchase agreement amendment, as discussed\nfurther below.\nMarch 2023 Note Purchase Agreement Amendment\nOn March 15, 2023, the Company entered into a waiver, consent, and amendment to the note purchase agreement (the \"note purchase agreement\namendment\") which among other things accelerates the repayment of the $30.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the senior secured notes due originally in\nMay 2027 to an effective maturity of June 2023. The Company has agreed to pay the full outstanding principal balance on the senior secured notes in four equal\namortization installments of $7.5 million with the first installment paid in connection with the signing of the note purchase agreement amendment and with the final\ninstallment due on June 15, 2023, including any accrued and unpaid interest. Under the note purchase agreement amendment, the noteholder also agreed to reduce\nthe minimum liquidity covenant amount, which was previously set at $25.0 million, to $17.5 million following the first amortization payment and to $10.0 million\nfollowing the first and second amortization payments until the senior secured notes are repaid in full. Furthermore, conditioned upon the timely payment of all the\namortization payments, the noteholder agreed to waive all prepayment premiums and the ESG KPI Fee (as defined below) that would otherwise have been owed by\nthe Company at maturity in May 2027.\nIn connection with the note purchase agreement amendment, the noteholder consented to the surrender of ownership to the Company, by the Pledgor, of\ncertain of the Pledged Shares in satisfaction of certain obligations of the Pledgor, should a surrender of the collateral be agreed by the Company and the Pledgor.\nThe note purchase agreement amendment also clarified that such surrendered Pledged Shares would become collateral for the Company's obligation under the note\npurchase agreement.\nThe note purchase agreement amendment also contains additional and modified reporting and information requirements, including amending the\nrequirement to deliver an audit report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, which report shall not include a “going concern” explanatory\nparagraph expressing substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern to exclude the audit opinion relating to the financial statements\nas of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, the note purchase agreement amendment clarifies that, to the extent, if any, that certain prior events\nrelated to the Pledge Agreement or amendments to the RJB Purchase Agreement constituted defaults under the note purchase agreement, such defaults are waived,\nalthough it is the Company's position that no such defaults existed at any time.\nF-12"

Sanberg relating to his affiliates’ obligations to fund the liquidity transactions\nvia the executed amendments above, as well as the Pledged Shares from the Pledgor affiliate, there is no assurance that the liquidity transactions will be\nconsummated in a timely manner, or that the Company will be able to sell the Pledged Shares in amounts that are sufficient to meet the Company's obligations as\nthey become due, or on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all.\nAlthough the Company has been reviewing a number of potential alternatives regarding its liquidity, including identified and to be identified cost reduction\ninitiatives, monetizing the Pledged Shares, and/or securing alternative sources for additional financing, including raising additional capital through the “at-the-\nmarket” equity offering launched on February 10, 2023, such alternatives may not be achievable on favorable conditions, or at all, and these conditions and events\nin the aggregate raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements do not\ninclude any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty and have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP, the Company is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities which are reported in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements and accompanying disclosures. The accounting estimates that require the most difficult and subjective judgments include revenue recognition, inventory\nvaluation, leases, the fair value of share-based awards, the fair value of the Blue Torch warrant obligation (as defined in Note 10), recoverability of long-lived\nassets, and the recognition and measurement of contingencies. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical\nexperience and other factors and adjusts those estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results could materially differ from the\nCompany’s estimates and assumptions.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAll highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash\nequivalents are stated at cost plus accrued interest and consist of cash on hand, money market accounts, and amounts held by third party financial institutions for\ncredit and debit card transactions. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $33.5 million and $82.2 million, respectively, and consist of\nqualifying money market accounts and amounts due from third party institutions which generally settle within three business days, of $4.8 million and $4.3 million\nas of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable primarily represent amounts due from third parties that market the Company’s products and other trade receivables. Accounts\nreceivable are recorded at invoiced amounts, net of allowances for doubtful accounts if applicable, are unsecured, and do not bear interest. The allowance for\ndoubtful accounts was $0.0 million and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCertain Risks and Concentrations\nFinancial instruments that subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. All of the\nCompany’s cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash are held at financial institutions in the United States that management believes to be of high credit quality.\nDeposits held in the United States with these financial institutions exceed federally insured limits.\nOn March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (\"SVB\") was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the\nFDIC as receiver. SVB’s deposits are insured by the FDIC in amounts up to $250,000 for each deposit account. Substantially all of the Company's cash and cash\nequivalents are held in four SVB deposit accounts and substantially all of which was not insured by the FDIC.

Starting\nMarch 13, 2023, the Company regained full access to all of its cash and cash equivalents.\nThe primary focus of the Company’s investment strategy is to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements. The Company’s investment policy\naddresses the level of credit exposure by limiting the concentration in any one corporate issuer or sector and establishing a minimum allowable credit rating.\nNo individual customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s total Net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. There are\nno significant concentration risks within the Company’s Accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, an individual shipping carrier accounted for 13.4%, 13.4% and 13.7% of the Company’s total\nCost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization, respectively. No individual supplier accounted for 10% or more of total Accounts payable as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.\nInventories, Net\nInventories, net consist primarily of bulk and prepped food, products available for resale, packaging, containers, and wine products which are stated at the\nlower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory costs consist of product costs, inbound shipping and handling costs, and applicable direct labor costs. Inventories are\nvalued on a first in, first out cost basis. The Company records an inventory valuation reserve when applicable based on currently available information about the\nlikely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, donations, or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each inventory category.\nLeases\nAt the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances\npresent. Leases are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, lease obligations and, if applicable, long-term lease obligations.\nLease obligations and their corresponding ROU assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term. As the interest rate\nimplicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable, the Company utilizes the appropriate incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to\nborrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term in an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Certain adjustments to the ROU\nasset may be required for items such as initial direct costs paid or incentives received. The lease term may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is\nreasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The components of a lease should be split into three categories: lease components, including land,\nbuilding, or other similar components; non-lease components, including common area maintenance, maintenance, consumables, or other similar components; and\nnon-components, including property taxes, insurance, or other similar components. However, the Company has elected to combine lease and non-lease components\nas a single component. The lease expense is recognized over the expected term on a straight-line basis.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are stated at cost and are depreciated using a straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows:\nComputer equipment\n2 - 3 years\nCapitalized software\n2 years\nFulfillment equipment\n5 - 7 years\nFurniture and fixtures\n5 years\nLeasehold improvements\nShorter of expected useful life or lease term\nBuildings\n30 years\nCapitalized Software Development Costs\nThe Company capitalizes qualifying internally-developed software development costs that are incurred during the application development stage, so long\nas management with the relevant authority authorizes the project, it is probable the\nF-14"

Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected\nuseful lives, which is approximately two years. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional significant functionality are capitalized and\namortized over the estimated useful life of the enhancement. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation operation activities, including\ntraining and maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs net of accumulated amortization are included as a component of\nProperty and equipment, net in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRecoverability of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets consist of the Company’s property and equipment and capitalized software development costs. The Company periodically evaluates\nwhether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining\nbalance may not be recoverable. These factors may include a significant deterioration of operating results, changes in business plans, or changes in anticipated cash\nflows. Recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated. If future\nundiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment is recognized in earnings to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no impairments of long-lived assets. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company\nrecorded impairment charges of $7.6 million in Other operating expense on long-lived assets related to its Arlington, Texas fulfillment center.\nFair Value Estimates\nThe fair value of financial instruments and non-financial instruments is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use when pricing\nan asset or liability at the balance sheet date. Certain assets are categorized based on the following fair value hierarchy of market participant assumptions:\n•\nLevel 1 — Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2 — Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly.\n•\nLevel 3 — Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value of the asset or liability and supported by little or\nno market activity.\nThe Company uses observable market data when available, and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value.\nCash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities are stated at carrying amounts as reported in the\nConsolidated Financial Statements, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The fair value of the long-term debt approximates its carrying\nvalue based on the variable nature of interest rates and current market rates available to the Company.\nThe Blue Torch warrant obligation issued in conjunction with the Amendment, as discussed in Note 10, was accounted for in accordance with ASC 815-40,\nContracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, as a liability recognized at fair value, and was remeasured as of each balance sheet date with changes in fair value recorded in\nOther income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Blue Torch warrant obligation was terminated within the termination of the\nCompany’s financing agreement with Blue Torch. For additional information on the Blue Torch warrant obligation, see Note 10.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company primarily generates revenue from the sale of its products to customers, including meals, wine, and kitchen tools, and through enterprise bulk\nsales on an ad hoc basis. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company derived substantially all of its Net revenue from sales of its meal\nkits.\nThe Company's revenue contracts represent a single performance obligation to sell its products to its customers. The Company recognizes revenue upon\ntransfer of control, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to the products, in an amount that reflects the consideration the\nCompany expects to be entitled to. In general, the Company charges credit cards in advance of shipment. Transfer of control generally passes upon delivery to the\nF-15"

Customers who receive a damaged meal or wine order or are dissatisfied with an order and contact the Company within seven days of receipt of the order\nmay receive a full or partial refund, full or partial credit against future purchase, or replacement, at the Company's sole discretion. Credits only remain available for\ncustomers who maintain a valid account with the Company. Customers who return an unused, undamaged Blue Apron Market product within 30 days of receipt\nreceive a full refund. The Company estimates and records expected credits and refunds based on prior history, recent trends, and projections for credits and refunds\non sales in the current period. Reserves for credits and refunds are included within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nThe Company periodically enters into agreements with third parties to market the Company’s products. The Company records revenue from such\narrangements at the gross amount as the Company is the principal in these arrangements as it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the goods to customers, provides\nprimary customer service for such products sold on its website, has latitude in establishing price and selecting such products sold on its website, and maintains\ninventory risk.\nThe Company has two types of contractual liabilities: (i) cash collections from its customers prior to delivery of products purchased, which are included in\nDeferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are recognized as revenue upon transfer of control of its products, and (ii) unredeemed gift cards and\nother prepaid orders, which are included in Deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are recognized as revenue when gift cards are redeemed and\nthe products are delivered. Certain gift cards are not expected to be redeemed, also known as breakage, and are recognized as revenue over the expected redemption\nperiod, subject to requirements to remit balances to governmental agencies.\nContractual liabilities included in Deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $19.1 million and $8.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $6.9 million to Net revenue from the Deferred revenue at\nDecember 31, 2021.\nSee Note 14 for further information regarding the March Sponsorship Gift Cards (as defined below) and May Sponsorship Gift Cards.\nCost of Goods Sold, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization consists of product and fulfillment costs. Product costs include the cost of food, packaging for\nfood that is portioned prior to delivery to customers, labor and related personnel costs incurred to portion food for the Company’s meals, inbound shipping costs,\nand cost of products sold through Blue Apron Wine, and Blue Apron Market. Fulfillment costs consist of costs incurred in the shipping and handling of inventory\nincluding the shipping costs to the Company’s customers, labor and related personnel costs related to receiving, inspecting, warehousing, picking inventory, and\npreparing customer orders for shipment, and the cost of packaging materials and shipping supplies.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are charged to Marketing expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Advertising costs were $80.2 million,\n$68.4 million, and $45.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The Company recognizes advertising costs the first time the\nadvertising takes place. Deferred advertising, marketing, and promotional costs, which principally relate to advertisements that have not yet been exhibited or\nservices that have not yet been received, were $0.3 million and $1.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are recorded within Prepaid\nexpenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nProduct, Technology, General and Administrative\nProduct, technology, general and administrative expenses consist of costs related to the development of the Company’s products and technology, general\nand administrative expenses, and overhead expenses, which include: payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the application, production, and\nmaintenance of the Company’s platform and other technology infrastructure costs; payroll and related expenses for employees performing corporate and other\nF-16"

The Company estimates\nthe fair value of stock options on the grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company estimates the fair value of performance-\nbased restricted stock units utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model if it is determined to include a market condition. The fair value of restricted stock\nunits is determined based on the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the grant date. The Company\nrecognizes forfeitures as they occur.\nOther Operating Expense\nOther operating expense consists of a non-cash gain, net of a termination fee, on the Fairfield lease termination, impairment losses on long-lived assets,\ncharges for estimated legal settlements, and restructuring costs.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income and expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with the Company’s outstanding borrowings and finance leases, offset by\ninterest income on cash and cash equivalents.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income and expense consists of the change in fair value of the Blue Torch warrant obligation upon remeasurement as of each reporting period, as\nwell as the gain recorded upon its derecognition. For additional information on the Blue Torch warrant obligation, see Note 10 and Note 17.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined\nbased on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be\nin effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Management makes an assessment of the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized. A\nvaluation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating the ability to\nrecover deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including historical\noperating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income. Based on the Company’s historical operating losses, the Company has recorded a\nvaluation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Company recognizes uncertain income tax positions at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit in accordance with\nASC 740, Income Taxes. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Changes in recognition or\nmeasurement are reflected in the period in which judgment occurs. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to the underpayment of\nincome taxes as a component of provision for income taxes.\nSegments\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the Chief\nOperating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s CODM is its\nChief Executive Officer.

This classification allowed the Company to elect to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded for the implementation of new or revised\naccounting standards. The Company ceased to be an emerging growth company on December 31, 2022, the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary\nof the IPO, and as a result, adopted all accounting pronouncements deferred under the emerging growth company election according to public company standards.\nThe adoption dates for the new accounting pronouncements disclosed below are presented accordingly.\nSmaller Reporting Company Status\nThe Company is a “smaller reporting company,” as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and therefore qualifies for reduced\ndisclosure requirements for smaller reporting companies.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, “Leases” (ASC 842),\nwhich requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to Accounting\nStandards Codification (“ASC”) 840, “Leases” (“ASC 840”). ASC 842 requires that a lessee recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments\nand a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.\nASC 842 is first effective for the Company within this annual period, resulting in the adoption of this standard effective as of January 1, 2022. The\nCompany adopted ASU 2016-02 using the modified retrospective approach, which permits application of this new guidance at the beginning of the period of\nadoption, with comparative periods continuing to be reported under ASC 840. The Company also elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the\ntransition guidance within ASC 842, which among other things, permits the Company to not reassess under the new standard the Company’s prior conclusions about\nlease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs. The Company did not elect the use-of-hindsight practical expedient or the practical expedient\npertaining to land easements, the latter not being applicable to the Company. The Company also elected to continue to recognize lease payments related to short-\nterm leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nIn June 2017 the Company applied build-to-suit accounting treatment to its fulfillment center in Linden, New Jersey, as the Company was deemed the\naccounting owner of the construction project because of the Company’s involvement in the build-out of the space. Upon adoption, the Company derecognized the\nfacility financing obligation and related building assets recorded as a result of the failed sale and leaseback transactions and recorded any difference as a\ncumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit. The lease is now accounted for as an operating lease. In addition, all amounts spent relating to the build-out of\nthe fulfillment center were reclassified from Buildings to Leasehold improvements, and will be depreciated over the remaining term of the lease.\nAdoption of ASC 842 resulted in the following adjustments to the balance sheet:\nF-18"

As a result of the nature of the\nCompany’s involvement in the construction of the fulfillment centers, the Company was considered to be the owner for accounting purposes. The Company\nfollowed build-to-suit lease accounting for these arrangements and capitalized the fair value of the buildings and direct construction costs incurred along with a\ncorresponding facility financing liability.\nIn October 2017, the Company performed a review of its real estate needs and decided to no longer pursue its planned build-out of the Fairfield facility and\nas a result, pursued potential alternatives for the leased Fairfield property. On March 30, 2020 (the “termination date”), the Company terminated the lease, effective\nimmediately, for its Fairfield facility (the “Fairfield lease termination”). In connection with the Fairfield lease termination, the Company agreed to a termination fee\nin the amount of $1.5 million, recognized upon the termination date and paid in the second quarter of 2020.\nPrior to the lease termination, the net carrying value of the build-to-suit assets totaled $31.1 million, the facility financing obligation totaled $35.7 million,\nand the Company had deferred rent of $1.8 million. Accordingly, as of the termination date, the Company derecognized the net carrying value of the build-to-suit\nassets and liabilities and the deferred rent balance. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash gain of $4.9 million, net of the lease termination fee, in Other\noperating expense during the first quarter of 2020.\n7.

Debt\n2020 and 2021 Term Loans\nOn October 16, 2020, the Company entered into a financing agreement which provided for a senior secured term loan in the aggregate principal amount of\n$35.0 million (the “2020 Term Loan”). The 2020 Term Loan bore interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (subject to a 1.50% floor) plus 8.00% per annum, with the\nprincipal amount repayable in equal quarterly installments of $875,000 through December 31, 2022, and the remaining unpaid principal amount of the 2020 Term\nLoan due on March 31, 2023.\n2020 Term Loan Amendment and Debt Extinguishment\nOn May 5, 2021 (the “closing date”), the Company amended the financing agreement (the “May 2021 Amendment”), which modified certain provisions of\nthe financing agreement, such as increasing the interest rate margin on the 2020 Term Loan by 1.00% per annum, resulting in the 2020 Term Loan bearing interest,\nfrom and after the closing date, at a rate equal to LIBOR (subject to a 1.50% floor) plus 9.00% per annum. In addition, the amendment provided for a $5.0 million\nterm loan (the “2021 Term Loan”) that was funded into an escrow account and subsequently released in full from the escrow account to the lenders upon the\nCompany’s completion of an underwritten public offering in June 2021.\nThe Company evaluated the May 2021 Amendment under ASC 470-50 regarding the modification of an existing debt instrument, which states that if the\nmodification of the terms of an existing debt agreement is considered substantial, the transaction shall be accounted for as an extinguishment, with the amended debt\ninstrument then initially recorded at fair value. The Company concluded that the modification was considered substantial, and qualified for extinguishment\naccounting under such guidance. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $4.1 million extinguishment loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which\nconsisted of (i) a $4.6 million loss related to the contemporaneous issuance of the Blue Torch warrant obligation, as discussed below, and (ii) a $0.1 million loss\nrelated to fees paid on behalf of the lender, which were partially offset by (iii) a $0.6 million gain related to the difference between the fair value of the modified\ndebt instrument and the net carrying value of the debt immediately before extinguishment.\nThe 2020 Term Loan was repaid in full on May 5, 2022 with the proceeds of the senior secured notes issued under the note purchase agreement described\nbelow.\nBlue Torch Warrant Obligation\nIn connection with the May 2021 Amendment, the Company agreed to prospectively grant warrants (the “Blue Torch warrant obligation”) to the lenders.\nUnder the terms of the Blue Torch warrant obligation, so long as the 2020 Term Loan remained outstanding, on the first day of each quarter beginning on July 1,\n2021, the Company issued a warrant to the lenders to purchase at an exercise price of $0.01 per share such number of shares of Class A common stock of the\nCompany as equaled 0.50% of the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, on a fully-diluted basis.\nThe Blue Torch warrant obligation was accounted for in accordance with ASC 815-40, Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, as a liability recognized at fair\nvalue as of the closing date, due to certain settlement provisions within the corresponding warrant obligation provisions under the financing agreement that did not\nmeet the criteria to be classified in stockholders’ equity. The Blue Torch warrant obligation was remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date, with changes in\nfair value recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Blue Torch warrant obligation was terminated within the\ntermination of the Company’s financing agreement, as discussed below.\nSenior Secured Notes and Blue Torch Warrant Obligation Termination\nOn May 5, 2022 (the “issue date”), the Company entered into a note purchase and guarantee agreement (the “note purchase agreement”), which provides\nfor, among other things, the issuance of $30.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due May 5, 2027 (the “senior secured notes”) at a\npurchase price equal to 94.00% thereof. The proceeds of the senior secured notes were used, together with cash on hand, to repay in full the outstanding amount\nunder the 2020 Term Loan and pay fees and expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by the note purchase agreement. The Company subsequently\nterminated its financing agreement with Blue Torch, effective as of the issue date, which also resulted in the termination of the Blue Torch warrant obligation.\n2020 Term Loan Debt Extinguishment\nThe Company evaluated the termination of the financing agreement under ASC 470-50 regarding the extinguishment of debt, which states that the\ndifference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the\nF-25"

Accordingly, the Company recorded a $0.7 million extinguishment\ngain in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which consisted of (i) a $2.6 million gain related to the allocation of the reacquisition price between the 2020\nTerm Loan and the Blue Torch warrant obligation, as discussed below, partially offset by (ii) a $0.9 million loss related to the 2020 Term Loan prepayment fee, (iii)\na $0.9 million loss related to the derecognition of unamortized debt issuance costs, and (iv) a $0.1 million loss related to legal and consulting fees incurred.\nIn addition, ASC 470-50 states that if upon extinguishment of debt the parties also exchange unstated (or stated) rights or privileges, the portion of the\nconsideration exchanged allocable to such unstated (or stated) rights or privileges shall be given appropriate accounting recognition. As such, the Company\nallocated a portion of the reacquisition price to the exchange of the Blue Torch warrant obligation, which resulted in a $0.2 million gain recorded in Other income\n(expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations upon its derecognition.\nAugust 2022 Note Purchase Agreement Amendment\nOn August 30, 2022, the Company amended the note purchase agreement, which would have been effective the first date that a minimum of $50.0 million\nof the equity proceeds are received under the RJB Second Closing, amongst other closing conditions. The amendment would have, among other things:\n•\nallowed the Company to voluntarily prepay the senior secured notes within 18 months of the issue date, subject to an Applicable Premium (as defined\nwithin the amendment) penalty;\n•\nallowed for the Company to repurchase up to $25.0 million of its outstanding equity interests, subject to certain conditions; and\n•\nadded certain limitations to the definition of Cash Flow Forecast (as defined within the amendment).\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the closing conditions of the amendment had not been met, and as such, the amendment was\nsuperseded by the March 2023 note purchase agreement amendment described below.\nMarch 2023 Note Purchase Agreement Amendment\nOn March 15, 2023, the Company entered into a waiver, consent, and amendment to the note purchase agreement which among other things accelerates the\nrepayment of the senior secured notes due originally in May 2027 to an effective maturity of June 2023. The Company has agreed to pay the full outstanding\nprincipal balance on the senior secured notes in four equal amortization installments of $7.5 million with the first installment paid in connection with the signing of\nthe note purchase agreement amendment and with the final installment due on June 15, 2023, including any accrued and unpaid interest. Under the note purchase\nagreement amendment, the noteholder also agreed to reduce the minimum liquidity covenant amount, which was previously set at $25.0 million, to $17.5 million\nfollowing the first amortization payment and to $10.0 million following the first and second amortization payments until the senior secured notes are repaid in full.\nFurthermore, conditioned upon the timely payment of all the amortization payments, the noteholder agreed to waive all prepayment premiums and the ESG KPI Fee\nthat would otherwise have been owed by the Company at maturity in May 2027.\nIn connection with the note purchase agreement amendment, the noteholder consented to the surrender of ownership to the Company, by the Pledgor, of\ncertain of the Pledged Shares in satisfaction of certain obligations of the Pledgor under the Pledge Agreement, should a surrender of the collateral be agreed by the\nCompany and the Pledgor. The note purchase agreement amendment also clarified that such surrendered Pledged Shares would become collateral for the Company's\nobligation under the note purchase agreement.\nThe note purchase agreement amendment also contains additional and modified reporting and information requirements, including amending the\nrequirement to deliver an audit report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, which report shall not include a “going concern” explanatory\nparagraph expressing substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern to exclude the audit opinion relating to the financial statements\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, the note purchase agreement amendment clarifies that, to the extent, if any, that prior events related to the Pledge\nAgreement or amendments to the RJB Purchase Agreement constituted defaults under the note purchase agreement, such defaults are waived, although it is the\nCompany's position that no such defaults existed at any time.\nAs a result, as of December 31, 2022, the total outstanding debt of $27.5 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, was classified within Current\nportion of long-term debt.\nF-26"

Pursuant to a\nstipulated schedule entered by the parties, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on May 21, 2018. Plaintiffs filed a response on July 12, 2018\nand defendants filed a reply on August 13, 2018. On April 22, 2020, the Court entered an order (i) denying the motion to dismiss insofar as Plaintiffs’ allegations\npertained to certain of the disclosures in the registration statement and prospectus claimed by plaintiff, and (ii) narrowing the factual issues in the case. On August\n11, 2020, the parties held a mediation after which they entered into a memorandum of understanding on August 14, 2020 regarding a proposed settlement.\nDiscovery has been stayed since August 14, 2020. The Company entered into a stipulation and agreement of settlement to resolve the class action litigation on\nOctober 28, 2020, which was subsequently amended on November 12, 2020. Under the terms of the settlement, a payment of $13.3 million was to be made by the\nCompany and/or its insurers in exchange for the release of claims against the defendants and other released parties by the lead plaintiff and all settlement class\nmembers and for the dismissal of the action with prejudice.

One of the state court actions was originally filed in the New York Supreme Court, but was voluntarily\ndismissed by plaintiffs on September 15, 2020 and subsequently re-filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York on October 2, 2020. On\nDecember 2, 2020, the Company settled this lawsuit, which did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The second state\nlawsuit was voluntarily dismissed on May 12, 2021.\nIn June 2020, certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors were named as defendants in a shareholder derivative action filed in the\nEastern District of New York, captioned Jeffrey Peters v. Matthew B. Salzberg, et al., 1:20-cv-02627. The complaint sought contribution from the officer and\ndirector defendants for any damages that the Company may incur as a result of the above-referenced class action lawsuit, attorneys’ fees, and other costs, as well as\nan order directing the Company to reform and improve its corporate governance and internal procedures to comply with applicable laws. On September 11, 2020,\nthis case was stayed pending resolution of the federal securities case. On June 16, 2021, the plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal requesting that the court to\ndismiss the action without prejudice and retain jurisdiction of the action solely for the purpose of adjudicating the plaintiff’s counsel’s anticipated application for an\naward of attorney’s fees and reimbursement of expenses in connection with purportedly mooted claims asserted by the plaintiff in the action. On June 22, 2021, the\ncourt dismissed the action but retained jurisdiction of the action solely for the purpose of adjudicating the plaintiff’s counsel’s anticipated application for fees and\nexpenses. On July 28, 2021, the Company and plaintiff’s counsel reached an agreement concerning plaintiff’s counsel’s claim for fees and costs without the need for\ncourt intervention.\nThe Company was subject to a lawsuit filed in California Superior Court under the Private Attorneys General Act on behalf of certain non-exempt\nemployees in the Company’s Richmond, California fulfillment center. The complaint was filed on October 16, 2017, and alleges that the Company failed to pay\nwages and overtime, provide required meal and rest breaks, provide suitable resting facilities and provide accurate wage statements, to non-exempt employees in\nviolation of California law. Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a separate class action lawsuit alleging largely the same claims, but covering a longer period, which is now\npending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. A mediation was held on November 20, 2019, at which time the cases were not\nresolved. On December 16, 2019, Plaintiff filed a motion for class certification in federal court. On December 18, 2019, the parties entered into a memorandum of\nunderstanding which, if finalized and approved by the court, will resolve both actions in their entirety. The parties finalized a settlement agreement on March 2,\n2020 and the court has vacated all other deadlines in the class-action case, including the due date for the Company’s opposition to the motion for class certification.\nOn July 6, 2020, the court granted preliminary approval of the final settlement agreement. A hearing for final approval was held on November 19, 2020 and the\ncourt granted final approval of the settlement agreement on that day. The Company paid approximately $2.0 million under the settlement agreement on December 9,\n2020.\nAlthough the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that it may incur losses in these cases, the Company is currently unable to estimate the\namount of such losses, except as noted above, due to the early stages of certain of the litigations, among other factors.\nIn addition, from time to time the Company may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of its business.\nAlthough the results of such litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes that the final outcome of these ordinary course\nmatters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows.\n12. Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit)\nPublic Equity Offerings\nOn February 10, 2023, the Company launched an \"at-the-market\" equity offering under its November 2022 Shelf for sale from time to time of up to $70.0\nmillion of Class A common stock. See Note 19 for further discussion.\nOn January 19, 2023, the Company completed an “at-the-market” equity offering, pursuant to its November 2022 Shelf. As a result of the offering, the\nCompany issued and sold 28,998,010 shares of its Class A common stock, resulting in $29.0 million of proceeds, net of commissions and offering costs.

Sanberg, pursuant to which such affiliate\nagreed to pay the Company a $20.0 million net sponsorship fee to support a marketing program through which the Company will distribute gift cards, at the\nCompany’s sole discretion, in order to support its previous growth strategy. On August 7, 2022, the Company amended the Sponsorship Gift Cards Agreement to\nextend the funding date to on or before August 31, 2022, and pursuant to which, Joseph N. Sanberg personally guaranteed his affiliate’s obligation.\nOn September 7, 2022, the Sponsorship Gift Cards Agreement was further amended to reduce the net sponsorship fee to $18.5 million and extend the due\ndate to September 19, 2022. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Sanberg affiliate has paid $5.8 million of its commitment under said agreement,\nwith $12.7 million remaining to be paid.\nAs the Company concluded the remaining amount to be paid under the Sponsorship Gift Cards Agreement did not meet the collectability criterion under\nASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the $12.7 million receivable was not recognized within the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nSustainability and Carbon Credit Agreement\nOn March 31, 2022, the Company entered into a Sustainability and Carbon Credit Agreement (the “Sustainability Agreement”) with an affiliate of Joseph\nN. Sanberg. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company purchased and subsequently retired $3.0 million of carbon offsets, which were recognized in Product,\ntechnology, general and administrative expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2022.\nSuch affiliate also performed the assessment of the Company’s 2021 annual carbon footprint that provided it with the basis for determining the amount of\ncarbon offsets the Company needed to purchase. The fee for these services was waived as a condition of entering into the Sustainability Agreement.\nOn June 30, 2022, the Company entered into a statement of work under the Sustainability Agreement, through which the affiliate transferred to the\nCompany a sufficient amount of carbon offsets for its estimated 2023 and 2024 Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions based upon its 2021 annual carbon\nfootprint, for a purchase price of $6.0 million, which was expected to be paid in twenty-four equal monthly installments beginning on July 31, 2022.\nOn February 2, 2023, the Company and its affiliate terminated the Sustainability Agreement, which released the Company of its future payment obligation\nof $5.5 million. Under the terms of the termination agreement, the Company retained a number of carbon credits purchased for $0.5 million and paid to the affiliate\nas of December 31, 2022. Such retained carbon credits are expected to offset the Company's estimated 2023 and 2024 Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.\n2022 Private Placements\nSee Notes 2 and 12 for further discussion of the RJB Private Placement and Findley Private Placement during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nF-34"

Each reporting period the Company assesses the\nrecoverability of its deferred tax assets and are required to establish a valuation allowance for any portion of the assets that the Company concludes is not more\nlikely than not realizable. Based upon the weight of available evidence, which includes the Company’s historical operating performance and the recorded\ncumulative net losses in prior fiscal periods, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $165.9 million and $140.2 million against the net U.S. deferred tax\nassets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The valuation allowance increased by $25.6 million during 2022, which was primarily a result of additional\nlosses generated, partially offset by the expiration of certain charitable contribution carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $563.9 million and $249.7 million, respectively. Of\nthe $563.9 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards, $221.4 million was generated before January 1, 2018, and is subject to a 20-year carryforward period.\nThe remaining $342.5 million can be carried forward indefinitely, but is subject to an 80% taxable income limitation in any future taxable year. The pre-2018\nfederal and all state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2032 and 2033, respectively, if not utilized.\nThe Company’s tax attributes may be limited by the ownership provisions of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, if the Company\nexperienced an “ownership change” during any three-year period, its use of these tax attributes may be limited. The Company has not performed a detailed analysis\nto determine if an ownership change has occurred.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any gross unrecognized tax benefits. The Company’s policy for classifying interest and\npenalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits is to include such items in the provision for income tax.\nThe Company files U.S. federal and state income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. The Company’s tax years from 2012\n(inception) are subject to examination by the United States and state authorities due to the carry forward of unutilized net operating losses.\nF-37"

Fair Value Measurements\nFinancial Instruments\nThe fair value of financial instruments is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability at the\nbalance sheet date. The Company uses observable market data when available, and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value.\nThe Company did not measure any assets or liabilities at fair value as of December 31, 2022. The following are the major categories of assets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2021 using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1), significant other observable\ninputs (Level 2) and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):\nDecember 31, 2021\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\n(In thousands)\nAssets:\n \n \n \n \nCash and cash equivalents:\nMoney market accounts\n$\n2,635\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n2,635\nTotal assets measured at fair value\n$\n2,635\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n2,635\nLiabilities:\nWarrant obligation\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n8,001\n$\n8,001\nOther noncurrent liabilities:\nWarrant obligation\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n1,588\n$\n1,588\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n9,589\n$\n9,589\nMoney market accounts\nMoney market accounts are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as they are valued using observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for\nidentical assets in active markets. The carrying amount of the Company’s money market accounts approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities.\nWarrant obligation\nThe Blue Torch warrant obligation in conjunction with the Amendment, as discussed in Note 10, was accounted for in accordance with ASC 815-40,\nContracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, as a liability recognized at fair value, and was remeasured as of each balance sheet date with changes in fair value recorded in\nOther income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The amount of each warrant to be issued under the obligation set forth in the financing\nagreement was based upon 0.50% of the then-outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock on a fully-diluted basis on the first day of each quarter, beginning\non July 1, 2021, so long as the 2020 Term Loan remained outstanding. As such, the fair value of the Blue Torch warrant obligation was calculated using the\nestimated amount of warrants to be issued over the life of the financing agreement multiplied by the price of the Company’s stock as of the closing date, less $0.01\nper share to represent each warrant’s exercise price. The estimated amount of shares to be issued was derived from the Company’s estimate of shares of the\nCompany’s common stock on a fully-diluted basis over the life of the financing agreement.\nOn May 5, 2022, the Company fully repaid the 2020 Term Loan with the proceeds of its senior secured notes and cash on hand and terminated its financing\nagreement effective as of the same date, which also resulted in the termination of the warrant obligation. As of May 5, 2022, all warrants that had been issued under\nthe Blue Torch warrant obligation had been exercised in full, resulting in no liability-classified warrants outstanding. See Note 10 for further discussion.\nThe following table summarizes the changes of the Blue Torch warrant obligation as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021:\nF-38"

See Note 7 for further discussion on the long-\nlived assets’ impairment losses.\n18. Restructuring Costs\nIn December 2022, the Company implemented a reduction in corporate personnel to better align internal resources with strategic priorities, which resulted\nin a reduction of approximately 10% of the Company’s total corporate workforce, inclusive of both current and vacant roles. As a result, during the three months\nended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $1.5 million in employee-related expenses in Other operating expense, primarily consisting of severance\npayments, substantially all of which will result in cash expenditures in the first half of 2023.\nEmployee-Related Costs\n(in thousands)\nBalance - December 31, 2021\n$\n— \n     Charges\n1,530\n     Cash payments\n(235)\nBalance - December 31, 2022\n$\n1,295 \nIn February 2020, the Company announced the closure of its fulfillment center in Arlington, Texas and the consolidation of production volume from the\nArlington, Texas fulfillment center to the Company’s fulfillment centers in Linden, New Jersey and Richmond, California in order to more efficiently continue to\nservice the Company’s national footprint while also enabling the Company to redirect financial resources into other parts of the business, including previous growth\ninitiatives.\nAs a result of the action, which was completed in May 2020, the Company recorded $0.8 million in total restructuring costs during the first half of 2020,\nincluding $0.4 million of employee-related expenses, primarily consisting of severance payments, and $0.4 million of other exit costs in Other operating expense,\nsubstantially all of which resulted in cash expenditures. In addition, during the first half of 2020, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $7.6\nmillion, primarily consisting of leasehold improvements and equipment. See Note 7 for further discussion of the impairment charges.\nThe Company temporarily reopened its Arlington, Texas fulfillment center beginning in January 2021 to leverage existing assets to meet forecasted\ndemand while continuing to implement operating efficiencies at its other fulfillment centers. In April 2021, the Company closed down the temporarily reopened\nArlington fulfillment center, with all production volume consolidated at its other fulfillment centers. The closure of the Arlington fulfillment center after its\ntemporary reopening did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\n19. Subsequent Events\nSilicon Valley Bank\nOn March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as receiver. SVB’s deposits are insured by the FDIC in amounts up to $250,000 for each deposit account.\nSubstantially all of the Company's cash and cash equivalents are held in four SVB deposit accounts and substantially all of which was not insured by the\nF-39"

On March 12, 2023, the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC announced that SVB depositors will have access to all of their\nmoney, including the uninsured amount, starting March 13, 2023. On March 13, 2023, the Company regained full access to all of its cash and cash equivalents.\nMarch 2023 Note Purchase Agreement Amendment\nOn March 15, 2023, the Company entered into a waiver, consent, and amendment to the note purchase agreement which among other things accelerates the\nrepayment of the senior secured notes due originally in May 2027 to an effective maturity of June 2023. The Company has agreed to pay the full outstanding\nprincipal balance on the senior secured notes in four equal amortization installments of $7.5 million with the first installment paid in connection with the note\npurchase agreement amendment and with the final installment due on June 15, 2023, including any accrued and unpaid interest. Under the note purchase agreement\namendment, the noteholder also agreed to reduce the minimum liquidity covenant amount, which was previously set at $25.0 million, to $17.5 million following the\nfirst amortization payment and to $10.0 million following the first and second amortization payments until the senior secured notes are repaid in full. Furthermore,\nconditioned upon the timely payment of all the amortization payments, the noteholder agreed to waive all prepayment premiums and the ESG KPI Fee that would\notherwise have been owed by the Company at maturity in May 2027.\nIn connection with the note purchase agreement amendment, the noteholder consented to the surrender of ownership to the Company, by the Pledgor, of the\nPledged Shares in satisfaction of certain obligations of the Pledgor, should a surrender of the collateral be agreed by the Company and the Pledgor. The note\npurchase agreement amendment also clarified that such surrendered Pledged Shares would become collateral for the Company's obligation under the note purchase\nagreement.\nThe note purchase agreement amendment also contains additional and modified reporting and information requirements, including amending the\nrequirement to deliver an audit report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, which report shall not include a “going concern” explanatory\nparagraph expressing substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern to exclude the audit opinion relating to the financial statements\nas of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, the note purchase agreement amendment clarifies that, to the extent, if any, that certain prior events\nrelated to the Pledge Agreement or amendments to the RJB Purchase Agreement constituted defaults under the note purchase agreement, such defaults are waived,\nthough it is the Company's position that no such defaults existed at any time.\nPublic Equity Offerings\nOn February 10, 2023, the Company launched an \"at-the-market\" equity offering under its November 2022 Shelf for sale from time to time of up to $70.0\nmillion of Class A common stock, and launched an \"at-the-market\" equity offering. As of February 28, 2023, as a result of the offering, the Company issued and\nsold 394,483 shares of its Class A common stock, resulting in $0.3 million of proceeds, net of commissions and offering costs.\nOn January 19, 2023, the Company completed an “at-the-market” equity offering, pursuant to its November 2022 Shelf. As a result of the offering, the\nCompany issued and sold 28,998,010 shares of its Class A common stock, resulting in $29.0 million of proceeds, net of commissions and offering costs.

The following description of the Company’s capital stock and provisions of the Company’s\nrestated certificate of incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), and its amended and restated by-laws (the “Bylaws”) are summaries and are\nqualified by reference to the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws, each of which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-\nK of which this Exhibit 4.2 is a part.\nAs of January 31, 2023, there were no shares of Class B common stock or Class C capital stock outstanding.

The\nboard of directors may pay or make a disparate dividend or distribution per share of Class A common stock, Class B common stock or Class C capital stock if such\ndisparate dividend or distribution is approved in advance by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock,\nClass B common stock and Class C capital stock, each voting separately as a class.\nVoting Rights\nHolders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of Class A common stock held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders,\nholders of Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes for each share of Class B common stock held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, and\nholders of Class C capital stock are not entitled to vote on any matter that is submitted to a vote of stockholders, except as otherwise required by law. Holders of\nClass A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of\nstockholders, unless otherwise required by law.

As a result of these conversions, pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation which provides for the\nautomatic conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock when the outstanding shares of Class B common stock represents less than 5% of the\ncombined voting power of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, each outstanding share of Class B common stock\nautomatically converted into one share of Class A common stock. Each share of Class B common stock or Class C capital stock that is converted into Class A\ncommon stock will thereupon automatically be retired and not be available for reissuance. If the Company subsequently wishes to issue more shares of Class B\ncommon stock or Class C capital stock than are then authorized for issuance, it would first have to amend its Certificate of Incorporation with the approval of its\nboard of directors and stockholders in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.\nAuthorized but Unissued Shares\n   The authorized but unissued shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock, Class C capital stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance\nwithout stockholder approval, subject to any limitations imposed by the listing rules of the New York Stock Exchange. These additional shares may be used for a\nvariety of corporate finance transactions, acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved capital stock and\npreferred stock could make more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Company by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.\nOther Rights\n   Holders of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C capital stock have no right to:\n•\nhave their stock redeemed;\n•\npurchase additional stock; or\n•\nmaintain their proportionate interest in our company.\nHolders of shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and capital stock are not required to make additional capital contributions.\nPreferred Stock\nUnder the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Company’s board of directors is authorized to direct the Company to issue shares of preferred stock\nin one or more series without stockholder approval.

The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions, future financings and\nother corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, a\nmajority of the Company’s outstanding voting stock.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\nDelaware Anti-Takeover Law\nThe Company is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Subject to certain exceptions, Section 203 prevents a publicly held\nDelaware corporation from engaging in a \"business combination\" with any \"interested stockholder\" for three years following the date that the person became an\ninterested stockholder, unless the interested stockholder attained such status with the approval of the board of directors or unless the business combination is\napproved in a prescribed manner. A \"business combination\" includes, among other things, a merger or consolidation involving the Company and the \"interested\nstockholder\" and the sale of more than 10% of the Company’s assets. In general, an \"interested stockholder\" is any entity or person beneficially owning shares\nrepresenting 15% or more of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding voting stock and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by\nsuch entity or person.\nStaggered Board; Removal of Directors\nHistorically, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provided for a classified board of directors consisting of three classes of approximately equal size,\neach serving staggered three-year terms. In 2021, the Company's board of directors and stockholders approved an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to\ndeclassify the board of directors. This amendment is referred to as the Declassification Amendment. The Declassification Amendment became effective in June\n2021. In accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation, as amended by the Declassification Amendment, directors will be elected to one-year terms of office\nbeginning at the Company's 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, such that at its 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, there will be a single class of directors\nsubject to annual election for one-year terms. Prior to the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, a person elected to fill a vacancy or a newly created directorship\nshall hold office until the next election of the class for which such director shall have been chosen.\nIn addition, a director may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the votes that all stockholders\nwould be entitled to cast for the election of directors. Any vacancy on the board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of the board of\ndirectors, may be filled only by vote of a majority of directors then in office.\nThe classification of the board of directors and the limitations on the removal of directors and filling of vacancies could make it more difficult for a third\nparty to acquire, or discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, control of the Company.\nSupermajority Voting\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law provides generally that the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on any matter is required to\namend a corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, unless a corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as the case may be, requires a greater\npercentage. The Bylaws may be amended or repealed by a majority vote of the board of directors or the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the\nvotes that all stockholders would be entitled to cast for the election of directors. In addition, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the votes that\nall stockholders would be entitled to cast for the election of directors is required to amend, repeal, or adopt any provisions inconsistent with any of the provisions of\nthe Certificate of Incorporation with respect to the staggered board, quorum of directors, and removal of directors and the provisions of the Certificate of\nIncorporation with respect to special meetings of the stockholders.\nStockholder Action; Special Meeting of Stockholders; Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations"

      "text": "The Certificate of Incorporation provides that any action required or permitted to be taken by stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or\nspecial meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders. The Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws also\nprovide that special meetings of stockholders can only be called by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer or the board of directors. In addition, the\nBylaws establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders, including proposed nominations of\ncandidates for election to the board of directors. Stockholders at an annual meeting may only consider proposals or nominations specified in the notice of meeting or\nbrought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors, or by a stockholder of record on the record date for the meeting, who is entitled to vote at\nthe meeting and who has delivered timely written notice in proper form to the secretary of the stockholder's intention to bring such business before the meeting.\nThese provisions could have the effect of delaying until the next stockholder meeting stockholder actions that are favored by the holders of a majority of the voting\npower of the Company’s outstanding voting securities. These provisions also could discourage a third party from making a tender offer for the Company’s capital\nstock, because even if it acquired a majority of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding voting stock, it would be able to take action as a stockholder, such as\nelecting new directors or approving a merger, only at a duly called stockholders meeting and not by written consent.\nIn addition, the Bylaws contain a proxy access provision that allows a stockholder or group of up to 20 stockholders owning at least 3% of the Company's\noutstanding shares of common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company's proxy materials director nominees constituting\nup to 20% of the number of directors in office or two nominees, whichever is greater, provided the stockholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the requirements in the\nbylaws. Stockholders must give timely written notice to the Company's secretary, in proper form, to include nominees in the Company's proxy materials for an\nannual meeting.\nChoice of Forum\nThe Certificate of Incorporation provides that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the\nState of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the\nCompany, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee or stockholder of the Company to it or its\nstockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law or as to which the General Corporation Law of the\nState of Delaware confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery, or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The Certificate of\nIncorporation further provides that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of\nAmerica shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended."
