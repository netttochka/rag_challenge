      "text": "5\nRecreation Lending\nRecreation lending is a high-growth business focused on originating prime and non-prime recreation loans. The segment is a\nsignificant source of income, accounting for 71% of our interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022. All of our recreation\nloans are serviced by a third-party loan servicer that we have used since the business’s inception.\nWe maintain relationships with approximately 3,100 dealers and financial service providers, or FSPs, not all of which are active\nat any one time. FSPs are entities that provide finance and insurance, or F&I, services to small dealers that do not have the desire or\nability to provide F&I services themselves. The ability of FSPs to aggregate the financing and relationship management for many small\ndealers makes them valuable to us. We receive approximately half of our loan volume from dealers and the other half from FSPs. Our\ntop ten dealer and FSP relationships were responsible for 48% of recreation lending’s new loan originations for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The percentage of new loan originations by the top ten dealer and FSP relationships is a measure of concentration,\nwhich management uses to determine whether to undertake diversification efforts, and which provides investors with information about\norigination concentration.\nThe recreation loan portfolio consists of thousands of geographically distributed loans with an average loan size of approximately\n$18,000 as of December 31, 2022. The loans are fixed rate with an average term at origination of 11.3 years. The weighted average\nmaturity of our loans outstanding is 9.6 years. The size, geographic dispersion, source and collateral variety of the loans reduces risk to\nthe Company. As of December 31, 2022, recreation loans were primarily secured by recreational vehicles, or RVs, which make up 58%\nof the portfolio, and boat loans, which make up 19% of the portfolio. Recreation loans are made to borrowers residing nationwide, with\nthe highest concentrations in Texas and Florida, at 16% and 11% of loans outstanding as of December 31, 2022 with no other states\nover 10%. As of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the weighted average FICO scores of our recreation loans outstanding were 671,\n668, and 658. The weighted average FICO scores at the time of origination for the loans funded in the years ended December 31, 2022,\n2021, and 2020 were 676, 684, and 680.\nHome Improvement Lending\nWorking directly with contractors and FSPs, we offer flexible customer financing for window, siding, and roof replacement,\nswimming pool installations, and other home improvement projects. Our core product is a standard installment loan, which features\naffordable monthly payments and competitive interest rates for prime credit customers at no cost to the contractor. We also offer a\nvariety of promotional loan options to help contractors close a challenging sale. Promotional loan options include same-as-cash, no\ninterest, and deferred payment features, which allow borrowers to reduce the total cost of financing or start repayments when it is most\nconvenient.\nHome improvement lending operates in a manner similar to recreation lending, with a few key differences. We currently maintain\na smaller number of relationships, with approximately 1,000 contractors and FSPs. Management monitors the number of contractors\nand FSPs and their relative contributions as a means of assessing market share and segment growth. Most of our home improvement-\nfinanced sales take place in the borrower’s home instead of a store, with the contractor presenting the borrower with a bid that includes\na financing option.\nA large proportion of our home improvement-financed sales are facilitated by contractor salespeople with limited financing\nbackgrounds rather than by contractor employees who provide F&I services. The result is contractor demand for financing services that\nfacilitate an in-home transaction (e.g., digital tools, including mobile applications for phone or tablet, support for E-SIGN compliant\nelectronic signatures, and extended operating hours), and additional resources for the salesperson throughout the financing process. Our\ntop ten contractors and FSP relationships were responsible for 62% of home improvement lending’s new loan originations for the year\nended December 31, 2022. The percentage of new loan originations by the top ten contractor and FSP relationships is a measure of\nconcentration, which management uses to determine whether to undertake diversification efforts, and which provides investors with\ninformation about origination concentration.\nWe offer home improvement loans with only fixed rates, with an average term at origination of 13.8 years. The weighted average\nmaturity of our loans outstanding is 12.4 years as of December 31, 2022. The average size of the loans in our home improvement\nportfolio at December 31, 2022 is approximately $20,000. The geographic dispersion of the home improvement loan portfolio\nsupplements credit quality in reducing risk to the Company. As of December 31, 2022, home improvement loans were concentrated in\nroofs, swimming pools, and windows at 37%, 23%, and 12%. Home improvement loans are made to borrowers residing nationwide,\nwith the highest concentrations in Texas, Florida, and Ohio at 10%, 10%, and 8% of loans outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and\nwith no other states over 6%. As of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the weighted average FICO scores of our home improvement\nloans outstanding were 753, 754, and 758. The weighted average FICO scores at the time of origination for the loans funded in the years\nended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were 758, 759, and 759."

      "text": "6\nCommercial Lending\nWe originate both senior and subordinated loans nationwide to businesses to finance either the purchase of the equipment and\nrelated assets necessary to open a new business or the purchase or improvement of an existing business. From the inception of the\ncommercial loan business, we have originated more than $1.0 billion in commercial loans. Commercial loans of $92.9 million comprised\n5% of our loans receivable as of December 31, 2022.\nWe have worked to increase our commercial loan activity, primarily because of the attractive higher yielding nature of most of\nthis business. We focus our marketing efforts on the manufacturing, professional, scientific, and technical services, more than 47% of\nwhich are located in the Midwest region, with the rest scattered across the country. These commercial loans are primarily secured by a\nsecond position on all assets of the businesses and generally range in amount from $2.0 million to $5.0 million at origination. As a\ncomponent of most of the transactions, a portion of the investment is an equity or partnership stake, and occasionally, we also receive\nwarrants to purchase an equity interest in the borrowers or some other form of success fee or profit participation. We plan to continue\nexpanding our commercial loan activities by developing a more diverse borrower base with a wider geographic area of coverage, and\nby expanding the targeted industries.\nCommercial loans are generally secured by equipment, accounts receivable, real estate, or other assets, and have interest rates\naveraging 473 basis points over the prevailing prime rate at the end of 2022, compared to 912 basis points over the prime rate at the end\nof 2021.\nMedallion Lending\nMedallion loans of $13.6 million comprised less than 1% of our loans receivable as of December 31, 2022. Including loans\nserviced for third parties, the total amount of medallion loans under our management was $33.1 million as of December 31, 2022.\nMedallion loans collateralized by New York City taxi medallions and related assets comprised 93% of the medallion loan portfolio\nas of December 31, 2022.\nOur medallion loans are secured by the taxi medallion and enhanced with personal guarantees of the owners, shareholders or\nequity members. When a borrower defaults on a loan, we have the ability to restructure the underlying loan or repossess the taxi\nmedallion collateralizing that loan and sell it in the market or through a foreclosure auction and pursue the personal guarantees, all of\nwhich we have done. We have recorded an allowance for loan losses against the loans to mitigate potential future losses, and since 2020,\nthe entire portfolio has remained on nonaccrual. Consistent with our established policy, once loans become 120 days past due, they are\ncharged off down to collateral value and transferred to loan collateral in process of foreclosure. Medallion loan collateral in process of\nforeclosure was $20.4 million as of December 31, 2022, with 82% located in the New York City Market.\nNew York City Market. A New York City taxi medallion is the only permitted license to operate a taxi and accept street hails in\nNew York City. As reported by the TLC, taxi medallions sold for a wide variety of prices during 2022 supporting our estimated value\nof $79,500, net of liquidation costs, as of December 31, 2022.\nA prospective taxi medallion owner must qualify under the taxi medallion ownership standards set and enforced by the TLC.\nThese standards prohibit individuals with criminal records from owning taxi medallions, require that the funds used to purchase taxi\nmedallions be derived from legitimate sources, and mandate that taxi vehicles and meters meet TLC specifications. In addition, before\nthe TLC will approve a taxi medallion transfer, the TLC requires a letter from the seller’s insurer stating that there are no outstanding\nclaims for personal injuries in excess of insurance coverage. After the transfer is approved, the owner’s taxi is subject to quarterly TLC\ninspections.\nMost New York City taxi medallion transfers are handled through approximately 18 taxi medallion brokers licensed by the TLC.\nIn addition to brokering taxi medallions, these brokers also arrange for TLC documentation insurance, vehicles, meters, and financing.\nWe have excellent relations with many of the most active brokers, and previously had received referrals from them regularly."

      "text": "7\nStrategic Partnerships\nIn 2019, the Bank launched a strategic partnership program to provide lending and other services to financial technology, or\nfintech, companies to offer loans and other financial services to customers. The Bank entered into an initial partnership in 2020 and\nbegan issuing its first loans. The associated activities are currently limited to originating loans or other receivables facilitated by our\nstrategic partners and selling those loans or receivables to our strategic partners or other third parties without recourse within a specified\ntime after origination, such as three business days. Revenues are currently derived primarily from contracted program fees paid to us by\nour strategic partners and interest income earned while the loans or receivables remain on our books, offset by any transaction fees paid\nby us to our strategic partners for their role in processing loan applications. We originated $49.5 million and $11.0 million of strategic\npartnership loans for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. We held $0.6 million and $0.1 million of strategic partnership loans\nas of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nOur Strategy\nOur core philosophy has been to identify markets that are profitable and where we can obtain defensible market positions. The\nkey elements of our strategy to grow our consumer lending (recreation and home improvement) and commercial lending businesses and\nincrease their profitability include:\nCapitalize on relationships with brokers and dealers. We are committed to establishing, building, and maintaining relationships\nwith our brokers and dealers. Our marketing efforts are focused on building relationships in the consumer markets as we work directly\nwith dealerships, contractors and FSPs to offer quality financing for their customers, including those with past credit challenges. We\nbelieve that relationships with dealers and brokers provide us with, in addition to loan origination opportunities, significant benefits,\nincluding an additional layer of due diligence and additional monitoring capabilities. We have assembled a management team that has\ndeveloped an extensive network of dealer and broker relationships in our target markets over the last 50 years. We believe that our\nmanagement team’s relationships with these dealers and brokers have provided and will continue to provide us with loan origination\nopportunities. In 2022, all of our consumer loans were generated by brokers, dealers, contractors, and FSPs.\nFocus on niche industries and our expertise in these niche fields. We specialize in providing consumer loans for the purchase of\nRVs, boats, and other consumer recreational equipment, and to finance home improvements through contractors and suppliers in the\nhome improvement sector. We believe our focus on these niche areas provides us with an opportunity to realize favorable returns.\nEmploy disciplined underwriting policies and maintain rigorous portfolio monitoring. We have an extensive loan underwriting\nand monitoring process. We conduct a thorough analysis of each potential loan and its prospects, competitive position, financial\nperformance, and industry dynamics. We stress the importance of credit and risk analysis in our underwriting process. We believe that\nour continued adherence to this disciplined process will permit us to continue to generate a stable, diversified and increasing revenue\nstream of current income from our earning assets to enable us to make distributions to our stockholders.\nLeverage the skills of our experienced management team. The members of our management team have broad investment\nbackgrounds, with prior experience in banking and non-bank consumer and commercial lending, at specialty finance companies, middle\nmarket commercial banks, and other financial services companies. We believe that the experience and contacts of our management team\nwill continue to allow us to effectively implement the key aspects of our business strategy.\nSeek strategic acquisitions. In addition to increasing market share in existing lending markets and identifying new niches, we seek\nto acquire other financing businesses and related portfolios, and specialty finance companies that make secured loans to small businesses\nand consumers which have experienced historically low loan losses similar to our own. Since our initial public offering in May 1996,\nwe have acquired eight specialty finance companies, five loan portfolios, and three taxi rooftop advertising companies.\nExpand our strategic partnership program. We launched an initial fintech partnership during 2020. These activities include\noriginating loans or other receivables marketed by our partners, and selling those loans or receivables to our partners or others, within a\nspecified time after origination, such as three business days. Revenues are derived primarily from contracted program fees paid to us by\nour partners, and interest income earned while the loans or receivables are on our books, offset by transaction fees paid to our partners\nfor processing loan applications. Our partners are non-banks offering loans and other financial services to their customers. We continue\nto evaluate and launch additional partnerships."

      "text": "8\nLoan Characteristics\nConsumer Loans. Consumer loans generally require equal monthly payments covering accrued interest and amortization of\nprincipal over a negotiated term, generally around eleven to fourteen years. Interest rates offered are fixed. Borrowers may prepay\nconsumer loans without any prepayment penalty. In general, the Bank has established relationships with dealers, FSPs, and contractors,\nwhich are the sources for consumer loan volumes. The loans are made up of recreation loans and home improvement loans which were\n65% and 35% of total consumer loans at December 31, 2022.\nOur recreation loans are secured primarily by RVs, boats and other consumer recreational equipment with a small proportion of\nloans secured by other collateral such as autos, motorcycles and boat motors. These loans, which together make up our largest and most\nprofitable loan portfolio, have a weighted average yield of 13.28% at December 31, 2022. Our home improvement loans are secured by\nthe personal property installed on real property, and the security interest for some of these loans is perfected with a UCC fixture filing.\nAs of December 31, 2022, these loans had a weighted average yield of 8.64%.\nCommercial Loans. We have typically originated commercial loans in principal amounts generally ranging from $2.0 million to\n$5.0 million, and occasionally have originated loans under or in excess of those amounts. These loans are generally retained and typically\nhave maturities ranging from three to ten years and require monthly payments ranging from full amortization over the loan term to fully\ndeferred interest and principal at maturity, with multiple payment options in between. Substantially all loans may be prepaid, and in the\nfirst five years, a prepayment fee may be owed to us. The term of, and interest rate charged on, certain of our outstanding loans are\nsubject to the regulations of the Small Business Administration, or the SBA. Under SBA regulations, the maximum rate of interest\npermitted on loans originated by us is 19%; however, terms and interest rates are subject to market competition for all loans.\nMedallion Loans. Our medallion loan portfolio consists of mostly fixed-rate loans, collateralized by first security interests in taxi\nmedallions and related assets. We estimate that the weighted average loan-to-value ratio of all of the medallion loans was 339% as of\nDecember 31, 2022, compared to 295% as of December 31, 2021. These ratios do not factor in the reserve on these loans of $9.5 million\nand $9.2 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and also do not include loan collateral in process of foreclosure, held at the lower\nof amortized cost or collateral value. In addition, we have recourse against the vast majority of the owners of the taxi medallions and\nrelated assets through personal guarantees. Other than in connection with dispositions of existing medallion assets, Medallion Financial\nCorp. has not originated a new medallion loan since 2015, and the Bank has not originated a new medallion loan since 2014.\nMarketing, Origination, and Loan Approval Process\nEach loan application is individually reviewed through analysis of several factors, including loan-to-value ratios, the borrower’s\ncredit history, public records, personal interviews, trade references, personal inspection of the premises, and approval from the TLC,\nSBA, or other regulatory body, if applicable. Each commercial and medallion loan applicant is required to provide personal or corporate\ntax returns, premises leases, and/or property deeds.\nThe Company’s senior management establishes loan origination criteria. Loans that conform to such criteria may be processed by\na loan officer with the proper credit authority, and non-conforming loans (other than those by the Bank) must be approved by the\nCompany’s Chief Executive Officer, President, and/or the Chief Credit Officer and the Investment Oversight Committee of the\nCompany’s board of directors. Loan criteria for loans originated with the Bank is established by the Bank’s board of directors and senior\nmanagement. The Bank’s policies identify specific approval authorities for its recreation and home improvement loans. Policy\nexceptions are reported to the Bank’s board of directors. Consumer loans are primarily sourced through relationships with RV and boat\ndealers, and home improvement contractors throughout our market area. Commercial loans are generally sourced through a network of\nprivate equity sponsors who we have long-standing relationships with, and are also referred by contacts with banks, attorneys, and\naccounting firms.\nSources of Funds\nManagement determines our funding sources, based upon an analysis of the respective financial and other costs and burdens\nassociated with funding sources. We also fund our lending operations through debt offerings and private placements, fixed-rate, senior\nsecured notes, long-term subordinated debentures issued to the SBA, as well as preferred equity securities at our subsidiaries. In the\npast, we have utilized credit facilities with banks, as well as equity and debt offerings, to fund our lending operations. Our funding\nstrategy and interest rate risk management strategy is to have the proper structuring of debt to minimize both rate and maturity risk,\nwhile maximizing returns with the lowest cost of funding over an intermediate period of time. Since the inception of the Bank,\nsubstantially all of the Bank’s borrowings have been provided by FDIC insured brokered certificates of deposit."

The mismatch between maturities and interest-rate\nsensitivities of these balance sheet items results in interest rate risk.

For additional discussion of our\nfunding sources and asset liability management strategy, see Asset/Liability Management on page 48.\nCompetition\nBanks, credit unions, and finance companies, some of which are SBICs, compete with us in originating consumer and commercial\nloans. Many of these competitors have greater resources than we have, and certain competitors are subject to less restrictive regulations\nthan we are. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and complete the financing transactions that will permit\nus to compete successfully.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2022 we employed 158 persons: 119 at Medallion Bank, 33 at our parent company, and 6 at Medallion\nCapital. This compares to 136 persons at the end of 2021: 95 at Medallion Bank, 34 at our parent company, and 7 at Medallion Capital.\nWe are committed to hiring inclusively, fostering an inclusive culture, and ensuring equitable pay for employees. We value\ndiversity among all of our employees. Equal employment opportunity is a fundamental principle at the Company, where employment is\nbased upon personal capabilities and qualifications. We prohibit and do not tolerate any discrimination against employees, applicants,\ninterns or any other covered persons, and we ensure equal employment opportunity without discrimination on the basis of race, color,\ncreed, religion, national origin, ancestry, ethnicity, citizenship status, physical or mental disability, age, sex (including pregnancy),\ngender, gender identity or gender expression (including transgender status), marital status, familial status, veteran status, genetic\ninformation or any other protected characteristic as established by applicable federal, state or local law.\nWe incentivize our employees through a combination of competitive salary, equity compensation and other benefits. We provide\nmost employees with incentive bonuses in the form of cash and equity. Employee equity ownership helps us attract, retain, motivate and\nreward employees, while aligning employee compensation with our stockholders’ interests by linking realizable pay with stock\nperformance.\nOur Compensation Committee reviews management’s recommendations and advises management and the Board of Directors on\nbroad compensation policies such as salary ranges, annual incentive bonuses, long-term incentive plans, including equity-based\ncompensation programs, and other benefit and perquisite programs.\nWe have a 401(k) Investment Plan and other generally available benefit programs like health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves,\nlife insurance, disability coverage, accident insurance and critical illness insurance; we believe that the availability of these benefit\nprograms generally enhance employee productivity and loyalty to the Company. We believe it is important for our employees at the\nBank to provide service to the communities in which they live and encourage them to take time, including prearranged work time, to\nparticipate in activities of local civic organizations, charitable or nonprofit organizations or educational institutions. We value employee\ndevelopment and training and are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our next-generation leaders. Our employee\nbenefits also help protect the health, well-being and financial security of our employees."

We expect to continue to fall within the exception from the definition of an “investment\ncompany” provided under Section 3(c)(6) of the 1940 Act as a company primarily engaged, directly or through majority-owned\nsubsidiaries, in the business of, among other things, (i) banking, (ii) purchasing and otherwise acquiring notes, drafts, acceptances, open\naccounts receivable, and other obligations representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise, insurance and services, and (iii)\nmaking loans to manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of, and to prospective purchasers of, specified merchandise, insurance, and\nservices. We monitor our continued compliance with this exception, and were compliant with as of December 31, 2022.\nRegulation of Medallion Bank as an Industrial Bank\nIn May 2002, we formed the Bank, which received approval from the FDIC for federal deposit insurance in October 2003. The\nBank is subject to extensive federal and state banking laws, regulations, and policies that are intended primarily for the protection of\ndepositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund, and the banking system as a whole; not for the protection of our other creditors and stockholders.\nUnder the banking charter, the Bank is authorized to make consumer and commercial loans, and may accept all FDIC-insured\ndeposits other than demand deposits (checking accounts). As a state-charted non-member bank with FDIC-insured deposits, the Bank\nis examined, supervised and regulated by the FDIC and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions, or the Utah DFI. The statutes\nenforced by, and regulations and policies of, these agencies affect almost all aspects of its business, including by prescribing permissible\ntypes of loans and investments, the amount of required capital, the permissible scope of its activities and various other requirements. If\nthe Bank’s regulators were to determine that we have violated banking laws and regulations, including by engaging in unsafe and\nunsound practices, the Bank could be subject to enforcement and other regulatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on its\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nCapital Standards\nThe Bank is subject to risk-based and leverage-based capital ratio requirements under the US Basel III capital rules adopted by\nthe federal banking regulators.\nUnder the risk-based capital standards, the Bank’s assets, exposures and certain off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk\ncategories, each with designated weights, and the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets.\nThe minimum capital ratios applicable to us are as follows:\n•\nCET1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), capital to risk-weighted assets. CET1\ncapital primarily includes common shareholders’ equity subject to certain regulatory adjustments and deductions, including\nwith respect to goodwill, intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets and accumulated other comprehensive income. The\nminimum CET1 risk-based capital ratio requirement is 4.5%.\n•\nTier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital primarily consists\nof CET1 capital and perpetual preferred stock. The minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio requirement is 6%.\n•\nTotal Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the ratio of total capital, including CET1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital and Tier\n2 capital, to risk-weighted assets. The Bank’s Tier 2 capital primarily includes allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25%\nof the Bank’s risk-weighted assets. The minimum total risk-based capital ratio requirement is 8%.\n•\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio, equal to the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets (net of goodwill, certain other intangible\nassets and certain other deductions). The minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement is 4%.\nThe prompt corrective action framework, which generally applies to FDIC-insured depository institutions, including the Bank,\nalso includes capital requirements the Bank must satisfy in order to, among other things, be able to accept brokered deposits without\nlimitations. See “Prompt Corrective Action” and “Brokered Deposits” below.\nIn addition to meeting the minimum capital requirements, under the U.S. Basel III capital rules, the Bank must also maintain the\nrequired capital conservation buffer of 2.5% to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions (including dividends on\nthe Bank’s preferred stock) and certain discretionary bonus payments to management. The capital conservation buffer is calculated as a\nratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and it effectively increases the required minimum risk-based capital ratios."

      "text": "11\nThe table below shows the capital requirements the Bank is required to maintain:\nMinimum U.S. Basel III Regulatory Capital\nRatio Plus Capital Conservation Buffer\nCET1 risk-based capital ratio\n7.0%\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio\n8.5%\nTotal risk-based capital ratio\n10.5%\nFor purposes of calculating the denominator of the three risk-based capital ratios, the assets of covered banking organizations are\ngiven risk weights that, under the US Basel III capital rules, range from 0% to 1,250%, depending on the nature of the asset. Most of\nthe Bank’s loans are assigned a 100% risk weight, with loans that are 90 days or more past due or on nonaccrual assigned a 150% risk\nweight. In addition, direct obligations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (U.S. Treasury), or obligations unconditionally guaranteed\nby the U.S. government have a 0% risk weight, while general obligation claims on states or other political subdivisions of the United\nStates are assigned a 20% risk weight, except for municipal or state revenue bonds, which have a 50% risk weight.\nThe U.S. Basel III capital rules provide for limited recognition in CET1 capital, and deduction from CET1 capital above certain\nthresholds, of three categories of assets: (i) deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that cannot be realized through net\noperating loss carrybacks (net of related valuation allowances and of deferred tax liabilities), (ii) mortgage servicing assets (net of\nassociated deferred tax liabilities) and (iii) investments in more than 10% of the issued and outstanding common stock of unconsolidated\nfinancial institutions (net of associated deferred tax liabilities). The federal banking regulators have adopted a rule that is designed to\nsimplify the capital treatment of those categories of assets for banking organizations, such as the Bank, that are not subject to the\nadvanced approaches in the U.S. Basel III capital rules.\nIn December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis\nregulatory reforms. Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee’s standardized approach for credit risk and provide\na new standardized approach for operational risk capital. The Basel Committee’s standards will generally be effective on January 1,\n2023. As with all standards proposed by the Basel Committee, the December 2017 standards are not effective in any jurisdiction until\nrules implementing such standards have been implemented by the relevant regulators in such jurisdiction. The U.S. federal bank\nregulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing these standards for the purposes of risk-based capital ratios.\nFederal banking regulators published a final rule, effective in April 2019, permitting banking organizations to phase in any adverse\nday-one regulatory capital effects of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 (referred to as the current expected credit loss model, or CECL), over\na period of three years. The Bank formally adopted CECL on January 1, 2023. For additional information on ASU 2016-13, see “Note\n1. Organization and summary of significant accounting policies” in the annual audited financial statements included elsewhere in this\nForm 10-K.\nThe Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018, or EGRRCPA, required the federal banking\nregulators to adopt regulations to implement an exemption from the U.S. Basel III capital rules for smaller banking organizations,\nincluding the Bank, that maintain a “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” of at least 8% to 10%. Specifically, the EGRRCPA provides\nthat if any depository institution or depository institution holding company with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets\nmaintains tangible equity in excess of this leverage ratio, as implemented by the federal banking regulators, it would be deemed to be\nin compliance with (i) the leverage and risk-based capital requirements promulgated by the federal banking agencies; (ii) in the case of\na depository institution, the capital ratio requirements to be considered “well-capitalized” under the federal banking agencies’ “prompt\ncorrective action” regime; and (iii) “any other capital or leverage requirements” to which the depository institution or holding company\nis subject, unless the appropriate federal banking agency determines otherwise based on the particular institution’s risk profile.\nThe FDIC has adopted a rule, implementing the Community Bank Leverage Ratio. Under the rule, the Community Bank Leverage\nRatio is the same as the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio under the Basel III capital rules and a qualifying small banking organization, such as the\nBank, that has less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and meets certain risk-based criteria can choose to apply the Community\nBank Leverage Ratio framework if its Community Bank Leverage Ratio is greater than 9%. The Bank has not elected and currently does\nnot expect to elect to apply the Community Bank Leverage Ratio framework, but will continue to assess the framework and may choose\nto apply it in the future.\nAs a condition to receipt of FDIC insurance, the Bank entered into the 2003 capital maintenance agreement with the FDIC\nrequiring it to maintain a 15% leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to average assets) and an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses and\nrestricting the amount of medallion loans that the Bank may finance to three times the Bank’s Tier 1 capital."

      "text": "12\nPrompt Corrective Action\nThe Bank is subject to FDIC regulations which apply to every FDIC-insured depository institution, setting out a system of\nmandatory and discretionary supervisory actions that generally become more severe as the capital levels of an individual institution\ndecline. Pursuant to provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or FDIA, and related regulations with respect to prompt corrective\naction, the federal banking regulators must take “prompt corrective action” with respect to FDIC-insured depository institutions that do\nnot meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA sets forth the following five capital categories: “well-capitalized,” “adequately\ncapitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” An insured depository institution’s\ncapital category depends upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are\nestablished by regulation.\n“Well-capitalized”\n“Adequately capitalized”\nCET1 risk-based capital ratio\n6.5%\n4.5%\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio\n8.0%\n6.0%\nTotal risk-based capital ratio\n10.0%\n8.0%\nTier 1 leverage ratio\n5.0%\n4.0%\nIf a bank meets the quantitative thresholds for well-capitalized status provided above and is not subject to any written agreement,\norder or directive from the appropriate regulatory agency to meet and maintain a specific capital level, it will qualify as well-capitalized.\nFailure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional\ndiscretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material adverse effect on the Bank’s operations or financial\ncondition. See “Brokered Deposits” below for additional information. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital\nrequirements could also result in restrictions on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory\napproval of applications. Pursuant to the 2003 capital maintenance agreement, the Bank has agreed that the Bank’s capital levels will at\nall times meet or exceed the levels required for the Bank to be considered well-capitalized under FDIC rules.\nBrokered Deposits\nThe Bank uses “brokered deposits” to fund a substantial portion of the Bank’s activities. Under the FDIA and related regulations,\nFDIC-insured institutions such as the Bank may only accept brokered deposits without FDIC permission if they meet specified capital\nstandards and are not subject to any written agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level, and are subject\nto restrictions with respect to the interest they may pay on deposits unless they are well-capitalized. In particular, the FDIA and the\nFDIC’s regulations prohibit an insured depository institution from accepting brokered deposits unless it is well-capitalized or is\nadequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC.\nUnder FDIC regulations governing brokered deposit and interest rate restrictions. A bank that is “adequately capitalized” and\naccepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate, at the time any such deposit is accepted, in excess\nof (i) 75 basis points over certain national rates described in the FDIC’s regulations or (ii) 90% of the highest interest rate paid on a\nparticular deposit product in the bank’s local market area, if the bank provides notice to the FDIC and evidence of such local rate. There\nare no such restrictions under the FDIC on a bank that is well-capitalized.\nPursuant to the 2003 capital maintenance agreement, the Bank has agreed that our capital levels will at all times meet or exceed\nthe level required for the Bank to be considered well-capitalized under FDIC rules. If the Bank was no longer able to accept or renew\nbrokered deposits as a result of failing to meet the requisite capital standards or as a result of being subject to a written agreement, order\nor directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level, there would be a material adverse effect on the Bank’s business, financial\ncondition, liquidity and results of operations.\nDeposit Insurance\nThe Bank’s deposits have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund, or DIF,\nis funded by assessments on insured depository institutions, such as us. The Bank’s assessment (subject to adjustment by the FDIC) is\ncurrently based on the Bank’s average total consolidated assets less the Bank’s average tangible equity during the assessment period,\nthe Bank’s supervisory ratings, and specified forward-looking financial measures used to calculate the assessment rate.\nIn October 2022, the FDIC adopted a rule applicable to all FDIC-insured banks that will increase initial base deposit insurance\nassessment rates by 2 basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The FDIC, as required under the FDIA,\nestablished a plan in September 2020 to restore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent within\neight years. The increased assessment is intended to improve the likelihood that the DIF reserve ratio would reach the required minimum\nby the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028."

      "text": "13\nPayment of Dividends\nThe power of the board of directors of an insured depository institution to declare a cash dividend or other distribution with respect\nto capital is subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions that limit the amount available for such distribution, depending upon earnings,\nfinancial condition and cash needs of the institution, as well as general business conditions. Insured depository institutions are also\nprohibited from paying management fees to any controlling persons or, with certain limited exceptions, making capital distributions,\nincluding dividends, if after such transaction the institution would be less than adequately capitalized.\nUnder Utah law, the Bank may only declare dividends to the Bank’s shareholders out of the Bank’s net profits, after providing for\nall expenses, losses, interest and taxes accrued or due. Further, the Bank is required to transfer to a surplus fund at least 10% of the\nBank’s net profits before dividends for the period covered by the dividend until the surplus fund reaches 100% of the Bank’s capital\nstock. Any amount paid from the Bank’s net earnings into a fund for the retirement of outstanding debt capital instruments or preferred\nstock for the period covered by the dividend will be considered an addition to the Bank’s surplus fund if, upon the retirement of such\ninstruments, the amount paid into the retirement fund for the period may be properly carried to the Bank’s surplus fund.\nThe federal banking agencies also have authority to prohibit depository institutions from engaging in business practices that are\nconsidered unsafe or unsound, possibly including payment of dividends or other payments under certain circumstances even if such\npayments are not expressly prohibited by statute.\nIn addition, as discussed under “Capital Standards,” if the Bank’s risk-based capital ratios do not satisfy the minimum risk-based\nrequirements plus the capital conservation buffer, the Bank will face graduated constraints on, among other things, capital distributions\n(including dividends on the Bank’s preferred stock) based on the amount of the shortfall and the amount of the Bank’s eligible retained\nincome. For these purposes, eligible retained income is defined as the greater of (i) net income for the four preceding quarters, net of\ndistributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income; and (ii) the average net income over the preceding four quarters.\nSafety and Soundness\nThe FDIA also implemented certain specific restrictions on transactions and required federal banking regulators to adopt overall\nsafety and soundness standards for depository institutions related to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems,\nloan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and\ncompensation, fees and benefits, and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate. Guidelines\nadopted by the federal banking regulators establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit\nsystems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and benefits. In general,\nthese guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified\nin the guidelines. These guidelines also prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation\nas excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee,\ndirector or principal shareholder. The federal banking agencies may require an institution to submit to an acceptable compliance plan as\nwell as have the flexibility to pursue other more appropriate or effective courses of action given the specific circumstances and severity\nof an institution’s noncompliance with one or more standards. The FDIC may also terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the\ninstitution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any\napplicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.\nAmong other things, in addition to the restrictions on brokered deposits discussed above, the FDIA limits the interest rates paid\non deposits by undercapitalized institutions and limits the aggregate extensions of credit by a depository institution to an executive\nofficer, director, principal shareholder or related interest.\nConsumer Financial Protection\nThe Bank is subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern the Bank’s consumer\nlending businesses. These laws include, but are not limited to, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the\nTruth in Lending Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and these laws’ respective state-law counterparts, as well as laws regarding\nunfair and deceptive acts and practices. These federal and state laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and\nterms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit\nreport information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices and subject the Bank to\nsubstantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from\nlitigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys’ fees. Federal banking regulators, state attorneys\ngeneral and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these\nand other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with\nconsumer protection requirements may also result in substantial reputational harm that could adversely affect our business."

      "text": "14\nCommunity Reinvestment Act of 1977\nThe Bank is subject to certain requirements and reporting obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA. Under\nthe CRA, the Bank has an obligation, consistent with safe and sound operations, to help meet the credit needs of our assessment area\nincluding low- and moderate-income individuals and communities in that assessment area. In connection with its examination of the\nBank, the FDIC is required to assess our CRA performance in the areas of lending, investments and services. The FDIC may take\ncompliance with the CRA into account when regulating and supervising our other activities. The CRA also requires the agencies to take\ninto account banks’ records of meeting community credit needs when evaluating applications for, among other things, new branches or\nmergers. We have elected to be evaluated for our compliance with CRA requirements based on a strategic plan we adopted with public\ninvolvement and regulatory approval. That strategic plan includes measurable goals for helping to meet the credit needs of our\nassessment area, and is available on our website. The CRA provides that CRA examination ratings be made public. The Bank received\na rating of “Outstanding” in its most recently completed CRA examination.\nIn May 2022, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or OCC, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, or Federal Reserve, requested comment on a joint notice of proposed rulemaking intended to strengthen and modernize the\nCRA by: (i) expanding access to credit, investment, and basic banking services in low- and moderate-income communities; (ii) adapting\nto technological changes in the banking industry; (iii) standardizing metrics used for CRA evaluation for greater clarity, consistency and\ntransparency in the application of the regulations; (iv) clarifying which activities qualify for CRA credit; and (v) tailoring CRA rules\nand data collection to bank size and business model. Comments were due by August 5, 2022. The Bank will continue to evaluate any\nchanges to the CRA regulations and their impact to the Bank’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nTransactions with Affiliates and Insiders\nThe Bank is subject to certain federal laws that restrict and control our ability to extend credit and provide to or receive services\nfrom its affiliates under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated thereunder. An affiliate of a\nbank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. These restrictions include\nquantitative and qualitative limits on the amounts and types of transactions that may take place, including the transfer of funds by the\nBank to certain of its affiliates in the form of loans, extensions of credit, investments, or purchases of assets. These restrictions also\nrequire that credit transactions with affiliates be collateralized and that its transactions with affiliates be on terms no less favorable to\nthe Bank than comparable transactions with unrelated third parties. Generally, the Bank’s covered transactions with any affiliate are\nlimited to 10% of our capital stock and surplus, and covered transactions with all affiliates are limited to 20% of our capital stock and\nsurplus.\nThe Bank is also subject to limits under federal law on its ability to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and principal\nshareholders (persons that beneficially own or control more than 10% of any class of our voting stock), as well as to entities owned or\ncontrolled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to such insiders are required to be made on terms that follow credit\nunderwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing for comparable transactions with non-insiders. Also, the terms\nof such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of non-repayment or present other unfavorable features and may\nnot exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons individually and in the aggregate. Certain extensions of\ncredit also require the approval of the Bank’s board of directors.\nFinancial Privacy and Cybersecurity\nFederal and state law contains extensive consumer privacy protection provisions. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires financial\ninstitutions to periodically disclose their privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and enables retail customers\nto opt out of institutions’ ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. Other federal and state\nlaws and regulations impact our ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing\npurposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also requires financial institutions to implement\na comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and\nconfidentiality of customer records and information. Federal law also makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to\nobtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.\nState regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. In recent\nyears, several states adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing\ndetailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also implemented or\nmodified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements.\nIn addition, pursuant to requirements applicable to FDIC-supervised banking organizations, such as us, we are required to notify\nthe FDIC within 36 hours of incidents that have materially disrupted, or degraded, or are reasonably likely to materially disrupt or\ndegrade the banking organization’s ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key\noperations of the banking organization, or pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States."

      "text": "15\nAnti-Money Laundering and the USA PATRIOT Act\nThe Bank is subject to the anti-money laundering (AML) provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, or the BSA, as amended by the\nUSA PATRIOT Act, or the PATRIOT Act, and implementing regulations issued by the FDIC and the U.S. Treasury. The PATRIOT\nAct, which includes the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001, is intended to facilitate\nthe detection and prosecution of terrorism and international money laundering. The PATRIOT Act establishes standards for verifying\ncustomer identification incidental to the opening of new accounts. Other provisions of the PATRIOT Act provide for special information\nsharing procedures governing communications with the government and other financial institutions with respect to suspected terrorists\nand money laundering activity, and enhancements to suspicious activity reporting, including electronic filing of suspicious activity\nreports over a secure filing network. The BSA requires all financial institutions, including banks, to, among other things, establish a\nrisk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA\nincludes a variety of record-keeping and reporting requirements (such as cash and suspicious activity reporting), as well as due\ndiligence/know-your-customer documentation requirements. The U.S. Treasury’s Office of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network,\nor FinCEN, issued a final rule, applicable as of May 2018, to clarify and enhance customer due diligence requirements for financial\ninstitutions. The rule (among other things) imposes certain obligations on covered financial institutions with respect to their “legal entity\ncustomers,” including corporations, limited liability companies and other similar entities. For each such customer that opens an account\n(including an existing customer opening a new account), the covered financial institution must identify and verify the customer’s\n“beneficial owners,” who are specifically defined in the rule. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with\ncustomer due diligence obligations. The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, or AMLA, which amends the BSA, is intended to\ncomprehensively reform and modernize US anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, the AMLA codifies a risk-based approach\nto AML compliance for financial institutions; requires the US Department of the Treasury to promulgate priorities for anti-money\nlaundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy; requires the development of standards by the Treasury Department for\ntesting technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; expands enforcement- and investigations - related authority, including a\nsignificant expansion in the available sanctions for certain BSA violations and expands BSA whistleblower incentives and protections.\nMany of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact of the\nAMLA, including on our compliance costs and compliance risk relating to the BSA, will depend on, among other things, rulemaking\nand implementation guidance.\nIn June 2021, FinCEN issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy required\nunder the AMLA. The priorities include: corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human\ntrafficking and proliferation financing.\nRegulation by the SBA\nMedallion Funding, Medallion Capital, and Freshstart are each licensed by the SBA to operate as SBICs, under the Small Business\nInvestment Act of 1958, as amended, or the SBIA. The SBIA authorizes the licensing of privately-held investment vehicles as SBICs in\norder to provide long term financing to small business concerns. Under the SBIA and the regulations promulgated by the SBA\nthereunder, a “small business concern” is a business that is independently owned and operated, which is not dominant in its field of\noperation, and which (i) has a tangible net worth, together with any affiliates, of $19.5 million or less and average annual net income\nafter US federal income taxes for the preceding two fiscal years of $6.5 million or less (average annual net income is computed without\nthe benefit of any carryover loss), or (ii) satisfies alternative criteria under the Federal government’s North American Industry\nClassification System, or the NAICS, that assigns codes to the industry in which a small business is engaged and provides a small\nbusiness size standard based either on the number of persons employed by the business or its gross revenues. In addition, at the end of\neach fiscal year, at least 25% of the total amount of investments must be made in “smaller enterprises” that have a net worth of $6.0\nmillion or less, and average net income after federal income taxes for the preceding two years of $2.0 million or less. A business that\nmeets the NAICS size standards also qualifies as a “smaller enterprise” for purposes of meeting SBA’s size standard regulations.\nInvestments by SBICs must generally be in active, primarily domestic businesses. SBIC regulations preclude investment in the\nfollowing types of businesses: (1) business whose primary business activity is as a relender or reinvestor (that is, directly or indirectly,\nproviding funds to others, purchasing debt obligations, factoring, or long term leasing of equipment with no provision for maintenance\nor repair); (2) many kinds of real estate projects; (3) single purpose projects that are not continuing businesses; (4) companies located\noutside the US intending to use the proceeds of the investment outside of the US or companies that are located in the US that have more\nthan 49% of their employees or tangible assets located outside of the US; (5) businesses that are passive and do not carry on an active\ntrade or business; (6) businesses that use 50% or more of the funds to buy goods or services from an associated supplier; and (7) certain\n“sin businesses” such as gambling and the like."

As of December 31, 2022, the maximum rate of interest permitted on loans originated by Medallion Funding, Medallion\nCapital, and Freshstart was 19%. As of December 31, 2022, our outstanding medallion loans had a weighted average rate of interest of\n2.09%, and our outstanding commercial loans had a weighted average rate of interest of 12.23%. Current SBA regulations also require\nthat each loan originated by an SBIC has a term between one and 20 years.\nIn addition, SBICs are subject to periodic examination by the SBA, for which the SBA charges examination fees. SBICs must\nmaintain certain records and make them available for SBA examination. SBICs also are required to prepare valuations of their portfolio\ninvestments in accordance with prescribed valuation guidelines, maintain certain minimum levels of capital, file annual reports\ncontaining financial, management and other information and file notices of certain material changes in their ownership and operations.\nWe are typically examined by the SBA for compliance with applicable SBA regulations.\nSBICs are precluded from making investments in a small business if it would give rise to certain conflicts of interest. Generally,\na conflict of interest may arise if an associate of the SBIC has or makes an investment in the small business that the SBIC is financing\nor serves as one of its officers or would otherwise benefit from the financing. A conflict of interest would also occur if an SBIC were to\nlend money to any of its officers, directors, and employees, or invest in any affiliates thereof. Joint investing with an associate (such as\nanother fund controlled by affiliates of the general partner of the fund) may be made on identical terms or on terms that are fair to the\nSBIC. The SBA also prohibits, without prior SBA approval, a “change of control” or transfers which would result in any person (or\ngroup of persons acting in concert) owning 10% or more of any class of capital stock of an SBIC. A “change of control” is any event\nwhich would result in the transfer of the power, direct or indirect, to direct the management and policies of an SBIC, whether through\nownership, contractual arrangements, or otherwise.\nUnder SBA regulations, without prior SBA approval, loans and other investments by licensees with outstanding SBA leverage to\nany single small business concern may not exceed 30% of an SBIC’s “regulatory capital.”\nSBICs may invest idle funds that are not being used to make loans or other long-term investments in certain short-term investments\npermitted under SBA regulations. These permitted investments include direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal\nand interest by, the government of the US with a term of 15 months or less and deposits maturing in one year or less issued by an\ninstitution insured by the FDIC. These permitted investments must be maintained in (i) direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed\nas to principal and interest by, the US, which mature within 15 months from the date of the investment; (ii) repurchase agreements with\nfederally insured institutions with a maturity of seven days or less if the securities underlying the repurchase agreements are direct\nobligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the US, and such securities must be maintained in a custodial\naccount in a federally insured institution; (iii) mutual funds, securities, or other instruments that exclusively consist of, or represent\npooled assets of, investments described in (i) or (ii) above; (iv) certificates of deposit with a maturity of one year or less, issued by a\nfederally insured institution; (v) a deposit account in a federally insured institution, subject to withdrawal restriction of one year or less;\n(vi) a checking account in a federally insured institution; or (vii) a reasonable petty cash fund.\nSBICs may purchase voting securities of small business concerns in accordance with SBA regulations. Although prior regulations\nprohibited an SBIC from controlling a small business concern except in limited circumstances, SBA regulations allow an SBIC to\nexercise control over a small business for a period of seven years from the date on which the SBIC initially acquires its control position.\nThis control period may be extended for an additional period of time with the SBA’s prior written approval.\nIf an SBIC defaults in its payment obligations to SBA under its outstanding debentures, fails to comply with any terms of its\nsecurities, or violates any law or certain regulations applicable to it, the SBA has the right to accelerate the maturity of all amounts due\nunder its debentures. Additionally, the SBA may appoint a receiver for the SBIC and for its liquidation in the event of a default on\npayment of a SBIC’s debentures or for serious regulatory violations."

Under the Change\nin Bank Control Act, control is conclusively presumed if, among other things, a person or company acquires 25% or more of any class\nof the Bank’s voting stock. A rebuttable presumption of control arises if a person or company acquires 10% or more of any class of\nvoting stock and is subject to several specified “control factors” as set forth in the applicable regulations. Although the Bank is an\n“insured depository institution” within the meaning of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Change in Bank Control Act,\nyour investment in the Company is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC, or any other agency, and is subject to loss. Under\nthe Utah Financial Institutions Act, control is defined as the power, directly or indirectly, or through or in concert with one or more\npersons to: (a) direct or exercise a controlling influence over (i) the management or policies of a financial institution or (ii) the election\nof a majority of the directors or trustees of an institution; or (b) to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a financial\ninstitution. In addition, under Utah law, there is a rebuttable presumption that a person has control of a Utah financial institution if the\nperson has the power, directly or indirectly, or through or in concert with one or more persons, to vote more than 10% but not less than\n25% of any class of voting securities of a financial institution. If any holder of any series of the Bank’s preferred stock is or becomes\nentitled to vote for the election of the Bank’s directors, such series will be deemed a class of voting stock, and any other person will be\nrequired to obtain the non-objection of the FDIC under the Change in Bank Control Act to acquire or maintain 10% or more of that\nseries. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of our common stock in excess of the\namount which can be acquired without regulatory approval.\nExamination and Supervision\nFederal and state banking agencies require the Bank to prepare annual reports on financial condition and to conduct an annual\naudit of financial affairs in compliance with minimum standards and procedures. We must undergo regular on-site examinations by the\nFDIC and the Utah DFI, which examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance responsibilities. A bank regulator\nconducting an examination has complete access to the books and records of the examined institution. The results of the examination are\nconfidential, with the exception of the CRA examination discussed above. The cost of examinations may be assessed against the\nexamined institution as the agency deems necessary or appropriate.\nIncentive Compensation\nThe FDIC has issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive\ncompensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging\nexcessive risk taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an\norganization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive\ncompensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not\nencourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk\nmanagement and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board\nof directors.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, to establish\njoint regulations or guidelines at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets, such as us, prohibiting incentive-\nbased payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk-taking by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal\nshareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. The federal banking\nregulators and the SEC proposed revised rules in 2016, which have not been finalized."

Under the Valid-When-Made Rule, the interest rate on a bank-made loan remains valid and enforceable even after\nthe bank sells or transfers it to a party that could not have originated the loan on the same terms as the bank. The Valid-When-Made\nRule does not address when a state-chartered bank is the “true lender” of a loan, and the ultimate effect of the FDIC rule remains\nuncertain in light of the overturning of the OCC's analogous rule pursuant to a Congressional Review Act resolution signed by President\nBiden, and other pending legal challenges to bank-fintech partnerships on the ground that the bank is not the “true lender.” On August\n20, 2020, the state attorneys general of seven states and the District of Columbia filed suit against the FDIC, alleging that the Valid-\nWhen-Made Rule conflicts with the FDIA, exceeds the FDIC’s statutory authority, and violates the Administrative Procedure Act. On\nFebruary 8, 2022, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted the FDIC's motion for summary\njudgement, holding that the FDIC had the power to issue the Valid-When-Made Rule and that its interpretation of the federal banking\nlaws is entitled to judicial deference. The consortium of states may choose to appeal the ruling; however, we believe the impact to the\nBank, regardless of outcome, would be minimal.\nFuture Legislation\nCongress may enact legislation from time to time that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures\nmay enact legislation from time to time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in those states. Federal\nand state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing\nregulations are applied. The substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof, cannot be\npredicted, although enactment of the proposed legislation could impact the regulatory structure under which we operate and may\nsignificantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital\nand modify our business strategy, and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nOur corporate website is located at www.medallion.com.

      "text": "19\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Loan Portfolios and Business\nOur business is heavily concentrated in consumer lending, which carries a high risk of loss that is different from and\ntypically higher than the risk of loss associated with commercial lending and which could be adversely affected by an economic\ndownturn and inflation.\nOur business is heavily concentrated in consumer lending. As a result, we are more susceptible to fluctuations and risks particular\nto consumer credit than a more diversified company would be. Our business is particularly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions that\naffect the US economy, consumer spending and consumer credit, including for example, the impacts of inflation, which has had and\ncould continue to have an adverse effect on consumer spending, a rising interest rate environment and the ongoing effects of the COVID-\n19 pandemic, as well as the impact that geopolitical responses to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have had on gasoline prices in the United\nStates. We are also more susceptible to the risks of increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions that are targeted at\nconsumer credit or the specific consumer credit products that we offer (including promotional financing). Our business concentration\ncould have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nBy its nature, lending to consumers carries with it different risks and typically a higher risk of loss than commercial lending.\nAlthough the net interest margins are intended to be higher to compensate us for this increased risk, an economic downturn could result\nin higher loss rates and lower returns than expected, and could affect the profitability of our consumer loan portfolios. During periods\nof economic slowdown, delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses generally increase, and consumers may reduce their\ndiscretionary spending in areas such as recreation and home improvement, which constitute a significant majority of our business. These\nperiods have been, and may continue to be, accompanied by increasing unemployment rates and declining values of consumer products\nsecuring outstanding accounts, which weaken collateral coverage and increase the amount of a loss in the event of default.\nFor example, the spread of COVID-19 in early 2020 created a global public-health crisis that resulted in widespread volatility and\ndeterioration in employment levels as well as business, economic and market conditions. In March 2020, we adjusted our payment\npolicies and procedures and created a program to support our borrowers during the pandemic, including by allowing borrowers to defer\npayments for up to 180 days. For 2020, the impact of this program was material to our operating results and financial position. The\nlingering effects of COVID-19 on New York City, where economic activity generally and taxi ridership in particular decreased\ndramatically during the pandemic and have not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels, and on all our other major medallion loan markets,\nlargely prevented our payment deferral program from being effective for our medallion loans. During the third quarter of 2020, we\nplaced all medallion loans on nonaccrual and adjusted them down to the collateral value, net of liquidation cost. We are continuing to\nevaluate options for our medallion loans, and actions that we may take to manage our medallion loan portfolio may result in additional\nwrite-downs, charge-offs or impairments, the impact of which could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we believe that our deferral programs were effective in mitigating the effect of COVID-19 on our recreation and home\nimprovement loan portfolios, the ultimate effects of COVID-19 on these loan portfolios and consumer businesses are uncertain, and we\ncould suffer substantial losses in our recreation and home improvement loan portfolios as a result of the effects of the pandemic on the\nability of our borrowers to repay their loans.\nAdditionally, higher gasoline prices, inflation, volatile real estate values and market conditions, reset of adjustable rate mortgages\nto higher interest rates, general availability of consumer credit, or other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income\ncould increase loss frequency and decrease consumer demand for RVs, boats, consumer recreational equipment and other consumer\nproducts (including in connection with home improvement projects), as well as weaken collateral values on certain types of consumer\nproducts. Any decrease in consumer demand for those products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to originate new\nloans and, accordingly, on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlthough declines in commodity prices, and more particularly gasoline prices, generally are financially beneficial to the individual\nconsumer, these declines may also have a negative impact on unemployment rates in geographic areas that are highly dependent upon\nthe oil and natural gas industry, which could adversely affect the credit quality of consumers in those areas.\nOur balance sheet consists of a significant percentage of non-prime consumer loans, which are associated with higher than average\ndelinquency rates. The actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses on these loans could be more dramatically\naffected by a general economic downturn. In addition, during an economic slowdown or recession, our servicing costs may increase\nwithout a corresponding increase in our net interest income."

      "text": "20\nFurthermore, our business is significantly affected by monetary and regulatory policies of the US Federal Government and its\nagencies. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control\nand could have a material adverse effect on us, including current higher interest rates, costs of compliance with increased regulation,\nand other factors. For example, the Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds Rate several times in 2022 and early 2023 and is expected\nto continue doing so while inflation remains above historical levels in the United States. If inflationary pressures persist, our interest\nexpense could increase faster than our interest income, reducing our net interest income and net interest margin, and continuing adverse\nimpacts on consumer spending could reduce demand for our consumer loan products. These developments, along with United States\ngovernment credit, debt ceiling and deficit concerns, global economic uncertainties and market volatility and the ongoing impacts of\nCOVID-19, have caused and could continue to cause interest rates to be volatile.\nThe process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires complex judgments, including forecasts of economic\nconditions and how those economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. The degree of uncertainty\nconcerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates, which may, in turn, impact the reliability of the\nprocess and the quality of our assets.\nOur financial condition, liquidity and results of operations depend on the credit performance of our loans.\nAs of December 31, 2022, 44% of our recreation loans were non-prime receivables with obligors who do not qualify for\nconventional consumer finance products as a result of, among other things, adverse credit history. While our underwriting guidelines\nare designed to confirm that, notwithstanding such factors, the obligor would be a reasonable credit risk, the receivables nonetheless are\nexpected to experience higher default rates than a portfolio of obligations of prime obligors. The weakening of our underwriting\nguidelines for any reason, such as in response to the competitive environment, in an effort to originate higher yielding loans, a lack of\ndiscipline or diligence by our employees in underwriting and monitoring loans or our inability to adequately adapt policies and\nprocedures to changes in economic or other conditions, may result in loan defaults and charge-offs that may necessitate increases to our\nallowance for loan losses, each of which could adversely affect our net income and financial condition. In the event of a default on a\nrecreation loan, generally the most practical recovery method is repossession of the financed vehicle, although the collateral value of\nthe vehicle usually does not fully cover the outstanding account balance and costs of recovery. Repossession sales that do not yield\nsufficient proceeds to repay the receivables in full typically result in losses on those receivables.\nIn addition, our prime portfolio has grown in proportion to our overall portfolio over the past several years. While prime portfolios\ntypically have lower default rates than non-prime portfolios, we have less ability to make risk adjustments to the pricing of prime loans\ncompared to non-prime loans. As a result, to the extent our prime portfolio continues to grow, a larger proportion of our business will\nconsist of loans with respect to which we will have less flexibility to adjust pricing to absorb losses. As a result of these factors, we may\nsustain higher losses than anticipated in our prime portfolio. Additionally, if our prime loan losses are higher than expected then we may\nalso be at risk with regard to our forecasted losses, which could impact our loss reserves and results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to cover losses on our loans.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses (a reserve established through a provision for losses that decreases our earnings and\nthat, accordingly, affects our financial condition) that we believe is appropriate to provide for incurred losses in our loan portfolio.\nThe process for establishing an allowance for loan losses is critical to our results of operations and financial condition, and requires\ncomplex models and judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, such\nas inflation and the risk of recession, growth in our loan portfolio, changes in the credit characteristics of our loan portfolio, new\ninformation regarding our loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for\nloan losses. In cases where we modify loans, if the modified loans do not perform as anticipated, we may be required to establish\nadditional allowances on these loans. As of December 31, 2022, the overall allowance for loan losses increased from December 31,\n2021, due in part to a higher allowance coverage ratio related to our recreation and home improvement loan portfolios, a result of the\nincreased net charge-offs in 2022, compared to 2021.\nWe periodically review and update our methodology, models and the underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments we use\nto establish our allowance for loan losses to reflect our view of current conditions. Moreover, our regulators, as part of their supervisory\nfunction, periodically review the methodology, models and the underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments we use for\ncalculating, and the adequacy of, our allowance for loan losses. Our regulators, based on their judgment, may conclude that we should\nmodify our methodology, models or the underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments, increase our allowance for loan losses,\nand/or recognize further losses. We continue to review and evaluate our methodology, models and the underlying assumptions,\nestimates, and assessments we use and we will implement further enhancements or changes to them, as needed. We cannot provide\nassurance that our loan loss reserves will be sufficient to cover actual losses. Future increases in the allowance for loan losses or\nrecognized losses (as a result of any review, update, regulatory guidance, changes in accounting standards or otherwise) will result in a\ndecrease in net earnings and capital and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition."

      "text": "21\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if we are unsuccessful in\ndeveloping and maintaining relationships with dealerships, contractors, and FSPs.\nWe originate loans by working with third-party sellers of consumer products and not by working directly with consumers. As a\nresult, our ability to originate consumer loans depends on relationships with a limited number of dealerships, contractors, and FSPs.\nAlthough we have relationships with various dealerships, contractors, and FSPs, none of relationships are exclusive and each may be\nterminated at any time. In addition, a large proportion of our new loan originations are concentrated in our top ten relationships (62% in\nour home improvement portfolio and 48% in our recreation portfolio), the loss of a significant relationship could have a negative effect\non demand for our products and our new loan originations. There is also significant competition for the contractor and FSP relationships\nwe depend on in connection with our home improvement lending segment. The loss of any of these relationships, our failure to develop\nadditional relationships, and circumstances in which our existing dealership, contractor, and FSP relationships generate decreased sales\nand loan volume all may have a material adverse effect on a substantial part of our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA reduction in demand for our products and failure by us to adapt to such reduction could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nThe demand for the products we offer may be reduced due to a variety of factors, such as demographic patterns, changes in\ncustomer preferences or financial conditions, macroeconomic conditions, regulatory restrictions that decrease customer access to\nparticular products or the availability of competing products. If we fail to adapt to significant changes in our customers’ demand for, or\naccess to, our products, our revenues could decrease and our operations could be adversely affected. Even if we do make changes to our\nproduct offerings to fulfill customer demand, customers may resist such changes or may reject such products. Moreover, the effect of\nany product change on the results of our business may not be fully ascertainable until the change has been in effect for some time, and,\nby that time, it may be too late to make further modifications to such product without causing further adverse effects to our business,\nresults of operations, and financial condition.\nDecreases or increases in prevailing interest rates could adversely affect our business, our cost of capital and our net\ninterest income.\nOur commercial borrowers have the right to prepay their loans in full or in part at any time. Commercial borrowers are subject to\na prepayment penalty of up to 5% during the first year, declining by one percentage point through the fifth year. A borrower is likely to\nexercise prepayment rights at a time when the interest rate payable on the borrower’s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates. In\na lower interest rate environment, we will have difficulty re-lending prepaid funds at comparable rates, which may reduce the net interest\nincome that we receive. When this occurs, we will generally reinvest these proceeds in temporary investments, pending their future\ninvestment in new portfolio companies. These temporary investments will typically have substantially lower yields than the debt being\nprepaid, and we could experience significant delays in reinvesting these amounts. Any future investment in a new portfolio company\nmay also be at lower yields than the debt that was repaid. As a result, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if\na substantial number of our portfolio companies elect to prepay amounts owed to us and we are not able to reinvest the proceeds for\ncomparable yields in a timely fashion. Additionally, prepayments could negatively impact our return on equity, which could result in a\ndecline in the market price of our common stock.\nOur profitability may be directly affected by interest rate levels and fluctuations in interest rates. As interest rates change, our\ngross interest rate spread on originations either increases or decreases because the rates charged on the loans originated are limited by\nmarket and competitive conditions, restricting our ability to pass on increased interest costs to the consumer. Additionally, although a\nsignificant percentage of our borrowers are non-prime and are not highly sensitive to interest rate movement, increases in interest rates\nmay reduce the volume of loans we originate. While we monitor the interest rate environment and seek to mitigate the impact of increased\ninterest rates, we cannot provide assurance that the impact of changes in interest rates can be successfully mitigated.\nIn addition, the majority of our loan portfolio is comprised of fixed-rate loans. To the extent our funding costs increase in response\nto an increase in market rates of interest, an abrupt increase in market rates of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until\nwe are able to originate new loans at higher prevailing interest rates. During 2022, we saw an increase in the cost of certificates of\ndeposit and we expect this increase to continue in 2023.\nAdditionally, because we borrow to fund our loans and investments, a portion of our income is dependent upon the difference\nbetween the interest rate at which we borrow funds and the interest rate at which we invest these funds. A portion of our investments,\nsuch as medallion loans, will have fixed interest rates, while a portion of our borrowings may have floating interest rates. As a result, a\nsignificant change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest\nrates, our cost of funds could increase, which would reduce our net investment income. We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations\nby using standard hedging instruments, subject to applicable legal requirements. These activities may limit our ability to participate in\nthe benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the hedged portfolio. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates\nor hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Also, we\nwill have to rely on our counterparties to perform their obligations under such hedges."

We continue to utilize a market value for a New York City taxi medallion of $85,000, $79,500\nnet of liquidation costs, as of December 31, 2022.\nGovernment entities may take other actions in the future, which could have adverse effects on the market for taxi medallions and\nwhich could affect our financial condition and results of operations. Every city in which we have originated medallion loans, and most\nother major cities in the United States, limits the supply of taxi medallions, which results in supply restrictions that support the value of\ntaxi medallions. Loosening restrictions that result in the issuance of additional taxi medallions could decrease the value of taxi medallions\nin that market and in turn, adversely affect the value of the collateral securing our then outstanding medallion loans in that market.\nWe estimate that the weighted average loan-to-value ratio of our medallion loans was approximately 339% as of December 31,\n2022. If taxi medallion values continue to decline, there is likely to be an increase in medallion loan delinquencies, foreclosures and\nborrower bankruptcies. Our ability to recover on defaulted medallion loans by foreclosing on and selling the taxi medallion collateral\nwould be diminished, which would result in future losses on defaulted medallion loans that could have an effect on our business. If we\nare required to liquidate all or a portion of our medallion loans quickly, we would realize less than the value at which we had previously\nrecorded such medallions.\nUncertainty relating to the reporting of collateral values for our loans may adversely affect the value of our portfolio.\nMedallion loans are primarily collateral-based lending, whereby the collateral value generally exceeds the amount of the loan at\nthe time of origination, providing sufficient excess collateral to protect us against losses. Collateral values for medallion loans reflect\nrecent sales prices and are typically obtained from the regulatory agency in a particular local market. We rely on the integrity of the\ncollateral value benchmarks obtained by the applicable regulatory agencies and other third parties. Any changes or volatility in these\nbenchmarks could cause us to suffer losses. We have experienced a significant downward movement in medallion collateral values\nwhich has caused and may continue to cause a negative impact on our valuation analysis and could further significantly lower the fair\nmarket value measurements of our portfolio.\nWe require an objective benchmark in determining the value of our portfolio. If the benchmarks that we currently use are deemed\nto be unreliable, we will need to use other intrinsic factors in determining the collateral values for our loans.\nFinancing and Related Risks\nFailure to raise additional capital in the future could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and\nfinancial position.\nOur privately placed notes contain certain provisions that require us to meet certain tests in order to raise additional debt. We\ncannot guarantee that we will continue to meet such tests in the future. Additionally, our ability to obtain additional sources of funds\nincluding through credit facilities or other alternative sources of financing may be difficult, and we cannot guarantee that we will be\nable to do so on terms favorable to us or at all. The availability of credit facilities depends, in part, on factors outside of our control,\nincluding regulatory capital treatment for unfunded bank lines of credit, the financial strength and strategic objectives of the banks that\nparticipate in credit facilities and the availability of bank liquidity in general.\nIn addition, we may need to raise additional capital in the future to have sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our\ncommitments, including the terms of the 2003 capital maintenance agreement, and fund our business needs and future growth,\nparticularly if the quality of our assets or earnings were to deteriorate significantly. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will\ndepend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial\ncondition. We may not be able to obtain capital on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital\nmarkets, such as a decline in the confidence of capital markets investors or other disruptions in capital markets, may adversely affect\nour capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. Further, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have\nto do so when other financial institutions are seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those institutions for investors.\nAn inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations."

The\ninability to accept and renew brokered deposits would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nliquidity, and results of operations.\nMedallion Bank relies on the established brokered deposit market to originate deposits to fund its operations. Additionally,\nMedallion Bank’s business, strategy and prospects are dependent on its ability to accept and renew brokered deposits without limitation\nand, therefore, dependent on its ability to be “well-capitalized” under the FDIC’s regulatory framework.\nMedallion Bank’s brokered deposits consist of deposits raised through the brokered deposit market rather than through retail\nbranches. Although Medallion Bank has developed contractual relationships with a diversified group of investment brokers, and the\nbrokered deposit market is well developed and utilized by many banking institutions, conditions could change that might affect the\navailability of brokered deposits. In addition, Medallion Bank’s ability to rely on brokered deposits as a source of funding is subject to\ncapitalization requirements set forth in the FDIC’s prompt corrective action framework. Medallion Bank may not accept or renew\nbrokered deposits unless it is “well-capitalized” or it is “adequately capitalized” and it receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is\n“adequately capitalized” and that accepts or renews brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC is subject to additional restrictions\non the interest rates it may offer. See \"Our Business - Supervision and Regulation\" for additional information.\nIf the capital levels at Medallion Bank fall below the “well-capitalized” level as defined by the FDIC, or we otherwise fail to\nmaintain “well capitalized” status, Medallion Bank’s ability to raise brokered deposits would be materially impaired. If Medallion\nBank’s capital levels fall below the “adequately-capitalized” level as defined by the FDIC, it would be unable to raise brokered deposits.\nAny impairment or inability to raise brokered deposits would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity\nand results of operations. Brokered deposits may also not be as stable as other types of deposits, and if Medallion Bank experiences a\nperiod of sustained operating losses, the cost of attracting deposits from the brokered deposit market could increase significantly.\nMedallion Bank’s ability to manage its growth to stay within the “well-capitalized” level is critical to our ability to retain open access\nto this funding source.\nInvestors in our securities, may be adversely affected and may face significant losses (including the possibility of losing their\nentire investment) if Medallion Bank is unable to accept or renew brokered deposits or if its access to the brokered deposit market were\nimpaired.\nWe depend on cash flow from our subsidiaries to make payments on our indebtedness and fund operations.\nWe are primarily a holding company, and we derive most of our operating income and cash flow from our subsidiaries. As a\nresult, we rely heavily upon distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to make payments on our indebtedness\nand fund operations. Funds are provided to us by our subsidiaries through dividends and payments on intercompany indebtedness, but\nwe cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will be in a position to continue to make these dividend or debt payments. The Utah\nDepartment of Financial Institutions and FDIC have the authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by Medallion Bank.\nIn addition, as a condition to receipt of FDIC insurance, Medallion Bank entered into a capital maintenance agreement with the FDIC\nrequiring it to maintain a 15% Tier 1 leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to average assets). As of December 31, 2022, Medallion Bank’s Tier\n1 leverage ratio was 16.2%. We received dividends from Medallion Bank of $20.0 million and $19.0 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to pending litigation with the SEC for certain violations of the federal securities laws, which could result\nin material fines and/or other sanctions and accordingly have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial\ncondition, results of operations and/or stock price, as well as a bar against our President and Chief Operating Officer.\nAs described in Note 10 “Commitments and Contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, on December 29, 2021, the SEC filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork against the Company and its President and Chief Operating Officer alleging certain violations of the antifraud, books and records,\ninternal controls and anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws. The litigation relates to certain issues that occurred during the\nperiod 2015 to 2017, including (i) the Company’s retention of third parties in 2015 and 2016 concerning posting information about the\nCompany on certain financial websites and (ii) the Company’s financial reporting and disclosures concerning certain assets, including\nMedallion Bank, in 2016 and 2017, a period when the Company had previously reported as a business development company (BDC)\nunder the Investment Company Act of 1940. Since April 2018, the Company does not report as a BDC, and has not worked with such\nthird parties since 2016. The Company does not expect to change previously reported financial results. The Company filed a motion to\ndismiss the complaint on March 22, 2022, the SEC filed an amended complaint on April 26, 2022 and the Company filed a motion to\ndismiss the amended complaint on August 5, 2022."

The Company and its President and Chief\nOperating Officer intend to defend themselves vigorously and believe that the SEC will not prevail on its claims. Nevertheless,\ndepending on the outcome of the litigation, the Company could incur a loss and other penalties that could be material to the Company,\nits results of operations and/or financial condition, as well as a bar against its President and Chief Operating Officer. In addition, the\nCompany has and expects to further incur significant legal fees and expenses in defending such charges by the SEC and the Company\nmay be subject to shareholder litigation relating to these SEC matters.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, and if we are found to be in violation of any of the federal, state, or local\nlaws or regulations applicable to us, our business could suffer.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted in 2010. The Dodd-\nFrank Act significantly changed federal financial services regulation and affects, among other things, the lending, deposit, investment,\ntrading, and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. In addition to the statutory requirements under the\nDodd-Frank Act, the legislation also delegated authority to US banking, securities, and derivatives regulators to impose additional\nrestrictions through required rulemaking. The Dodd-Frank Act requires a company that owns an industrial bank to serve as a “source of\nstrength” to the institution and is also subject to the “Volcker Rule.” Although these requirements have not materially impacted us, we\ncannot assure you that they will not in the future.\nOther changes in the laws or regulations applicable to us more generally, may negatively impact the profitability of our business\nactivities, require us to change certain of our business practices, materially affect our business model, limit the activities in which we\nmay engage, affect retention of key personnel, require us to raise additional regulatory capital, increase the amount of liquid assets that\nwe hold, or otherwise affect our funding profile or expose us to additional costs (including increased compliance costs). Any such\nchanges may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and may adversely\naffect our ability to conduct our business as previously conducted or our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are also subject to a wide range of federal, state, and local laws and regulations, such as local licensing requirements, and\nretail financing, debt collection, consumer protection, environmental, health and safety, creditor, wage-hour, anti-discrimination,\nwhistleblower and other employment practices laws and regulations and we expect these costs to increase going forward. The violation\nof these or future requirements or laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal sanctions against us, which may\ninclude fines, a cease and desist order against the subject operations or even revocation or suspension of our license to operate the subject\nbusiness. As a result, we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs to comply with\nthese requirements and laws and regulations.\nThe banking industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory framework, together with any future legislative or regulatory\nchanges, may have a significant adverse effect on our operations.\nThe banking industry is extensively regulated and supervised under both federal and state laws and regulations that are intended\nprimarily for the protection of depositors, customers, federal deposit insurance funds, and the banking system as a whole, not for the\nprotection of security holders. We are subject to regulation and supervision by the FDIC and the Utah DFI. The laws and regulations\napplicable to us govern a variety of matters, including permissible types, amounts, and terms of loans and investments we may make,\nthe maximum interest rate that may be charged, the amount of reserves we must hold against deposits we take, the types of deposits we\nmay accept, maintenance of adequate capital and liquidity, changes in the control of Medallion Bank and us, restrictions on dividends,\nand establishment of new offices. We must obtain approval from our regulators before engaging in certain activities or acquisitions, and\nthere is the risk that such approvals may not be obtained, either in a timely manner or at all. Our regulators also have the ability to\ncompel us to take, or restrict us from taking, certain actions entirely, such as actions that our regulators deem to constitute an unsafe or\nunsound banking practice. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, or regulatory policies and interpretations of\nsuch laws and regulations, could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, or damage to our reputation, all of\nwhich could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFederal and state banking laws and regulations, as well as interpretations and implementations of these laws and regulations, are\ncontinually undergoing substantial review and change. Financial institutions generally have also been subjected to increased scrutiny\nfrom regulatory authorities. Changes in the Presidential Administration or control of Congress also increases the likelihood of further\nchanges to laws, regulations and supervisory practices affecting financial institutions, which could include more stringent requirements\nand greater scrutiny from regulatory authorities. These changes and increased scrutiny have resulted and may continue to result in\nincreased costs of doing business and may in the future result in decreased revenues and net income, reduce our ability to effectively\ncompete to attract and retain customers, or make it less attractive for us to continue providing certain products and services. Any future\nchanges in federal and state law and regulations, as well as the interpretations and implementations, or modifications or repeals, of such\nlaws and regulations, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including those listed above or other ways that could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations."

No assurance can be given that applicable laws or regulations will not be amended or construed\ndifferently or that new laws and regulations will not be adopted, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations.\nThe USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Bank Secrecy Act, or the BSA, require financial institutions to design and implement\nprograms to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected,\nfinancial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with FinCEN. These rules require financial institutions to establish\nprocedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers and beneficial owners of certain legal entity customers seeking to\nopen new financial accounts. Federal and state bank regulators also have focused on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money\nlaundering regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting\nacquisitions or expanding activities. Although we have policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with the BSA and other\nanti-money laundering laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the\ntime or protect us against liability for actions taken by our employees, agents, and intermediaries with respect to our business or any\nbusinesses that we may acquire. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist\nfinancing could also have serious reputational consequences for us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we\ncollect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security, and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security\nbreach notification, and we could be negatively affected by these laws. For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley\nAct which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share nonpublic personal information about our customers\nwith nonaffiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing\nand security practices and afford customers the right to “opt out” of any information sharing by us with nonaffiliated third parties (with\ncertain exceptions); and (iii) requires that we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program\ncontaining safeguards appropriate based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of customer\ninformation we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal banking regulators and states\nhave also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law\nenforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Moreover, legislators and regulators are increasingly\nadopting or revising privacy, information security, and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our\ncurrent and planned privacy, data protection, and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and\nsafeguarding of consumer or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. This could also increase our\ncosts of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. This includes increased privacy-\nrelated enforcement activity at the federal level, by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as at the state level.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection, and information security laws (including those regarding security\nbreach notification) could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and\nservices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. Our failure to comply\nwith privacy, data protection, and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental\ninvestigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur use of third-party vendors and our other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to regulatory\nrequirements and scrutiny.\nWe regularly use third-party vendors as part of our business. We also have substantial ongoing business relationships with other\nthird parties. These types of third-party relationships are subject to demanding regulatory requirements and attention by our federal and\nstate bank regulators. Regulation requires us to adopt enhanced due diligence, ongoing monitoring and control over our third-party\nvendors and other ongoing third-party business relationships. In certain cases, we may in the future be required to renegotiate our\nagreements with these vendors to meet these enhanced requirements, which could increase our costs and potentially limit our\ncompetitiveness. We expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of our third-party\nrelationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these relationships. As a result, if our regulators conclude that\nwe have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our third-party vendors or other ongoing third-party business relationships\nor that such third parties have not performed appropriately, we could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil money penalties\nor other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation, any of which could have a material\nadverse effect our business, financial condition or results of operations."

Although the dealerships, contractors and FSPs that we contract with\nare required to fulfill their contractual commitments to consumers and to comply with applicable law, from time to time they might not,\nor a consumer might allege that they did not. This, in turn, can result in claims against us or in loans being uncollectible. In those cases,\nwe may decide that it is beneficial to remediate the situation, either by assisting the consumers to get a refund, working with the\ndealerships, contractors or FSPs to modify the terms of the loans or reducing the amount due by making a concession to the consumer\nor otherwise. Historically, the cost of remediation has not been material to our business, but it could be in the future.\nOur SBIC subsidiaries are licensed by the SBA and are therefore subject to SBA regulations.\nOur SBIC subsidiaries are licensed to operate as SBICs and are regulated by the SBA. The SBA also places certain limitations on\nthe financing terms of investments by SBICs in portfolio companies and prohibits SBICs from providing funds for certain purposes or\nto businesses in a few prohibited industries. Compliance with SBA requirements may cause the SBIC subsidiaries to forego attractive\ninvestment opportunities that are not permitted under SBA regulations.\nFurther, SBA regulations require that a licensed SBIC be periodically examined and audited by the SBA to determine its\ncompliance with the relevant SBA regulations. The SBA prohibits, without prior SBA approval, a “change of control” of an SBIC or\ntransfers that would result in any person (or a group of persons acting in concert) owning 10% or more of a class of capital stock of an\nSBIC. If the SBIC subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable SBIC regulations, the SBA could, depending on the severity of the\nviolation, limit or prohibit their use of debentures, declare outstanding debentures immediately due and payable, and/or limit them from\nmaking new investments. In addition, the SBA could revoke or suspend an SBIC license or may appoint a receiver for the SBIC and for\nits liquidation for willful or repeated violation of, or willful or repeated failure to observe, any provision of the SBIA or any rule or\nregulation promulgated thereunder. Such actions by the SBA would, in turn, negatively affect us.\nOur ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted.\nThe SBA restricts the ability of SBICs to lend money to any of their officers, directors, and employees, or invest in any affiliates\nthereof.\nMedallion Bank is subject to certain federal laws that restrict and control its ability to engage in transactions with its affiliates.\nSections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and applicable regulations restrict the transfer of funds by Medallion Bank to certain\nof its affiliates, including us, in the form of loans, extensions of credit, investments, or purchases of assets and restrict its ability to\nprovide services to, or receive services from, its affiliates. Sections 23A and 23B also require generally that Medallion Bank’s\ntransactions with its affiliates be on terms no less favorable to Medallion Bank than comparable transactions with unrelated third parties.\nFederal and state law may discourage certain acquisitions of our common stock which could have a material adverse effect\non our stockholders.\nBecause Medallion Bank is an “insured depository institution” within the meaning of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the\nChange in Bank Control Act and Medallion Financial Corp. is a “financial institution holding company” within the meaning of the Utah\nFinancial Institutions Act, federal and Utah law and regulations prohibit any person or company from acquiring control Medallion Bank\nor Medallion Financial Corp., without, in most cases, prior written approval of the FDIC or the Commissioner of the Utah Department\nof Financial Institutions, as applicable. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, control is conclusively presumed if, among other things,\na person or company acquires 25% or more of any class of the Bank’s voting stock. A rebuttable presumption of control arises if a\nperson or company acquires 10% or more of any class of voting stock and is subject to several specified “control factors” as set forth in\nthe applicable regulations. Although Medallion Bank is an “insured depository institution” within the meaning of the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, your investment in the Company is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe FDIC, or any other agency, and is subject to loss. Under the Utah Financial Institutions Act, control is defined as the power,\ndirectly or indirectly, or through or in concert with one or more persons to: (a) direct or exercise a controlling influence over (i)\nmanagement or policies of a financial institution or (ii) the election of a majority of the directors or trustees of an institution or (b) vote\n25% or more of any class of voting securities of a financial institution. In addition, under Utah law, there is a rebuttable presumption\nthat a person has control of a Utah financial institution if the person has the power, directly or indirectly, or through concern with one\nor more persons, to vote more than 10% but not less than 25% of any class of voting securities of a financial institution. Investors are\nresponsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of our common stock in excess of the amount which can\nbe acquired without regulatory approval.

The recreation lending and home\nimprovement lending markets are also highly fragmented, with a small number of lenders capturing large shares of each market and\nmany smaller lenders competing for the remaining market share. Our competitors often seek to provide financing on terms more\nfavorable to consumers or dealers, contractors, and FSPs than we offer. Many of these competitors also have long-standing relationships\nwith dealers, contractors, and FSPs and may offer other forms of financing that we do not offer, e.g., credit card lending. We anticipate\nthat we will encounter greater competition as we expand our operations, and competition may also increase in more stable or favorable\neconomic conditions. Certain of our competitors are not subject to the same regulatory requirements that we are and, as a result, these\ncompetitors may have advantages in conducting certain business and providing certain services and may be more aggressive in their\nloan origination activities. Increasing competition could also require us to lower the rates we charge on loans in order to maintain our\ndesired loan origination volume, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe have in the past and may in the future pursue new strategies and lines of business, and we may face enhanced risks as\na result of these changes in strategy, including from transacting with a broader array of customers and exposure to new assets,\nactivities and markets.\nIn July 2019, we launched our strategic partnership program, through which we partner with third parties to offer consumer loans\nand other financial services. Potential legal and regulatory risks associated with this line of business remain uncertain and may develop\nin ways that could affect us adversely, including as a result of legal proceedings brought against us on the basis that we are the “true\nlender” of the loans facilitated, held and serviced by our Strategic Partners, or on the basis of a determination by the FDIC or other\nfinancial regulators that our Strategic Partnership Program represents an unsafe and unsound practice.\nWe may continue to change our strategy and enter new lines of business, including through the acquisition of another company,\nacquisitions of new types of loan portfolios or other asset classes, or otherwise, in the future. Any new business initiatives, including\nour Strategic Partnership Program, have in the past and may in the future expose us to new and enhanced risks, including new credit-\nrelated, compliance, fraud, market and operational risks, increased compliance and operating costs, different and potentially greater\nregulatory scrutiny of such new activities and assets, and may expose us to new types of customers as well as asset classes, activities\nand markets.\nAny new business initiatives and strategies we may pursue in the future may be less successful than anticipated and may not\nadvance our intended business strategy. We may not realize a satisfactory return on investments or acquisitions, we may experience\ndifficulty in managing new portfolios or integrating operations, and management’s attention from our other businesses could be diverted.\nAny of these results could ultimately have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations will depend on our ability to manage growth effectively.\nOur ability to achieve our loan and investment objective will depend on our ability to grow, which will depend, in turn, on our\nmanagement team’s ability to identify, evaluate, and monitor, and our ability to finance and invest in, companies that meet our\ninvestment criteria.\nAccomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis will be largely a function of our management team’s handling of the investment\nprocess, its ability to provide competent, attentive, and efficient services, and our access to financing on acceptable terms. In addition\nto monitoring the performance of our existing investments, members of our management team and our investment professionals may\nalso be called upon to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. These demands on their time may distract them or slow\nthe rate of investment. In order to grow, we will need to hire, train, supervise, and manage new employees.

The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to serve\ncustomers better. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of customers by using technology to provide\nproducts and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our\ncompetitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we do. We may not be able to effectively\nimplement new, technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. In\naddition, the implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems and integrate new ones may also cause\nservice interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable\nlaws. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry and failure to avoid\ninterruptions, errors and delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe expect that new technologies and business processes applicable to the banking industry will continue to emerge, and these\nnew technologies and business processes may be better than those we currently use. Because the pace of technological change is high\nand our industry is intensely competitive, we may not be able to sustain our investment in new technology as critical systems and\napplications become obsolete or as better ones become available. A failure to maintain current technology and business processes could\ncause disruptions in our operations or cause our products and services to be less competitive, all of which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause\nour business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that\nof our customers and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in third-party data centers, and on our\nnetworks.

In addition, we may also be required to incur significant costs in connection with\nany regulatory investigation or civil litigation resulting from a security breach or other information technology disruption that affects\nus.\nWe have been, and likely will continue to be, the target of attempted cyber-attacks, computer viruses, malicious code, phishing\nattacks, denial of service attacks and other information security threats. To date, cyber-attacks have not had a material impact on our\nfinancial condition, results or business; however, we could suffer material financial or other losses in the future and we are not able to\npredict the severity of these attacks. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the\nevolving nature of these threats, the current global economic and political environment, our work-from home arrangements, the\noutsourcing of some of our business operations, the ongoing shortage of qualified cybersecurity professionals, and the interconnectivity\nand interdependence of third parties to our systems. In addition, our increasing interconnectivity with service providers, dealerships,\ncontractors and FSPs, including through application programming interfaces, increases the risk that a security breach or other disruption\naffecting a third party materially affects our ability to conduct business.\nWe are dependent upon our key investment personnel for our future success.\nWe depend on the diligence, skill, and network of business contacts of the investment professionals we employ for sourcing,\nevaluating, negotiating, structuring, and monitoring our investments. Our future success also depends on our senior management team\nand its coordination with the senior management team at Medallion Bank. These members of senior management include Alvin\nMurstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Andrew M. Murstein, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Anthony N.\nCutrone, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Donald S. Poulton, President and Chief Executive Officer, Medallion\nBank, D. Justin Haley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Medallion Bank, and Steven M. Hannay, Executive Vice\nPresident and Chief Lending Officer, Medallion Bank. The departure of any member of our senior management or the senior\nmanagement team at Medallion Bank could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results."

We cannot assure you that there\nwill not be further terrorist attacks against the US or US businesses or major natural disasters hitting the United States. Such attacks or\nnatural disasters in the US or elsewhere may impact the businesses in which we directly or indirectly invest by undermining economic\nconditions in the United States. In addition, a portion of our business is focused on the New York City metropolitan area, which suffered\na terrorist attack in 2001 and has faced continued threats. Another terrorist attack in New York City or elsewhere could severely impact\nour results of operations. Losses resulting from terrorist attacks are generally uninsurable.\nOur operations could be interrupted if certain external vendors on which we rely experience difficulty, terminate their\nservices or fail to comply with banking laws and regulations.\nWe depend to a significant extent on relationships with third parties that provide services, primarily information technology\nservices critical to our operations. Currently, we obtain services from third parties that include information technology infrastructure\nand support, plus loan origination, loan servicing, and accounting systems and support. If any of our third-party service providers\nexperience difficulties or terminate their services and we are unable to replace our service providers with other service providers, our\noperations could be interrupted. It may be difficult for us to replace some of our third-party vendors, particularly vendors providing our\nloan origination, loan servicing and accounting services, in a timely manner if they are unwilling or unable to provide us with these\nservices in the future for any reason. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, it could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Even if we are able to replace these third parties, it may be at higher\ncost to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, if a third-\nparty provider fails to provide the services we require, fails to meet contractual requirements, such as compliance with applicable laws\nand regulations, or suffers a cyber-attack or other security breach, our business could suffer economic and reputational harm that could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMisconduct by current or former employees could expose us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.\nWe are vulnerable to reputational harm because we operate in an industry in which integrity and the confidence of the dealerships,\ncontractors, and FSPs that sell our consumer products are of critical importance. Our current and former directors, and employees could\nengage or could have engaged in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if such a person were to engage, or\npreviously engaged, in fraudulent, illegal or suspicious activities, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to\nour reputation (as a consequence of the negative perception resulting from such activities), financial position, third-party relationships\nand ability to forge new relationships with third-party dealers, contractors or FSPs. Our business often requires that we deal with\nconfidential information. If our current and former directors, and employees were to improperly use or disclose this information or\npreviously improperly used or disclosed this information, even if inadvertently, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial\nposition and current and future business relationships. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we\ntake to detect and prevent this activity may not always be effective. Misconduct by our current and former employees or directors, or\neven unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results\nof operations.\nWe borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested, and increases the risk of investing\nin us.\nBorrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested, and therefore increase the risk\nassociated with investing in us. We borrow from the brokered CD market, private and public note placements and issue senior debt\nsecurities to banks and other lenders, and through long-term subordinated SBA debentures. These creditors have fixed dollar claims on\nour assets that are superior to the claims of our stockholders. If the value of our assets increases, then leveraging would cause\nstockholders’ equity to increase more sharply than it would have had we not leveraged. Conversely, if the value of our assets decreases,\nleveraging would cause stockholders’ equity to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged. Similarly, any\nincrease in our income in excess of interest payable on the borrowed funds would cause our net income to increase more than it would\nwithout the leverage, while any decrease in our income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not\nborrowed. Such a decline could reduce the amount available for distribution payments.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $1.8 billion of outstanding indebtedness with a weighted average borrowing cost of 2.43%.\nApproximately $513.2 million of our borrowing relationships have maturity dates during 2023, a vast majority of which are\nbrokered certificates of deposit. Additionally, with the cessation of LIBOR in 2023, there could be rate adjustments that may have an\nimpact to our cost of borrowings. We currently have $33.0 million of indebtedness of which the interest rate is LIBOR-based.

Historically, our borrower base consists primarily of small business owners that may have limited resources\nand that are generally unable to obtain financing from traditional sources. There is generally no publicly available information about\nthese small business owners, and we must rely on the diligence of our employees and agents to obtain information in connection with\nour credit decisions. In addition, these small businesses often do not have audited financial statements. Some smaller businesses have\nnarrower product lines and market shares than their competition. Therefore, they may be more vulnerable to customer preferences,\nmarket conditions, or economic downturns, which may adversely affect the return on, or the recovery of, our investment in these\nbusinesses.\nOur portfolio is and may continue to be concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies, industries and sectors,\nwhich will subject us to a risk of significant loss if any of these companies default on its obligations to us or by a downturn in the\nparticular industry or sector.\nOur portfolio is and may continue to be concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies, industries and sectors. In\naddition, taxi companies that constitute separate issuers may have related management or guarantors and constitute larger business\nrelationships to us. We do not have fixed guidelines for diversification, and while we are not targeting any specific industries, our\ninvestments are, and could continue to be, concentrated in relatively few industries. As a result, the aggregate returns we realize may be\nadversely affected if a small number of loans perform poorly or if we need to write down the value of any one loan. If our larger\nborrowers were to significantly reduce their relationships with us and seek financing elsewhere, the size of our loan portfolio and\noperating results could decrease. In addition, larger business relationships may also impede our ability to immediately foreclose on a\nparticular defaulted portfolio company as we may not want to impair an overall business relationship with either the portfolio company\nmanagement or any related funding source. Additionally, a downturn in any particular industry or sector in which we are invested could\nalso negatively impact the aggregate returns we realize.\nThe lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.\nWe generally make investments in private companies. Substantially all of these securities are subject to legal and other restrictions\non resale or are otherwise less liquid than publicly traded securities. The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to\nsell such investments if the need arises. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may\nrealize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded our investments. We may also face other restrictions on\nour ability to liquidate an investment in a portfolio company to the extent that we have material non-public information regarding such\nportfolio company.\nIn addition, the illiquidity of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of loans at times when\nit may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments. In addition, if we were required to liquidate some or all of the\ninvestments in the portfolio, the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments.\nBecause we borrow money to make loans and investments, our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate\nat which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change\nin market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds\nwould increase, which would reduce our net operating income before net realized and unrealized gains. We use a combination of long-\nterm and short-term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing activities. Our long-term fixed-rate investments are financed\nprimarily with short-term floating-rate debt, and to a lesser extent by term fixed-rate debt. We may use interest rate risk management\ntechniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Such techniques may include various interest rate hedging\nactivities.\nWe have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Assuming that the balance sheet were\nto remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity a hypothetical immediate 1% increase in interest\nrates would result in an increase to net income as of December 31, 2022 by $1.2 million on an annualized basis, and the impact of such\nan immediate increase of 1% over a one year period would have been a reduction in net income by $1.4 million at December 31, 2022.\nAlthough management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential\nchanges in credit quality, size, and composition of the assets on the balance sheet, and other business developments that could affect net\nincrease in net assets resulting from operations in a particular quarter or for the year taken as a whole. Accordingly, no assurances can\nbe given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by these estimates."

Accordingly, following those transactions, the overall credit\ncharacteristics of our loan portfolio declined due to the transfer of the loans with stronger credit characteristics. In the future, the credit\ncharacteristics of our loan portfolio could change as a result of loan sales, and other characteristics could change as well. For example,\nif we sell loans with less favorable credit characteristics, the net interest income and net interest margin for our loan portfolio could be\nadversely affected because loans with less favorable credit characteristics typically generate more net interest income and higher net\ninterest margin.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, and in evaluating and monitoring our loan portfolio on an\nongoing basis, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers, including financial statements, credit reports and\nother financial information. We may also rely on representations of those customers or of other third parties, such as independent\nauditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. The failure to receive financial statements, credit reports or other\nfinancial or business information related to our customers on a timely basis, or the inadvertent reliance by us on inaccurate, incomplete,\nfraudulent or misleading forms of any of the foregoing information, could result in loan losses, reputational damage or other effects that\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLaws and regulations implemented in response to climate change could result in increased operating costs for our portfolio\ncompanies.\nCongress and other governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations in response to\nclimate change and the reduction of greenhouse gases. Existing environmental regulations could be revised or reinterpreted, new laws\nand regulations could be adopted, and future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur, which could impose additional\ncosts on the operation of our portfolio companies. For example, regulations to cut gasoline use and control greenhouse gas emissions\nfrom new cars could adversely affect our medallion portfolio companies. Our portfolio companies may have to make significant capital\nand other expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. Changes in, or new, environmental restrictions may force our portfolio\ncompanies to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed their estimates. There can be no assurance that such companies\nwould be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from their customers or that their business, financial condition or\nresults of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in environmental laws and\nregulations, in which case the value of these companies could be adversely affected.\nOur portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies.\nWe invest in our portfolio companies primarily through senior secured loans, junior secured loans, and subordinated debt issued\nby small-to mid-sized companies. Our portfolio companies may have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with,\nor senior to, the debt in which we invest. By their terms, such debt instruments may entitle the holders to receive payment of interest or\nprincipal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments with respect to the debt instruments in which we invest.\nAlso, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization, or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt\ninstruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we\nreceive any distribution. After repaying such senior creditors, such portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for\nrepaying its obligation to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with debt instruments in which we invest, we would have to share on\nan equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution,\nreorganization, or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company.\nThere may be circumstances where our debt investments could be subordinated to claims of other creditors or we could\nbe subject to lender liability claims.\nEven though we may have structured most of our investments as senior loans, if one of our portfolio companies were to go\nbankrupt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which we actually provided managerial assistance to that\nportfolio company, a bankruptcy court might recharacterize our debt investment and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of\nother creditors. We may also be subject to lender liability claims for actions taken by us with respect to a borrower’s business or instances\nwhere we exercise control over the borrower. It is possible that we could become subject to a lender’s liability claim, including as a\nresult of actions taken in rendering significant managerial assistance.\nWe may not control many of Medallion Capital’s portfolio companies.\nWe may not control many of Medallion Capital’s portfolio companies, even though we may have board representation or board\nobservation rights.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nOBJECTIVE\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the\naccompanying notes thereto for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. This section is intended to provide management's\nperspective of our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, this section contains forward-looking statements. These\nforward-looking statements are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions. Certain factors that could\ncause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements are described in the\nRisk Factors section on page 19. Additionally, more information about our business activities can be found in “Business.”\nGENERAL\nWe are a specialty finance company whose focus and growth has been our consumer finance and commercial lending businesses\noperated by Medallion Bank, or the Bank, and Medallion Capital, Inc., or Medallion Capital. The Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary\nthat originates consumer loans for the purchase of recreational vehicles, boats, and home improvements, and provides loan origination\nand other services to fintech partners. Medallion Capital is a wholly-owned subsidiary that originates commercial loans through its\nmezzanine financing business. As of December 31, 2022, our consumer loans represented 94% of our gross loan portfolio and\ncommercial loans represented 5%. Total assets were $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2021.\nOur loan-related earnings depend primarily on our level of net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the\ntotal yield on our loan portfolio and the average cost of borrowed funds. We fund our operations through a wide variety of interest-\nbearing sources, including bank certificates of deposit issued to customers, debentures issued to and guaranteed by the SBA, privately\nplaced notes, and preferred securities. Net interest income fluctuates with changes in the yield on our loan portfolios and changes in the\ncost of borrowed funds, as well as changes in the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities held by us. Net interest\nincome is also affected by economic, regulatory, and competitive factors that influence interest rates, loan demand, and the availability\nof funding to finance our lending activities. We, like other financial institutions, are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our\ninterest-earning assets reprice, either due to inflation or other factors, on a different basis than our interest-bearing liabilities. We continue\nto monitor global supply chain disruptions, gas prices, labor shortages, unemployment, and other factors contributing to U.S. inflation.\nWe also provide debt, mezzanine, and equity investment capital to companies in a variety of commercial industries. These\ninvestments may be venture capital style investments which may not be fully collateralized. Our investments are typically in the form\nof secured debt instruments with fixed interest rates accompanied by an equity stake or warrants to purchase an equity interest for a\nnominal exercise price (such warrants are included in equity investments on the consolidated balance sheets). Interest income is earned\non the debt instruments.\nThe Bank is an industrial bank regulated by the FDIC and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions that originates consumer\nloans, raises deposits, and conducts other banking activities. The Bank generally provides us with our lowest cost of funds which it\nraises through bank certificates of deposit. To take advantage of this low cost of funds, historically we referred a portion of our medallion\nand commercial loans to the Bank, which originated these loans, and have since been serviced by Medallion Servicing Corp., or MSC.\nHowever, other than in connection with dispositions of existing medallion assets, the Bank has not originated any new medallion loans\nsince 2014 (and Medallion Financial Corp. has not originated any new medallion loans since 2015) and is working with MSC to service\nits remaining portfolio, as it winds down. MSC earns referral and servicing fees for these activities.\nIn 2019, the Bank launched a strategic partnership program to provide lending and other services to financial technology, or\nfintech, companies. The Bank entered into an initial partnership in 2020 and began issuing its first loans. The Bank continues to evaluate\nand launch additional partnership programs with fintech companies.\nWe continue to consider various alternatives for the Bank, which may include an initial public offering of its common stock, the\nsale of all or part of the Bank, a spin-off or other potential transaction. We do not have a deadline for its consideration of these\nalternatives, and there can be no assurance that this process will result in any transaction being announced or consummated.\nCOVID-19\nIn March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we adjusted the payment policies and procedures with our consumer and\nmedallion businesses, and allowed borrowers to defer payments up to 180 days. As of December 31, 2022, no consumer or medallion\nloans remained on deferral related to COVID-19. For our medallion portfolio, we determined that anticipated payment activity on our\nmedallion portfolio was impossible to quantify upon the end of the deferral moratorium, and therefore all medallion loans were deemed\nimpaired, placed on nonaccrual status, and written down to each market’s net collateral value in 2020, with additional write-offs taken\nduring 2021. There were no additional write-offs in 2022. We will continue to monitor our medallion portfolio and related assets, which\nmay result in additional write-downs, charge-offs or impairments."

Some of these significant accounting\npolicies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The policies noted below, however, are deemed to be\nour “critical accounting policies” under the definition given to this term by the SEC. According to the SEC, “critical accounting policies”\nmean those policies that are most important to the presentation of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and require\nmanagement’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of\nmatters that are inherently uncertain.\nThe judgments used by management in applying the critical accounting policies may be affected by deterioration in the economic\nenvironment, which may result in changes to future financial results. Specifically, subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light\nof the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes to the allowance for loan losses in future periods, and the inability to\ncollect on outstanding loans could result in increased loan losses.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management’s periodic review of\nthe collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may\naffect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions, and excess\nconcentration risks. In analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, the Company uses historical delinquency and actual loss\nrates with a three-year look-back period for medallion loans and a one-year look-back period for recreation and home improvement\nloans and uses historical loss experience and other projections for commercial loans. The allowance is evaluated on a regular basis by\nmanagement and is based upon management’s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the\nnature and size of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying\ncollateral, prevailing economic conditions, and excess concentration risks. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires\nestimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\nOur methodology to calculate the general reserve portion of the allowance includes the use of quantitative and qualitative factors.\nWe initially determine an allowance based on quantitative loss factors for loans evaluated collectively for impairment. The quantitative\nloss factors are based primarily on historical loss rates, after considering loan type, historical loss and delinquency experience. The\nquantitative loss factors applied in the methodology are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted to reflect changes in historical loss levels\nor other risks. Qualitative loss factors are used to modify the reserve determined by the quantitative factors and are designed to account\nfor losses that may not be included in the quantitative calculation according to management’s best judgment. If our qualitative loss factor\nrates were to increase 50 basis points, our recreation and home improvement general reserve would increase by $5.9 million and $3.1\nmillion, respectively. Likewise, if our qualitative loss factor rates were to decrease 50 basis points, our recreation and home improvement\ngeneral reserve would decrease by $5.9 million and $3.1 million, respectively. Performing loans are recorded at par and the general\nreserve maintained to absorb expected losses consistent with GAAP.\nAll medallion loans are deemed impaired and have a specific allowance for each loan, such that the underlying net loan has a\nvalue no greater than collateral value. The determination of taxi medallion collateral fair value is derived quarterly for each jurisdiction.\nFor medallion loans, delinquent nonperforming loans are valued at collateral value for the most recent quarter. Collateral value for the\nmedallion loans is generally determined utilizing factors deemed relevant under the circumstances of the market including but not limited\nto: actual transfers, pending transfers, median and average sales prices, discounted cash flows, market direction and sentiment, and\ngeneral economic trends for the industry and economy. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are\nsusceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. We deem a loan impaired when, based on current information\nand events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan\nagreement, including scheduled principal and interest payments. We charge-off loans in the period that such loans are deemed\nuncollectible or when they reach 120 days delinquent regardless of whether the loan is a recreation, home improvement, or medallion\nloan.\nThe methodology used in the periodic review of reserve adequacy, which is performed at least quarterly, is designed to be\nresponsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and inherent credit losses. The changes are reflected in both the pooled formula reserve\nand in specific reserves as the collectability of larger classified loans is regularly recalculated with new information as it becomes\navailable. Management is primarily responsible for the overall adequacy of the allowance."

We anticipate the adoption will increase our allowance for loan losses (allowance for credit losses under CECL) by $11.6 million\nfor consumer loans and a $2.2 million increase with respect to our commercial loans. With the adoption of CECL, we expect that there\nwill be earlier recognition of credit losses, including a near-term effect of larger loan loss provisions, compared to the previous incurred\nlosses accounting standard.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and intangible assets arose as a result of the excess of the fair value that was determined by an independent third party\nexpert over the book value of several of our previously unconsolidated portfolio investment companies as of April 2, 2018. Goodwill is\nnot amortized, but is subject to quarterly review by management to determine whether additional impairment testing is needed, and such\ntesting is performed at least on an annual basis. The annual goodwill assessment is focused on the Bank goodwill of $150.8 million and\nintangible assets of $22.0 million, both of which utilized a step zero qualitative impairment analysis based on historical and projected\nfinancial data. The Bank-related intangible assets are amortized over their approximate useful life.\nDeferred Taxes\nDeferred taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax basis\nand are stated at tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.

In 2022, we increased rates on newly issued\nrecreation and home improvement loans; however, the effects of these increases have been mitigated as maturing and pre-paid loans\nhad interest rates comparable to or exceeding these increased rates. Despite a decrease in our average borrowing cost, interest expense\nincreased for 2022 driven by the overall increase in our borrowings. The portion of our borrowings represented by deposits, our lowest\ncost of funds, accounted for a greater percentage of our total borrowings in 2022 compared to 2021 and caused a decrease in our average\ncost of borrowings, despite a slight increase in costs of those deposits.\nOur interest expense is driven by the interest rates payable on our bank certificates of deposit, fixed-rate, long-term private notes,\nfixed-rate, long-term debentures issued to the SBA, preferred securities, and have historically included short-term credit facilities with\nbanks and other short-term notes payable. The Bank issues brokered bank certificates of deposit, which are our lowest borrowing costs.\nThe Bank is able to bid on these deposits at a wide variety of maturity levels which allows for improved interest rate management\nstrategies.\nOur cost of funds is primarily driven by the rates paid on our various debt instruments and their relative mix, and changes in the\nlevels of average borrowings outstanding. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for details on the terms of our outstanding\ndebt. Our debentures issued to the SBA typically have terms of ten years.\nWe continue to seek SBA funding through Medallion Capital to the extent it offers attractive rates. SBA financing subjects its\nrecipients to limits on the amount of secured bank debt they may incur. We use SBA funding to fund loans that qualify under the Small\nBusiness Investment Act of 1985, as amended, or the SBIA, and SBA regulations. In July 2020, we obtained a $25.0 million commitment\nfrom the SBA. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, adjustable rate debt constituted 2% of total debt."

      "text": "40\nProvision and Allowance for Loan Loss\nOur methodology to calculate the general reserve portion of the allowance includes the use of quantitative and qualitative factors.\nWe initially determine an allowance based on quantitative loss factors for loans evaluated collectively for impairment. The quantitative\nloss factors are based primarily on historical loss rates, after considering loan type, historical loss and delinquency experience. The\nquantitative loss factors applied in the methodology are periodically reevaluated and adjusted to reflect changes in historical loss levels\nor other risks. Qualitative loss factors are used to modify the reserve determined by the quantitative factors and are designed to account\nfor losses that may not be included in the quantitative calculation according to management’s best judgment.

We also show results for a non-operating segment, corporate and other investments.\nRecreation Lending\nRecreation lending is a high-growth business focused on originating prime and non-prime recreation loans which is a significant\nsource of income for us, accounting for 71%, 74%, and 76% of our interest income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and\n2020.\nWe maintain relationships with approximately 3,100 dealers and financial service providers, or FSPs, not all of which are active\nat any one time. FSPs are entities that provide finance and insurance, or F&I, services to small dealers that do not have the desire or\nability to provide F&I services themselves. The ability of FSPs to aggregate the financing and relationship management for many small\ndealers makes them valuable. We receive approximately half of our loan volume from dealers and the other half from FSPs. Our top ten\ndealer and FSP relationships were responsible for 48% of recreation lending’s new loan originations for the year ended December 31,\n2022. The percentage of new loan originations by the top ten dealer and FSP relationships is a measure of concentration, which\nmanagement uses to determine whether to undertake diversification efforts, and which provides investors with information about\norigination concentration.\nThe recreation loan portfolio consists of thousands of geographically distributed loans with an average loan size of approximately\n$18,000 as of December 31, 2022. The loans are fixed rate with an average term at origination of 11.3 years. The weighted average\nmaturity of our loans outstanding as of December 31, 2022 is 9.6 years.\nThe loans are secured primarily by RVs, boats, and trailers, with RV loans making up 58% of the portfolio, boat loans making up\n19% of the portfolio, and trailer loans 14% as of December 31, 2022, compared to 60%, 19% and 9% as of December 31, 2021.\nRecreation loans are made to borrowers residing nationwide, with the highest concentrations in Texas and Florida, at 16% and 11% of\nloans outstanding with no other states over 10%. As of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the weighted average FICO scores of our\nrecreation loans outstanding were 671, 668, and 658.

As of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the weighted average FICO scores of\nour home improvement loans outstanding were 753, 754, and 758. The weighted average FICO scores at the time of origination for the\nloans funded in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were 758, 759, and 759.\nA large proportion of our home improvement-financed sales are facilitated by contractor salespeople with limited financing\nbackgrounds rather than by contractor employees who provide F&I services. The result is contractor demand for financing services that\nfacilitate an in-home transaction (e.g., digital tools, including mobile applications for phone or tablet, support for E-SIGN compliant\nelectronic signatures, and extended operating hours), and additional resources for the salesperson throughout the financing process. Our\ntop ten contractors and FSP relationships were responsible for 62% of home improvement lending’s new loan originations for the year\nended December 31, 2022. The percentage of new loan originations by the top ten contractor and FSP relationships is a measure of\nconcentration, which management uses to determine whether to undertake diversification efforts, and which provides investors with\ninformation about origination concentration.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the home improvement lending segment continued to grow with the net portfolio\nincreasing 43% from the prior year.

The increase in interest income reflects continued growth in the recreation and home improvement lending\nsegments, and to a lesser extent, growth in our commercial lending segment. The yield on interest earning assets was 11.06% for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, compared to 11.51% for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting the growth of our home\nimprovement lending segment, the loans of which have a lower coupon associated with the higher credit quality, as compared to our\nother lending segments which carry a higher coupon. Average interest earning assets were $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31,\n2022, an increase from $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to continued demand for both recreation and home\nimprovement loans in 2022. In 2022, loan originations were $983.9 million, up from $747.4 million in 2021, with $513.1 million and\n$392.5 million of the 2022 originations attributable to the recreation and home improvement loans.\nLoans before allowance for loan losses were $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2022, comprised of recreation ($1.2 billion), home\nimprovement ($0.6 billion), commercial ($92.9 million), medallion ($13.6 million), and strategic partnership (less than $0.6 million)\nloans. We had an allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2022 of $63.8 million, which was attributable to the recreation (66%),\nhome improvement (18%), medallion (15%), and commercial (1%) loan portfolios. As of December 31, 2021, loans before allowance\nfor loan losses were $1.5 billion, comprised of recreation ($1.0 billion), home improvement ($0.4 billion), commercial ($76.7 million),\nmedallion ($14.0 million), and strategic partnership ($0.1 million) loans. We had an allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2021\nof $50.2 million, which was attributable to recreation (64%), medallion (19%), and home improvement (15%) loans. The loan loss\nallowance increased during the year, primarily due to the growth in the loan portfolio, as well as due to increases in the rate at which we\nprovision for loans, specifically our recreation and home improvement loans, with the allowance rate for these portfolios increasing 18\nbasis points and 13 basis points, respectively. These increases represent the increased charge-off exposure incurred in 2022 as compared\nto the prior year.\nLoans increased $0.4 billion, or 29%, from $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2021 to $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 as a\nresult of $1.0 billion of loan originations, offset primarily by principal payments, and to a lesser extent charge-offs and transfers to loan\ncollateral in process of foreclosure. The provision for loan losses was $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared\nto $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase from the prior year is attributable to the growth in the loan portfolio,\nwith new loans requiring an initial allowance be recorded upon issuance, an increase in net charge-offs during the year, as well as an\nincrease in our allowance rate for our loans, particularly recreation and home improvement loans where our allowance coverage rates\nincreased 18 basis point and 13 basis points, respectively. See Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for\nadditional information on loans and allowance for loan losses.\nInterest expense was $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $31.1 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. The increase from the prior year is attributable to the increase in our borrowings, primarily the increase in our\ncertificates of deposit, despite our average cost of borrowing for the year decreasing 11 basis points from the prior year. The average\ncost of borrowed funds was 2.17% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2.28% for the year ended December 31, 2021,\nthe decrease mainly driven by the changing mix of our borrowings, with certificates of deposit, our lowest cost of funding, continuing\nto be a larger portion of our borrowings when compared to prior years. The average cost of the certificates of deposit was 1.57% during\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 1.55% for the year ended December 31, 2022, with the increase reflecting the increased\ncosts associated with newly issued deposits in the current year when compared to the maturing deposits. We expect our average cost of\nfunds to increase from these levels in this current inflationary environment as we continue to rely upon the issuance of new certificates\nof deposit to fund our growing lending business. Average debt outstanding was $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, up\nfrom $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, as we issued additional certificates of deposit fund our loan growth. See page\n37 for tables that show average balances and cost of funds for our funding sources.\nNet interest income was $160.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $127.8 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. Net interest margin was 9.05% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 9.25%, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, reflecting the above. With the rates we charge on loans and our cost of funds both increasing due to inflation, we\nexpect our net interest margin to continue to tighten in 2023.\nNet other income, which is comprised primarily of gains on the sale of loans and medallion, gains (losses) on equity investments,\nprepayment fees, servicing fee income, late charges, write-downs of loan collateral, and sponsorship and race winnings in the previous\nyear, was $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The\ndecrease was mainly due to the absence of non-recurring gains such as disposal of equity investments and the extinguishment of debt,\nas well as the absence of sponsorship and race winnings in the current year resulting from the disposition of our ownership in RPAC in\nDecember 2021."

Salaries and benefits were $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, down from $31.6 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, with the change mainly attributable to the absence of RPAC related salaries, offset by the increased number of\nemployees at the Bank tied to the overall growth in our assets. Professional fees were $13.1 million for the year ended December 31,\n2022, compared to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily reflective of higher legal and professional costs for a\nvariety of corporate matters inclusive of the SEC litigation.\nTotal income tax expense was $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $24.2 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, for which $1.8 million of tax expense was recorded in 2021 related to a valuation allowance with respect to certain\ntax assets which we believe will not be realized.\nLoan collateral in process of foreclosure was $21.8 million at December 31, 2022, a decline from $37.4 million at December 31,\n2021. The decrease primarily reflects cash payments received and structured settlements during the year.\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020\nFor a comparison of the Company’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31,\n2020, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company’s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March\n14, 2022.\nASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nWe, like other financial institutions, are subject to interest rate risk to the extent that our interest-earning assets (consisting of\nconsumer, commercial, and medallion loans, and investment securities) reprice on a different basis over time in comparison to our\ninterest-bearing liabilities (consisting primarily of bank certificates of deposit, privately placed notes, SBA debentures and borrowings,\nand preferred securities).\nHaving interest-bearing liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may be beneficial in times of\ndeclining interest rates, although such an asset/liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of rising interest\nrates. Abrupt increases in market rates of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until we are able to originate new loans\nat the higher prevailing interest rates. Conversely, having interest-earning assets that mature or reprice more frequently on average than\nliabilities may be beneficial in times of rising interest rates, although this asset/liability structure may result in declining net earnings\nduring periods of falling interest rates. This mismatch between maturities and interest rate sensitivities of our interest-earning assets and\ninterest-bearing liabilities results in interest rate risk.\nThe effect of changes in interest rates is mitigated by regular turnover of the portfolios. We believe that the average life of our\nloan portfolios varies to some extent as a function of changes in interest rates. Borrowers are more likely to exercise prepayment rights\nin a decreasing interest rate environment because the interest rate payable on the borrower’s loan is high relative to prevailing interest\nrates. Conversely, borrowers are less likely to prepay in a rising interest rate environment. However, borrowers may prepay for a variety\nof other reasons, such as to monetize increases in the underlying collateral values. In addition, we manage our exposure to increases in\nmarket rates of interest by incurring fixed-rate indebtedness, such as ten year subordinated SBA debentures, and by setting repricing\nintervals on certificates of deposit, for terms of up to five years.\nA relative measure of interest rate risk can be derived from our interest rate sensitivity gap. The interest rate sensitivity gap\nrepresents the difference between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which mature and/or reprice within specified\nintervals of time. The gap is considered to be positive when repriceable assets exceed repriceable liabilities, and negative when\nrepriceable liabilities exceed repriceable assets. A relative measure of interest rate sensitivity is provided by the cumulative difference\nbetween interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities for a given time interval expressed as a percentage of total assets."

We do not expect this change to have a material impact on our\nborrowings.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur sources of liquidity include brokered certificates of deposit, unfunded commitments to sell debentures to the SBA, loan\namortization and prepayments, private issuances of debt securities, participations or sales of loans to third parties, issuances of preferred\nsecurities at our subsidiaries, and the disposition of our other assets. Additionally, the Bank has up to $75.0 million available under Fed\nFunds lines with several commercial banks, and as of December 31, 2022, we had unfunded commitments from the SBA of $4.8 million.\nIn February 2021, we completed a private placement to certain institutional investors of $25.0 million aggregate principal amount\nof 7.25% unsecured senior notes due February 2026, with interest payable semiannually. Follow-on offerings of these notes in March\nand April 2021 raised an additional $3.3 million and $3.0 million.\nIn December 2020, we completed a private placement to certain institutional investors of $33.6 million aggregate principal amount\nof 7.50% unsecured senior notes due December 2027, with interest payable semiannually.

In addition, if we were required to liquidate some\nor all of our portfolio, the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments. Because we\nborrow money to make loans and investments, our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we\nborrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market\ninterest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income. In periods of sharply rising interest rates, our cost of funds\nwould increase, which would reduce our net interest income.\nWe use a combination of long-term and short-term borrowings and equity capital to finance our lending and investing activities.\nOur long-term fixed-rate loans and investments are financed primarily with fixed-rate debt. We may use interest rate risk management\ntechniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. We have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest\nrates on net interest income. Assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing\ninterest rate sensitivity a hypothetical immediate 1% increase in interest rates would result in an increase to net income as of\nDecember 31, 2022 by $1.2 million on an annualized basis, and the impact of such an immediate increase of 1% over a one year period\nwould have been a reduction in net income by $1.4 million at December 31, 2022. Although management believes that this measure is\nindicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality, size, and composition of\nthe assets on the balance sheet, and other business developments that could affect net income from operations in a particular quarter or\nfor the year taken as a whole. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential\noutcome simulated by these estimates.\nFrom time to time, we work with investment banking firms and other financial intermediaries to investigate the viability of several\nother financing options which include, among others, the sale or spinoff of certain assets or divisions, the development of a securitization\nconduit program, and other independent financing for certain subsidiaries or asset classes. These financing options would also provide\nadditional sources of funds for both external expansion and continuation of internal growth."

Prepayments on loans are influenced\nsignificantly by general interest rates, medallion loan market values, economic conditions, and competition.\nWe also generate liquidity through deposits generated at the Bank, through the issuance of SBA debentures, the issuance of\nprivately placed notes, and historically through borrowing arrangements with other banks, preferred equity securities at our subsidiaries,\nas well as from cash flow from operations. In addition, we may choose to participate a greater portion of our loan portfolio to third\nparties. We actively seek additional sources of liquidity; however, given market conditions, there can be no assurance that we will be\nable to secure additional liquidity on terms favorable to us or at all. If that occurs, we may decline to underwrite lower yielding loans in\norder to conserve capital until credit conditions in the market become more favorable; or we may be required to dispose of assets when\nwe would not otherwise do so, and at prices which may be below the net book value of such assets in order for us to repay indebtedness\non a timely basis.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, or Topic 326: Measurement of Credit Losses\non Financial Instruments, or ASU 2016-13. The main objective of this new standard is to provide financial statement users with more\ndecision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial assets and other commitments to extend credit held by a\nreporting entity at each reporting date. Under the FASB’s new standard, the concepts used by entities to account for credit losses on\nfinancial instruments will fundamentally change. The existing “probable” and “incurred” loss recognition threshold is removed. Loss\nestimates are based upon lifetime “expected” credit losses. The use of past and current events must now be supplemented with\n“reasonable and supportable” expectations about the future to determine the amount of credit loss. The collective changes to the\nrecognition and measurement accounting standards for financial instruments and their anticipated impact on the allowance for credit\nlosses modeling have been universally referred to as the CECL (current expected credit loss) model. ASU 2016-13 applies to all entities\nand is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 for public entities, with early adoption permitted. In November 2019,\nthe FASB issued ASU 2019-10 to defer implementation of the standard for smaller reporting companies to fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2022. We adopted Topic 326 on January 1, 2023. We anticipate the adoption will increase our allowance for loan losses\n(allowance for credit losses under CECL) by $11.6 million for consumer loans and a $2.2 million increase with respect to our commercial\nloans. The medallion loan allowance will not be affected. With the adoption of CECL, we expect that there will be earlier recognition\nof credit losses, including a near-term effect of larger loan loss provisions, compared to the incurred losses accounting standard."

This new standard amends certain Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, paragraphs from the Codification\nin response to the issuance of SEC Final Rule No. 33-10786, Amendments to Financial Disclosures About Acquired and Disposed\nBusinesses and SEC Rule No. 33-10835, Update of Statistical Disclosures for Bank and Savings and Loan Registrants.

The main objective of this new standard is to amend ASU 2016-13 in response\nto feedback received from the post-implementation review process. The amendments update ASU 2016-13 to require that an entity\nmeasure and record the lifetime expected credit losses on an asset upon origination or acquisition, and, as a result, credit losses from\nloans modified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) have been incorporated into the allowance for credit losses. The amendments also\nrequire the disclosure of current period gross write-offs, by year of origination, for financing receivables. ASU 2022-02 was effective\nupon the adoption of ASU 2016-13.\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement, or Topic 820: Fair Value Measurement of Equity\nSecurities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, or ASU 2016-13. This new standard is effective for the fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 31, 2023 and clarifies the guidance in Topic 820 when measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual\nrestrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security and introduces new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to\ncontractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value in accordance with Topic 820. We have assessed the impact of the update\nand determined it does not have a material impact on the accompanying financial statements."

      "text": "53\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur business activities contain elements of risk. We consider the principal types of risk to be fluctuations in interest rates and\nportfolio valuations. We consider the management of risk essential to conducting our businesses. Accordingly, our risk management\nsystems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risks, to set appropriate policies and limits, and to continually monitor\nthese risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs.\nIn addition, the illiquidity of portions of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of them at\ntimes when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments. In addition, if we were required to liquidate some\nor all of our portfolio, the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments. Because we\nborrow money to make loans and investments, our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we\nborrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market\ninterest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income. In periods of sharply rising interest rates, our cost of funds\nwould increase, which would reduce our net interest income. We use a combination of long-term and short-term borrowings and equity\ncapital to finance our investing activities. Our long-term fixed-rate investments are financed primarily with long-term fixed-rate debt,\nand to a lesser extent by floating-rate debt. We may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to\ninterest rate fluctuations. We have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Assuming that the\nbalance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity a hypothetical immediate\n1% increase in interest rates would result in an increase to net income as of December 31, 2022 by $1.2 million on an annualized basis,\nand the impact of such an immediate increase of 1% over a one year period would have been a reduction in net income of $1.4 million\nat December 31, 2022. Although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does\nnot adjust for potential changes in credit quality, size, and composition of the assets on the balance sheet, and other business\ndevelopments that could affect net income from operations in a particular quarter or for the year taken as a whole. Accordingly, no\nassurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by these estimates.\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nReference is made to the financial statements set forth under Item 15 (A) (1) in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which financial\nstatements are incorporated herein by reference in response to this Item 8.\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL\nDISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures pursuant to Rules 13a—15(e) and 15d – 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and have concluded that they are\neffective as of December 31, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports\nthat it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in\nthe SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer\nand Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures."

Projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making\nthis assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission,\nor COSO, in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its assessment and those criteria, management believes that we\nmaintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\nWe believe that the consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly represent our consolidated financial position\nand consolidated results of operations for all periods presented.\nOur Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, Mazars USA LLP, has audited and issued a report on management’s\nassessment of our internal control over financial reporting. The report of Mazars USA LLP appears below.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(d) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, have evaluated our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the\n2022 fourth quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting, and have concluded that there have been no changes that occurred during the 2022 fourth quarter that have materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting."

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated\nFramework: (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Medallion Financial Corp. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022\nand 2021 and the related consolidated statements of operations, other comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity,\nand cash flows for each of the three years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and our report dated March 10, 2023\nexpressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report\non Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material\nrespects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial\nreporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to\nthe maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention\nor timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial\nstatements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the\nresults of its operations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the three-year period ended\nDecember 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”),\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated\nMarch 10, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining,\non a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation\nof the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements\nthat were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are\nmaterial to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole,\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loans losses is assessed on a regular basis on\nloans segregated into homogenous pools based on similarities. Through the evaluation, general allowances for loan losses are assessed\nbased on historical delinquency and actual loss rates. General allowances are evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based\nupon management’s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and size of the loan\nportfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, prevailing\neconomic conditions, and excess concentration risks. Management also analyzes and considers several other relevant internal and\nexternal factors. Considering the estimation and judgment required by management in determining adjustments for loan losses, our audit\nof the allowance for loan losses and the related disclosures required a high degree of auditor judgment regarding the qualitative\nadjustments."

      "text": "F-9\nMEDALLION FINANCIAL CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2022\n(1) ORGANIZATION OF MEDALLION FINANCIAL CORP. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nMedallion Financial Corp., or the Company, is a specialty finance company organized as a Delaware corporation that reports as a\nbank holding company, but is not a bank holding company for regulatory purposes. The Company conducts its business through various\nwholly-owned subsidiaries including its primary operating company, Medallion Bank, or the Bank, a Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, or FDIC, insured industrial bank that originates consumer loans, raises deposits, and conducts other banking activities. The\nBank is subject to competition from other financial institutions and to the regulations of certain federal and state agencies, and undergoes\nexaminations by those agencies. The Bank was formed in May 2002 for the purpose of obtaining an industrial bank charter pursuant to\nthe laws of the State of Utah. The Bank originates consumer loans on a national basis for the purchase of recreational vehicles, or “RVs”,\nboats and other consumer recreational equipment and to finance home improvements such as replacement windows and roofs. Prior to\n2014, the Bank originated commercial loans to finance the purchase of taxi medallions, all of which are serviced by the Company. The\nloans are financed primarily with time certificates of deposit which are originated nationally through a variety of brokered deposit\nrelationships. In 2019, the Bank began building a strategic partnership program that targets relationships with financial technology, or\nfintech, companies to offer loans and other financial services to customers. The Bank entered into an initial partnership in 2020 and\ncontinues to evaluate and launch additional partnerships.\nThe Company also conducts business through its subsidiaries Medallion Capital, Inc., or MCI, a Small Business Investment\nCompany, or SBIC, which conducts a mezzanine financing business; Medallion Funding LLC, or MFC, an SBIC, which historically\nwas the Company's primary taxi medallion lending company; and Freshstart Venture Capital Corp., or FSVC, an SBIC that originated\nand services medallion and commercial loans. MCI, MFC, and FSVC, as SBICs, are regulated by the Small Business Administration,\nor SBA. MCI and FSVC are financed in part by the SBA.\nThe Company established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Medallion Financing Trust I, or Fin Trust, for the purpose of issuing\nunsecured preferred securities to investors. Fin Trust is a separate legal and corporate entity with its own creditors who, in any liquidation\nof Fin Trust, will be entitled to be satisfied out of Fin Trust’s assets prior to any value in Fin Trust becoming available to Fin Trust’s\nequity holders. The assets of Fin Trust, aggregating $34.0 million at December 31, 2022, are not available to pay obligations of its\naffiliates or any other party, and the assets of affiliates or any other party are not available to pay obligations of Fin Trust.\n(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the US,\nor GAAP, requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the\naccompanying notes. Accounting estimates and assumptions are those that management considers to be the most critical to an\nunderstanding of the consolidated financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties. All of\nthese estimates reflect management’s best judgment about current economic and market conditions and their effects based on\ninformation available as of the date of these consolidated financial statements. If such conditions change, it is reasonably possible that\nthe judgments and estimates could change, which may result in future impairments of loans and loan collateral in process of foreclosure,\ngoodwill and intangible assets, and investments, among other effects.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned and controlled\nsubsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions, balances, and profits (losses) have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company consolidates all entities it\ncontrols through a majority voting interest, a controlling interest through other contractual rights, or as being identified as the primary\nbeneficiary of VIEs. The primary beneficiary is the party who has both (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the entity’s economic performance, and (2) an obligation to absorb losses of the entity or a right to receive benefits\nfrom the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity. For consolidated entities that are less than wholly owned, the third-\nparty’s holding is recorded as non-controlling interest."

      "text": "F-10\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original purchased maturity of three months or less to be cash\nequivalents. Cash balances are generally held in accounts at large national or regional banking organizations in amounts that exceed the\nfederally insured limits. As of December 31, 2022, cash also includes $1.3 million of interest-bearing funds deposited in other banks,\nthat are mainly callable, with original terms of 3 to 5 years.\nFair Value of Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company follows the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820,\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or FASB ASC 820, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair\nvalue, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as an exit price (i.e. a price that would\nbe received to sell, as opposed to acquire, an asset or transfer a liability), and emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement.\nIt establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent\nexternal sources and the reporting entity’s own assumptions. Further, it specifies that fair value measurement should consider adjustment\nfor risk, such as the risk inherent in the valuation technique or its inputs. See also Notes 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nEquity Investments\nThe Company follows FASB ASC Topic 321, Investments – Equity Securities, or ASC 321, which requires all applicable\ninvestments in equity securities with a readily determinable fair value to be valued as such, and those without a readily determinable\nfair value, are measured at cost, less any impairment plus or minus any observable price changes. Equity investments of $10.3 million\nand $9.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, comprised mainly of nonmarketable stock and stock warrants, are recorded at cost\nless any impairment plus or minus observable price changes. As of December 31, 2022, cumulative impairment of $2.4 million had been\nrecorded with respect to these investments.\nDuring 2021, the Company purchased $2.0 million of equity securities with a readily determinable fair value. As a result, all\nunrealized gains and losses are included in gain (loss) on equity investments.

      "text": "F-11\nLoans\nThe Company’s loans are currently reported at the principal amount outstanding, inclusive of deferred loan acquisition costs,\nwhich primarily includes deferred fees paid to loan originators, and which is amortized to interest income over the life of the loan.\nLoan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the yield of the related\nloans. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, net loan origination costs were $34.9 million and $26.1 million. Net amortization to income\nfor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $8.7 million, $8.0 million, and $6.0 million.\nInterest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Medallion and commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status, and all\nuncollected accrued interest is reversed, when there is doubt as to the collectability of interest or principal, or if loans are 90 days or\nmore past due, unless management has determined that they are both well-secured and in the process of collection. Interest income on\nnonaccrual loans is generally recognized when cash is received, unless a determination has been made to apply all cash receipts to\nprincipal. The consumer loan portfolio has different characteristics, typified by a larger number of smaller dollar loans that have similar\ncharacteristics. A loan is considered to be impaired, or nonperforming, when based on current information and events, it is unlikely the\nCompany will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement. Management considers\nloans that are in bankruptcy status, but have not been charged-off, to be impaired. Consumer loans are placed on nonaccrual when they\nbecome 90 days past due, or earlier if they enter bankruptcy, and are charged-off in their entirety when deemed uncollectible, or when\nthey become 120 days past due, whichever occurs first, at which time appropriate recovery efforts against both the borrower and the\nunderlying collateral are initiated. For the recreation loan portfolio, the process to repossess the collateral is started at 60 days past due.\nIf the collateral is not located and the account reaches 120 days delinquent, the account is charged-off. If the collateral is repossessed, a\nloss is recorded by writing the collateral down to its fair value less selling costs, and the collateral is sent to auction. When the collateral\nis sold, the net auction proceeds are applied to the account, and any remaining balance is written off. Proceeds collected on charged-off\naccounts are recorded as recoveries. Total loans 90 days or more past due were $8.9 million or 0.47% of the total loan portfolio as of\nDecember 31, 2022, as compared to $4.0 million, or 0.28% as of December 31, 2021.\nIn situations where, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, the Company grants concessions\nto the borrower for other than an insignificant period of time that the Company would not otherwise consider, the related loan is classified\nas a troubled debt restructuring, or TDR. The Company strives to identify borrowers in financial difficulty early and work with them to\nmodify their loans to more affordable terms before they reach nonaccrual status. These modified terms may include rate reductions,\nprincipal forgiveness, term extensions, payment forbearance and other actions intended to minimize the economic loss to the Company\nand to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral. For modifications where the Company forgives principal, the entire amount\nof such principal forgiveness is immediately charged off. Loans classified as TDRs are considered impaired loans. Recreation loans\nwhich are party to a Chapter 13 bankruptcy are immediately classified as TDRs. The Company’s policy with regard to bankrupt\nrecreation loans is to take an immediate 40% write down of the loan balance.\nLoan collateral in process of foreclosure primarily includes medallion loans that have reached 120 days past due and have been\ncharged-down to their net realizable value, in addition to consumer repossessed collateral in the process of being sold. For New York\nCity medallion loans in the process of foreclosure, the Company continued to utilize a net value of $79,500 when assessing net realizable\nvalue for these medallion loans, despite fluctuating current transfer prices which may exceed that level from time to time. The \"loan\ncollateral in the process of foreclosure\" designation reflects that the collection activities on these loans have transitioned from working\nwith the borrower, to the liquidation of the collateral securing the loans. The Company accounts for its sales of loans in accordance with\nFASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, or FASB ASC 860, which provides accounting and\nreporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities. In accordance with FASB ASC 860,\nthe Company had elected the fair value measurement method for its servicing assets and liabilities. The principal portion of loans\nserviced for others by the Company and its affiliates was $19.5 million and $20.5 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company\nhas evaluated the servicing aspect of its business in accordance with FASB ASC 860 and determined that no material servicing asset or\nliability existed as of December 31, 2022 and 2021."

      "text": "F-12\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management’s periodic review of\nthe collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may\naffect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions, and excess\nconcentration risks. In analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, the Company uses historical delinquency and actual loss\nrates with a one-year lookback period for consumer loans. For commercial loans deemed nonperforming, the historical loss experience\nand other projections are looked at. For medallion loans, delinquent nonperforming loans are valued at collateral value for the most\nrecent quarter. Collateral value for the medallion loans is generally determined utilizing factors deemed relevant under the circumstances\nof the market including but not limited to: actual transfers, pending transfers, median and average sales prices, discounted cash flows,\nmarket direction and sentiment, and general economic trends for the industry and economy. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as\nit requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. As a result of COVID-19, the\nCompany determined that anticipated payment activity on the medallion portfolio was impossible to quantify upon exit of the six-month\ndeferral period with borrowers, and therefore deemed all such loans as impaired in the third quarter of 2020. As a result, all medallion\nloans were placed on nonaccrual and reserved down to collateral value, net of liquidation costs, which was $79,500 for New York City\nmedallions. The Company continued to use $79,500 as its internally determined value for assessing net realizable value for these\nmedallion loans, despite fluctuating current transfer prices which may exceed that level from time to time. The Company continues to\nmonitor the impact of COVID-19 on the consumer, commercial, and medallion loans. Credit losses are deducted from the allowance\nand subsequent recoveries are added back to the allowance.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company’s goodwill and intangible assets arose as a result of the excess of fair value over book value for several of the\nCompany’s previously unconsolidated portfolio investment companies as of April 2, 2018. This fair value was brought forward under\nthe Company’s new reporting, and was subject to a purchase price accounting allocation process conducted by an independent third-\nparty expert to arrive at the current categories and amounts. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to quarterly review by management\nto determine whether additional impairment testing is needed, and such testing is performed at least on an annual basis. Intangible assets\nare amortized over their useful life of approximately 20 years. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had intangible assets\nof $22.0 million and $23.5 million. During 2021, the Company disposed of its investment in RPAC Racing LLC, or RPAC, resulting in\nthe removal of $26.2 million of intangible assets. The Company recognized $1.4 million of amortization expense on the intangible assets\nfor each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Additionally, loan portfolio premiums of $12.4 million were determined as\nof April 2, 2018, of which $0 and $0.5 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and of which $0.5 million, $2.2\nmillion, and $3.0 million was amortized to interest income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. Management\nperformed a step 0 analysis in assessing the goodwill and intangibles for impairment at December 31, 2022 and 2021, concluding that\nthere was no impairment of these assets.\nThe following table details of the intangible assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2022\n2021\nBrand-related intellectual property\n$\n16,775\n$\n17,874\nHome improvement contractor relationships\n5,260\n5,606\nTotal intangible assets\n$\n22,035\n$\n23,480\nFixed Assets\nFixed assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over\ntheir estimated useful lives of 3 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease\nterm or the estimated economic useful life of the improvement. Depreciation and amortization expense was $0.4 million, $0.3 million,\nand $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nDeferred Costs\nDeferred financing costs represent costs associated with obtaining the Company’s borrowing facilities, and are amortized on a\nstraight line basis over the lives of the related financing agreements and life of the respective pool. Amortization expense was $2.6\nmillion, $2.4 million, and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. In addition, the Company capitalizes\ncertain costs for transactions in the process of completion (other than business combinations), including those for potential investments,\nand the sourcing of other financing alternatives. Upon completion or termination of the transaction, any accumulated amounts will be\namortized against income over an appropriate period, or written off. The amount on the Company’s balance sheet for all of these purposes\nwere $7.0 million and $7.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021."

      "text": "F-13\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes,\nor ASC 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the impact of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and\nliabilities and their tax basis and are stated at tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Deferred tax\nassets are also recorded for net operating losses, capital losses and any tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided\nagainst a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. All available\nevidence, both positive and negative, is considered to determine whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed. Items\nconsidered in determining the Company’s valuation allowance include expectations of future earnings of the appropriate tax character,\nrecent historical financial results, tax planning strategies, the length of statutory carryforward periods and the expected timing of the\nreversal of temporary differences. The Company recognizes tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only when the position is more likely\nthan not to be sustained assuming examination by tax authorities. The Company records income tax related interest and penalties, if\napplicable, within current income tax expense.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share (EPS)\nBasic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) resulting from operations available to common\nstockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the\npotential dilution that could occur if option contracts to issue common stock were exercised, or if restricted stock vests, and has been\ncomputed after giving consideration to the weighted average dilutive effect of the Company’s stock options and restricted stock. The\nCompany uses the treasury stock method to calculate diluted EPS, which is a method of recognizing the use of proceeds that could be\nobtained upon exercise of options and warrants, including unvested compensation expense related to the shares, in computing diluted\nEPS. It assumes that any proceeds would be used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. The table\nbelow shows the calculation of basic and diluted EPS.\nYear Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders\n$\n43,840\n$\n54,108\n$\n(34,783)\nWeighted average common shares outstanding applicable\nto basic EPS\n23,583,049\n24,599,804\n24,445,452\nEffect of dilutive stock options\n67,825\n92,602\n—\nEffect of restricted stock grants\n276,469\n250,763\n—\nAdjusted weighted average common shares outstanding applicable to diluted EPS\n23,927,342\n24,943,169\n24,445,452\nBasic income (loss) per share\n$\n1.86\n$\n2.20\n$\n(1.42)\nDiluted income (loss) per share\n1.83\n2.17\n(1.42)\nPotentially dilutive common shares excluded from the above calculations aggregated 347,963 shares, 421,190, and 934,003 shares\nas of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nStock Compensation\nThe Company follows FASB ASC Topic 718, or ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation, for its equity incentive, stock\noption, and restricted stock plans, and accordingly, the Company recognizes the expense of these grants as required. Stock-based\nemployee compensation costs pertaining to stock options are reflected in net income resulting from operations for any new grants using\nthe fair values established by usage of the Black-Scholes option pricing model, expensed over the vesting period of the underlying\noption. Stock-based employee compensation costs pertaining to restricted stock are reflected in net income resulting from operations for\nany new grants using the grant date fair value of the shares granted, expensed over the vesting period of the underlying stock.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company issued 522,475, 258,120, and 229,408 restricted shares\nof stock-based compensation awards, issued 0, 317,398, and 444,557 shares of other stock-based compensation awards, and issued\n129,638, 16,803, and 47,156 restricted stock units; and recognized $3.5 million, $2.3 million, and $2.0 million, or $0.15, $0.09, and\n$0.08 per diluted common share for each respective year, of non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the grants. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options and restricted stock was $3.9\nmillion, which is expected to be recognized over the next 9 quarters."

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions\nby regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy\nguidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve\nquantitative measures of the Bank’s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting\npractices. The Bank’s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the bank regulators about\ncomponents, risk weightings, and other factors.\nFDIC-insured banks, including the Bank, are subject to certain federal laws, which impose various legal limitations on the extent\nto which banks may finance or otherwise supply funds to certain of their affiliates. In particular, the Bank is subject to certain restrictions\non any extensions of credit to, or other covered transactions with, such as certain purchases of assets, the Company or its affiliates.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and\nratios as defined in the regulations (set forth in the table below). Additionally, as conditions of granting the Bank’s application for federal\ndeposit insurance, the FDIC ordered that the Tier 1 leverage capital to total assets ratio, as defined, be not less than 15%, a level which\ncould preclude its ability to pay dividends to the Company, and that an adequate allowance for loan losses be maintained. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the Bank’s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 16.2%.

The main objective of this new standard is to provide financial statement users with more\ndecision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial assets and other commitments to extend credit held by a\nreporting entity at each reporting date. Under the FASB’s new standard, the concepts used by entities to account for credit losses on\nfinancial instruments will fundamentally change. The existing “probable” and “incurred” loss recognition threshold is removed. Loss\nestimates are based upon lifetime “expected” credit losses. The use of past and current events must now be supplemented with\n“reasonable and supportable” expectations about the future to determine the amount of credit loss. The collective changes to the\nrecognition and measurement accounting standards for financial instruments and their anticipated impact on the allowance for credit\nlosses modeling have been universally referred to as the CECL (current expected credit loss) model. ASU 2016-13 applies to all entities\nand is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 for public entities, with early adoption permitted. In November 2019,\nthe FASB issued ASU 2019-10 to defer implementation of the standard for smaller reporting companies, such as the Company, to fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted Topic 326 on January 1, 2023. The Company anticipates the adoption\nwill increase in the Company's allowance for loan losses (allowance for credit losses under CECL) by $11.6 million for consumer loans\nand a $2.2 million increase with respect to the Company's commercial loans. The medallion loan allowance will not be affected. With\nthe adoption of CECL, the Company expects that there will be earlier recognition of credit losses, including a near-term effect of larger\nloan loss provisions, compared to the incurred losses accounting standard."

The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable\nincome during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible pursuant to ASC 740. The Company considers the reversal\nof deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The Company’s\nevaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets must consider both positive and negative evidence. The weight given to the potential\neffects of positive and negative evidence is based on the extent to which it can be objectively verified.

Annually,\nthe contracts with a five-year term will renew for new five-year terms unless prior to the end of the first year of each five-year term,\neither the Company or the executive provides notice to the other party of its intention not to extend the employment period beyond the\ncurrent five-year term. Typically, the contracts with a one- or two-year term will renew for new one- or two-year terms unless prior to\nthe term either the Company or the executive provides notice to the other party of its intention not to extend the employment period\nbeyond the current one or two-year term (as applicable); however, there is currently one agreement that renews after two years for\nadditional one- year terms. In the event of a change in control, as defined, during the employment period, the agreements provide for\nseverance compensation to the executive in an amount equal to the balance of the salary, bonus, and value of fringe benefits which the\nexecutive would be entitled to receive for the remainder of the employment period. Employment agreements expire at various dates\nthrough 2027, with future minimum payments under these agreements of approximately $11.8 million as follows:\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2023\n$\n4,128\n2024\n2,493\n2025\n2,131\n2026\n2,131\n2027\n888\nThereafter\n—\nTotal\n$\n11,771\n(B) OTHER COMMITMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2022 the Company had no other commitments. Generally, any commitments would be on the same terms as\nloans to or investments in existing borrowers or investees, and generally have fixed expiration dates. Since some commitments would\nbe expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements."

      "text": "F-29\n(C) SEC LITIGATION\nOn December 29, 2021, the SEC filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against\nthe Company and its President and Chief Operating Officer alleging certain violations of the antifraud, books and records, internal\ncontrols and anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws. The litigation relates to certain issues that occurred during the period\n2015 to 2017, including (i) the Company’s retention of third parties in 2015 and 2016 concerning posting information about the Company\non certain financial websites and (ii) the Company’s financial reporting and disclosures concerning certain assets, including Medallion\nBank, in 2016 and 2017, a period when the Company had previously reported as a business development company (BDC) under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940. Since April 2018, the Company does not report as a BDC, and has not worked with such third parties\nsince 2016. The Company does not expect to change previously reported financial results. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint on March 22, 2022, the SEC filed an amended complaint on April 26, 2022 and the Company filed a motion to dismiss the\namended complaint on August 5, 2022.\nThe SEC is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement plus pre-judgment interest and civil penalties in amounts unspecified, as well\nas an officer and director bar against the Company’s President and Chief Operating Officer. The Company and its President and Chief\nOperating Officer intend to defend themselves vigorously and believe that the SEC will not prevail on its claims. Nevertheless,\ndepending on the outcome of the litigation, the Company could incur a loss and other penalties that could be material to the Company,\nits results of operations and/or financial condition, as well as a bar against its President and Chief Operating Officer. In addition, the\nCompany has and expects to further incur significant legal fees and expenses in defending such charges by the SEC and the Company\nmay be subject to shareholder litigation relating to these SEC matters.\n(D) OTHER LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to inquiries from certain regulators and are currently involved in various legal\nproceedings incident to the normal course of business, including collection matters with respect to certain loans. The Company intends\nto vigorously defend any outstanding claims and pursue its legal rights. In the opinion of management, based on the advice of legal\ncounsel, except for the pending SEC litigation, as described above, there is no proceeding pending, or to the knowledge of management\nthreatened, which in the event of an adverse decision could result in a material adverse impact on the financial condition or results of\noperations of the Company.\n(11) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nCertain directors, officers, and stockholders of the Company are also directors and officers of its main consolidated subsidiaries,\nMFC, MCI, FSVC, and the Bank, as well as other subsidiaries. Officer salaries are set by the Board of Directors of the Company.\nJeffrey Rudnick, the son of one of the Company’s directors, served as the Company’s Senior Vice President at a salary of $239,000\nand 195,000 per year during 2022 and 2021, which was increased to $250,950 effective January 1, 2023. Mr. Rudnick received an\nannual cash bonus of $85,000, $75,000, and $32,500 as well as an equity bonus in the amount of $50,000, $45,019, and $30,000 for the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\n(12) STOCKHOLDERS’/SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nOn April 29, 2022, the Company's board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company\nwas authorized to repurchase up to $35 million of its shares, which was increased to $40 million on August 10, 2022. Such new\nrepurchase program replaced the previous one, which was terminated. During the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company\nrepurchased 2,650,911 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $20,618,843. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2022, up to\n$19,998,012 of shares remain authorized for repurchase under the Company's stock repurchase program.

Under the 401(k) Plan,\nan employee may elect to defer not less than 1% of total annual compensation, up to the applicable limits set forth in the Internal Revenue\nCode. Employee contributions are invested in various mutual funds according to the directions of the employee. Once eligible full-time\nemployees have completed a minimum of ninety (90) days of service, and part time employees have worked at least 1,000 hours, the\nCompany matches employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan in an amount per employee equal to fifty percent of the first 8% of the\nemployee’s annual contributions, subject to legal limits. Prior to June 1, 2022, the 401(k) Plan covered full- and part-time employees of\nthe Company aged 21 and older that had completed a minimum of thirty (30) days of service, with the Company matching one-third of\nthe first 6% of the contributions of eligible employees that had completed at least one (1) year of service (in the case of full-time\nemployees) or 1,000 hours (in the case of part-time employees).

The following methods and assumptions were used to\nestimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument. Fair value estimates that were derived from broker quotes cannot be\nsubstantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument.\n(a)\nCash and cash equivalents – Book value equals fair value.\n(b)\nEquity securities – The Company’s equity securities are recorded at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price\nchanges.\n(c)\nInvestment securities – The Company’s investments are recorded at the estimated fair value of such investments.\n(d)\nLoans receivable – The Company’s loans are recorded at book value which approximated fair value.\n(e)\nFloating rate borrowings – Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, the carrying amount approximates fair value.\n(f)\nCommitments to extend credit – The fair value of commitments to extend credit is estimated using the fees currently\ncharged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and present\ncreditworthiness of the counter parties. For fixed rate loan commitments, fair value also includes a consideration of the\ndifference between the current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the\nestimated fair value of these off-balance-sheet instruments was not material.\n(g)\nFixed rate borrowings – The fair value of the debentures payable to the SBA is estimated based on current market interest\nrates for similar debt.\nDecember 31,\n2022\n2021\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCarrying\nAmount\nFair\nValue\nCarrying\nAmount\nFair\nValue\nFinancial assets\nCash, cash equivalents, and federal funds sold (1)\n$\n105,598\n$\n105,598\n$\n124,484\n$\n124,484\nEquity investments\n10,293\n10,293\n9,726\n9,726\nInvestment securities\n48,492\n48,492\n44,772\n44,772\nLoans receivable\n1,853,108\n1,853,108\n1,438,758\n1,438,758\nAccrued interest receivable (2)\n12,613\n12,613\n10,621\n10,621\nEquity securities(3)\n1,724\n1,724\n1,950\n1,950\nFinancial liabilities\nFunds borrowed\n1,833,434\n1,833,434\n1,478,001\n1,478,001\nAccrued interest payable (2)\n4,790\n4,790\n3,395\n3,395\n(1)\nCategorized as level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, excluding $1.3 million as of December 31, 2022 and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2021 of interest-bearing\ndeposits categorized as level 2.

      "text": "F-31\n(15) FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nThe Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 820, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair\nvalue, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value, and enhances disclosure requirements\nfor fair value measurements.\nIn accordance with FASB ASC 820, the Company has categorized its assets and liabilities measured at fair value, based on the\npriority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority\nto quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3). The\nCompany's assessment and classification of an investment within a level can change over time based upon maturity or liquidity of the\ninvestment and would be reflected at the beginning of the quarter in which the change occurred.\nAs required by FASB ASC 820, when the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level\nwithin which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement\nin its entirety. For example, a level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable (levels 1 and 2) and unobservable\n(level 3). Therefore, gains and losses for such assets and liabilities categorized within the level 3 table below may include changes in\nfair value that are attributable to both observable inputs (levels 1 and 2) and unobservable inputs (level 3).\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value, recorded on the consolidated balance sheets, are categorized based on the inputs to\nthe valuation techniques as follows:\nLevel 1. Assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active\nmarket that the Company has the ability to access (examples include active exchange-traded equity securities, exchange-traded\nderivatives, most US Government and agency securities, and certain other sovereign government obligations).\nLevel 2. Assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are\nobservable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following:\na)\nQuoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets (for example, restricted stock);\nb)\nQuoted price for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets (for example, corporate and municipal bonds,\nwhich trade infrequently);\nc)\nPricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (examples include most\nover-the-counter derivatives, including interest rate and currency swaps); and\nd)\nPricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or\nother means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (examples include certain residential and commercial\nmortgage-related assets, including loans, securities, and derivatives).\nLevel 3. Assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both\nunobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management’s own assumptions about\nthe assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the assets or liability (examples include certain private equity\ninvestments, and certain residential and commercial mortgage-related assets, including loans, securities, and derivatives).\nA review of fair value hierarchy classification is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs\nmay result in a reclassification for certain assets or liabilities. Reclassifications impacting level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are reported\nas transfers in/out of the level 3 category as of the beginning of the quarter in which the reclassifications occur.\nEquity investments were recorded at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes. Commencing in 2020, the\nCompany elected to measure equity investments at fair value on a non-recurring basis, which have been adjusted for all periods\npresented."

Trust III had historically been consolidated as a\nsubsidiary of MFC, although it should have been consolidated under the variable interest model, since MFC was its primary beneficiary\nuntil October 31, 2018. Trust III was a VIE since the key decision-making authority rested in the servicing agreement (where MFC was\nthe servicer for Trust III) rather than in the voting rights of the equity interests and as a result the decision-making rights were considered\na variable interest. This conclusion was supported by a qualitative assessment that Trust III did not have sufficient equity at risk. Since\nthe inception of Trust III, MFC had also been party to a limited guaranty which was considered a variable interest because, pursuant to\nthe guaranty, MFC absorbed variability as a result of the on-going performance of the loans in Trust III. As of October 31, 2018, the\nCompany determined that MFC was no longer the primary beneficiary of Trust III and accordingly deconsolidated the VIE, leading to\na net gain of $25.3 million recorded as well as a new promissory note payable by MFC of $1.4 million issued in settlement of the limited\nguaranty. Subsequent to deconsolidation, the Company’s interest in Trust III was accounted for as an equity investment and had a value\nof $0 through its transfer to a third party in the 2021 third quarter. In addition, the Company remained the servicer of the assets of Trust\nIII for a fee, until its disposition.\n(19) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe Company has evaluated the effects of events that have occurred subsequent to December 31, 2022, through the date of\nfinancial statement issuance. As of such date, there were no subsequent events that required disclosure."
