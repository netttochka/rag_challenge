      "text": "Dear Stockholders,\nThe year 2022 was defined by volatility, both for \nAlcoa Corporation and the global commodity \nindustry. The first half of the year saw historically  \nhigh aluminum prices. But then global instability—\npartly driven by the war in Ukraine and the resulting \nEuropean energy crisis—upended markets in the \nsecond half of the year.\nThe year and its study in contrasts gave us another \nopportunity to demonstrate the strength and \nresiliency of our business. \nAcross Alcoa, we have worked diligently to build a \nstronger foundation, and our work has made us a more \nagile and resilient business for the various phases of \nthe commodity cycle. We are focused on delivering \nvalue today while continuing to focus on tomorrow.\nResponding to short-term challenges\nIssues stemming from the widespread global \ninstability in 2022 shocked the aluminum market, \nbut we acted swiftly. We reduced some production \ncapacity—when and where conditions warranted. \nFor example, to mitigate exorbitant energy costs, we \ncurtailed one-third of our production capacity at our \nsmelter in Lista, Norway and worked to sign a more \ncompetitive energy agreement for the future. \nSimilarly, we also reduced the output at our alumina \nrefinery in San Ciprián, Spain, due to high costs of \nnatural gas. We also safely completed the curtailment \nof the smelter there in January of 2022, per the terms \nof an agreement signed in December of 2021. Since \nthe curtailment, we have obtained two new wind-\nbased power purchase agreements that can supply \nup to three-fourths of the electricity at the smelter’s \nfull capacity, assuming final permitting needed for \nconstruction. A progressive restart of the site is now \nslated to begin in January of 2024.  \nWe also advanced strategic restarts of aluminum \nsmelting capacity that we expect will bring value to \nour business, including Alumar in Brazil and Portland \nAluminium, two smelter joint ventures we operate as \nmajority owners. \nOur decisive actions throughout the year helped our \nCompany effectively mitigate the effect of rapidly \nchanging market conditions, while still delivering \nagainst our strategic priorities.\nFavorable market dynamics in the first two quarters, \nincluding higher aluminum and alumina pricing, yielded \n$1 billion in net income despite high raw materials, \nenergy, and production costs. In the third and fourth \nquarters, we saw lower sales prices in alumina and \naluminum and incurred restructuring related charges \nrelated to noncash pension settlement charges, \ncontributing to a full year net loss of $123 million.\nDespite these challenges, we continue to be  \nwell-positioned with a strong balance sheet, ending \nthe year with $1.4 billion in cash and net debt of  \n$444 million and proportional adjusted net debt of \n$1.1 billion, as a result of our strategic, financial,  \nand operational actions over the past several years \nthat have strengthened the Company. \nIn 2022, we returned $572 million in capital to our \nstockholders through share repurchases and our \nquarterly cash dividend program. \nSupporting our long-term vision \nWhile we addressed short-term challenges, we \ncontinued to work on our long-term vision to reinvent \nthe aluminum industry for a sustainable future. \nLetter to Stockholders\nAcross Alcoa, we have worked  \ndiligently to build a stronger  \nfoundation, and our work has  \nmade us a more agile and resilient \nbusiness for the various phases  \nof the commodity cycle. \n4"

While still a small \npercentage of our overall volume, our sales of \nSustana’s low-carbon EcoLum™ metal grew more \nthan four times the previous year, driven mostly by \ndemand from the European market.\nImportantly, we also made progress on our roadmap \nof breakthrough technologies.

Business.\n(dollars in millions, except per-share amounts, average realized prices, and average cost amounts)\nThe Company\nAlcoa Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Company), is active in all aspects of the upstream aluminum industry with bauxite\nmining, alumina refining, and aluminum smelting and casting. The Company has direct and indirect ownership of 27 locations across\nnine countries on six continents.\nThe Company’s operations in 2022 comprised three reportable business segments: Bauxite, Alumina, and Aluminum. The Bauxite and\nAlumina segments primarily consist of a series of affiliated operating entities held in Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals, a global,\nunincorporated joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina Limited (described below). The Aluminum segment consists of the\nCompany’s aluminum smelting and casting operations along with most of the Company’s energy production assets. Beginning in\nJanuary 2023, the Company changed its operating segments, by combining the Bauxite and Alumina segments, and will report its\nfinancial results in the following two segments: (i) Alumina and (ii) Aluminum.\nAluminum, as an element, is abundant in the earth’s crust, but a multi-step process is required to make finished metal. Aluminum\nmetal is produced by refining alumina oxide from bauxite into alumina, which is then smelted into aluminum and can be cast into\nmany shapes and forms.\nAlcoa smelts and casts aluminum in various shapes and sizes for global customers, including developing and creating various alloy\ncombinations for specific applications.\nAluminum metal is a commodity traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and priced daily. Additionally, alumina is subject to\nmarket pricing through the Alumina Price Index (API), which is calculated by the Company based on the weighted average of a prior\nmonth’s daily spot prices published by the following three indices: CRU Metallurgical Grade Alumina Price, Platts Metals Daily\nAlumina PAX Price, and FastMarkets Metal Bulletin Non-Ferrous Metals Alumina Index. As a result, the prices of both aluminum\nand alumina are subject to significant volatility and, therefore, influence the operating results of Alcoa.\nAlcoa Corporation became an independent, publicly traded company on November 1, 2016, following its separation (the Separation\nTransaction) from its former parent company, Alcoa Inc. References herein to “ParentCo” refer to Alcoa Inc. and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries through October 31, 2016, at which time it was renamed Arconic Inc. (Arconic) and since has been subsequently renamed\nHowmet Aerospace Inc.\nBusiness Strategy\nAlcoa has three strategic priorities: reduce complexity, drive returns and advance sustainably. The Company strives to operate with\nlean overhead and manage its portfolio of assets with the goal of profitability through all market cycles. Alcoa aims to drive margin-\nfocused growth and innovate and create low-carbon solutions. Alcoa works to be a responsible and reliable producer, which includes\nengagement with communities in which it operates to bring shared value.\nToday, Alcoa has a comprehensive suite of SustanaTM brand products, which includes EcoDuraTM aluminum, EcoLumTM aluminum,\nand EcoSourceTM alumina.\nFurther, Alcoa has active research and development projects that have the potential to drive value by reducing costs, improving\nefficiency, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in both alumina refining and aluminum smelting. The roadmap of technologies\ninclude:\n•\nThe ELYSISTM joint venture uses an aluminum smelting technology that eliminates all direct greenhouse gas emissions from\nthe traditional smelting process, instead emitting pure oxygen as a byproduct. The research and development program is\nbeing ramped up to commercial scale and commercial-grade research and development scale quantities of the metal have\nbeen used by top-tier brands including Apple Inc. and Audi AG.\n•\nThe Refinery of the Future initiative aims to achieve alumina refining with no direct greenhouse gas emissions through\nadapting various processes and new technologies under development for alumina refining, such as mechanical vapor\nrecompression (MVR) and electric calcination.\n•\nThe ASTRAEATM process is a proprietary technology under development that can purify post-consumer aluminum scrap,\nregardless of alloy combination, and beneficiate it up to high purity levels that exceed what is produced at most primary\naluminum smelters operating today, permitting use in high tolerance applications, such as aerospace.\nAlcoa has received annual recognition from S&P Dow Jones Sustainability Indices and has also earned certifications from the\nAluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI), a comprehensive third-party program to verify responsible production in the aluminum\nindustry. Alcoa has certified 17 operating sites and can market globally ASI-certified bauxite, alumina, and aluminum."

      "text": "2\nIn 2019, the Company announced a five year strategic portfolio review of smelting and refining capacity to improve cost positioning,\nincluding curtailment, closure or divestiture. Through 2021, Alcoa reached approximately 75 and 58 percent of its target to improve,\ncurtail, close, or divest 1.5 and 4 million metric tons of smelting and refining capacity, respectively. While no actions were taken in\n2022 related to these targets, the Company took actions in response to market conditions, and the strategic portfolio review is\ncontinuing.\nThe Company has the goal of being the lowest emitter of carbon dioxide among all global aluminum companies, per ton of emissions\nin both smelting and refining, and aims to move its aluminum asset portfolio to a first quartile cost position relative to other aluminum\nproducers upon completion of our portfolio review. In 2022, Alcoa exceeded its target of 85 percent of its smelting portfolio being\npowered by renewable energy, attaining 86 percent. Renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished\nconstantly, such as sunlight, wind, and hydropower.\nSee Part II Item 7 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nunder caption Business Update.\nJoint Ventures\nAlcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC)\nAWAC is an unincorporated global joint venture between Alcoa Corporation and Alumina Limited, a company incorporated under the\nlaws of the Commonwealth of Australia and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.

An equity call can be made on\n30 days’ notice, subject to certain limitations, in the event the aggregate annual capital budget of AWAC requires an equity\ncontribution from Alcoa and Alumina Limited.\nDividend Policy\nAWAC will generally be required to distribute at least 50% of the prior calendar quarter’s net income of each AWAC entity, and\ncertain AWAC entities will also be required to pay a distribution every three months equal to the amount of available cash above\nspecified thresholds and subject to the forecast cash needs of the AWAC entity.\nLeveraging Policy\nDebt of AWAC is subject to a limit of 30% of total capital (defined as the sum of debt (net of cash) plus any minority interest plus\nshareholder equity). The AWAC joint venture has raised a limited amount of debt to fund growth projects as permitted under Alcoa’s\nrevolving credit line and in accordance with the joint venture partnership agreements.\nSaudi Arabia Joint Venture\nIn December 2009, Alcoa entered into a joint venture with the Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Ma’aden), which was formed by the\ngovernment of Saudi Arabia to develop its mineral resources and create a fully integrated aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia.\nMa’aden is listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul). The joint venture complex includes a bauxite mine with estimated capacity\nof 5 million dry metric tons per year; an alumina refinery with a capacity of 1.8 million metric tons per year (mtpy); and an aluminum\nsmelter with a capacity of 780,000 mtpy.\nThe joint venture is currently comprised of two entities: the Ma’aden Bauxite and Alumina Company (MBAC) and the Ma’aden\nAluminium Company (MAC). Ma’aden owns a 74.9% interest in the MBAC and MAC joint venture. Alcoa owns a 25.1% interest in\nMAC, which holds the smelter; AWAC holds a 25.1% interest in MBAC, which holds the mine and refinery. The refinery and smelter\nare located within the Ras Al Khair industrial zone on the east coast of Saudi Arabia.\nIn accordance with the June 2019 amended joint venture agreement, Ma’aden’s put option and Alcoa Corporation’s call option,\nrelating to additional interests in the joint venture, were exercisable for a period of six months after October 1, 2021. On March 31,\n2022, Ma’aden’s and Alcoa’s put and call options, respectively, expired with neither party exercising their options.\nThe amended joint venture agreement defined October 1, 2021 as the date after which Alcoa is permitted to sell all of its shares in\nboth MBAC and MAC collectively, for which Ma’aden has a right of first refusal. Prior to this date, Ma’aden and Alcoa Corporation\ncould not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of, pledge, or encumber any interests in the joint venture. Under the amended joint\nventure agreement, upon the occurrence of an unremedied event of default by Alcoa, Ma’aden may purchase, or, upon the occurrence\nof an unremedied event of default by Ma’aden, Alcoa may sell, its interest in the joint venture for consideration that varies depending\non the time of the default.\nELYSIS\nELYSIS Limited Partnership is a joint venture between wholly-owned subsidiaries of Alcoa (48.235%) and Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. (Rio\nTinto) (48.235%), respectively, and Investissement Québec (3.53%), a company wholly-owned by the Government of Québec,\nCanada. The purpose of the ELYSIS joint venture is to advance larger scale development and commercialization of its patent-\nprotected technology that produces oxygen and eliminates all direct greenhouse gas emissions from the traditional aluminum smelting\nprocess. Alcoa invented the inert anode technology for the aluminum smelting process that serves as the basis for the ELYSIS joint\nventure. Batches of aluminum produced by ELYSIS have been sold for use by such companies as Apple Inc. and Audi AG, as the\njoint venture continues working toward an industrial scale with a technology package planned for sale beginning in 2024.\nOthers\nThe Company is party to several other joint ventures and consortia. See additional details within each business segment discussion\nbelow.\nThe Aluminerie de Bécancour Inc. (ABI) smelter is a joint venture between Alcoa and Rio Tinto located in Bécancour, Québec. Alcoa\nowns 74.95% of the joint venture through the equity investment in Pechiney Reynolds Quebec, Inc., which owns a 50.1% share of the\nsmelter, and two wholly-owned Canadian subsidiaries, which own 49.9% of the smelter.

Boké Investment Company is owned 100% by Halco (Mining) Inc.; AWA LLC holds a 45%\ninterest in Halco. AWA LLC is part of the AWAC group of companies and is ultimately owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina\nLimited.\nUntil the sale of Alcoa’s interest in April 2022, MRN was a joint venture between Alcoa Alumínio (8.58%), AWA Brasil (AWAB)\n(4.62%), and AWA LLC (5%), each a subsidiary of Alcoa, and affiliates of Rio Tinto (12%), Companhia Brasileira de Alumínio\n(10%), Vale S.A. (Vale) (40%), South32 Limited (South32) (14.8%), and Norsk Hydro ASA (5%) for the operation of a bauxite mine\nin Porto Trombetas in the state of Pará in Brazil. AWAB and AWA LLC are part of the AWAC group of companies and are ultimately\nowned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited.\nOn April 30, 2022, Alcoa completed the sale of its investment in MRN for proceeds of $10. An additional $30 in cash could be paid to\nthe Company in the future if certain post-closing conditions related to future MRN mine development are satisfied. Related to this\ntransaction, the Company recorded an asset impairment of $58 in the first quarter of 2022 in Restructuring and other charges, net on\nthe Statement of Consolidated Operations. In addition, the Company entered into several bauxite offtake agreements with South32\nMinerals S.A. to provide bauxite supply for existing long-term supply contracts.\nAlumar is an unincorporated joint venture for the operation of a refinery, smelter, and casthouse in Brazil. The refinery is owned by\nAWAB (39.96%), Rio Tinto (10%), Alcoa Alumínio (14.04%), and South32 (36%). AWAB is part of the AWAC group of companies\nand is ultimately owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited. With respect to Rio Tinto and South32, the named company or\nan affiliate thereof holds the interest. The smelter and casthouse are owned by Alcoa Alumínio (60%) and South32 (40%).\nStrathcona calciner is a joint venture between affiliates of Alcoa and Rio Tinto. Calcined coke is used as a raw material in aluminum\nsmelting. The calciner is owned by Alcoa (39%) and Rio Tinto (61%); Alcoa’s capacity is currently idled in connection with the\ncurtailment of the Intalco aluminum smelter.\nHydropower\nMachadinho Hydro Power Plant (HPP) is a consortium located on the Pelotas River in southern Brazil in which the Company has a\n25.7% ownership interest through Alcoa Alumínio. The remaining ownership interests are held by unrelated third parties.\nBarra Grande HPP is a joint venture located on the Pelotas River in southern Brazil in which the Company has a 42.2% ownership\ninterest through Alcoa Alumínio. The remaining ownership interests are held by unrelated third parties.\nEstreito HPP is a consortium between Alcoa Alumínio, through Estreito Energia S.A. (25.5%) and unrelated third parties located on\nthe Tocantins River, northern Brazil.\nSerra do Facão HPP is a joint venture between Alcoa Alumínio (35%) and unrelated third parties located on the Sao Marcos River,\ncentral Brazil.\nManicouagan Power Limited Partnership (Manicouagan) is a joint venture between affiliates of Alcoa and Hydro-Québec.\nManicouagan owns and operates the 335 megawatt McCormick hydroelectric project, which is located on the Manicouagan River in\nthe Province of Québec, Canada. Alcoa owns 40% of the joint venture.\nBauxite\nThis segment consists of the Company’s global bauxite mining operations. Bauxite is the principal raw material used to produce\nalumina and contains various aluminum hydroxide minerals, the most important of which are gibbsite and boehmite. Bauxite is refined\nusing the Bayer process, the principal industrial chemical process for refining bauxite to produce alumina, a compound of aluminum\nand oxygen that is the raw material used by smelters to produce aluminum metal. The Company obtains bauxite from its own\nresources, including those belonging to AWAC, as well as through long-term and short-term contracts and mining leases. Tons of\nbauxite are reported on a zero-moisture basis in millions of dry metric tons (mdmt) unless otherwise stated.\nIn 2022, Alcoa-operated mines supplied 92 percent of their volume to Alcoa refineries and sold the remaining 8 percent to third-party\ncustomers. Alcoa-operated mines produced 36.7 mdmt of bauxite and mines operated by partnerships in which Alcoa, including\nAWAC, has equity interests produced 5.4 mdmt of bauxite on a proportional equity basis, for a total Company bauxite production of\n42.1 mdmt.\nOn April 30, 2022, Alcoa completed the sale of its investment in MRN. The Company entered into several bauxite offtake agreements\nwith South32 to provide bauxite supply for existing long-term supply contracts.\nBased on the terms of its bauxite supply contracts, the amount of bauxite AWAC purchases from its minority-owned joint ventures,\nMRN (until its sale in April 2022) and CBG, differ from its proportional equity in those mines. Therefore, in 2022, Alcoa had access\nto 43.0 mdmt of production from its portfolio of bauxite interests and bauxite offtake and supply agreements and sold 3.5 mdmt of\nbauxite to third parties; 39.5 mdmt of bauxite was delivered to Alcoa refineries."

Accordingly,\nsegment information for all prior periods presented will be updated to reflect the new segment structure in future Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K filings.\nInformation regarding the Company’s bauxite mining properties and bauxite mineral resources and reserves is included in Part 1 Item\n2 of this Form 10-K.\nAlumina\nThis segment consists of the Company’s worldwide refining system, which processes bauxite into alumina. Alcoa’s alumina sales are\nmade to customers globally and are typically priced by reference to published spot market prices. The Company produces smelter\ngrade alumina and non-metallurgical grade alumina. The Company’s largest customer for smelter grade alumina is its own aluminum\nsmelters, which in 2022 accounted for approximately 30% of its total alumina shipments. A small portion of the alumina (non-\nmetallurgical grade) is sold to third-party customers who process it into industrial chemical products. This segment also includes\nAWAC’s 25.1% share of MBAC.\nThe Company primarily sells alumina through fixed price spot sales and contracts containing two pricing components: (1) the API\nprice basis and (2) a negotiated adjustment basis that takes into account various factors, including freight, quality, customer location,\nand market conditions. In 2022, approximately 96% of the Company’s smelter grade alumina shipments to third parties were sold on a\nfixed price spot basis or adjusted API price basis.\nAlcoa’s alumina refining facilities and its worldwide alumina capacity stated in metric tons per year (mtpy) are shown in the following\ntable:\nCountry\nFacility\nNameplate\nCapacity1\n(000 mtpy)\nAlcoa\nCorporation\nConsolidated\nCapacity1\n(000 mtpy)\nAustralia (AofA)\nKwinana\n2,190\n2,190\nPinjarra\n4,700\n4,700\nWagerup\n2,879\n2,879\nBrazil\nPoços de Caldas\n390\n390\nSão Luís (Alumar)\n3,860\n2,084\nSpain\nSan Ciprián\n1,600\n1,600\nTOTAL\n15,619\n13,843\nEquity Interests:\nCountry\nFacility\nNameplate\nCapacity1\n(000 mtpy)\nAlcoa\nCorporation\nConsolidated\nCapacity1\n(000 mtpy)\nSaudi Arabia\nRas Al Khair (MBAC)\n1,800\n452\n(1)\nNameplate Capacity is an estimate based on design capacity and normal operating efficiencies and does not necessarily represent\nmaximum possible production.

Idle capacity of 800,000 mtpy at the San Ciprián refinery is due to the partial curtailment of the refinery in 2022 and\n214,000 mtpy of idle capacity at the Poços de Caldas facility is a result of the previous full curtailment of the Poços de Caldas smelter.\nIn October 2019, the Company announced a five-year review of our production assets that includes a range of potential outcomes for\nthese facilities to improve cost positioning, including curtailment, closure, or divestiture. The review includes 4 million metric tons of\nglobal refining capacity, of which 2,305,000 mtpy of capacity has been permanently closed since the announced review.\nIn 2022, production at the San Ciprián refinery was reduced to approximately 50 percent of the 1.6 million metric tons of annual\ncapacity to mitigate the financial impact of high natural gas costs. The Company is actively reviewing the location’s operating levels\ngiven the ongoing volatility in European energy markets."

The portfolio review includes evaluations to improve cost positioning, including curtailments, closures, or divestitures. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 868,000 mtpy of idle smelting capacity relative to total Alcoa consolidated\ncapacity of 2,968,000 mtpy. The idle capacity includes the capacity at the fully curtailed Intalco smelter, 228,000 mtpy of idle\ncapacity at the San Ciprián smelter, 162,000 mtpy of idle capacity at the Warrick smelter, 157,000 mtpy of idle capacity at the Alumar\nsmelter, 31,000 mtpy of idle capacity at the Lista smelter, and 11,000 mtpy of idle capacity at the Portland smelter.\nOn August 30, 2022, the Company announced the curtailment of one-third of its production capacity (31 kmt) at the Lista (Norway)\nsmelter. The site’s exposure to spot energy pricing during the third quarter of 2022 caused significant cost increases. In July 2022, the\nCompany entered into a fixed price power agreement effective for the fourth quarter of 2022 through December 31, 2023. In February\n2023, the agreement was amended with improved fixed pricing and lower volume commitments.\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company announced curtailment of approximately 54,000 mtpy at the Warrick smelter in the state of Indiana.\nIn January 2022, Alcoa completed the curtailment of the San Ciprián aluminum smelter’s 228,000 mtpy of annual capacity while the\ncasthouse continues to operate. The curtailment is a result of an agreement that was reached with the workers’ representatives in\nDecember 2021 to suspend production due to exorbitant energy prices in Spain and to begin the restart process in January 2024. On\nFebruary 3, 2023, the Company reached an updated agreement with the workers’ representatives to commence the restart process in\nphases beginning in January 2024. Alcoa plans that all pots will be restarted by October 1, 2025, and from October 1, 2025 until the\nend of 2026, the minimum production will be 75 percent of the nominal capacity of 228,000 mtpy.\nOn September 20, 2021, the Company announced its plan to restart its 268,000 mtpy per year share of capacity at the Alumar smelter\nin São Luís, Brazil, which had been fully curtailed since 2015. The first metal sales occurred in the second quarter of 2022 and the\nCompany continues to progress the restart of the smelter.\nIn October 2022, the Company completed the restart of 35,000 mtpy (19,000 mtpy Alcoa share) of previously curtailed annual\ncapacity at the Portland aluminum smelter in Australia that was previously announced in November 2021. With the restart complete,\nthe plant is operating at approximately 95 percent of its total capacity and Alcoa has approximately 186,000 mtpy of consolidated\nannual capacity operating at Portland.\nEnergy Facilities and Sources\nIn 2022, energy comprises approximately 30% of the Company’s total alumina refining production costs and electric power comprises\napproximately 25% of the Company’s primary aluminum production costs.\nElectricity markets are regional and are limited by physical and regulatory constraints, including the physical inability to transport\nelectricity efficiently over long distances, the design of the electric grid, including interconnections, and the regulatory structure\nimposed by various federal and state entities.\nElectricity contracts may be short-term (real-time or day ahead) or years in duration, and contracts can be executed for immediate\ndelivery or years in advance. Pricing may be fixed, indexed to an underlying fuel source or other index such as LME, cost-based or\nbased on regional market pricing. In 2022, Alcoa generated approximately 11% of the power used at its smelters worldwide and\ngenerally purchased the remainder under long-term arrangements.\nThe following table sets forth the electricity generation capacity and 2022 generation of facilities in which Alcoa Corporation has an\nownership interest.

During 2022, approximately 37% of the generation from the Warrick power plant was sold into the market under its current\noperating permits. Alcoa Power Generating Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, also owns certain Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission (FERC)-regulated transmission assets in Indiana, Tennessee, New York, and Washington.\nThe consolidated capacity of the Brazilian energy facilities shown above in megawatts (MW) is the assured energy, representing\napproximately 52% of hydropower plant nominal capacity. Since May 2015 (after curtailment of the Poços de Caldas and São Luís\nsmelters in Brazil), the excess generation capacity from the Brazilian hydroelectric facilities has been sold into the market.\nBelow is an overview of our external energy for our smelters and refineries.\nExternal Energy Source\nRegion\nElectricity\nNatural Gas\nNorth\nAmerica\nQuébec, Canada\nAlcoa’s smelter located in Baie-Comeau, Quebec, purchases approximately one-\nquarter of its electricity needs from Manicouagan Power Limited Partnership.\nOtherwise, all electricity consumed by the three smelters in Québec is purchased\nunder contracts with Hydro-Québec that expire on December 31, 2029.\nMassena, New York (Massena West)\nThe Massena West smelter in New York receives power from the New York\nPower Authority (NYPA) pursuant to a contract between Alcoa and NYPA that\nexpires in March 2026.\nAlcoa generally procures natural gas on a\ncompetitive bid basis from a variety of\nsources, including producers in the gas\nproduction areas and independent gas\nmarketers. Contract pricing for gas is\ntypically based on a published industry\nindex such as the New York Mercantile\nExchange (NYMEX).\nAustralia\nPortland\nThis smelter purchases power from the National Electricity Market (NEM)\nvariable spot market in the state of Victoria. During 2021, the smelter entered\ninto fixed-for-floating swap contracts with AGL Hydro Partnership, Origin\nEnergy Electricity Limited and Alinta Energy CEA Trading Pty Ltd, at a\ncombined level of 515 MW. In addition, in November 2021 the Portland\nAluminium joint venture announced the planned restart of 35,000 mtpy of idle\ncapacity (19,000 mtpy Alcoa share) which was underpinned by an additional\nfixed-for-floating swap contract with AGL Hydro Partnership for 72 MW. These\nswap contracts manage exposure to the variable energy rates from the NEM spot\nmarket. The swap contracts will expire on June 30, 2026.\nWestern Australia\nAofA uses gas to co-generate steam and\nelectricity for its alumina refining\nprocesses at the Kwinana, Pinjarra and\nWagerup refineries. In 2015, AofA\nsecured a significant portion of gas\nsupplies to 2032, covering more than 95\npercent of the refineries’ gas\nrequirements through 2023 and\ndecreasing percentages thereafter. In\n2020 and 2022, AofA contracted for\nadditional gas supplies starting in 2024.\nOn a combined basis, these gas supply\narrangements are expected to cover\napproximately 80% of the refineries’ gas\nrequirements through 2027.\nIn January 2023, the Company reduced\nproduction at the Kwinana (Australia)\nrefinery by approximately 30 percent in\nresponse to a domestic natural gas\nshortage in Western Australia due to\nproduction challenges experienced by\nkey gas suppliers."

The Company continues to negotiate with\nother generators to secure the remaining power supply needs for the smelter.\nThe supply of energy will depend on the permitting and development of the\nwindfarms.\nLista and Mosjøen, Norway\nBeginning in 2017, Alcoa entered into several long-term power purchase\nagreements, which secured approximately 50 percent of the necessary power for\nthe Norwegian smelters for the period of 2020 to 2035. The remaining 50 percent\nwas purchased under short-term contracts. In 2022, approximately 25 percent of\nthe necessary power at the Mosjøen (Norway) smelter was purchased at spot\nrates. Financial compensation of the indirect carbon emissions costs passed\nthrough in the electricity bill is received in accordance with EU Commission\nGuidelines and the Norwegian compensation regime. During 2022, the Company\nacted to mitigate spot energy pricing at the Lista (Norway) smelter. In July 2022,\nthe Company entered into a fixed price power agreement effective for the fourth\nquarter of 2022 through December 31, 2023. In February 2023, the agreement\nwas amended with improved fixed pricing and lower volume commitments. The\nCompany is continuing to review operating levels with changes in market\nconditions.\nIceland\nLandsvirkjun, the Icelandic national power company, supplies competitively\npriced electricity from a hydroelectric facility to Alcoa’s Fjarðaál smelter\nunder a 40-year power contract, which will expire in 2047 with a price\nrenegotiation effective from 2027.\nSpain\nIn January 2022, Naturgy terminated its\ncontract supplying 50 percent of the\nrefinery’s natural gas demand until June\n2022 and 25 percent from July to\nDecember 2022. Subsequent to February\n2022, the Company has access to\nadequate supply at spot gas rates.\nSouth\nAmerica\nAlumar\nOn September 20, 2021, the Company announced its plan to restart its 268\nkmt per year share of capacity at the Alumar smelter in São Luís, Brazil,\nwhich had been fully curtailed since 2015. The first metal sales occurred in the\nsecond quarter of 2022 and the Company continues to progress the restart of\nthe smelter. Alcoa entered into several short-term power purchase agreements\nwhich secured substantially all of the necessary power for its share of the\nAlumar smelter for the restart period in 2022 through the end of 2023. Alcoa\nalso entered into multiple long-term power purchase agreements which\ncollectively secured all of the necessary power for its share of the Alumar\nsmelter for the period of 2024 through 2038. All power secured for short and\nlong term is from renewable sources.\nSources and Availability of Raw Materials\nThe Company believes that the raw materials necessary to its business are and will continue to be available and that the sources and\navailability of such raw materials are currently adequate. Generally, materials are purchased from third-party suppliers under\ncompetitively priced supply contracts or bidding arrangements. Substantially all of the raw materials required to manufacture our\nproducts are available from more than one supplier. Some sources of these raw materials are located in countries that may be subject\nto unstable political and economic conditions, which could disrupt supply or affect the price of these materials.\nCertain raw materials, such as caustic soda and calcined petroleum coke, may be subject to significant price volatility which could\nimpact our financial results."

Because of the number of different types of elements that can be used to\nproduce various alloys, providing a range of such elements would not be meaningful. With the exception of a very small number of\ninternally used products, Alcoa produces its aluminum alloys in adherence to an Aluminum Association (of which Alcoa is an active\nmember) standard, which uses a specific designation system to identify alloy types. In general, each alloy type has a major alloying\nelement other than aluminum but will also include lesser amounts of other constituents.\nCompetition\nAlcoa is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of the aluminum supply chain in which it competes. With our business\nsegments operating in close proximity to our broad, worldwide customer base, we endeavor to meet customer demand in key markets\nin North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Australia, and China.\nWe compete with a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets across the aluminum supply chain. Competitors\ninclude bauxite miners who supply to the third-party bauxite market, alumina suppliers, refiners and producers, commodity traders,\naluminum producers, and producers of alternative materials such as steel, titanium, copper, carbon fiber, composites, plastic, and\nglass.\nBy having an integrated aluminum value chain, we are able to offer our Sustana line of products manufactured through low-carbon\nemitting processes, which includes: EcoSource alumina, Ecolum aluminum, and EcoDura aluminum.\nBauxite\nWe are among the world’s largest bauxite miners. The majority of bauxite mined globally is converted to alumina for the production\nof aluminum. In 2022, approximately 8% of Alcoa’s bauxite shipments were sold to third-party customers and Alcoa-operated mines\nsupply approximately 92% of their volume to Alcoa refineries.\nAlcoa’s share of mines operated by partnerships in which Alcoa, including AWAC, has equity interests, supply approximately 55% of\ntheir volume to Alcoa refineries. Our principal competitors in the third-party bauxite market include Rio Tinto and multiple suppliers\nfrom Guinea, Australia, Indonesia, and Brazil, among other countries. We compete largely based on bauxite quality, price, and\nproximity to customers, as well as strategically located long-term bauxite resources in Australia, Brazil, and Guinea, which is home to\nthe world’s largest reserves of high-quality metallurgical grade bauxite.\nAlumina\nWe are the world’s largest alumina producer outside of China. The alumina market is global and highly competitive, with many active\nsuppliers, producers, and commodity traders. Our main competitors in the third-party alumina market are Aluminum Corporation of\nChina, South32, Hangzhou Jinjiang Group, Rio Tinto, and Norsk Hydro ASA. In recent years, there has been significant growth in\nalumina refining in China and India. The majority of our product is sold in the form of smelter grade alumina."

      "text": "11\nKey factors influencing competition in the alumina market include cost position, price, reliability of bauxite supply, quality, and\nproximity to customers and end markets. We had an average cost position in the first quartile of global alumina production in 2022.\nOur refineries are strategically located near low-cost bauxite mines, which provide a long-term supply of bauxite to our refining\nportfolio. Our alumina refineries include sophisticated refining technology to maximize efficiency with the bauxite grades from these\ninternal mines.\nThe Company anticipates continuing growth in its EcoSource low carbon smelter-grade alumina from smelting customers. Alumina-\nassociated emissions are generally the third largest component of aluminum’s carbon footprint.\nAluminum\nIn our Aluminum segment, competition is dependent upon the type of product we are selling.\nThe market for primary aluminum is global, and demand for aluminum varies widely from region to region. We compete with\ncommodity traders, such as Glencore, Trafigura, J. Aron and Gerald Group, and aluminum producers such as Emirates Global\nAluminum, Norsk Hydro ASA, Rio Tinto, Century Aluminum, Vedanta Aluminum Ltd., and United Company RUSAL Plc.\nSeveral of the most critical competitive factors in our industry are product quality, production costs (including source, reliability of\nsupply, and cost of energy), price, access and proximity to raw materials, customers and end markets, timeliness of delivery, customer\nservice (including technical support), product innovation, and breadth of offerings. Where aluminum products compete with other\nmaterials, the characteristics of aluminum are also a significant factor, particularly its light weight, strength, and recyclability.\nIncreasingly, Alcoa is seeing higher demand for its Sustana line of products by customers focused on low carbon inputs throughout\ntheir supply chain.\nThe strength of our position in the primary aluminum market is largely attributable to: our integrated supply chain; long-term energy\narrangements; the ability of our casthouses to provide customers with a diverse product portfolio in terms of shapes and alloys; and\nour decreasing demand for fossil fuels, as approximately 86% of the aluminum smelting portfolio operated by the Company was\npowered by renewable (primarily hydropower) energy sources in 2022. The Company intends to continue to focus on optimizing\ncapacity utilization.\nPatents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks\nThe Company believes that its domestic and international patent, trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a competitive\nadvantage. The Company’s rights under its intellectual property, as well as the technology and products made and sold under them,\nare important to the Company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. Alcoa’s business as a whole is\nnot, however, materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret or trademark. As a result of product development and\ntechnological advancement, the Company continues to pursue patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world. As of December\n31, 2022, Alcoa’s worldwide patent portfolio consisted of approximately 400 granted patents and 180 pending patent applications. The\nCompany also has a number of domestic and international registered trademarks that have significant recognition within the markets\nthat are served, including the name “Alcoa” and the Alcoa symbol.\nIn connection with the Separation Transaction, Alcoa Corporation and ParentCo entered into certain intellectual property license\nagreements that provide for a license of certain patents, trademarks, and know-how from ParentCo or Alcoa Corporation, as\napplicable, to the other, on a perpetual, royalty-free, and non-exclusive basis, subject to certain exceptions.\nGovernment Regulations and Environmental Matters\nAlcoa’s global operations subject it to compliance with various types of government laws, regulations, permits, and other requirements\nwhich often provide discretion to government authorities and could be interpreted, applied, or modified in ways to make the\nCompany’s operations or compliance activities more costly. These laws and regulations include those relating to safety and health,\nenvironmental protection and compliance, tailings management, data privacy and security, anti-corruption, human rights, competition,\nand trade, such as tariffs or other import or export restrictions that may increase the cost of raw material or cross-border shipments and\nimpact our ability to do business with certain countries or individuals. Though we cannot predict the collective potential adverse\nimpact of the expanding body of laws, regulations, and interpretations, we believe that we are in compliance with such laws and\nregulations in all material respects and do not expect that continued compliance with such regulations will have a material effect upon\ncapital expenditures, earnings, or our competitive position.

You should not interpret the disclosure\nof any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key\nrisk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to Alcoa or that Alcoa\ncurrently deems immaterial that also may materially adversely affect us in future periods. See Part II Item 7 of this Form 10-K in\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under caption Forward-Looking Statements."

      "text": "15\nIndustry and Global Market Risks\nThe aluminum industry and aluminum end-use markets are highly cyclical and are influenced by several factors, including global\neconomic conditions, the Chinese market, and overall consumer confidence.\nThe nature of the industries in which our customers operate causes demand for our products to be cyclical, creating potential\nuncertainty regarding future profitability. The demand for aluminum is sensitive to, and impacted by, demand for the finished goods\nmanufactured by our customers in industries, such as the commercial construction, transportation, and automotive industries, which\nmay change as a result of changes in the global economy, foreign currency exchange rates, energy prices, or other factors beyond our\ncontrol. The demand for aluminum is also highly correlated to economic growth, and we could be adversely affected by large or\nsudden shifts in the global inventory of aluminum and the resulting market price impacts.\nWe believe the long-term prospects for aluminum and aluminum products are positive; however, we are unable to predict the future\ncourse of industry variables or the strength of the global economy and the effects of government intervention. Our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations may be materially affected by the conditions in the global economy generally, including\ninflationary and recessionary conditions, and in global capital markets, including in the end markets and geographic regions in which\nwe and our customers operate. Many of the markets in which our customers participate are also cyclical in nature and experience\nsignificant fluctuations in demand for their products based on economic conditions, consumer demand, raw material and energy costs,\nand government actions. Many of these factors are beyond our control.\nThe Chinese market is a significant source of global demand for, and supply of, commodities, including aluminum. Chinese\nproduction rates of aluminum, both from new construction and installed smelting capacity, can fluctuate based on Chinese government\npolicy, such as the level of enforcement of capacity limits and/or licenses and environmental policies. In addition, industry\novercapacity, a sustained slowdown in Chinese aluminum demand, or a significant slowdown in other markets, that is not offset by\ndecreases in supply of aluminum or increased aluminum demand in emerging economies, such as India, Brazil, and several Southeast\nAsian countries, could have an adverse effect on the global supply and demand for aluminum and aluminum prices. Also, changes in\nthe aluminum market can cause changes in the alumina and bauxite markets, which could also materially affect our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations. As a result of these factors, our profitability is subject to significant fluctuation.\nA decline in consumer and business confidence and spending, severe reductions in the availability and cost of credit, and volatility in\nthe capital and credit markets could adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability\nof our business. We are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers. If the availability of\ncredit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers’ business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit\nis increased, the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access credit or absorb the increased cost of that\ncredit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer\naccounts. These conditions and a disruption of the credit markets could also result in financial instability of some of our suppliers and\ncustomers. The consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the\nreduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase, and bankruptcy\nof customers, suppliers, or other creditors. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nMarket-driven balancing of global aluminum supply and demand may be disrupted by non-market forces.\nIn response to market-driven factors relating to the global supply and demand of aluminum and alumina, including energy prices and\nenvironmental policies, other industry producers have independently undertaken to reduce or increase production. Changes in\nproduction may be delayed or impaired by the ability to secure, or the terms of long-term contracts, to buy energy or raw materials.\nThe impact of non-market forces on global aluminum industry capacity, such as political instability or pressures or governmental\npolicies in certain countries relating to employment, the environment, or maintaining or further developing industry self-sufficiency,\nmay affect overall supply and demand in the aluminum industry. For example, the ongoing active conflict between Russia and\nUkraine could adversely impact macroeconomic conditions and result in heightened economic sanctions from the U.S. and the\ninternational community in a manner that adversely affects our industry. The disruption of the market-driven balancing of the global\nsupply and demand of aluminum, a resulting weak pricing environment and margin compression may adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations."

      "text": "16\nWe could be materially adversely affected by volatility and declines in aluminum and alumina, including global, regional, and\nproduct-specific prices, or by significant changes in production costs which are linked to LME or other commodities.\nThe overall price of primary aluminum consists of several components: (i) the underlying base metal component, which is typically\nbased on quoted prices from the LME; (ii) the regional premium, which comprises the incremental price over the base LME\ncomponent that is associated with the physical delivery of metal to a particular region (e.g., the Midwest premium for metal sold in the\nUnited States); and (iii) the product premium, which represents the incremental price for receiving physical metal in a particular shape\n(e.g., foundry, billet, slab, rod, etc.) and/or alloy. Each of the above three components has its own drivers of variability.\nThe LME price volatility is typically driven by macroeconomic factors (including political instability), global supply and demand of\naluminum (including expectations for growth, contraction, and the level of global inventories), and trading activity of financial\ninvestors. LME cash prices reached the highest level in over a decade in March 2022 at $3,985 per metric ton, with the low point of\nthe year in September 2022 at $2,080 per metric ton.\nWhile global inventories declined in 2022, high LME inventories could lead to a reduction in the price of aluminum and declines in\nthe LME price have had a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regional premiums tend to\nvary based on the supply of and demand for metal in a particular region, associated transportation costs, and import tariffs. Product\npremiums generally are a function of supply and demand for a given primary aluminum shape and alloy combination in a particular\nregion. Periods of industry overcapacity may also result in a weak aluminum pricing environment.\nA sustained weak LME aluminum pricing environment, deterioration in LME aluminum prices, or a decrease in regional premiums or\nproduct premiums could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Similarly, our\noperating results are affected by significant changes in key costs of production that are commodity or LME-linked.\nMost of our alumina contracts contain two pricing components: (1) the API price basis and (2) a negotiated adjustment basis that takes\ninto account various factors, including freight, quality, customer location, and market conditions. Because the API component can\nexhibit significant volatility due to market exposure, revenues associated with our alumina operations are exposed to market pricing.\nOur participation in increasingly competitive and complex global markets exposes us to risks, including legal and regulatory risks\nand changes in conditions beyond our control, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations.\nWe have operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the United States, including Australia, Brazil, Canada,\nEurope, Guinea, and the Saudi Arabia. The risks associated with the Company’s global operations include:\n•\nGeopolitical risks, such as political instability, coups d’états, civil unrest, strikes and work stoppages, expropriation,\nnationalization of properties by a government, imposition of sanctions, changes to import or export regulations and fees,\nrenegotiation, revocation or nullification of existing agreements, leases, licenses, and permits, and changes to mining royalty\nrules or laws;\n•\nEconomic and commercial instability risks, including those caused by sovereign and private debt default, corruption, and\nchanges in local government laws, regulations, and policies, such as those related to tariffs and trade barriers, trade tensions,\ntaxation, exchange controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings;\n•\nWeakening macroeconomic conditions;\n•\nContracting manufacturing activity, especially in the global automotive sector;\n•\nWar or terrorist activities;\n•\nMajor public health issues, such as an outbreak of a pandemic or epidemic, which could cause disruptions in our operations,\nsupply chain, or workforce;\n•\nInformation systems failures or disruptions, including due to cyber attacks;\n•\nDifficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights, or limitations in the protection of technology, data, and\nintellectual property, in certain jurisdictions; and,\n•\nUnexpected events, accidents, or environmental incidents, including natural disasters.\nWe have experienced some of these events, and while the impact of any of the foregoing factors is difficult to predict, any one or more\nof them could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Existing insurance arrangements may not\nprovide sufficient coverage or reimbursement for significant costs that may arise from such events.\nUnexpected or uncontrollable events or circumstances in any of the foreign markets in which we operate, including actions by foreign\ngovernments such as changes in foreign policy or fiscal regimes, termination of our leases or agreements with such foreign\ngovernments, increased government regulation, or forced curtailment or continuation of operations, could materially and adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, or results of operations."

      "text": "17\nWe may be unable to obtain, maintain, or renew permits or approvals necessary for our mining operations, which could materially\nadversely affect our operations and profitability.\nOur mining operations are subject to extensive permitting and approval requirements. These include permits and approvals issued by\nvarious government agencies and regulatory bodies at the federal, state, and local levels of governments in the countries in which we\noperate. The permitting and approval rules are complex, are often subject to interpretations by regulators, which may change over\ntime, and may be impacted by heightened levels of regulatory oversight and stakeholder focus on addressing environmental and social\nimpacts of mining activities. Changing expectations and increased information required by regulators could make our ability to\ncomply with the applicable requirements more difficult, inhibit or delay our ability to timely obtain the necessary approvals, if at all,\nresult in approvals being conditioned in a manner that may restrict the Company’s ability to efficiently and economically conduct its\nmining activities, require us to adjust our mining plans, or preclude the continuation of certain ongoing operations and mining\nactivities or the development of future mining operations. Failure to obtain, maintain, or renew permits or approvals, or permitting or\napproval delays, restrictions, or conditions may impact the quality of the bauxite we are able to mine and could increase our costs and\naffect our ability to efficiently and economically conduct our operations, potentially having a materially adverse impact on our results\nof operations and profitability.\nIn addition, the permitting processes, restrictions, and requirements imposed by conditional permits or approvals, and associated costs\nand liabilities, may be extensive and may delay or prevent commencing or continuing exploration or production operations, which\ncould adversely affect the Company’s mining operations and production, and consequently our refining and smelting operations, and\ncould require us to curtail, close, or otherwise modify our production, operations, and sites. Additionally, the Company’s mining\npermits may be rescinded or modified, or our mining plans may be adjusted, to mitigate against adverse impacts to sites within or near\nour mining areas that have environmental, biodiversity, or cultural significance, potentially having a materially adverse impact on our\nresults of operations and profitability. Due to mining plan approval delays in Western Australia, the Company is currently mining and\nprocessing lower grade bauxite, which has caused increased production costs.\nOur operations and profitability have been and could continue to be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in the cost, quality,\nor availability of raw materials or other key inputs, or by disruptions in the supply chain.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations have been and could continue to be negatively affected by unfavorable\nchanges in the cost, quality, or availability of energy, raw materials, including carbon products, caustic soda, and other key inputs,\nsuch as bauxite, as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials and key inputs to refining and smelting\nlocations. We may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through price increases, productivity\nimprovements, cost reduction programs, or reductions or curtailments to production at our operations. A decrease in the quality of raw\nmaterials or key inputs has in the past and could continue to cause increased production costs, which also has in the past and could\ncontinue to result in lower production volumes. For example, the Company is currently mining and processing lower grade bauxite in\nWestern Australia, which has caused increased production costs. Changes in the costs of bauxite, alumina, energy and other inputs\nduring a particular period may not be adequate to offset concurrent sharper decreases in the price of alumina or aluminum and could\nhave a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn addition, due to global supply chain disruptions, we may not be able to obtain sufficient supply of our raw materials, energy, or\nother key inputs in a timely manner, including due to shortages, inflationary cost pressures, or transportation delays, which could\ncause disruption in our operations or production curtailments. Though we have been able to source our raw materials and other key\ninputs in adequate amounts from other suppliers or our own stockpiles to date, there can be no guarantee that our operations or\nprofitability will not be adversely affected in the future. Our suppliers, vendors, and customers could experience similar constraints\nthat could impact our operations and profitability.\nOur operations consume substantial amounts of energy and could be disrupted, and our profitability could decline, if energy costs\nrise or if energy supplies are interrupted or become uncertain.\nOur refineries and smelters consume substantial amounts of natural gas and electricity in the production of alumina and aluminum.\nThe prices for and availability of energy are subject to volatile market conditions that can be affected by factors beyond our control\nsuch as weather, political, regulatory, and economic conditions. For example, significantly higher market power prices in Europe in\n2022 have caused competitors’ smelters to announce production cuts, as well as the production cuts announced by Alcoa in 2022 due\nto rising energy costs (see Part 1 Item 1 of this Form 10-K).\nThough we have ownership in certain hydroelectricity assets, we rely on third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in\nthe manufacture of our products. Energy supply contracts for our operations vary in length and market exposure, and we could be, and\nhave been, negatively impacted by:\n•\nSignificant increases in LME prices, or spot electricity, fuel oil and/or natural gas prices;\n•\nUnavailability of or interruptions or uncertainty in energy supply or unplanned outages due to political instability, droughts,\nhurricanes, wildfires, other natural disasters, equipment failure, or other causes;\n•\nUnavailability of long-term energy from renewable sources in particular locations or at competitive rates;"

These events\ncould disrupt our operations or result in production curtailments that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nBusiness Strategy Risks\nWe have incurred, and may incur in the future, significant costs associated with our strategy to be a lower cost, competitive, and\nintegrated aluminum production business and we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits from announced plans,\nprograms, initiatives relating to our portfolio, capital investments, and developing technologies.\nWe are executing a strategy to be a low cost, competitive, and integrated aluminum production business by implementing productivity\nand cost-reduction initiatives, optimizing our portfolio of assets, and investing in technology to advance sustainably. We have been\ntaking decisive actions to lower the cost base of our operations through procurement strategies for raw materials, labor productivity,\nimproving operating performance, deploying Company-wide business process models, and reducing overhead costs. In 2019, the\nCompany announced a five year strategic portfolio review of smelting and refining capacity. Through 2021, Alcoa reached\napproximately 75 and 58 percent of its target to improve cost positioning, including curtailment, closure or divestiture of 1.5 and 4\nmillion metric tons of smelting and refining capacity, respectively. While no actions were taken in 2022 related to these targets, the\nCompany took actions in response to market conditions, and the strategic portfolio review is continuing. Though we have made\nprogress on this strategy, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits or cost savings from this strategy.\nWe have made and may continue to plan and execute other actions to grow or streamline our portfolio. There is no assurance that\nanticipated benefits of our strategic actions will be realized. With respect to portfolio optimization actions such as divestitures,\ncurtailments, closures, and restarts, we may face barriers to exit from unprofitable businesses or operations, including high exit costs\nor objections from various stakeholders, the lack of availability of buyers willing to purchase such assets at prices acceptable to us,\ndelays due to any regulatory approvals or government intervention, continuing environmental obligations, and third parties unwilling\nto release us from guarantees or other credit support provided in connection with the sale of assets. In addition, we may retain\nliabilities from such transactions, have ongoing indemnification obligations, and incur unforeseen liabilities for divested entities if a\nbuyer fails to honor all commitments.\nOur business operations are capital intensive, and portfolio optimization actions such as the curtailment or closure of operations or\nfacilities may include significant costs and charges, including asset impairment charges and other measures. There can be no assurance\nthat such actions will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned at the anticipated cost or will result in being beneficial to\nthe Company. The effect of closures, curtailments, and divestitures over time will reduce the Company’s cash flow and earnings\ncapacity and result in a less diversified portfolio of businesses, and we will have a greater dependency on remaining businesses for our\nfinancial results. Additionally, curtailing certain existing facilities, whether temporarily or permanently, may require us to incur\ncurtailment and carrying costs related to those facilities, as well as further increased costs should production be resumed at any\ncurtailed facility, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results, and results of operations.\nOur announced multi-year portfolio review of Company assets includes evaluating our portfolio to assess each facility’s strategic\nbenefits, competitiveness, and viability. Following this review, we expect to be a low cost, first quartile producer across our product\nsegments of bauxite, alumina, and aluminum, and have up to 85% of smelting production from renewable energy sources, which\naligns with our long-term goal of having the lowest carbon-producing refineries and smelters in the industry. Our announced roadmap\nof technologies under development to support our long-term goal of having the lowest carbon-producing alumina refineries and\naluminum smelters includes investments to develop, implement, and commercialize new technologies to reduce carbon emissions in\nthe aluminum production process. We may not be able to implement, fully or in a cost-effective or timely way, the actions necessary\nto achieve this strategy and goal, which actions could include capturing, maintaining and/or expanding margins from new products,\ncontinued product innovation investment in research and development projects and new technologies, successful deployment and\ncommercialization of effective new technologies, and cost-effective long-term energy solutions. We may not achieve the expected\nresults from technology innovation or other benefits, including certain emissions or environmental-related goals, or expected\nprofitability associated with this strategy. In addition, even if we are able to cost effectively develop our technologies, alternatives to\ntechnologies may be more acceptable to the market. Executing these actions also diverts senior management time and resources from\nour regular business operations, each of which could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of\noperations."

We may experience\noperational challenges in integrating or segregating assets for such a venture or transaction, and such a venture or transaction\ncould increase the number of our outstanding shares or amount of outstanding debt and affect our financial position.\nWe participate in joint ventures, have formed strategic alliances, and may enter into other similar arrangements in the future. For\nexample, AWAC is an unincorporated global joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina Limited. AWAC consists of a number of\naffiliated entities, which own, operate, or have an interest in, bauxite mines and alumina refineries, as well as an aluminum smelter, in\nseven countries. In addition, Alcoa is minority owner of a joint venture with the Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Ma’aden). Although\nthe Company has, in connection with these and our other existing joint ventures and strategic alliances, sought to protect our interests,\njoint ventures, and strategic alliances inherently involve special risks. Whether or not the Company holds majority interests or\nmaintains operational control in such arrangements, our joint venture and other business partners may take certain actions and\npositions, or experience difficulties, that may negatively impact the Company and/or its reputation, such as:\n•\nAdvancing economic, political, social, or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with, or opposed to those of, the\nCompany and our stakeholders;\n•\nExercising veto rights to block actions that we believe to be in our or the joint venture’s or strategic alliance’s best interests;\n•\nTaking action contrary to our policies or objectives with respect to our investments; and,\n•\nAs a result of financial or other difficulties, be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture, strategic\nalliance, or other agreements, such as contributing capital to expansion or maintenance projects.\nWe continuously evaluate and may in the future enter into additional strategic business transactions. Any such transactions could\nhappen at any time, could be material to our business, and could take any number of forms, including, for example, an acquisition,\nmerger, sale or distribution of certain assets, refinancing, or other recapitalization or material strategic transaction. There can be no\nassurance that our joint ventures, strategic alliances, or additional strategic business transactions will be beneficial to us, whether due\nto the above-described risks, unfavorable global economic conditions, increases in costs, foreign currency fluctuations, political risks,\ngovernment interventions, retained liabilities, indemnification obligations, or other factors. Evaluating potential transactions and\nintegrating completed ones may divert the attention of our management from ordinary operating matters. In addition, to the extent we\nconsummate an agreement for the sale and disposition of an asset or asset group we may experience operational difficulties\nsegregating them from our retained assets and operations, which could impact the execution or timing of such dispositions and could\nresult in disruptions to our operations and/or claims for damages, among other things.\nIf we engage in a strategic transaction, we may require additional financing that could result in an increase in the number of our\noutstanding shares of stock or the aggregate amount and/or cost of our debt, which may result in an adverse impact to our credit\nratings or adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The number of shares of our stock or the\naggregate principal amount of our debt that we may issue in connection with such a transaction could be significant.\nGlobal Operational Risks\nOur global operations expose us to risks related to economic, political, and social conditions, including the impact of trade policies\nand adverse industry publicity, which may negatively impact our business and our ability to operate in certain locations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including foreign or domestic government fiscal and political\ncrises, political and economic disputes and sanctions, social requirements and conditions, and adverse industry publicity. These\nfactors, among others, bring uncertainty to the markets in which we compete, and may adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, we operate in communities around the world, and social issues in the communities where we operate could affect our\nability to maintain our operations; furthermore, incidents related to our industry could generate negative publicity and impact the\nsocial acceptability of our operations in such locations, including by damaging our reputation, our relationships with stakeholders, and\nour competitive position. Growing expectations of hosting communities as well as increasing social activism pose additional\nchallenges to us maintaining our social license to operate and expand our business. For example, community and stakeholder concerns\nin Juruti, Brazil have affected our ability to access certain mining areas at times. In certain jurisdictions, there are increasing\nregulatory developments to protect minority groups, such as Indigenous People in Australia. This could have an adverse effect on our\nability to secure expansions to our operations at all or in the expected timeframe, could significantly increase our cost of doing\nbusiness, and could disrupt our operations."

      "text": "20\nIn the United States, in recent years, the U.S. government has taken actions with respect to the implementation of significant changes\nto certain trade policies, including import tariffs and quotas, modifications to international trade policy, the withdrawal from or\nrenegotiation of certain trade agreements, and other changes that have affected U.S. trade relations with other countries, any of which\nmay require us to significantly modify our current business practices or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our business or\nthose of our customers. The U.S. government continues to review trade policies and negotiate new agreements with countries globally\nthat could impact the Company. For example, the U.S. government is negotiating agreements with countries in relation to the tariffs\ninitially applied under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (Section 232) in 2018. In 2021, the U.S. and European Union\n(EU) reached agreement whereby the U.S. lifted the Section 232 duties and applied a tariff-rate-quota allowing duty-free importation\nof aluminum from the EU based on historical volumes, and the EU suspended its retaliatory tariffs that had been in place on certain\nU.S. products. To the extent that further agreements are reached on a broader range of imports, or these tariffs and other trade actions\nresult in a decrease in international demand for aluminum produced in the United States or otherwise negatively impact demand for\nour products, our business may be adversely impacted, and could further exacerbate aluminum and alumina price volatility and overall\nmarket uncertainty.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, as well as inflation and other economic\nfactors in the countries in which we operate.\nEconomic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, competitive factors in the\ncountries in which we operate, and volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment, could affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in the valuation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies,\nparticularly the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Canadian dollar, euro, and Norwegian kroner, which are the currencies of certain\ncountries in which we have operations, may affect our profitability, as some important inputs are purchased in other currencies, while\nour products are generally sold in U.S. dollars. As the U.S. dollar strengthens, the cost curve shifts down for smelters outside the\nUnited States, but costs for our U.S. smelting portfolio may not decline.\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our future profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Changes in foreign and domestic tax\nlaws, regulations, or policies, or their interpretation and application by regulatory bodies, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could\naffect our future profitability. For example, in October 2021, a new framework for international tax was agreed to by 137 member\ncountries and jurisdictions of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), with rules targeted to be\nfinalized in 2023 and implemented by participating jurisdictions as early as 2024. The impact to the Company of such an agreement is\nuncertain until applicable rules are promulgated and implemented by the participating jurisdictions. In December 2022, the European\nUnion Council formally adopted the Global Minimum Tax portion of this framework, requiring member states to implement certain\ntax rules for tax years beginning in 2024. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of profits\namong these different jurisdictions. Our tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and\nreflects various estimates and assumptions. The assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the Company that could impact\nthe valuation of our deferred tax assets. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate\nas a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the\nCompany, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, and changes in the valuation of\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities. Significant changes to tax laws or regulations and the positions of taxing authorities could have a\nsubstantial impact, positive or negative, on our effective tax rate, cash tax expenditures and cash flows, and deferred tax assets and\nliabilities.\nWe are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many jurisdictions, such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, and Spain. For\nexample, in July 2020, AofA received Notices of Assessment (the Notices) from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) related to the\npricing of certain historic third-party alumina sales. The Notices asserted claims for income tax payable by AofA of approximately\n$143 (A$214), exclusive of interest and penalties. The Notices also include claims for compounded interest on the tax amount totaling\napproximately $474 (A$707). In accordance with the ATO’s dispute resolution practices, AofA paid 50% of the assessed income tax\namount exclusive of interest and any penalties to the ATO during the third quarter of 2020, and the ATO is not expected to seek\nfurther payment prior to final resolution of the matter. If AofA is ultimately successful, any amounts paid to the ATO as part of the\n50% payment would be refunded. The ATO has also issued a position paper with its preliminary view on the imposition of\nadministrative penalties related to the tax assessment, proposing penalties of approximately $86 (A$128). AofA disagrees with the\nATO’s proposed position on penalties and submitted a response to the position paper in the fourth quarter of 2020. After the ATO\ncompletes its review of AofA’s response, the ATO could issue a penalty assessment. The Company does not agree with the ATO’s\npositions, and AofA will continue to defend this matter in the Australian Courts. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of\nexaminations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. The results of tax audits and\nexaminations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of our tax exposures could materially\naffect our financial results. See Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Notes Q and S to the Consolidated Financial Statements under\ncaptions Unrecognized Tax Benefits and Contingencies, respectively."

This legislation did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31,\n2022.\nWe face significant competition globally within and beyond the aluminum industry, which may have an adverse effect on\nprofitability.\nWe compete with a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. aluminum industry competitors as well as with producers of other materials,\nsuch as steel, titanium, plastics, composites, ceramics, and glass, among others. Use of such materials could reduce the demand for\naluminum products, which may reduce our profitability and cash flow. Factors affecting our ability to compete include increased\ncompetition from overseas producers, our competitors’ pricing strategies, the introduction or advancement of new technologies and\nequipment by our competitors or our customers, changes in our customers’ strategy or material requirements, and our ability to\nmaintain the cost-efficiency of our facilities. Certain competitors possess financial, technical and management resources to develop\nand market products that may compete favorably against our products, and consolidation among our competitors may also allow them\nto compete more effectively. In addition, our competitive position depends, in part, on our ability to operate as an integrated aluminum\nvalue chain, leverage innovation expertise across businesses and key end markets, and access an economical power supply to sustain\nour operations in various countries. See Business—Competition.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance coverage.\nWe maintain various forms of insurance, including insurance covering claims related to our properties and risks associated with our\noperations. Our existing property and liability insurance coverages contain exclusions and limitations on coverage. In connection with\nrenewals of insurance, we have experienced, or could experience in the future, additional exclusions and limitations on coverage,\nsignificantly increased self-insured retentions and deductibles, and significantly higher premiums. We may not be able to procure\nadequate insurance coverage for certain risks, if at all, and existing insurance arrangements may not provide sufficient coverage or\nreimbursement for significant costs that may arise. As a result, in the future our insurance coverage may not cover claims to the extent\nthat it has in the past and the costs that we incur to procure insurance may increase significantly, either of which could have an adverse\neffect on our results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy\ncaused by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\nThe global economy has been negatively impacted by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Such adverse and uncertain economic\nconditions have exacerbated supply chain disruptions and increased our costs for energy, particularly in Spain, and for certain raw\nmaterials. During the first quarter of 2022, in response to the conflict, we ceased purchasing raw materials from and selling our\nproducts to Russian businesses. To date, these actions have not had a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial\ncondition and results of operations, but they could have material negative impacts if the conflict continues and global sales of our\nproducts are impacted. Furthermore, governments in the U.S., United Kingdom and European Union have each imposed export\ncontrols on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. Although we have\nno operations in Russia or Ukraine and our sales into these regions were historically minimal and have recently been discontinued, we\nwill continue to monitor the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the potential impact of financial and economic sanctions on the\nregional and global economy.\nIncreased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, or retaliatory measures taken by Russia, or other countries in response, as well\nas the destabilizing effects of the conflict, could also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations by\nlimiting sales, restricting access to required raw materials, or raising costs thereof. Destabilizing effects that the ongoing conflict may\npose for the global oil and natural gas markets could also adversely impact our operations by further increasing our energy costs. In\naddition, further escalation of geopolitical tensions related to the conflict could result in loss of property, cyberattacks, additional\nsupply disruptions, an inability to obtain key supplies and materials, reduced production and sales, and/or operational curtailments,\nand adversely affect our business and our supply chain."

We may\nbecome subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with business operations, compliance measures, or provision of health or\nwelfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws, regulations, or policies. We are also subject to a variety of legal and compliance\nrisks, including, among other things, potential claims relating to health and safety, environmental matters, intellectual property rights,\nproduct liability, data privacy, taxes and compliance with U.S. and foreign export, anti-bribery, and competition laws, and sales and\ntrading practices. We could be subject to fines, penalties, interest, or damages (in certain cases, treble damages). In addition, if we\nviolate the terms of our agreements with governmental authorities, we may face additional monetary sanctions and other remedies as a\ncourt deems appropriate.\nWhile we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks, the\nglobal and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks continue to exist, and additional legal proceedings and contingencies\nmay arise from time to time. In addition, various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of\nliabilities or make estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling,\njudgment, or settlement, or significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling or settlement or\nunfavorable changes in laws, regulations or policies, or other contingencies that the Company cannot predict with certainty could have\na material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. See Part I Item 3 of this Form 10-K and Part\nII Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements under caption Contingencies.\nClimate change, climate change legislation or regulations, and efforts to reduce greenhouse gases and build operational resilience\nto extreme weather conditions may adversely impact our operations and markets.\nEnergy is a significant input in a number of our operations and there is growing recognition that consumption of energy derived from\nfossil fuels is a contributor to climate change. Several governments or regulatory bodies in areas where we operate, such as in Canada\nand the EU, have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate\nchange, which could result in changes to the margins of greenhouse gas (GHG) intensive assets and energy-intensive assets. These\nregulatory mechanisms relating to carbon may be either voluntary or legislated and the inconsistency of associated regulations may\nimpact our operations directly or indirectly through customers or our supply chain. Assessments of the potential impact of future\nclimate change legislation, regulation, and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory\nchange in countries in which we operate and the diversity in the scope and development of such regulations. For example, in 2021, the\nEuropean Commission proposed a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) as a levy on carbon-intensive imports, which was\nprovisionally approved in December 2022 and would include aluminum in the first phase of implementation beginning in 2023. We\nmay realize increased capital expenditures, costs, or taxes resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or\nregulations, including costs to purchase or profits from sales of allowances or credits under a carbon credit/pricing or “cap and trade”\nsystem, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage, a change in\ncompetitive position relative to industry peers, and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods\nproduced by the Company and, indirectly, from changes in costs of goods sold.\nThough we are investing in technology to reduce the production of greenhouse gases in the manufacture of our products, such as our\nELYSIS joint venture aluminum smelting technology and other technologies that limit the production of carbon in alumina refining, in\ncertain aspects of our operations, our ability to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions is also dependent on the actions of third parties,\nespecially energy providers, and our ability to make significant changes in our greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, we could face\nadditional costs associated with any new regulation of GHG emissions, and our ability to modify our operations to avoid these costs\nmay be limited in the near term.\nIn addition, regulations to combat climate change could impact the competitiveness of the Company, including the attractiveness of\nthe locations of some of the Company’s assets. The global focus on climate is raising awareness in all countries, such as the agreement\nat the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) by many governments of countries where the Company\noperates to combat deforestation, which could adversely affect our ability to mine and operate in sensitive areas like the Jarrah Forest\nand the Amazon."

These may include changes in rainfall patterns, wildfires, heat waves, shortages of\nwater or other natural resources, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns, flooding, increased frequency and intensities of storms,\nand changing temperature levels. Any of these may disrupt our operations, hinder transportation of products to us or of our products to\ncustomers, prevent access to our facilities, negatively impact our suppliers’ or customers’ operations and their ability to fulfill\ncontractual obligations to us, and/or cause damage to our facilities, all of which may increase our costs, reduce production, and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we establish strategies and expectations related to climate change and other environmental matters. Our ability to\nachieve any such strategies or expectations is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside of our control.\nExamples of such factors include, but are not limited to, evolving legal, regulatory, and other standards, processes, and assumptions,\nthe pace of scientific and technological developments, increased costs, the availability of requisite financing, and changes in carbon\nmarkets. Failures or delays (whether actual or perceived) in achieving our strategies or expectations related to climate change and\nother environmental matters could adversely affect our business, operations, and reputation, and increase the risk of litigation.\nWe are subject to a broad range of health, safety and environmental laws, regulations, and other requirements in the jurisdictions\nin which we operate that may expose us to substantial claims, costs, and liabilities.\nOur operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws,\nregulations, policies, and permitting, licensing, and other requirements, including those related to health, safety, environmental, and\nwaste management and disposal matters, which may expose us to substantial claims, costs, and liabilities. We may be subject to fines,\npenalties, and other damages, such as natural resource or community damages and the costs associated with the investigation and\ncleanup of soil, surface water, groundwater, and other media under laws such as CERCLA (commonly known as Superfund) or similar\nU.S. and foreign regulations. These laws, regulations, policies, and permitting, licensing, and other requirements could change or\ncould be, and have been, applied or interpreted in ways that could (i) require us to enjoin, curtail, close or otherwise modify our\noperations and sites, including the implementation of corrective measures, the installation of additional equipment or structures, or the\nundertaking of other remedial actions, or (ii) subject us to enforcement risk or impose on or require us to incur additional capital\nexpenditures, compliance or other costs, fines, penalties, or damages, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations,\ncash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our common stock.\nThe costs of complying with such laws, regulations, policies, and other requirements, including participation in assessments,\nremediation activities, and cleanups of sites, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be so for the\nforeseeable future. Environmental laws may impose cleanup liability on owners and occupiers of contaminated property, including\npreviously owned, non-operational, or divested properties, regardless of whether the owners and occupiers caused the contamination\nor whether the activity that caused the contamination was lawful at the time it was conducted. As a result, we may be subject to claims\narising from current or former conditions at sites that we own or operate currently, as well as at sites that we owned or operated in the\npast, and at contaminated sites that have always been owned or operated by third parties, regardless of whether we caused the\ncontamination or whether the activity that caused the contamination was lawful at the time it was conducted. Liability may be without\nregard to fault and may be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other\ndamages, or even for the entire share.\nIn addition, because environmental laws, regulations, policies, and other requirements are constantly evolving, we will continue to\nincur costs to maintain compliance and such costs could increase materially and prove to be more limiting and costly than we\nanticipate. Evolving standards and expectations can result in increased litigation and/or increased costs, all of which can have a\nmaterial and adverse effect on our business operations, earnings, and cash flows. Future compliance with environmental, health and\nsafety legislation and other regulatory requirements or expectations may prove to be more limiting and costly than we anticipate and\nmay disrupt our business operations and require significant expenditures. Our business, financial condition, or results of operations in\na particular period could be materially affected by certain health, safety, or environmental matters, including remediation costs and\ndamages related to certain sites.\nOur operations include impoundment structures, which could impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances\nor other damage, which could result in material liabilities to us.\nSome of our operations generate hazardous waste and other byproducts, which we contain in tailing facilities, residue storage areas,\nand other structural impoundments that are subject to extensive regulation and increasingly strict industry standards. Overtopping of\nstorage areas caused by extreme weather events, erosion, or unanticipated structural failure of impoundments could result in severe,\nand in some cases catastrophic, damage to the environment, natural resources, or property, or personal injury and loss of life. These\nand other similar impacts that our operations may have on the environment, as well as exposures to hazardous substances or wastes\nassociated with our operations, could result in significant costs, civil or criminal damages, fines or penalties, and enforcement actions\nissued by regulatory or judicial authorities enjoining, curtailing, or closing operations or requiring corrective measures, any of which\ncould materially and adversely affect us."

Our global\noperations require increased reliance on technology, which expose us to risks of theft of proprietary information, including trade\nsecrets and other intellectual property that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. The protection of such information, as well as sensitive customer information, personal data of our employees, and other\nconfidential information, is critical to us. We face global cybersecurity threats, which may range from uncoordinated individual\nattempts to sophisticated and targeted measures, known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company. In addition, a greater\nnumber of our employees are working remotely since the COVID-19 pandemic, which has increased cybersecurity vulnerabilities and\nrisk to our information technologies systems.\nCyber attacks and other cyber incidents are becoming more frequent and sophisticated, are constantly evolving, and are being made by\ngroups and individuals with significant resources and a wide range of expertise and motives. Cyber attacks and security breaches may\ninclude, but are not limited to, unauthorized attempts to access information or digital infrastructure, efforts to direct payments to\nfictitious parties, viruses, ransomware, malicious codes, hacking, phishing (including through social engineering), denial of service,\nhuman error, and other electronic security breaches, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. As techniques used in cyber attacks change frequently and may not be immediately detectable, we\nmay be unable to anticipate or detect these techniques, such as use of a zero-day exploit or unknown malware, immediately identify\nthe scope and impact of an incident, contain the incident within our systems, or implement preventative or remediation measures. In\naddition, we utilize third-party vendors for certain software applications, storage systems, and cloud computing services. Cyber\nattacks, security breaches, or other incidents on the information technology systems of our service providers or business partners could\nmaterially impact us. We have in the past experienced attempts and incidents by external parties to penetrate our and our service\nproviders or business partners networks and systems. Such attempts and incidents to date have not resulted in any material breaches,\ndisruptions, or loss of information.\nWe continue to assess potential cyber threats and invest in our information technology infrastructure to address these threats, including\nby monitoring networks and systems, training employees on cyber threats, and enhancing security policies of the Company and its\nthird-party providers. While the Company continually works to strengthen our systems and security measures, safeguard information,\nand mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent or timely detect cyber attacks or\nsecurity breaches. Such intrusions could manipulate or improperly use our systems or networks, disclose, or compromise confidential\nor protected information, destroy, or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt our operations, any of which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, cybersecurity incidents could negatively impact our reputation and competitive position, and could result in litigation with\nthird parties, regulatory action, loss of business, theft of assets, and significant remediation costs, any of which could have a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Such security breaches could also result in a violation of applicable\nU.S. and international privacy and other laws, and subject us to litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of\nwhich could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. For example, the European Union’s General Data Privacy\nRegulation subjects companies to a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. In the event our\noperations are found to be in violation of the GDPR’s requirements, we may be subject to significant civil penalties, business\ndisruption and reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations. Cyber attacks or breaches could require significant management attention and resources and result in the diminution of the\nvalue of our investment in research and development, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nor results of operations.\nThough we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, if our information technology systems, or those of our third-\nparty providers, are damaged, breached, interrupted, or cease to function properly for any reason, and, if the disaster recovery and\nbusiness continuity plans do not effectively resolve the incident on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage\nor conduct business and we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action,\nwhich may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations."

Our ability to generate cash flows is affected by many factors, including market and pricing conditions. Insufficient cash\ngeneration or capital project overruns may negatively impact our ability to fund as planned our sustaining and return-seeking capital\nprojects, and such postponement in funding capital expenditures or inadequate funding to complete projects could result in operational\nissues. For 2023, we project capital expenditures of $600 million, of which $485 million is for sustaining capital and $115 million for\nreturn-seeking capital. If our technology research and development projects prove feasible with an acceptable expected rate of return,\nour capital expenditures for return-seeking projects would increase significantly over the next several years. To the extent our access\nto competitive financial, credit, capital, and/or banking markets becomes impaired, our operations, financial results, and cash flows\ncould be adversely impacted. We may also need to address commercial, political, and social issues in relation to capital expenditures\nin certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate. If our interest in our joint ventures is diluted or we lose key concessions, our\ngrowth could be constrained. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition, and prospects.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will continue to return capital to our stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and/or the\nrepurchase of our common stock. The reduction or discontinuation of the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders or the\nrepurchase of our shares of common stock could adversely affect the market price or liquidity of our shares.\nIn October 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program, at $0.10 per share and authorized a\n$500 share repurchase program, which was fully used with the completion of $150 in repurchases during the third quarter of 2022. In\nJuly 2022, the Board of Directors approved an additional common stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase\nshares of its outstanding common stock up to an aggregate transactional value of $500, depending on the Company’s continuing\nanalysis of market, financial, and other factors (the New Repurchase Program). This share repurchase authorization does not have a\npredetermined expiration date. The Company is under no obligation to pay any cash dividends to stockholders or to repurchase our\noutstanding shares of common stock at any particular price or at all, and the payment of dividends and/or repurchases of stock may be\nlimited, suspended, or discontinued at any time in our discretion and without notice. The Company set each of the current dividend\nand new share repurchase program authorizations at a level it believes is sustainable throughout the commodity cycle, based on our\ncurrent financial position and reasonable expectations of cash flow. In addition, as described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section,\nthe Company’s Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) could inhibit the Company’s ability to make certain restricted payments,\nincluding the amount of dividends and payments to redeem, repurchase, or retire equity securities or other indebtedness, if the\nCompany does not maintain certain financial ratios.\nThe Company intends to pay dividends on a quarterly basis. Dividends on Alcoa Corporation common stock are subject to\nauthorization by the Company’s Board of Directors. The payment, amount, and timing of dividends, if any, depends upon matters\ndeemed relevant by the Company’s Board of Directors, such as Alcoa Corporation’s financial position, results of operations, cash\nflows, capital requirements, business condition, future prospects, any limitations imposed by law, credit agreements or senior\nsecurities, and other factors deemed relevant and appropriate.\nDeclines in asset values or increases in liabilities, including liabilities associated with benefit plans or taxes, can reduce stockholders’\nequity. A deficit in stockholders’ equity could limit our ability under Delaware law to pay dividends and repurchase shares in the\nfuture.\nThe reduction, suspension, or elimination of our cash dividend or our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market\nprice of our stock and/or significantly increase its trading price volatility. The payment of any future dividends and the existence of a\nshare repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would otherwise be and could potentially reduce the market\nliquidity for our stock. Additionally, any future payment of dividends or repurchases of our common stock could negatively impact\nour financial position and our ability to fund ordinary and existing operations, capital expenditures, the payment of taxes, and growth\nor other opportunities."

      "text": "26\nDeterioration in our credit profile or increases in interest rates could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access\nto the capital markets and commercial credit.\nThe major credit rating agencies evaluate our creditworthiness and give us specified credit ratings. These ratings are based on a\nnumber of factors, including our financial strength and financial policies as well as our strategies, operations, and execution of\nannounced actions. These credit ratings are limited in scope and do not address all material risks related to an investment in us, but\nrather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time its rating is issued. Nonetheless, the credit ratings we receive impact our\nborrowing costs as well as our access to sources of capital on terms advantageous to our business. Failure to obtain or maintain\nsufficiently high credit ratings could adversely affect our interest rates in financings, our liquidity, or our competitive position, and\ncould also restrict our access to capital markets. In addition, our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating\nagency if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant. If a rating agency were to downgrade our rating, our borrowing costs could\nincrease, our funding sources could decrease, and we would need to rely on our cash flows from operations. As a result of these\nfactors, a downgrade of our credit ratings could have a materially adverse impact on our future operations, cash flows, and financial\nposition.\nOur indebtedness restricts our current and future operations, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our\nbusiness and manage our operations, and failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness,\nincluding due to events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAlcoa and Alcoa Nederland Holding B.V. (ANHBV), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alcoa, are party to a revolving credit agreement\nwith a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein (as subsequently amended, the Revolving Credit Facility). The terms of the\nRevolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain covenants that could impose significant\noperating and financial restrictions on us upon non-compliance with them, including on our ability to, among other things:\n•\nMake investments, loans, advances, and acquisitions;\n•\nAmend certain material documents;\n•\nDispose of assets;\n•\nIncur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain disqualified equity interests and preferred stock;\n•\nMake certain restricted payments, including limiting the amount of dividends on equity securities and payments to redeem,\nrepurchase or retire equity securities or other indebtedness;\n•\nEngage in transactions with affiliates;\n•\nMaterially alter the business we conduct;\n•\nEnter into certain restrictive agreements;\n•\nCreate liens on assets to secure lenders and issuers;\n•\nConsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of Alcoa’s, ANHBV’s or a subsidiary guarantor’s\nassets; and,\n•\nTake any actions that would reduce our ownership of AWAC entities below an agreed level.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility requires us to comply with financial covenants which includes maintaining an interest expense coverage\nratio of not less than 4.00 to 1.00, and a debt to capitalization ratio not to exceed .60 to 1.00 (replaced the maximum leverage ratio\nupon a ratings upgrade to investment grade by Moody’s Investor Service (Moody’s) on July 26, 2022). The results of the calculation\nof these ratios, when considering the Company’s existing debt obligations, affects and could restrict the amount of additional\nborrowing capacity under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility or other credit facilities, and ANHBV’s ability to make restricted\npayments, to make investments and to incur indebtedness.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility released the collateral package that had previously secured the Revolving Credit Facility, which will\ncontinue so long as certain credit ratings are maintained. If Alcoa Corporation or ANHBV, as applicable, fails to have a rating of at\nleast Ba1 from Moody’s and BB+ from S&P, then the Company would be required to execute all security documents to re-secure\ncollateral under the Revolving Credit Facility by, subject to certain exceptions, a first priority security interest in substantially all\nassets of Alcoa Corporation, ANHBV, the material domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries of Alcoa Corporation, and the material\nforeign wholly-owned subsidiaries of Alcoa Corporation located in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway,\nand Switzerland including equity interests of certain subsidiaries that directly hold equity interests in AWAC entities. Our ability to\ncomply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry\nconditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing,\nmerger and acquisition, or other opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the\nRevolving Credit Facility or the indentures governing our notes and other outstanding indebtedness, including such indebtedness for\nwhich the Company is a guarantor.\nSee Part II Item 7 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nunder caption Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities for more information on the restrictive covenants in the\nRevolving Credit Facility."

We cannot assure that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt\ninstruments if accelerated upon an event of default, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate as\na going concern. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance, or restructure our secured indebtedness, the holders of such\nindebtedness could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, any event of default or declaration of\nacceleration under one debt instrument also could result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments.\nLabor- and Pension-Related Risks\nUnion disputes and other employee relations issues, as well as labor market conditions, could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, or results of operations.\nA significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining\nagreements with varying durations and expiration dates. Union disputes and other employee relations issues could, and have,\nadversely affected our business, financial condition, or results of operations. For example, in 2022, a strike at the Mosjøen (Norway)\nsmelter commenced, after negotiations for a nationwide collective labor agreement between Industri Energi, a federation of\nNorwegian industries that includes Alcoa and Norsk Industri, which represents workers reached an impasse. The strike affected\nnumerous industrial plants representing the Norwegian electrochemical industry. The strike ended on August 24, 2022, with a solution\nreached on the labor dispute, and normal operations resumed at the Mosjøen smelter with no material impact on the Company.\nWe may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements when they expire. In addition, existing collective\nbargaining agreements may not prevent strikes, work stoppages, work slowdowns, union organizing campaigns, or lockouts at our\nfacilities in the future. We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective\nbargaining agreements. A labor dispute or work stoppage of employees could have a material adverse effect on production at one or\nmore of our facilities, and depending on the length of work stoppage, on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAdditionally, in the current competitive labor market, if we lose critical or a significant number of workers to attrition, it may be\ndifficult or costly to find and recruit replacement employees, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nA decline in the liability discount rate, lower-than-expected investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods.\nOur results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense we record for our pension and other postretirement\nbenefit plans, reductions in the fair value of plan assets, and other factors. We calculate income or expense for our plans using\nactuarial valuations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).\nThese valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions, which may change based on changes in\nkey economic indicators. The most significant year-end assumptions used by the Company to estimate pension or other postretirement\nbenefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected long-term rate of\nreturn on plan assets. In addition, the Company is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may\nresult in a significant charge to stockholders’ equity. See Part II Item 7 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations under caption Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Pension and Other\nPostretirement Benefits and Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Although GAAP\nexpense and pension funding contributions are impacted by different regulations and requirements, the key economic factors that\naffect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities we would contribute to the pension plans.\nPotential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve\nthe plans’ funded status. While the Company took several actions in 2022 to improve the funded status of its pension plans and adjust\nits asset allocation to reduce variance risk, declines in the discount rate or lower-than-expected investment returns on plan assets could\nhave a material negative effect on our cash flows. Adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan\nassets and increase our liabilities related to such plans, adversely affecting our liquidity and results of operations."

See Part I Item 1 of this Form 10-K for additional information,\nincluding the ownership, capacity, and utilization of these facilities, used in the Alumina and Aluminum segments. A discussion of our\nbauxite mining properties is below.\nThe following map shows the locations of our operations as of December 31, 2022:\nAlcoa Locations and Properties.\nAlthough Alcoa’s facilities vary in terms of age and condition, management believes that its facilities are suitable and generally\nadequate to support the current and projected operations of the business. See Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Notes B and K to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements for more information on properties, plants, and equipment.\nBauxite Mining Properties\nAlcoa has access to large bauxite deposit areas with mining rights that extend in many cases more than 15 years from the date of this\nForm 10-K. The Company obtains bauxite from its own resources and from those belonging to AWAC, located in the countries listed\nin the table below, as well as pursuant to both long-term and short-term contracts and mining leases. Tons of bauxite are reported on a\nzero-moisture basis in millions of dry metric tons (mdmt) unless otherwise stated.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company’s individually material mining properties, as determined in accordance with subpart 1300 of\nRegulation S-K, are our bauxite mining properties in the Darling Range of Western Australia (Darling Range) and Juruti, Brazil\n(Juruti)."

Under subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, mineral resources may not be classified as “mineral\nreserves” unless the determination has been made by a qualified person (as defined under subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K) that the\nmineral resources can be the basis of an economically viable project. Part or all of the mineral deposits (including any mineral\nresources) in these categories may never be converted into mineral reserves. Further, except for the portion of mineral resources\nclassified as mineral reserves, mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic value. Estimates of inferred mineral resources\nhave too high of a degree of uncertainty as to their existence and may not be converted to a mineral reserve. Therefore, it should not\nbe assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists, that it can be the basis of an economically viable project, or that\nit will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Likewise, it should not be assumed that all or any part of measured or indicated mineral\nresources will ever be converted to mineral reserves. Management relies on estimates of our recoverable mineral reserves, which\nestimation is complex due to geological characteristics of the properties and the number of assumptions made and variable factors,\nsome of which are beyond our control.\nThe following table shows the AWAC and/or Alcoa share (proportion) of annual production tonnage at each of our bauxite mining\nproperties and in the aggregate for each of the last three fiscal years.\nSummary of Attributable Annual Bauxite Production (mdmt) for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively:\nCountry\nProperty (Region)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nAustralia\nDarling Range (Western Australia, WA)\n31.4\n34.7\n34.8\nBrazil\nJuruti (Pará State)\n4.9\n5.8\n6.1\nBrazil\nTrombetas (Pará State) (1)\n0.5\n2.0\n2.1\nBrazil\nPoços de Caldas (Minas Gerais)\n0.4\n0.4\n0.2\nGuinea\nBoké (Sangaredi)\n3.6\n3.5\n3.6\nSaudi Arabia\nAl Ba’itha (Al Qassim)\n1.3\n1.2\n1.2\n42.1\n47.6\n48.0\n(1)\nRepresents production prior to the Company’s sale of its interest in the MRN property on April 30, 2022.

Both infrastructure\nareas include:\n•\nOre crushing and handling facilities;\n•\nOre stockpile stacker/reclaimer;\n•\nMaintenance facilities;\n•\nSampling stations;\n•\nSite offices including a production tracking room;\n•\nHaul road networks;\n•\nOverland conveyors, as illustrated on the above map;\n•\nWater supplies consisting of abstraction from licensed surface water sources supplemented with treated wastewater from\nvehicle washdowns, stormwater runoff, and maintenance workshops; and,\n•\nPower supply lines direct from certain of the Company’s refineries.\nPersonnel are sourced from the area around Perth, Western Australia, which benefits from a skilled workforce due to the relatively\nlarge number of operating mines in the region.\nHuntly is accessible from the South Western Highway via Del Park Road, which connects the town of North Dandalup in the north\nwith Dwellingup in the south. From Del Park Road, a 3 km road following the route of the bauxite conveyor to the Pinjarra refinery\nprovides access to the Huntly site administration offices. Willowdale is similarly accessible, 19 km from the South Western Highway\nvia Willowdale Road, a road to the south of Waroona. There are several airstrips in the region, although the closest major airport is in\nPerth, approximately 70 km north of North Dandalup. The nearest commercial port is at the Kwinana refinery, approximately 40 km\nsouth of Perth.\nWhile an extensive haul road network and overland conveyors transport crushed bauxite from the main mining hub to the Wagerup\nand Pinjarra refineries, bauxite is also transferred to the Kwinana refinery via the Kwinana freight railway system, using the Kwinana–\nMundijong line.\nAlcoa’s Darling Range mining operations do not produce mine waste in the same manner as conventional mining operations and\nwaste dumps are not constructed.\nAlcoa’s Darling Range facilities are in a well-maintained condition. Net book value of these facilities for the year-ended 2022 is $434\nmillion included in Properties, plants, and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nRefer to the Darling Range TRS in Sections 14.0 and 15.0 for more information on the surface infrastructure and facilities of the\nDarling Range.\nLand Tenure and Permitting\nBauxite occurrences were first recorded in the Darling Range in 1902, with studies and exploration subsequently conducted by the\nGeological Survey of Western Australia until the 1950s. Commercial exploration took place from 1957 by Western Mining\nCorporation Ltd (WMC, later WANL), across a large portion of southwest Western Australia within a Special Mineral Lease\n(ML1SA) granted in 1961. Commercial mining first took place within the Darling Range in 1963 at the former Jarrahdale mining\ncenter with WANL having joined with Alcoa. The Huntly and Willowdale mines commenced commercial production in 1972 and\n1984, respectively. Huntly supplies bauxite to the Kwinana and Pinjarra refineries (approximately 25 Mtpa), while Willowdale\nsupplies the Wagerup refinery (approximately 10 Mtpa)."

      "text": "35\nThe ML1SA lease allows for exploration and mining of bauxite within the tenement boundaries. ML1SA was granted in 1961, by the\nState Government of Western Australia under the Alumina Refinery Act, 1961, for four 21-year periods, and the current lease expires\non September 24, 2024. Prior to September 24, 2024, Alcoa will notify the State Government of Western Australia of its intention to\nexercise its right to renew for a further 21-year period to extend the concession to 2045. The State Government concession agreement\nincludes the provision for conditional renewal beyond 2045. Alcoa pays rent for each square mile of ML1SA in accordance with the\nAlumina Refinery Agreement Act 1961 (WA), providing exclusive rights to explore for and mine bauxite on all Crown Land within\nthe ML1SA. The current lease covers an area of 702,261 hectares (ha).\nThere are certain annual requirements to maintain the existing permits and approvals associated with ML1SA, including:\n•\nSubmission of annual mine plans for mining associated with the Wagerup refinery;\n•\nMaintain public Completion Criteria documentation for its bauxite mining operations;\n•\nAnnual submission and approval of Mining and Management Programs (MMPs) that include five-year mining schedules;\n•\nAnnual reporting of bauxite processed and any non-compliances to maintain environmental operational licenses; and,\n•\nMaintain compliance with environmental protection orders.\nThe ML1SA area includes sub-lease arrangements made between Alcoa and the Worsley Alumina joint venture participants. The\nagreements, made in August 2001 and September 2016, provide bauxite mining concessions to the Worsley Participants. No mineral\nresources or mineral reserves attributable to the Darling Range mining areas have been declared within these sub-lease areas.\nConstraints on mining activities within the ML1SA concession are in place, among others, which prevent mining within: 200 m of the\ntop water level of drinking water reservoirs; National Parks; Aboriginal Heritage Sites; Old Growth Forest; formal Conservation\nAreas; and 50 m of granite outcrop (greater than 1 ha). Mineral resources and mineral reserves have not been defined in these\nrestricted areas.\nMining on a day-only basis is conducted in “noise zones” where noise from the mining operations will potentially exceed allowable\nlevels. The operation actively seeks to maintain lower noise levels than those mandated, thus mining in these areas is undertaken by\ncontract miners using smaller equipment on day shifts only.\nThe Company has all environmental permits and operating licenses required for current mining activities. Outcomes of and\ncompliance with the management and monitoring programs are tracked within Alcoa’s Environmental Management System and\nreported within the Annual Environmental Review report.\nRefer to the Darling Range TRS in Section 3.0 for more information on Land Permitting and Tenure for the Darling Range.\nGeology and Exploration\nThe Darling Range comprises a low incised plateau formed by uplift along the north-south trending Darling Fault, a major structural\nlineament that extends for over 250 km, from Bindoon in the north to Collie in the south. Bauxite deposits have been identified\nthroughout the Darling Range and generally occur as erratically distributed alumina-rich lenses. Lateralization and subsequent\nperiodic activity of the Darling Fault has resulted in the current landform of scarps and deeply incised valleys on the western edge of\nthe Darling Range.\nSystematic exploration for bauxite within the region commenced in the 1960s and is currently conducted on a continuous basis to\nestablish optimal mine plans to achieve a uniform quality of bauxite production. Current mine plans include further exploration\nthroughout all areas where Alcoa has mining permits to sustain future production.\nRefer to the Darling Range TRS in Sections 6.0 through 11.0 for more information on the geology, mineralization, and exploration\nhistory of the Darling Range, including Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QA/QC) procedures and data used in the current mineral\nresource estimate.\nMining and Processing\nThe Huntly and Willowdale mines employ conventional open pit surface mining practices and equipment. Following definition of\nmineral reserve blocks, vegetation is cleared after which Alcoa operations commence stripping topsoil and secondary overburden\nremoval using small excavators, scrapers, and trucks. Soil is stockpiled at the site, away from the proposed pit, for rehabilitation\npurposes. After completion of mining, overburden is progressively backfilled into adjacent exhausted pits, topsoiled, and rehabilitated\nby re-establishment of native vegetation, creating a stable post-mining landform that replicates the pre-existing environment."

For comparative purposes,\nmeasured and indicated mineral resources were 96.7 mdmt and 82.8 mdmt for the years ended 2022 and 2021, respectively,\nrepresenting an increase of 17 percent. Inferred mineral resources were 140.3 mdmt and 320.0 mdmt for the years ended 2022 and\n2021, respectively, representing a decrease of 56 percent. Probable reserves were 255.8 mdmt and 132.7 mdmt for the years ended\n2022 and 2021, respectively, representing an increase of 93 percent, and proven reserves were 145.8 mdmt and 108.6 mdmt for the\nyears ended 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing an increase of 34 percent. The decrease in inferred mineral resources from 2021\nis partially reflected in the increase in measured and indicated mineral resources (and the subsequent conversion to mineral reserves).\nThe decrease is mostly attributable to the change to a 3D modelling method and the continued increased confidence through the\ncontinuous drilling program. Further mine planning work has allowed subsequent conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves.\nThe mineral reserves increase is mostly attributable to the conversion from mineral resources to mineral reserves, partially offset by\nmining depletion in 2022. Additionally, refer to the Darling Range TRS for more information on the mineral resources and mineral\nreserves of the Darling Range mines.\nIndividual Property Disclosure—Juruti\nProperty Location and Description\nThe Juruti bauxite mine is located in the west of Para State in northern Brazil. The mine is approximately 55 km south from the town\nof Juruti on the southern shore of the Amazon River. The mine is owned and operated by Alcoa through AWAB. The Juruti bauxite\nmine represents an established mining operation which commenced commercial production of bauxite in 2009."

      "text": "38\nLand Tenure and Permitting\nAll exploration and mining activities are managed by the National Mining Agency, Agencia Nacional de Mineracao (ANM), under the\nMining Code (1967). Permits are granted by the ANM falls into two categories:\n•\nExploration Permits: granted to support ongoing exploration activities. On submittal of an approved Exploration Report, the\nholder is then granted one year to present a Mining Plan as a precursor to obtaining a Mining Concession. Exploration\nPermits require:\no\nInitial application fee and submission by a registered professional geologist or mining engineer;\no\nAnnual fee payment to the ANM;\no\nDeclaration of exploration expenditures on an annual basis; and,\no\nSurvey visit fee payment to the ANM.\n•\nMining Concession: following a successful Mining Plan submission, enabling exploitation once Environmental Licenses are\ngranted. Concession holders are required to:\no\nCommence mining activities within 6 months of being granted;\no\nSubmit annual reports on all mining / processing activities (Relatorio Annual de Lavra, or RAL) to the ANM;\no\nMake compensation payments to landowners in line with the agreements made for mining easement; and,\no\nMake Brazilian Mineral Royalty payments (Compensacao Financeira pela Exploracao de Recursos Minerais, or\nCFEM).\nAt Juruti there are three continuous mining concessions for an aggregated 29,410 hectares (ha), where current mineral reserves are\ndetermined. Brazilian mineral legislation does not limit the duration of mining concessions and instead the concession remains in\nforce until the deposit is exhausted. These concessions may be extended later or expire earlier than estimated, based on the rate at\nwhich the deposits are exhausted and on obtaining any additional governmental approval, as necessary, such as operational licenses\nand environmental approvals.\nIn addition to the mining rights, there are thirteen requests for mining concessions, fourteen exploration permits, and two requests for\nexploration permits. The aggregated area for these permits is 197,866 ha.\nThe mining operations at Juruti take place on third-party land and, in accordance with the Mining Concession requirements, Alcoa\ncurrently has agreements in place with respective landowners. Agreements form a “mining easement,” which grants Alcoa access to\nthe mining areas in exchange for compensation payments. As a result, there are no other titles, claims, leases, or options applicable to\nthe exploration or mining permit areas which may limit Alcoa’s rights. Similarly, there are no liens or encumbrances.\nThe Company has all environmental permits and operating licenses required for current mining activities; there are no liens or\nencumbrances.\nRefer to the Juruti TRS in Sections 3.0 and 17.0 for more information on Land Permitting and Tenure for the Juruti mine.\nGeology and Exploration\nThe bauxite deposit of the Juruti bauxite mine consist of several lateritic bauxite plateaus which exist over a large lateral extent\n(several km) in comparison to the total thickness of the deposit (typically up to 20 m below surface).\nSystematic exploration for bauxite within the region has persisted since Alcoa’s ownership and is currently conducted on a continuous\nbasis to establish optimal mine plans to achieve a uniform quality of bauxite production. Current mine plans include further\nexploration throughout all areas where Alcoa has mining permits to sustain future production.\nRefer to the Juruti TRS in Sections 6.0 through 11.0 for more information on the geology, mineralization, and exploration history of\nthe Juruti mine, including QA/QC procedures and data used in the current mineral resource estimate.\nMining and Processing\nJuruti is an active mining operation using surface strip mining methods over a total of eight plateaus whereby land clearance, topsoil\nremoval, and overburden stripping is followed by bauxite deposit excavation and stockpiling. Waste is subsequently backfilled, and\noverburden and topsoil are re-instated for surface rehabilitation.\nJuruti produces both a washed and unwashed bauxite product; however, all tonnage is presented on a zero-moisture basis. Bauxite\nprocessing takes place at a dedicated plant facility located at the Juruti mine site which has been operating since 2009 and comprises a\nsimple comminution (crushing, screening) and washing circuit designed to remove fine particles from the ore.\nFine materials removed from ore are deposited in a thickening pond for settling and water reclamation, after which solid tailings are\ndiscarded into separate tailings ponds. There is currently one thickening pond and seven disposal ponds."

None of the reportable non-compliances represent a risk that could\nadversely affect its license to operate.\nRefer to the Juruti TRS in Section 17.0 for more information on the environmental, social, compliance, and permitting aspects of the\nJuruti mine.\nMineral Resources and Mineral Reserves\nFor information on Juruti mineral resources and mineral reserves, refer to the tables above. For comparative purposes, probable\nreserves were 36.8 mdmt and 37.7 mdmt for the years ended 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing a decrease of 2 percent. Proven\nreserves were 48.6 mdmt and 50.9 mdmt for the years ended 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing a decrease of 5 percent. The\ndecrease in mineral reserves from 2021 reflects mining depletion during 2022. Mineral resources were unchanged from 2021.\nAdditionally, refer to the Juruti TRS for more information on the mineral resources and mineral reserves of the Juruti mine.\nInternal Controls\nAlcoa has a long history of mining bauxite, with the majority of bauxite production having been used to supply Alcoa refineries.\nDespite having longstanding and robust processes for sampling, analysis, ore definition, and grade control, it is only within the last ten\nyears that structured and documented QA/QC practices have spread beyond the laboratories of many of the operations.\nInternal controls used by the Company are informed by internal reviews, representation on Technical Committees of Joint Venture\noperations, and by reviews, audits, and studies performed by third-party mining consultants. The controls include: surveying of\ndrillhole collar locations, drill sample logging, collection and security, database verification and security, QA/QC programs, internal\nand third-party qualified person statistical analysis, internal and third-party qualified person model validation, and reconciliation.\nModelling and analysis of the Company’s resources is completed internally and reviewed by a qualified person, with the exception of\nAl Ba’itha where modelling and analysis is completed by a third-party consultant.\nAs the ore bodies are shallow and generally horizontal, two-dimensional seam modelling has been the standard practice; however,\nmany operations are implementing more conventional 3D block modelling using geostatistical interpolation methods. Mineral\nresource estimation is validated internally through visual comparison of drillholes and model blocks as well as through the use of\nswath plots and statistical distributions. Mineral resource estimation is reviewed and adopted by a qualified person. Mineral reserve\nestimation is completed internally and reviewed by a qualified person, with the exception of Boké and Al Ba’itha where reserve\nestimation is completed by a third-party consultant.\nLabelled samples from the drill site are securely transported for logging or temporary storage by the drilling contractor or Alcoa\npersonnel. Additional transport to internal or external laboratories is controlled and completed, as necessary, by Alcoa personnel or by\ncourier.\nDrillhole databases are all site specific; most sites use industry standard drillhole database software, applications, and processes with\nsecurity and backup protocols in place. Prior to modelling, secondary validation and cleansing of the modelling datasets is performed.\nWherever possible, data collection is digital to allow direct loading into the database.\nThe Company has well-established QA/QC programs that are site specific and range from in-development to mature. Although some\nprograms are limited to laboratory protocols only covering analysis of duplicate pulps and standards, others involve, to varying\ndegrees, the range of activities from twin hole drilling and collection of field duplicates, submission of blind duplicates and standards\nand submission of duplicate samples to umpire laboratories. Regardless of the level of QA/QC, all sites have well established and\ndocumented sampling and analysis regimes. QA/QC practices and available data is reviewed by a qualified person.\nAs discussed above, management relies on estimates for our mineral reserves and these estimates could change due to a number of\nfactors, including future changes in: permitting requirements, geological conditions, ongoing mine planning, macroeconomic and\nindustry conditions, and regulatory disclosure requirements.

Proceedings that\nwere previously disclosed may no longer be reported because, as a result of rulings in the case, settlements, changes in our business, or\nother developments, in our judgment, they are no longer material to Alcoa’s business, financial position or results of operations. See\nPart II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn addition to the matters discussed below, various other lawsuits, claims, and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted\nagainst Alcoa Corporation, including those pertaining to environmental, safety and health, commercial, tax, product liability,\nintellectual property infringement, employment, employee and retiree benefit matters, and other actions and claims arising out of the\nnormal course of business. While the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial, the ultimate liability is not readily\ndeterminable because of the considerable uncertainties that exist. Accordingly, it is possible that the Company’s liquidity or results of\noperations in a particular period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters. However, based on facts currently\navailable, management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse\neffect, individually or in the aggregate, on the financial position of the Company.\nEnvironmental Matters\nAlcoa is involved in proceedings under CERCLA and analogous state or other statutory or jurisdictional provisions regarding the\nusage, disposal, storage, or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites. The Company has committed to participate, or is\nengaged in negotiations with authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation, in clean-up efforts at several such sites. The\nmost significant of these matters are discussed in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nunder the caption Contingencies.\nIn August 2005, Dany Lavoie, a resident of Baie-Comeau in the Canadian Province of Québec, filed a Motion for Authorization to\nInstitute a Class Action and for Designation of a Class Representative against Alcoa Canada Ltd., Alcoa Limitée, Société Canadienne\nde Metaux Reynolds Limitée, and Canadian British Aluminum in the Superior Court of Québec in the District of Baie-Comeau,\nalleging that defendants, as the present and past owners and operators of an aluminum smelter in Baie-Comeau, had negligently\nallowed the emission of certain contaminants from the smelter on the lands and houses of the St. Georges neighborhood and its\nenvirons causing property damage and personal injury. In May 2007, the court authorized a class action suit on behalf of all people\nwho suffered property or personal injury damages caused by the emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from the Company’s\naluminum smelter in Baie-Comeau. In September 2007, plaintiffs filed the claim against the original defendants. The Soderberg\nsmelting operations that plaintiffs allege to be the source of emissions of concern ceased operations in 2013 and have been dismantled.\nA court appointed expert, engaged to perform analysis of the potential impacts from the emissions in accordance with a sampling\nprotocol agreed to by the parties, submitted its report to the court in May 2019. In 2021, plaintiffs filed their amended claim and expert\nreports, and defendants filed their amended defense and expert reports. In October 2021, the parties participated in mediation. In\nMarch 2022, the parties reached a settlement for damages that is subject to court approval. On May 31, 2022, the court entered a\njudgement approving the settlement and formally concluding the litigation. The settlement does not have a material impact on the\nCompany’s financial results.\nIntalco (Washington) Notice of Violation—In May 2022, the Company received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (the EPA). The NOV alleges violations under the Clean Air Act at the Company’s curtailed Intalco\n(Washington) smelter from when the smelter was operational. The EPA has referred the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice,\nEnvironment and Natural Resources Division (the DOJ). The DOJ and the Company are engaged in discussions with respect to a\nresolution of this matter.\nAsbestos Litigation\nSome of our subsidiaries as premises owners are defendants in active lawsuits filed in various jurisdictions on behalf of persons\nseeking damages for alleged personal injury as a result of occupational exposure to asbestos at various facilities. Our subsidiaries and\nacquired companies all have had numerous insurance policies over the years that provide coverage for asbestos based claims. Many of\nthese policies provide layers of coverage for varying periods of time and for varying locations. We have significant insurance\ncoverage and believe that our reserves are adequate for known asbestos exposure related liabilities. The costs of defense and\nsettlement have not been and are not expected to be material to the results of operations, cash flows, and financial position of Alcoa\nCorporation.\nItem 4.

      "text": "44\nOverview\nOur Business\nAlcoa Corporation (Alcoa or the Company) is a vertically integrated aluminum company comprised of bauxite mining, alumina\nrefining, aluminum production (smelting and casting), and energy generation. Aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the London\nMetal Exchange (LME) and priced daily. Additionally, alumina is subject to market pricing through the Alumina Price Index (API),\nwhich is calculated by the Company based on the weighted average of a prior month’s daily spot prices published by the following\nthree indices: CRU Metallurgical Grade Alumina Price, Platts Metals Daily Alumina PAX Price, and FastMarkets Metal Bulletin\nNon-Ferrous Metals Alumina Index. As a result, the price of both aluminum and alumina is subject to significant volatility and,\ntherefore, influences the operating results of Alcoa Corporation.\nThrough direct and indirect ownership, Alcoa Corporation has 27 operating locations in nine countries around the world, situated\nprimarily in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Spain, and the United States. Governmental policies, laws and regulations,\nand other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results\nof operations in these countries.\nBusiness Update\nIn 2022, world events, including the on-going conflict between Russia and Ukraine, influenced costs for raw materials and created a\nglobal energy crisis, particularly in Europe. The Company saw significant decreases in market pricing for alumina and aluminum\nbetween the first and the second half of the year.\nDespite the significant change in alumina and aluminum prices during 2022, the alumina and aluminum markets ended 2022 balanced\nor in a slight volume deficit, respectively, while the cost for raw materials remained high throughout the year. All direct material costs\nincreased since the end of 2021, driven by inflation pressures and multiple supply chain disruptions.\nAlcoa worked to offset negative market impacts, including the high costs of energy in Europe. The Company partially curtailed two\nfacilities, adjusting production rates to approximately 50 percent of the 1.6 million metric tons of annual capacity at the San Ciprián\nalumina refinery in Spain due to high costs of natural gas, and curtailing one of three potlines at the Lista aluminum smelter in\nNorway due to high electricity costs. Additionally, in July, the Company curtailed one aluminum potline at Warrick Operations in the\nU.S. due to workforce shortages in the region, and sold the excess power into the market.\nThe Company also continued its work to support the planned restart of the San Ciprián smelter in Spain. Alcoa signed two power\npurchase agreements for wind-based electricity for up to approximately 75 percent of the smelter’s power needs.\nThe Company continued to progress the full restart at the Alumar smelter in Brazil and in the fourth quarter 2022 completed the restart\nof some modest capacity at the Portland Aluminium joint venture in Australia. Those sites have competitive, multi-year energy\nagreements; with fully renewable power sources (hydropower) for the Alumar smelter.\nLower bauxite quality in areas where the Company is currently mining in Australia impacted production levels in 2022 at certain of\nthe Australia refineries.\nDuring 2022, the Company maintained a strong balance sheet and further reduced pension liabilities by completing a $1,000 transfer\nof obligations and related assets for certain U.S. retirees and their beneficiaries.\nIn 2019, the Company announced a five year strategic portfolio review of smelting and refining capacity to improve cost positioning,\nincluding curtailment, closure, or divestiture. Through 2021, Alcoa reached approximately 75 and 58 percent of its target to improve,\ncurtail, close, or divest 1.5 and 4 million metric tons of smelting and refining capacity, respectively. While no actions were taken in\n2022 related to these targets, the Company took actions in response to market conditions as noted above, and the strategic portfolio\nreview is continuing.\nAlthough 2022 was an unusual year with global events influencing energy and raw material costs, the Company continues to project\nstrong long-term demand for aluminum, as a key material for a global economy with a growing focus on lower carbon dioxide\nemissions, including renewable energy infrastructure and transmission, electric and electric-intensive vehicles and packaging markets.\nEven in a challenging market, the Company saw continued evidence of the growth of aluminum demand. In 2022, Alcoa saw a\nsignificant increase in year-over-year demand for its EcoLum aluminum, which is part of our Sustana brand, through both increased\nmargins and deliveries while still a relatively small portion of the Company’s overall sales volume. The year-over-year volume\nincrease for EcoLum, which is aluminum produced with no more than 4.0 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per metric ton of\naluminum produced, grew more than four times over 2021, driven mostly by the European market.\nDue to renewable energy sources and low carbon dioxide intensity in our operations, Alcoa believes that it is well positioned as a\nsupplier of choice, especially in a world that is working to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Company has a global\nrefining system with the industry’s lowest carbon dioxide intensity (per CRU Group’s 2021 results published in third quarter 2022),\nand 86 percent of the Company’s smelting portfolio was powered by renewable energy sources in 2022."

      "text": "45\nSan Ciprián Smelter\nIn January 2022, Alcoa completed the curtailment of the San Ciprián aluminum smelter’s 228 kmt of annual capacity while the\ncasthouse continues to operate. The curtailment is a result of an agreement that was reached with the workers’ representatives in\nDecember 2021 to suspend production until January 2024 due to exorbitant energy prices in Spain. In 2022, cash payments of $26\nwere made to reduce the related reserve for certain employee and contractual obligations that was recorded in December 2021. In\nconnection with the agreement, the Company has restricted cash of $103 to be made available for $68 in capital improvements at the\nsite and $35 in smelter restart costs.\nDuring 2022, Alcoa signed two long-term power purchase agreements for wind-based electricity for up to approximately 75 percent of\nthe San Ciprián smelter’s power needs upon restart, although permitting approvals are required by the regional and national Spanish\ngovernments before construction can begin.\nOn February 3, 2023, the Company reached an updated agreement with the workers’ representatives to commence the restart process\nin phases beginning in January 2024. Alcoa plans that all pots will be restarted by October 1, 2025, and from October 1, 2025 until the\nend of 2026, the minimum production will be 75 percent of the annual capacity of 228 kmt. Under the terms of the updated agreement,\nthe Company is responsible for certain employee obligations during the extended curtailment period. As a result, the Company will\nrecord charges of approximately $50 (pre- and after-tax) in the first quarter of 2023 in Restructuring and other charges, net on the\nStatement of Consolidated Operations. Cash outlays related to these obligations are expected in 2024 and 2025. In connection with the\nupdated agreement, the Company made additional commitments of $78 for capital improvements at the site to be spent primarily\nbetween 2024 and 2025.\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, the Company repaid carbon dioxide credits related to the San Ciprián smelter. Spain has a\ncompensatory mechanism for the indirect cost of carbon dioxide and provides associated credits. Upon receipt of the credits in each of\nthe applicable years, the Company recorded the cash received as deferred income (liability) due to a three-year clawback provision\nbased on continued operations and employment. In June 2021, the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism (the Ministry)\ninitiated the process to request repayment of 2018 and 2019 credits due to Alcoa’s decision to implement the collective dismissal\nprocess and its potential impact on operations and employment at San Ciprián. Alcoa disagreed with the Ministry’s position as the\ncollective dismissal process was not concluded and qualifying operations and employment at San Ciprián were maintained during the\nrelevant three-year period. The Company requested to suspend the payment of the claimed credits (and interest) in exchange for a\nbank guarantee. On April 26, 2022, the Spanish National Court rejected the Company’s request and the Company made a repayment\nof approximately $41 (€37) for the 2018 and 2019 compensation credits and interest.\nAlumar Smelter\nOn September 20, 2021, the Company announced its plan to restart its 268 kmt per year share of capacity at the Alumar smelter in São\nLuís, Brazil, which had been fully curtailed since 2015. Alcoa incurred restart expenses of $75 during 2022. The first metal sales\noccurred in the second quarter of 2022 and the Company continues to progress the restart of the smelter.\nThe restart leverages the site’s integration with an alumina refinery, new long-term contracts for renewable energy and an available\nskilled workforce, as well as tax efficiencies and a strong U.S. dollar. With the completion of the planned restart, Alcoa will have\napproximately 76 percent of its 2.97 million metric tons of global aluminum smelting capacity operating.\nOther Portfolio Actions\nKwinana—In January 2023, the Company reduced production at the Kwinana (Australia) refinery by approximately 30 percent in\nresponse to a domestic natural gas shortage in Western Australia due to production challenges experienced by key gas suppliers.\nPortland—In October 2022, the Company completed the restart of 35 kmt (19 kmt Alcoa share) of previously curtailed annual\ncapacity at the Portland aluminum smelter in Australia that was previously announced in November 2021. With the restart complete,\nthe plant is operating at approximately 95 percent of its total capacity and Alcoa has approximately 186 kmt of consolidated annual\ncapacity at Portland.\nLista—On August 30, 2022, the Company announced the curtailment of one third of the production capacity (31 kmt) at the Lista\nsmelter in Norway to mitigate high energy costs for the site. The site was exposed to spot energy pricing, which had increased to\nabove $600 per megawatt hour. In July 2022, the Company entered into a fixed price power agreement effective for the fourth quarter\nof 2022 through December 31, 2023. In February 2023, the agreement was amended with improved fixed pricing and lower volume\ncommitments.\nWarrick—On July 1, 2022, Alcoa curtailed one of the three operating smelting potlines (54 kmt) at its Warrick Operations site due to\noperational challenges stemming from labor shortages in the region."

      "text": "46\nAddy, Washington—In July 2022, Alcoa made the decision to permanently close the previously curtailed magnesium smelter in Addy\n(Washington). The facility has been fully curtailed since 2001. The Company recorded a charge of $29 to establish reserves for\nenvironmental and demolition obligations in Restructuring and other charges, net on the Statement of Consolidated Operations in the\nthird quarter of 2022. Associated cash outlays are expected to be paid over the next three to five years.\nMRN—On April 30, 2022, Alcoa completed the sale of its investment in MRN for proceeds of $10. An additional $30 in cash could\nbe paid to the Company in the future if certain post-closing conditions related to future MRN mine development are satisfied. Related\nto this transaction, the Company recorded an asset impairment of $58 in the first quarter of 2022 in Restructuring and other charges,\nnet on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. In addition, the Company entered into several bauxite offtake agreements with\nSouth32 to provide bauxite supply for existing long-term supply contracts.\nCapital Returns\nOn July 20, 2022, Alcoa Corporation announced that its Board of Directors approved a new common stock repurchase program under\nwhich the Company may purchase shares of its outstanding common stock up to an aggregate transactional value of $500, depending\non the Company’s continuing analysis of market, financial, and other factors (the New Repurchase Program). The Company had $500\navailable for share repurchases at the end of 2021 from a prior authorization in October 2021. The share repurchase programs may be\nsuspended or discontinued at any time and do not have predetermined expiration dates.\nIn 2022, the Company repurchased 8,565,200 shares of its common stock for $500 under the previously authorized program; the\nshares were immediately retired. As of the date of this report, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase up to a total of $500,\nin the aggregate, of its outstanding shares of common stock under the New Repurchase Program. Refer to Liquidity and Capital, for\nmore information.\nIn each quarter of 2022, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share of the Company’s common\nstock, totaling $72 for the year.\nBalance Sheet Actions\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the Company purchased group annuity contracts to transfer the obligation to pay remaining retirement\nbenefits for approximately 4,400 retirees and beneficiaries from its U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The transfer of approximately\n$1,000 in both plan obligations and plan assets was completed in August 2022. As a result, Alcoa recognized a non-cash settlement\nloss of $617 (pre- and after-tax) in Restructuring and other charges, net on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. See Part II Item\n2 of this Form 10-K in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOn June 27, 2022, the Company successfully amended and restated its Revolving Credit Facility, which includes terms that provide\nimproved flexibility to execute on Alcoa’s long-term strategies. Among other improvements, the Revolving Credit Facility released\nthe collateral package that had previously secured the Revolving Credit Facility, which will continue so long as certain credit ratings\nare maintained, and provides a debt to capitalization ratio not to exceed .60 to 1.00 to replace the maximum leverage ratio upon a\nratings upgrade to investment grade by Moody’s or S&P. On July 26, 2022, Moody’s upgraded the rating of ANHBV’s senior\nunsecured notes to Baa3 (investment grade) from Ba1 and set the current outlook to stable. Refer to Liquidity and Capital, for more\ninformation.\nOther Matters\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Norwegian government approved a 2023 budget proposal that sets a floor for the carbon dioxide\ncompensation to be paid in 2023 based on 2022 power purchased. The Company recorded an adjustment of $25 in the fourth quarter\nof 2022 to Cost of goods sold to reverse amounts accrued for 2022 credits earned through September 30, 2022 under the prior carbon\ndioxide compensation program.\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes a 15% minimum tax on book income of\ncertain large corporations, a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases after December 31, 2022, and several tax incentives to promote\nclean energy. This legislation did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company recorded a charge of $77 in Restructuring and other charges, net to reflect its estimate for the\nagreement reached with the workers of the divested Avilés and La Coruña facilities (Spain) to settle various legal disputes related to\nthe 2019 divestiture. In April 2022, the Company received unanimous acceptance of the offer from all active workers of the divested\nAvilés and La Coruña facilities and a Global Settlement Agreement (GSA) was fully executed. The Company recorded a charge of\n$2 in Restructuring and other charges, net in second quarter of 2022 to reflect an update to its estimated liability for the GSA. The\nCompany expects to make cash payments in 2023 upon completion of certain administrative and judicial approvals (See Note S).\nOn March 31, 2022, Ma’aden’s put option and the Company’s call option, relating to additional interests in the joint venture, expired\nwith neither party exercising their options. In accordance with the joint venture agreement, the call and put options were exercisable\nfor a period of six months after October 1, 2021."

In comparison, the 2021 Provision for\nincome taxes was $629 on income before taxes of $1,199 or 52.5%.\nThe increase in tax expense is primarily attributable to a charge to record a full valuation allowance of $217 against the deferred tax\nassets of Alcoa Alumínio (Alumínio), and a charge of $30 primarily to write off the deferred tax assets of Alcoa Norway ANS due to a\nlegal entity restructuring in 2022. This increase was partially offset by a tax benefit of $33 recognized due to changes in the utilization\nof the tax holiday rate in AWAB, lower income in some of the jurisdictions where the Company records taxes, and a valuation\nallowance of $103 recorded in 2021 against the net deferred tax assets of Alúmina Española, S.A (Española).\nThe 2022 full valuation allowance for Alumínio was a result of Alumínio’s three-year cumulative loss position for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Although the Company entered into aluminum contracts to manage exposures associated with the restart, these\ncontracts were held by another legal entity, and the associated realized gains are not available to Alumínio to offset the restart losses.\nWhile management believes Alumínio will return to profitability in the future with the restart of the Alumar smelter, current volatility\nin the market does not provide a reliable basis for concluding that it is more likely than not that Alumínio’s net deferred tax assets,\nwhich consist primarily of tax loss carryforwards with indefinite life, will be realized. Alumar smelter profitability in future periods\ncould prompt the Company to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax asset and assess the possibility of a reversal of the valuation\nallowance, which could have a significant impact on net income in the quarter the valuation allowance is reversed.\nIn 2021, a valuation allowance of $103 was recorded against the net deferred tax assets of Española. Management concluded that it\nwas more likely than not that Española’s net deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of tax loss carryforwards, would not be\nrealized as the entity’s sole operating asset, the San Ciprián refinery, was in a three-year cumulative loss position for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2021.\nNoncontrolling interest\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $161 in 2022 compared with $141 in 2021. These amounts are entirely related\nto Alumina Limited’s 40% ownership interest in several affiliated operating entities.\nThe increase is primarily a result of higher average realized prices of alumina, lower elimination of intercompany profit in inventory,\nhigher other income primarily related to favorable mark-to-market results on derivative instruments, lower taxes on lower profits\nbefore taxes and the absence of the Española valuation allowance, lower restructuring charges primarily due to lower pension actions,\nand a decrease in equity earnings from the Ma’aden bauxite and alumina joint venture, partially offset by higher raw material costs,\nenergy prices and production costs."

      "text": "50\nSegment Information\nAlcoa Corporation is a producer of bauxite, alumina, and aluminum products. The Company’s operations consist of three worldwide\nreportable segments: Bauxite, Alumina, and Aluminum. Segment performance under Alcoa Corporation’s management reporting\nsystem is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is the Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings\nbefore interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of each segment. The Company calculates Segment Adjusted EBITDA as Total\nsales (third-party and intersegment) minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general administrative, and other\nexpenses; and Research and development expenses. Alcoa Corporation believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to\ninvestors because such measure provides both additional information about the operating performance of Alcoa Corporation and\ninsight on the ability of Alcoa Corporation to meet its financial obligations. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to\nbe a substitute for, and should not be considered in isolation from, the financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Alcoa\nCorporation’s Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA totaled $2,275 in 2022, $3,053 in 2021, and $1,317 in 2020. The following information provides\nproduction, shipments, sales, and Segment Adjusted EBITDA data for each reportable segment, as well as certain realized price and\naverage cost data, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022. See Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note E to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nBauxite\n2022\n2021\nProduction (mdmt)\n42.1\n47.6\nThird-party shipments (mdmt)\n3.5\n5.7\nIntersegment shipments (mdmt)\n39.5\n42.4\nTotal shipments (mdmt)\n43.0\n48.1\nThird-party sales\n$\n204\n$\n236\nIntersegment sales\n680\n711\nTotal sales\n$\n884\n$\n947\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n82\n$\n172\nOperating costs\n$\n919\n$\n912\nAverage cost per dry metric ton of bauxite shipped\n$\n21\n$\n19\nProduction in the above table can vary from Total shipments due primarily to differences between the equity allocation of production,\nofftake agreements with the respective equity investment, and other supply agreements. Additionally, Total shipments include dry\nmetric tons that were not produced by the Bauxite segment. Such bauxite was purchased to satisfy certain customer commitments. The\nBauxite segment bears the risk of loss of the purchased bauxite until control of the product has been transferred to this segment’s\ncustomers. Operating costs in the table above includes all production-related costs: conversion costs, such as labor, materials, and\nutilities; depreciation, depletion, and amortization; and plant administrative expenses.\nOverview. This segment represents the Company’s global bauxite mining operations. A portion of this segment’s production\nrepresents the offtake from equity method investments in Brazil (prior to the MRN sale in April 2022) and Guinea, as well as\nAWAC’s share of production related to the equity investment in Saudi Arabia. The bauxite mined by this segment is sold primarily to\ninternal customers within the Alumina segment; a portion of the bauxite is sold to external customers. Bauxite mined by this segment\nand used internally is transferred to the Alumina segment at negotiated terms that are intended to approximate market prices; sales to\nthird-parties are conducted on a contract basis. Generally, this segment’s sales are transacted in U.S. dollars while costs and expenses\nare transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are the Australian dollar and the Brazilian real. Most of the\noperations that comprise the Bauxite segment are part of AWAC (see Noncontrolling Interest in Earnings Summary above).\nBusiness Update. Total shipments decreased 5.1 million dry metric tons compared to 2021 primarily due to lower demand from\ncertain Alumina segment refineries, the cessation of bauxite sales to Russian aluminum businesses, decreased demand in the Atlantic\nbauxite market, and the expiration of the Company’s license to export bauxite from Australia.\nOn April 30, 2022, Alcoa completed the sale of its investment in MRN for proceeds of $10. An additional $30 in cash could be paid to\nthe Company in the future if certain post-closing conditions related to future MRN mine development are satisfied. Related to this\ntransaction, the Company recorded an asset impairment of $58 in the first quarter of 2022 in Restructuring and other charges, net on\nthe Statement of Consolidated Operations. In addition, the Company entered into several bauxite offtake agreements with South32\nMinerals S.A. to provide bauxite supply for existing long-term supply contracts.\nMining operations are relocated periodically in support of optimizing the value extracted from bauxite reserves. In 2022, the Company\ncontinued the process of moving the Juruti mining operations, which is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2023. During\n2022, the Company incurred $41 in capital expenditures related to the Juruti mining operation relocation."

      "text": "52\nIn the above table, total shipments include metric tons that were not produced by the Alumina segment. Such alumina was purchased\nto satisfy certain customer commitments. The Alumina segment bears the risk of loss of the purchased alumina until control of the\nproduct has been transferred to this segment’s customers. Additionally, operating costs in the table above includes all production-\nrelated costs: raw materials consumed; conversion costs, such as labor, materials, and utilities; depreciation and amortization; and\nplant administrative expenses.\nOverview. This segment represents the Company’s worldwide refining system, which processes bauxite into alumina. The alumina\nproduced by this segment is sold primarily to internal and external aluminum smelter customers; a portion of the alumina is sold to\nexternal customers who process it into industrial chemical products. Approximately two-thirds of Alumina’s production is sold under\nsupply contracts to third parties worldwide, while the remainder is used internally by the Aluminum segment. Alumina produced by\nthis segment and used internally is transferred to the Aluminum segment at prevailing market prices. A portion of this segment’s third-\nparty sales are completed through the use of alumina traders. Generally, this segment’s sales are transacted in U.S. dollars while costs\nand expenses are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are the Australian dollar, the Brazilian real, and\nthe euro. Most of the operations that comprise the Alumina segment are part of AWAC (see Noncontrolling Interest in Earnings\nSummary above). This segment also includes AWAC’s 25.1% ownership interest in the mining and refining joint venture company in\nSaudi Arabia.\nBusiness Update. During 2022, the average API of $365 per metric ton trended favorably compared to 2021 reflecting a 13%\nsequential increase.\nAlumina production decreased 5% in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the reduced production at the Australian refineries, and\nthe reduction in the daily production rate at the San Ciprián refinery, partially offset by increased production at the Alumar refinery\ndue to the non-recurrence of the ship unloader outage in 2021. Australian refinery production in 2022 was less than 2021 due to\nextended and unplanned maintenance periods and lower bauxite quality impacting production levels.\nDuring 2022, the Alumina segment experienced higher raw material costs, higher energy costs predominantly related to the San\nCiprián refinery, and higher caustic usage at certain Australian refineries related to lower bauxite quality, due to the location of mining\nareas.\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the Company reduced production at the San Ciprián refinery to 50 percent of the 1.6 million metric tons\nof annual capacity to lessen the financial impact from rising natural gas prices in Spain.\nIn December 2022, the Company recorded a charge of $25 to Cost of goods sold to increase the AROs at the Alumar refinery when\nupdated estimates became available for improvements required on closed bauxite residue areas.\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, the Company recorded the reversal of a valuation allowance on Brazil state VAT of $46 in Cost of\ngoods sold. In the fourth quarter of 2018, after an assessment of the future realizability of the state VAT credits, Alcoa established an\nallowance on the accumulated state VAT credit balances and stopped recording any future credit benefits. With the restart of the\nAlumar smelter in Brazil and the first metal sales in June 2022, the Company has the ability to monetize these credits and reversed the\nvaluation allowance in the second quarter of 2022.\nDuring 2022, the Company recorded a charge of $48 to Cost of goods sold and an increase to the capitalized asset retirement cost of\n$9 to increase the AROs at the Poços de Caldas refinery for improvements required on both operating and closed bauxite residue areas\nto comply with updated impoundment regulations in the region.\nCapacity. The Alumina segment had a base annual capacity of 13,843 kmt with 1,014 kmt of curtailed refining capacity. In the third\nquarter of 2022, curtailed capacity increased 800 kmt, due to the partial curtailment of the San Ciprián refinery (see above).\nAnnual Comparison\nProduction\nProduction decreased 5% primarily as a result of:\n•\nReduced alumina production at the Australian refineries due to extended and unplanned equipment maintenance and lower\nbauxite quality impacting production levels\n•\nDecreased production at the San Ciprián refinery due to the partial curtailment in the third quarter of 2022\nPartially offset by:\n•\nIncreased production at Alumar refinery due to non-recurrence of ship unloader outage in 2021\nThird-party sales\nThird-party sales increased $381 primarily as a result of:\n•\nHigher average realized price of $58/ton principally driven by a higher average API"

This change is isolated to the Huntly mine that supplies the Pinjarra and Kwinana refineries.\nOperating those refineries with lower quality bauxite decreases alumina output and increases caustic usage.\nThe Company projects total alumina shipments to range between 12.7 and 12.9 million metric tons in 2023, down from 2022 primarily\ndue to the full year impact of the partial curtailment of the San Ciprián refinery and the reduction of bauxite grade at the Huntly mine.\nAs discussed above, in the third quarter of 2022, the Company reduced production at the San Ciprián refinery to 50 percent of the 1.6\nmillion tons of annual capacity in an effort to reduce the refinery’s losses related to natural gas prices. The Company is actively\nreviewing the refinery’s operating levels, commercial options, and other support, given the ongoing volatility in European energy\nmarkets. Commercial actions taken in late 2022 to mitigate the impact of energy and raw material costs at the San Ciprián refinery are\nexpected to improve segment profitability in 2023."

Such aluminum was purchased by this segment to satisfy certain customer commitments. The\nAluminum segment bears the risk of loss of the purchased aluminum until control of the product has been transferred to this segment’s\ncustomer. Until the sale of the Warrick Rolling Mill on March 31, 2021, total aluminum information includes flat-rolled aluminum\nwhile primary aluminum information does not. Primary aluminum third-party sales exclude realized gains and losses related to\nembedded derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forward sales of aluminum. Operating costs includes all\nproduction-related costs: raw materials consumed; conversion costs, such as labor, materials, and utilities; depreciation and\namortization; and plant administrative expenses.\nThe average realized third-party price per metric ton of primary aluminum includes three elements: a) the underlying base metal\ncomponent, based on quoted prices from the LME; b) the regional premium, which represents the incremental price over the base\nLME component that is associated with the physical delivery of metal to a particular region (e.g., the Midwest premium for metal sold\nin the United States); and c) the product premium, which represents the incremental price for receiving physical metal in a particular\nshape (e.g., billet, slab, rod, etc.) or alloy.\nOverview. This segment consists of the Company’s (i) worldwide smelting and casthouse system, which processes alumina into\nprimary aluminum, and the (ii) portfolio of energy assets in Brazil, Canada, and the United States.\nAluminum’s combined smelting and casting operations produce primary aluminum products, virtually all of which are sold to external\ncustomers and traders. The smelting operations produce molten primary aluminum, which is then formed by the casting operations\ninto either common alloy ingot (e.g., t-bar, sow, standard ingot) or into value add ingot products (e.g., foundry, billet, rod, and slab). A\nvariety of external customers purchase the primary aluminum products for use in fabrication operations, which produce products\nprimarily for the transportation, building and construction, packaging, wire, and other industrial markets. Results from the sale of\naluminum powder and scrap are also included in this segment, as well as the impacts of embedded aluminum derivatives related to\nenergy supply contracts.\nThe energy assets supply power to external customers in Brazil and, to a lesser extent, in the United States, as well as internal\ncustomers in the Aluminum (Canadian smelters and Warrick (Indiana) smelter) and Alumina segments (Brazilian refineries).\nGenerally, this segment’s aluminum sales are transacted in U.S. dollars while costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the\nlocal currency of the respective operations, which are the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Norwegian krone, the Icelandic króna, the\nCanadian dollar, the Brazilian real, and the Australian dollar.\nThis segment also includes Alcoa Corporation’s 25.1% ownership interest in the smelting joint venture company in Saudi Arabia.\nBusiness Update. During 2022, third-party sales were flat compared to 2021 on higher LME and regional premiums, partially offset by\nlower trading activities, as well as lower shipments. Metal prices increased with LME prices on a 15-day lag averaging $2,726 per\nmetric ton. The Aluminum segment also experienced higher raw material and energy costs during 2022.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Norwegian government approved a 2023 budget proposal that sets a floor for the carbon dioxide\ncompensation to be paid in 2023 based on 2022 power purchased. The Company recorded an adjustment of $25 in the fourth quarter\nof 2022 to Cost of goods sold to reverse amounts accrued for 2022 credits earned through September 30, 2022 under the prior carbon\ndioxide compensation program."

      "text": "55\nOn December 29, 2021, the Company and workers’ representatives at the San Ciprián, Spain aluminum facility reached an agreement\nfor the two-year curtailment of the smelter’s 228 kmt of annual capacity due to exorbitant energy prices in Spain. The curtailment was\ncompleted in January 2022 while the casthouse continues to operate. During 2022, $26 of payments were made to reduce the\nemployee leave compensation and take or pay contractual obligations of $62 recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Company\nincurred $5 of capital investment expenditures against the commitments for capital investments of $68 and restart costs of $35. In\nOctober 2022, the Company signed an agreement with a renewable energy provider for approximately 30 percent of the smelter’s\npower needs upon restart and continues to negotiate with other generators to secure the remaining power supply needs for the smelter.\nWhen combined with the 45 percent of the smelter’s power needs secured in the second quarter of 2022, up to approximately 75\npercent of the smelter’s power needs have been secured under long-term agreements with renewable energy providers to date. On\nFebruary 3, 2023, the Company reached an updated agreement with the workers’ representatives to commence the restart process in\nphases beginning in January 2024. Alcoa plans that all pots will be restarted by October 1, 2025, and from October 1, 2025 until the\nend of 2026, the minimum production will be 75 percent of the annual capacity of 228 kmt. See Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in\nNote V to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn conjunction with the previously announced restart of the Alumar smelter in São Luís, Brazil, Alcoa incurred restart expenses of $75\nduring 2022. The first metal sales occurred in the second quarter of 2022 and the Company continues to progress the restart of the\nAlumar smelter.\nIn October 2022, the Company completed the previously announced restart of 19 kmt (Alcoa share) of previously curtailed capacity at\nthe Portland (Australia) smelter. Alcoa incurred restart expenses of $12 during 2022.\nOn August 30, 2022, the Company announced the curtailment of one third of the production capacity (31 kmt) at the Lista (Norway)\nsmelter to mitigate high energy costs for the site. The site was exposed to spot energy pricing, which had increased to above $600 per\nmegawatt hour. In July 2022, the Company entered into a fixed price power agreement effective for the fourth quarter 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2023.\nOn July 1, 2022, Alcoa curtailed one of the three operating smelting potlines (54 kmt) at the Warrick Operations site due to\noperational challenges stemming from labor shortages in the region.\nCapacity. At December 31, 2022, the Aluminum segment had 868 kmt of idle smelting capacity on a base capacity of 2,968 kmt, an\nincrease from 2021 of 183 kmt in idle capacity due to the San Ciprián smelter curtailment and partial curtailment of the Warrick and\nLista smelters, partially offset by the Alumar and Portland smelter restarts in 2022.\nAnnual Comparison\nProduction\nProduction decreased 8% primarily as a result of:\n•\nCurtailment of the San Ciprián smelter, completed in January 2022\n•\nPartial curtailment of the Warrick smelter in July 2022\n•\nPartial curtailment of the Lista smelter in August 2022\nPartially offset by:\n•\nAlumar smelter restart\n•\nPortland smelter restart\nThird-party sales\nThird-party sales decreased $31 primarily as a result of:\n•\nLower trading activities\n•\nAbsence of sales from the divested Warrick Rolling Mill\n•\nDecreased sales from the San Ciprián smelter due to the smelter curtailment, partially offset by increased price\n•\nLower pricing at the Brazil hydro-electric facilities as 2021 drought conditions elevated prices in the prior year period\n•\nLower shipments mainly due to the partial curtailments of the Warrick smelter and the Lista smelter and maintenance at European\nsmelters, partially offset by higher shipments from the Alumar smelter and Portland smelter due to the restarts\nPartially offset by:\n•\nHigher average realized price of $578/ton driven by a higher average LME (on a 15-day lag) and regional premiums\n•\nIncrease in value add product sales\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA decreased $387 primarily as a result of:\n•\nUnfavorable raw material costs, primarily on higher market prices for carbon and average alumina input costs\n•\nHigher costs primarily associated with higher transportation costs, increased maintenance costs, and higher labor expenses\n•\nLower pricing at the Brazil hydro-electric facilities"

The unsold portion of the specified receivable pool is\npledged as collateral to the purchasing bank to secure the sold receivables. Alcoa Corporation will guarantee the performance\nobligations of the wholly-owned subsidiary under the facility; however no assets (other than the receivables) will be pledged as\ncollateral.\nManagement believes that the Company’s cash on hand, future operating cash flows, and liquidity options, combined with its strategic\nactions, are adequate to fund its short term and long term operating and investing needs for at least twelve months and the foreseeable\nfuture thereafter. Further, the Company has flexibility related to its use of cash; the Company has no significant debt maturities until\n2027 and no significant cash contribution requirements related to its U.S. pension plan obligations for the foreseeable future (refer to\nMaterial Cash Requirements, below, for more information).\nAlthough management believes that Alcoa’s future cash from operations and other liquidity options will provide adequate resources to\nfund operating and investing needs, the Company’s access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will\nbe affected by many factors, including: (i) Alcoa Corporation’s credit rating; (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets; (iii) the\ncurrent state of the economy and commodity markets, and (iv) short- and long-term debt ratings. There can be no assurances that the\nCompany will continue to have access to capital markets on terms acceptable to Alcoa Corporation.\nChanges in market conditions caused by global or macroeconomic events, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine,\nhigh inflation, and changing global monetary policies could have adverse effects on Alcoa’s ability to obtain additional financing and\ncost of borrowing. Inability to generate sufficient earnings could impact the Company’s ability to meet the financial covenants in our\noutstanding debt and revolving credit facility agreements and limit our ability to access these sources of liquidity or refinance or\nrenegotiate our outstanding debt or credit agreements on terms acceptable to the Company. Additionally, the impact on market\nconditions from such events could adversely affect the liquidity of Alcoa’s customers, suppliers, and joint venture partners and equity\nmethod investments, which could negatively impact the collectability of outstanding receivables and our cash flows.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were $1,363, of which $1,280 was held outside the United States.\nAlcoa Corporation has a number of commitments and obligations related to the Company’s operations in various foreign jurisdictions,\nresulting in the need for cash outside the United States.

Notable changes to the sources and (uses) of cash\ninclude:\n•\n($964) lower net income generation, excluding the impacts from restructuring charges, primarily due to higher raw materials,\nenergy and production costs, partially offset by higher aluminum and alumina pricing;\n•\n($372) in income taxes paid on prior year earnings, as well as on higher current year earnings in jurisdictions where the\nCompany pays taxes;\n•\n$282 in certain working capital accounts, primarily a lower increase in receivables relating to higher aluminum and alumina\nprices than in 2021, a lower increase in inventories on higher raw material volumes in 2021, and a lower increase in accounts\npayable as raw material and energy costs increased less than in 2021; and,\n•\n$562 in lower pension contributions to the Company’s defined benefit pension plans.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, AofA paid approximately $74 (A$107) to the ATO related to the tax dispute described in Note S to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Upon payment, AofA recorded a noncurrent prepaid tax asset,\nas the Company continues to believe it is more likely than not that AofA’s tax position will be sustained and therefore is not\nrecognizing any tax expense in relation to this matter. In accordance with Australian tax laws, the initial interest assessment and\nadditional interest are deductible against AofA’s taxable income resulting in approximately $169 (A$219) in 2020, $14 (A$19) in\n2021, and $15 (A$22) in 2022 in lower cash tax payments. If AofA is ultimately successful, the interest deduction would become\ntaxable as income in the year the dispute is resolved. In addition, should the ATO decide in the interim to reduce any interest already\nassessed, the reduction would be taxable as income at that point in time. During 2022, AofA continued to record its tax provision and\ntax liability without effect of the ATO assessment, since it expects to prevail. The tax payable will remain on AofA’s balance sheet as\na noncurrent liability, increased by the tax effect of subsequent periods’ interest deductions, until dispute resolution, which is expected\nto take several years. At December 31, 2022, the noncurrent liability resulting from the cumulative interest deductions was\napproximately $174 (A$260).\nFinancing Activities\nCash used for financing activities was $768 in 2022 compared with $1,158 in 2021.\nThe use of cash in 2022 was primarily $165 of net cash paid to Alumina Limited (see Noncontrolling interest in Results of Operations\nabove), $500 for the repurchase of common stock, and $72 of dividends paid."

The uses of cash were partially offset by the issuance of $500 aggregate principal amount 2029 Notes by ANHBV in March\n2021 with net proceeds of approximately $493.\nCredit Facilities. On June 27, 2022, Alcoa Corporation and ANHBV, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alcoa Corporation and the\nborrower, entered into an amendment and restatement agreement (the Third Amendment and Restatement) (as amended and restated,\nthe Revolving Credit Facility) that provides additional flexibility to the Company and ANHBV by (i) extending the maturity date of\nthe Revolving Credit Facility from November 2023 to June 2027, (ii) reducing the aggregate commitments under the facility from\n$1,500 to $1,250, (iii) releasing the collateral package that had previously secured the Revolving Credit Facility, which will continue\nso long as certain credit ratings are maintained, (iv) increasing the maximum leverage ratio from 2.75 to 1.00 to 3.25 to 1.00, which\nincreases following material acquisitions for four consecutive fiscal quarters following an acquisition, (v) providing a debt to\ncapitalization ratio not to exceed .60 to 1.00 to replace the maximum leverage ratio upon a ratings upgrade to investment grade by\nMoody’s or S&P, and (vi) providing flexibility for dividends and other restricted payments, to make investments, and to incur\nadditional indebtedness. The Revolving Credit Facility implements a sustainability adjustment to the applicable margin and\ncommitment fee that may result in a positive or negative adjustment based on two of the Company’s existing sustainability metrics.\nIf Alcoa Corporation or ANHBV, as applicable, fails to have a rating of at least Ba1 from Moody’s and BB+ from S&P, then the\nCompany would be required to execute all security documents to re-secure collateral under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants. There were no borrowings outstanding at December\n31, 2022 and 2021, and no amounts were borrowed during 2022 and 2021 under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Company may draw on the facility periodically to ensure working capital needs are met. See Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in\nNote M to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Revolving Credit Facility.\nGuarantees of Third Parties. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no outstanding potential future payments for\nguarantees issued on behalf of a third-party.\nBank Guarantees and Letters of Credit. Alcoa Corporation has outstanding bank guarantees and letters of credit related to, among\nothers, energy contracts, environmental obligations, legal and tax matters, leasing obligations, workers compensation, and customs\nduties. The total amount committed under these instruments, which automatically renew or expire at various dates between 2023 and\n2024, was $293 (includes $131 issued under a standby letter of credit agreement —see below) at December 31, 2022. Additionally,\nParentCo has outstanding bank guarantees and letters of credit related to the Company of $14 at December 31, 2022. In the event\nParentCo would be required to perform under any of these instruments, ParentCo would be indemnified by Alcoa Corporation in\naccordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Likewise, the Company has outstanding bank guarantees and letters of\ncredit related to ParentCo of $8 at December 31, 2022. In the event Alcoa Corporation would be required to perform under any of\nthese instruments, the Company would be indemnified by ParentCo in accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement.\nIn August 2017, Alcoa Corporation entered into a standby letter of credit agreement, which expires on June 27, 2024 (extended in\nAugust 2018, May 2019, May 2021, and June 2022), with three financial institutions. The agreement provides for a $200 facility used\nby the Company for matters in the ordinary course of business. Alcoa Corporation’s obligations under this facility are secured in the\nsame manner as obligations under the Company’s revolving credit facility. Additionally, this facility contains similar representations\nand warranties and affirmative, negative, and financial covenants as the Company’s revolving credit facility. See Part II Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K in Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Company’s debt. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, letters of credit aggregating $131 were issued under this facility.\nSurety Bonds. Alcoa Corporation has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters, contract performance, workers\ncompensation, environmental-related matters, and customs duties. The total amount committed under these bonds, which\nautomatically renew or expire at various dates between 2023 and 2027, was $174 at December 31, 2022. Additionally, ParentCo has\noutstanding surety bonds related to the Company of $11 at December 31, 2022. In the event ParentCo would be required to perform\nunder any of these instruments, ParentCo would be indemnified by Alcoa Corporation in accordance with the Separation and\nDistribution Agreement. Likewise, the Company has outstanding surety bonds related to ParentCo of $3 at December 31, 2022.

See Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional information related to the Company’s debt.\nDecember 31,\n2022\n2021\n5.500% Notes, due 2027\n750\n$\n750\n6.125% Notes, due 2028\n500\n500\n4.125% Notes, due 2029\n500\n500\nOther\n84\n5\nUnamortized discounts and deferred financing costs\n(27)\n(28)\nTotal\n1,807\n1,727\nLess: amount due within one year\n1\n1\nLong-term debt, less amount due within one year\n$\n1,806\n$\n1,726\nRatings. Alcoa Corporation’s cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions\nbut also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to Alcoa Corporation’s debt by the major credit rating agencies.\nOn July 26, 2022, Moody’s upgraded the rating of ANHBV’s senior unsecured notes to Baa3 (investment grade) from Ba1 and set the\ncurrent outlook to stable.\nDividend. In each quarter of 2022, the Board of Directors declared and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share of the\nCompany’s common stock, totaling $72 for the year.\nThe details of any future cash dividend declaration, including the amount of such dividend and the timing and establishment of the\nrecord and payment dates, will be determined by the Board of Directors. The decision of whether to pay future cash dividends and the\namount of any such dividends will be based on the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash flows, capital\nrequirements, business conditions, the requirements of applicable law, and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem\nrelevant.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program.\nIn October 2021, Alcoa Corporation’s Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase program under which the Company\nmay purchase shares of its outstanding common stock up to an aggregate transactional value of $500, depending on cash availability,\nmarket conditions, and other factors.\nOn July 20, 2022, Alcoa Corporation announced that its Board of Directors approved an additional common stock repurchase program\nunder which the Company may purchase shares of its outstanding common stock up to an aggregate transactional value of $500,\ndepending on the Company’s continuing analysis of market, financial, and other factors (the New Repurchase Program). Prior to this\nauthorization, $150 remained available for share repurchases at the end of the second quarter of 2022 from a prior authorization in\nOctober 2021 of $500 which was fully exhausted in 2022 with the Company’s repurchase activity (see below).\nIn 2022, the Company repurchased 8,565,200 shares of its common stock for $500, under the previously authorized program; the\nshares were immediately retired. As of the date of this report, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase up to a total of $500,\nin the aggregate, of its outstanding shares of common stock under the New Repurchase Program. Repurchases under this program may\nbe made using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or pursuant to a\nRule 10b5-1 plan. This program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a predetermined expiration date.\nAlcoa Corporation intends to retire repurchased shares of common stock.\nIn 2021, the Company repurchased 3,184,300 shares of its common stock for $150; the shares were immediately retired.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used for investing activities was $495 in 2022 compared with cash provided from investing activities of $565 in 2021.\nIn 2022, the use of cash was primarily attributable to $480 of capital expenditures and $32 of cash contributions to the ELYSIS joint\nventure, partially offset by the sale of the Company’s interest in the MRN mine of $10.\nIn 2021, the source of cash was primarily attributable to proceeds from the sale of assets of $966, primarily the Warrick Rolling Mill,\nRockdale, and Eastalco site sales, partially offset by $390 in capital expenditures.\nIn 2023, Alcoa expects capital expenditures of approximately $600 related to sustaining capital projects and growth projects. The\ntiming and amount of capital expenditures may fluctuate as a result of the Company’s normal operations."

      "text": "61\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nAs discussed above, the Company relies primarily on operating cash flows to fund its cash commitments and management believes its\noperating cash flows, cash on hand, and liquidity options will be adequate to fund its cash needs for at least 12 months and the\nforeseeable future thereafter. We have committed cash outflows related to pension and postretirement benefit obligations and\noperating lease agreements. See Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Notes O and T, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for additional information. As of December 31, 2022, a summary of Alcoa Corporation’s outstanding material cash\nrequirements are as follows:\nTotal\n2023\n2024-2025\n2026-2027\nThereafter\nOperating activities:\nEnergy-related purchase obligations\n$\n13,911\n$\n1,563\n$\n2,400\n$\n2,241\n$\n7,707\nRaw material purchase obligations\n8,639\n2,516\n1,872\n943\n3,308\nOther purchase obligations\n794\n382\n186\n133\n93\nInterest related to debt\n513\n97\n185\n185\n46\nFinancing activities:\nLong-term debt\n1,834\n1\n81\n751\n1,001\nTotals\n$\n25,691\n$\n4,559\n$\n4,724\n$\n4,253\n$\n12,155\nPurchase obligations—Energy-related purchase obligations consist primarily of electricity and natural gas contracts with expiration\ndates ranging from 1 year to 25 years. Raw material obligations consist mostly of bauxite (relates to AWAC’s bauxite mine interests\nin Guinea and Brazil), caustic soda, lime, alumina, aluminum fluoride, calcined petroleum coke, anodes and cathode blocks with\nexpiration dates ranging from less than 1 year to 13 years. Other purchase obligations consist principally of freight for bauxite and\nalumina with expiration dates ranging from 1 to 10 years. Many of these purchase obligations contain variable pricing components,\nand, as a result, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. In accordance with the terms of\nseveral of these supply contracts, obligations may be reduced as a result of an interruption to operations, such as a plant curtailment or\na force majeure event.\nInterest related to total debt—Interest is based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2022 and is calculated on debt with\nmaturities that extend to 2029.\nLong-term debt—Total debt amounts in the preceding table represent the principal amounts of all outstanding long-term debt, which\nhave maturities that extend to 2029.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain\nestimates based on judgments and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements and disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Areas that require such estimates include the review\nof properties, plants, and equipment and goodwill for impairment, and accounting for each of the following: asset retirement and\nenvironmental obligations; litigation matters; pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations; derivatives and hedging\nactivities; and income taxes.\nManagement uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates; actual results may differ from those\nused to prepare the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management\nbelieves that the amounts recorded in the financial statements related to these items are based on its best estimates and judgments\nusing all relevant information available at the time.\nA summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note B to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nProperties, Plants, and Equipment. Properties, plants, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable, including in the period when\nassets have met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. The model used to determine recoverability of an asset or asset group\nwould leverage the model that management uses for planning and strategic review of the entire business, including related inputs and\nassumptions. Management’s impairment assessment process is described in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note B to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nmore information regarding properties, plants, and equipment.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or\nif a decision is made to sell or exit a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of\nimpairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others, deterioration in general economic conditions, negative\ndevelopments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that\nhave a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods. The fair value\nthat could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate goodwill for impairment."

      "text": "62\nUnder the qualitative impairment test, management considers a number of factors in its assessment, such as: general economic\nconditions, equity and credit markets, industry and market conditions, and earnings and cash flow trends.\nUnder the quantitative impairment test, management uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate the current fair value of its\nreporting units. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast\noperating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, production costs, production capability, tax rates,\ncapital spending, discount rate, and working capital changes. The model used for the goodwill impairment test leverages the model,\nincluding related inputs and assumptions, that management uses for planning and strategic review of the entire business.\nManagement will test goodwill on a qualitative or quantitative basis. Refer to Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note B to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding management’s impairment assessment process.\nManagement performed a quantitative assessment for the Bauxite and Alumina reporting units in 2022. As a result of the assessments,\nthe estimated fair values of the Bauxite and Alumina reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values, resulting in\nno impairment. The impact on the estimated fair values of an increase in the discount rate of 1% would not result in a change in the\nconclusions reached, the estimated fair values would remain in excess of carrying values.\nFurther, in all years presented, there have been no triggering events that necessitated an impairment test for either the Bauxite or\nAlumina reporting units. Refer to Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note L to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more\ninformation regarding goodwill.\nAsset Retirement and Environmental Obligations. Estimates are used to record environmental remediation and asset retirement\nobligation (ARO) reserves based on the best available information at the time of recognition. Several assumptions are used to estimate\nthe costs required to demolish, environmentally remediate, or reclaim the site, including:\n•\nEngineering estimates and benchmarks to other similar projects;\n•\nMining area to be reclaimed and estimated restoration costs;\n•\nVolume of regulated materials to be removed (asbestos, PCB fluids, spent potlining);\n•\nDisposition of materials;\n•\nExtent of contamination based on available data;\n•\nScope of remediation to mitigate human health or environmental risks and/or to meet likely regulatory requirements; and,\n•\nCommercial availability and pricing for off-site treatment or disposal applications.\nAs the site is demolished, remediated, or reclaimed, the assumptions and estimates used to record the reserve may change to account\nfor:\n•\nActual site conditions that require more or less remediation or reclamation;\n•\nLegislation that becomes more or less stringent;\n•\nRegulative authorities requiring updates to final design prior to completion;\n•\nAlternative disposal methods for waste;\n•\nTechnological changes which allow remediation to be more efficient;\n•\nMarket factors; and,\n•\nVariances in work that is atypical from prior work experience.\nChanges to the estimates may result in material changes to the reserve that may require an increase to or a reversal of a previously\nrecorded reserve. Historically, the Company has not had material changes in established reserves. Refer to Part II Item 8 of this Form\n10-K in Note R and Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding current reserves.\nLitigation Matters. For asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed\nto be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many\nfactors such as, among others, the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions\nof legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters. Once\nan unfavorable outcome is deemed probable, management weighs the probability of estimated losses, and the most reasonable loss\nestimate is recorded. If an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible, then the matter is disclosed, and no\nliability is recorded. With respect to unasserted claims or assessments, management must first determine that the probability that an\nassertion will be made is likely, then, a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably\nestimate the potential loss is made. Legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in\nmanagement’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss. Refer to Part II Item 8\nof this Form 10-K in Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding management’s litigation matters\npolicy."

      "text": "63\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits. Liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined\nusing actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated\nliability, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary\nincreases, health care cost trend rates, retirement age, and mortality).\nThe yield curve model used to develop the discount rate parallels the plans’ projected cash flows and has a weighted average duration\nof 11 years. The underlying cash flows of the high-quality corporate bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to\nsatisfy the Company’s plan obligations multiple times. If a deep market of high-quality corporate bonds does not exist in a country,\nthen the yield on government bonds plus a corporate bond yield spread is used. The impact on the combined pension and other\npostretirement liabilities of a change in the weighted average discount rate of ¼ of 1% would be approximately $75 and either a\ncharge or credit of approximately $1 to pretax earnings in the following year.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets (a four-year\naverage or the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non-U.S. plans). The process used by management to\ndevelop this assumption is one that relies on forward-looking investment returns by asset class. Management incorporates expected\nfuture investment returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and\nconsultants, as well as management’s own judgment. A change in the assumption for the weighted average expected long-term rate of\nreturn on plan assets of ¼ of 1% would impact pretax earnings by approximately $7 for 2023.\nMortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables and future improvement scales published by third parties, such as the Society\nof Actuaries, and consider other available information including historical data as well as studies and publications from reputable\nsources.\nRefer to Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding pension\nand other postretirement benefits including accounting impacts of current year actions.\nDerivatives and Hedging. To calculate the fair value of certain derivatives, management uses discounted cash flow (DCF) and other\nsimulation models that consider the following inputs and assumptions: quoted market prices (e.g., aluminum prices on the 10-year\nLondon Metal Exchange (LME) forward curve and energy prices), information concerning time premiums and volatilities for certain\noption type embedded derivatives and regional premiums for aluminum contracts, aluminum and energy prices beyond those quoted in\nthe market, and the estimated credit spread between Alcoa and the counterparty. The quoted market prices used in the valuation\nmodels are dependent on market fundamentals, the relationship between supply and demand at any point in time, seasonal conditions,\ninventories, and interest rates. For periods beyond the term of quoted market prices, management estimates the price of aluminum by\nextrapolating the 10-year LME forward curve and estimates the Midwest premium based on recent transactions.\nChanges in estimates can have a material impact on the derivative valuations. Refer to Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note P to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding derivatives and hedging and related activity during the period.\nIncome Taxes. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that\na tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management applies judgment in assessing all\navailable positive and negative evidence and considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in\ncarryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning\nstrategies. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the\ncarryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Alcoa Corporation’s experience with similar operations. Existing\nfavorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence\nincludes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the\nutilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. In certain jurisdictions, deferred tax assets related to\ncumulative losses may exist without a valuation allowance where in management’s judgment the weight of the positive evidence more\nthan offsets the negative evidence of the cumulative losses. Upon changes in facts and circumstances, management may conclude that\ndeferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is currently recorded may not be realized, resulting in a future charge to establish\na valuation allowance. Financial information utilized in this analysis leverages the same financial information, including related inputs\nand assumptions, that management uses for planning and strategic review of the entire business.\nTax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a\nmore likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which\nmeans that the statute of limitations has expired, or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the\nstatute of limitations remains open.\nChanges in estimates can have a material impact on the deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions. Refer to Part II Item 8 of this Form\n10-K in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding income taxes and deferred tax assets and\nrelated activity during the period."

Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement conducted an assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2022 using the criteria in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company maintained\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company’s financial statements\nincluded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, has audited the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2022 and has issued an attestation report, which is included herein.\n/s/ Roy C.

      "text": "66\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Alcoa Corporation\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alcoa Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity and\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as\nthe “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\nthe Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in\nour opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the\naccompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well\nas evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting\nincluded obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included\nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable\nbasis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect\non the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."

The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole,\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nU.S. Pension Annuitizations\nAs described in Notes B and O to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had a projected benefit obligation related to its\ndefined pension plans of $2,518 million as of December 31, 2022, including $1,113 million of benefit obligations in the U.S. In the\nthird quarter of 2022, the Company purchased group annuity contracts to transfer the obligation to pay remaining retirement benefits\nof certain retirees and beneficiaries from its U.S. defined benefit pension plans and transferred approximately $1,000 million in both\nbenefit obligations and plan assets. As a result, the Company remeasured its U.S. defined benefit pension plans and recognized a $617\nmillion settlement loss. As disclosed by management, the remeasurement of its U.S. defined benefit pension plans was performed\nusing actuarial methodologies and incorporated significant assumptions, including the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return\non plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, retirement age, and mortality rate).\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the U.S. pension annuitizations is a critical\naudit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the valuation of the U.S. pension annuitizations, as well as\ntheir consideration of the accounting for the non-recurring nature of the U.S. pension annuitizations; (ii) a high degree of auditor\njudgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the accounting for the U.S.\npension annuitizations, participants transferred, and significant assumptions related to the discount rate, expected long-term rate of\nreturn on plan assets, and mortality rate used in determining the valuation of the U.S. pension annuitizations; and (iii) the audit effort\ninvolved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion\non the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s\naccounting for and valuation of the U.S. pension annuitizations, including controls over management’s methodology and significant\nassumptions. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for determining the valuation of the\nU.S. pension annuitizations; (ii) testing the participants transferred, the settlement loss recognized, and the completeness and accuracy\nof the underlying data used in the valuation of the U.S. pension annuitizations; and (iii) the involvement of professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge to assist in (a) evaluating the appropriateness of the actuarial methodology used by management; and\n(b) evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and mortality rate assumptions.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 23, 2023\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2015."

      "text": "73\nAlcoa Corporation and subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in millions, except per-share amounts; metric tons in thousands (kmt))\nA. Basis of Presentation\nAlcoa Corporation (or the Company) is a vertically integrated aluminum company comprised of bauxite mining, alumina refining,\naluminum production (smelting and casting), and energy generation. Through direct and indirect ownership, the Company has 27\noperating locations in nine countries around the world, situated primarily in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Spain, and the\nUnited States.\nAlcoa Corporation became an independent, publicly traded company on November 1, 2016, following its separation (the Separation\nTransaction) from its former parent company, Alcoa Inc. References herein to “ParentCo” refer to Alcoa Inc. and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries through October 31, 2016, at which time it was renamed Arconic Inc. (Arconic) and since has been subsequently renamed\nHowmet Aerospace Inc.\nBasis of Presentation. The Consolidated Financial Statements of Alcoa Corporation are prepared in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). In accordance with GAAP, certain situations require\nmanagement to make estimates based on judgments and assumptions, which may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities\nand the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. They also may affect the reported amounts\nof revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management uses historical experience and all available information to make\nthese estimates. Management regularly evaluates the judgments and assumptions used in its estimates, and results could differ from\nthose estimates upon future events and their effects or new information. Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements\nwere reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include the accounts of Alcoa Corporation and\ncompanies in which Alcoa Corporation has a controlling interest, including those that comprise the Alcoa World Alumina &\nChemicals (AWAC) joint venture (see below). Intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The equity method of accounting is\nused for investments in affiliates and other joint ventures over which the Company has significant influence but does not have\neffective control. Investments in affiliates in which Alcoa Corporation cannot exercise significant influence are accounted at cost less\nany impairment, a measurement alternative in accordance with GAAP.\nAWAC is an unincorporated global joint venture between Alcoa Corporation and Alumina Limited and consists of several affiliated\noperating entities, which own, have an interest in, or operate the bauxite mines and alumina refineries within the Company’s Bauxite\nand Alumina segments (except for the Poços de Caldas mine and refinery, portions of the São Luís refinery and investment in\nMineração Rio do Norte S.A. (MRN) until its sale in April 2022, all in Brazil) and a portion (55%) of the Portland smelter (Australia)\nwithin the Company’s Aluminum segment. Alcoa Corporation owns 60% and Alumina Limited owns 40% of these individual entities,\nwhich are consolidated by the Company for financial reporting purposes and include Alcoa of Australia Limited (AofA), Alcoa World\nAlumina LLC (AWA), Alcoa World Alumina Brasil Ltda. (AWAB), and Alúmina Española, S.A. (Española). Alumina Limited’s\ninterest in the equity of such entities is reflected as Noncontrolling interest on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nManagement evaluates whether an Alcoa Corporation entity or interest is a variable interest entity and whether the Company is the\nprimary beneficiary. Consolidation is required if both of these criteria are met. Alcoa Corporation does not have any variable interest\nentities requiring consolidation.\nRelated Party Transactions. Alcoa Corporation buys products from and sells products to various related companies, consisting of\nentities in which the Company retains a 50% or less equity interest, at negotiated prices between the two parties. These transactions\nwere not material to the financial position or results of operations of Alcoa Corporation for all periods presented.\nB. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nCash Equivalents. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.\nRestricted Cash. Restricted cash is included with Cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the Cash and cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash at beginning of year and Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of year on the accompanying Statement\nof Consolidated Cash Flows. Current restricted cash amounts are reported in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the\naccompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Noncurrent restricted cash amounts are reported in Other noncurrent assets on the\naccompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet (see Note U for a reconciliation of Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash).\nInventory Valuation. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with the cost of inventories principally\ndetermined under the average cost method."

Interest related to the construction of\nqualifying assets is capitalized as part of the construction costs. Depreciation is recorded principally on the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation is recorded on temporarily idled facilities until such time management approves a\npermanent closure.

Gains or losses from the sale of assets are generally recorded in Other (income) expenses,\nnet.\nProperties, plants, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated\nundiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. An impairment loss would\nbe recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the fair value. The amount of the impairment loss to be\nrecorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined\nusing the best information available, which generally is a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The determination of what constitutes\nan asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant\njudgments.\nLeases. The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at the inception of the arrangement based on the terms and\nconditions in the contract. A contract contains a lease if there is an identified asset which the Company has the right to control. Lease\nright-of-use (ROU) assets are included in Properties, plants, and equipment with the corresponding operating lease liabilities included\nwithin Other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits.\nOperating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease\npayments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date in determining the present\nvalue of lease payments unless a rate is implicit in the lease. Lease terms include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably\ncertain that those options will be exercised. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, including anticipated renewals, are not\nrecorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe Company made a policy election not to record any non-lease components of a lease agreement in the lease liability. Variable lease\npayments are not presented as part of the ROU asset or liability recorded at the inception of a contract. Lease expense for operating\nlease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nEquity Investments. Alcoa invests in a number of privately-held companies, primarily through joint ventures and consortia, which\nare accounted for using the equity method. The equity method is applied in situations where the Company has the ability to exercise\nsignificant influence, but not control, over the investee. Management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain\nindicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable.\nDeferred Mining Costs. Alcoa incurs deferred mining costs during the development stage of a mine life cycle. Such costs include the\nconstruction of access and haul roads, detailed drilling and geological analysis to further define the grade and quality of the known\nbauxite, and overburden removal costs. These costs relate to sections of the related mines where the Company is currently extracting\nbauxite or preparing for production in the near term. These sections are outlined and planned incrementally and generally are mined\nover periods ranging from one to five years, depending on specific mine plans. The amount of geological drilling and testing necessary\nto determine the economic viability of the bauxite deposit being mined is such that the reserves are considered to be proven. Deferred\nmining costs are amortized on a units-of-production basis and included in Other noncurrent assets on the accompanying Consolidated\nBalance Sheet.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or\nmore frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or exit a business.\nGoodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one\nlevel below an operating segment. The Company has four reporting units, of which two are included in the Aluminum segment\n(smelting/casting and energy generation). The remaining two reporting units are the Bauxite and Alumina segments. Of these four\nreporting units, only Bauxite and Alumina contain goodwill (see Note L)."

      "text": "75\nGoodwill is tested for impairment by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (greater than 50%)\nthat the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or performing a quantitative assessment using a discounted cash\nflow model. If the qualitative assessment indicates a possible impairment, then a quantitative impairment test is performed to\ndetermine the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow method. Otherwise, no further analysis is required.\nUnder the quantitative assessment, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its\ncarrying value, including goodwill. In the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, an\nimpairment loss equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill\napplicable to that reporting unit would be recognized.\nAlcoa’s policy for its annual review of goodwill is to perform the quantitative impairment test for each of its two reporting units that\ncontain goodwill at least once during every three-year period.\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized generally on a straight-line basis over the periods benefited. The following table\ndetails the weighted average useful lives of software and other intangible assets by type of operation (numbers in years):\nSoftware\nOther intangible\nassets\nBauxite mining\n3\n—\nAlumina refining\n7\n25\nAluminum smelting and casting\n3\n40\nEnergy generation\n3\n29\nAsset Retirement Obligations. Alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations (AROs) related to legal obligations associated with the\nstandard operation of bauxite mines, alumina refineries, and aluminum smelters. These AROs consist primarily of costs associated\nwith mine reclamation, closure of bauxite residue areas, spent pot lining and regulated waste materials disposal, and landfill closure.\nAdditionally, costs are recorded as AROs upon management’s decision to permanently close and demolish certain structures and for\nany significant lease restoration obligations. The fair values of these AROs are recorded on a discounted basis at the time the\nobligation is incurred and accreted over time for the change in present value; related accretion is recorded as a component of Cost of\ngoods sold. Additionally, the Company capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived\nassets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life. Certain conditional asset retirement obligations related to alumina\nrefineries, aluminum smelters, and energy generation facilities have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements due to\nuncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date. The fair value of these asset retirement obligations will be recorded when a\nreasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made. Subsequent adjustments to estimates of previously established AROs\nfor current operations are capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets and depreciating these assets\nover their remaining useful life. Adjustments to estimates of AROs for closed locations are charged to Restructuring and other\ncharges, net on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations (see Note R).\nEnvironmental Matters. Environmental related expenditures for current operations are expensed as a component of Cost of goods\nsold or capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, generally for closed\nlocations which will not contribute to future revenues, are charged to Restructuring and other charges, net. Liabilities are recorded\nwhen remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In instances where the Company has ongoing monitoring and\nmaintenance responsibilities, it is Alcoa’s policy to maintain a reserve equal to five years of expected costs. The liability is\ncontinuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress, rate and pricing changes, actual volumes of material\nrequiring management, changes to the original assumptions regarding how the site was to be remediated, and other factors that may be\nrelevant, including changes in technology or regulations. The estimates may also include costs related to other potentially responsible\nparties to the extent that Alcoa has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share.\nLitigation Matters. For asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed\nto be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. With respect to unasserted claims or assessments, liabilities are recorded when the\nprobability that an assertion will be made is likely, an unfavorable outcome of the matter is deemed to be probable, and the loss is\nreasonably estimable. Legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s\njudgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss. Legal costs, which are primarily for\ngeneral litigation, environmental compliance, tax disputes, and general corporate matters, are expensed as incurred.\nRevenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation(s) in accordance with the\nprovisions of a customer order or contract. This is achieved when control of the product has been transferred to the customer, which is\ngenerally determined when title, ownership, and risk of loss pass to the customer, all of which occurs upon shipment or delivery of the\nproduct. The shipping terms vary across all businesses and depend on the product, the country of origin, and the type of transportation.\nAccordingly, the sale of Alcoa’s products to its customers represent single performance obligations for which revenue is recognized at\na point in time, except for the Company’s Energy product division in which the customer simultaneously receives and consumes\nelectricity (see Note E). Revenue is based on the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for its products. Returns\nand other adjustments have not been material. Based on the foregoing, no significant judgment is required to determine when control\nof a product has been transferred to a customer."

      "text": "76\nThe Company considers shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill the promise to transfer the related products. As a result,\ncustomer payments of shipping and handling costs are recorded as a component of revenue. Taxes collected (e.g., sales, use, value\nadded, excise) from its customers related to the sale of its products are remitted to governmental authorities and excluded from Sales.\nCost of goods sold. The Company includes the following in Cost of goods sold: operating costs of our three segments, excluding\ndepreciation, depletion, and amortization, but including all production related costs: raw materials consumed; purchases of metal for\nconsumption or trade; conversion costs, such as labor, materials, and utilities; equity earnings of certain investments integral to the\nCompany’s supply chain; and plant administrative expenses. Also included in Cost of goods sold are: costs related to the\nTransformation function, which focuses on the management of expenses and obligations of previously closed operations; pension and\nother postretirement benefit service cost for employees maintaining closed locations; and other costs not included in the operating\ncosts of the segments.\nSelling, general administrative, and other expenses. The Company includes the costs of corporate-wide functional support in\nSelling, general administrative, and other expenses. Such costs include: executive; sales; marketing; strategy; operations\nadministration; finance; information technology; legal; human resources; and government affairs and communications.\nStock-Based Compensation. Compensation expense for employee equity grants is recognized using the non-substantive vesting\nperiod approach, in which the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value.\nForfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The fair value of performance stock units containing a market condition is valued using a\nMonte Carlo valuation model. There were no stock options granted in 2022 or 2021. In 2020, the fair value of stock options was\nestimated on the date of grant using a lattice pricing model. Determining the fair value at the grant date requires judgment, including\nestimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, annual forfeiture rate, and exercise behavior. These\nassumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time.\nRefer to Note N for more information regarding stock-based compensation.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits. Alcoa sponsors several defined benefit pension plans and health care postretirement\nbenefit plans. The Company recognizes on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these pension and postretirement benefit plans\nas either an asset or a liability on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The net funded status represents the difference between the fair\nvalue of each plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the respective plan. The benefit obligation represents the present value of the\nestimated future benefits the Company currently expects to pay to plan participants based on past service. Unrecognized gains and\nlosses related to the plans are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheet until amortized\ninto net income.\nThe plan assets and benefit obligations are measured at the end of each year or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events\nsuch as a significant plan amendment, settlement, or curtailment. For interim plan remeasurements, it is the Company’s policy to\nrecord the related accounting impacts within the same quarter as the triggering event.\nLiabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate\nsignificant assumptions, including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the expected long-term rate of return\non plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, health care cost trend rates, retirement\nage, and mortality).\nThe yield curve model used to develop the discount rate parallels the plans’ projected cash flows and has a weighted average duration\nof 11 years. The underlying cash flows of the high-quality corporate bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to\nsatisfy the Company’s plan obligations multiple times. If a deep market of high-quality corporate bonds does not exist in a country,\nthen the yield on government bonds plus a corporate bond yield spread is used.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets (a four-year\naverage or the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non-U.S. plans). The process used by management to\ndevelop this assumption is one that relies on forward-looking investment returns by asset class. Management incorporates expected\nfuture investment returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and\nconsultants, as well as management’s own judgment.\nMortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables and future improvement scales published by third parties, such as the Society\nof Actuaries, and consider other available information including historical data as well as studies and publications from reputable\nsources.\nA change in one or a combination of these assumptions, or the effects of actual results differing from assumptions, could have a\nmaterial impact on Alcoa’s projected benefit obligation. These changes or differences are recorded in Accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss and are amortized into net income as a component of the net periodic benefit cost (income) over the average\nfuture working lifetime or average remaining life expectancy, as appropriate, of the plan’s participants."

Derivatives are held for purposes other than trading and are part of a formally documented risk\nmanagement program.\nAlcoa accounts for hedges of firm customer commitments for aluminum as fair value hedges. The fair values of the derivatives and\nchanges in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are reported as assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nChanges in the fair values of these derivatives and underlying hedged items generally offset and are recorded each period in Sales,\nconsistent with the underlying hedged item.\nThe Company accounts for hedges of foreign currency exposures and certain forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges. The fair\nvalues of the derivatives are recorded as assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The changes in the fair values of\nthese derivatives are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to Sales, Cost of goods sold, or Other\n(income) expenses, net in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged items or in the period that the transaction no longer\nqualifies as a cash flow hedge. These contracts cover the same periods as known or expected exposures, generally not exceeding five\nyears.\nIf no hedging relationship is designated, the derivative is marked to market through Other (income) expenses, net.\nCash flows from derivatives are recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in a manner consistent with the underlying\ntransactions.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.\nUnder this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) for the current\nyear plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, result from differences between the financial and tax bases of\nAlcoa’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted.\nValuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that a tax benefit\nwill not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management applies judgement in assessing all available\npositive and negative evidence and considers all potential sources of taxable income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation\nallowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a\nvaluation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it\nis determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation\nallowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to\nlaw changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays.\nTax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a\nmore likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which\nmeans that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the\nstatute of limitations remains open. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for\nincome taxes and are accrued in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time\nthat the related tax benefits are recognized.\nForeign Currency. The local currency is the functional currency for Alcoa’s significant operations outside the United States, except\nfor certain operations in Canada and Iceland, and a holding and trading company in the Netherlands, where the U.S. dollar is used as\nthe functional currency. The determination of the functional currency for Alcoa’s operations is made based on the appropriate\neconomic and management indicators. Where local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S.\ndollars using year-end exchange rates and income and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates for the reporting\nperiod. Unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance. In March 2020 and January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04 and ASU No. 2021-\n01, respectively. Together, the ASUs provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the U.S. GAAP guidance on contract\nmodifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London\nInterbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The Company adopted this guidance\nin 2022, and there was no material impact on the Company's financial statements."

      "text": "80\nIn December 2021, the Company announced the two-year curtailment of 228 kmt of smelting capacity at the San Ciprián (Spain)\naluminum smelter. The temporary curtailment, which began at the end of January 2022, was the result of an agreement reached with\nthe workers at the site to suspend production due to exorbitant energy prices in Spain. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company\nis responsible for certain employee and contractual obligations during the curtailment period. As a result, the Company recorded\ncharges of $62 in the fourth quarter of 2021 in Restructuring and other charges, net on the Statement of Consolidated Operations to\nestablish the related reserve. In 2022, cash payments of $26 were made to reduce the reserve. Additionally, in connection with the\nagreement, the Company committed to restart the smelter beginning in January of 2024 and has restricted cash of $103 to be made\navailable in the future to cover $68 in capital improvements at the site and $35 in smelter restart costs. Restricted cash is included in\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets and Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (see Note U). The San\nCiprián smelter continues to incur operating costs for the casthouse as well as resources to maintain and improve the smelter for\nrestart.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, as part of the Company’s ongoing strategic portfolio review, the Company announced the\npermanent closure of the Wenatchee (Washington) aluminum smelter. The smelter has been fully curtailed since 2015. Charges\nrelated to the closure totaled $90 in the fourth quarter of 2021 and included a charge of $10 for the write down of remaining\ninventories to net realizable value recorded in Cost of goods sold on the Statement of Consolidated Operations and a charge of\n$80 recorded in Restructuring and other charges, net on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The restructuring charges were\ncomprised of: $30 to write-off the remaining net book value of various assets; $23 of asset impairments; $21 to establish reserves\nrelated to environmental and demolition obligations; $5 related to take-or-pay contractual obligations; and $1 of severance and\nemployee termination costs from the separation of approximately 10 employees. Cash outlays related to demolition and environmental\nrelated activities are expected to be spread over approximately 5 years.\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, as part of the Company’s ongoing strategic portfolio review, the Company announced the decision to\npermanently close the previously curtailed anode facility in Lake Charles (Louisiana). The anode facility within the Lake Charles site\nhas been fully curtailed since 2015. The Company recorded charges of $27 in the third quarter of 2021, which were recorded in\nRestructuring and other charges, net on the Statement of Consolidated Operations, comprised of asset impairments of $22 and cash-\nbased charges for closure and asset retirement obligations of $5. The closure was completed in September 2022. The decision to\npermanently close the facility was made as part of the Company’s on-going portfolio review. The Company’s petroleum coke calciner\nlocated at the same site in Lake Charles remains in operation, unaffected by the closure of the anode facility.\n2020 Actions. In 2020, Alcoa Corporation recorded Restructuring and other charges, net, of $104 which were comprised of the\nfollowing components: $59 related to settlements and curtailments of certain pension and other postretirement benefits (see Note O);\n$28 (net) for costs related to the curtailment of the Intalco (Washington) smelter; $20 for additional contract costs related to the then\ncurtailed Wenatchee (Washington) smelter; and several other insignificant items.\nIn April 2020, as part of the Company’s portfolio review, Alcoa Corporation announced the curtailment of the remaining 230 kmt of\nuncompetitive smelting capacity at the Intalco (Washington) smelter amid declining market conditions. The full curtailment, which\nincluded 49 kmt of earlier-curtailed capacity, was completed during the third quarter of 2020. The $28 net restructuring charge\nrecorded during 2020 was comprised of $13 for severance and employee termination costs from the separation of approximately 685\nemployees, $16 for contract termination costs, and a net curtailment gain of $1 related to the U.S. hourly defined benefit pension and\nretiree life plans (see Note O). Additional contract termination costs related to take-or-pay agreements may recur during the\ncurtailment period.\nAlcoa Corporation does not include Restructuring and other charges, net in the results of its reportable segments.

Segment and Related Information\nSegment Information\nAlcoa Corporation is a producer of bauxite, alumina, and aluminum products. The Company has three operating and reportable\nsegments, which are organized by product on a global basis: Bauxite, Alumina, and Aluminum. Segment performance under Alcoa\nCorporation’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance\nis the Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of each segment. The Company calculates\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA as Total sales (third-party and intersegment) minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling,\ngeneral administrative, and other expenses; and Research and development expenses. Alcoa Corporation’s Adjusted EBITDA may not\nbe comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The chief operating decision maker function regularly reviews the\nfinancial information, including Sales and Adjusted EBITDA, of these three operating segments to assess performance and allocate\nresources. Beginning in January 2023, the Company changed its operating segments by combining the Bauxite and Alumina segments,\nand will report its financial results in the following two segments: (i) Alumina, and (ii) Aluminum (see Note V).\nSegment assets include, among others, customer receivables (third-party and intersegment), inventories, properties, plants, and\nequipment, and equity investments. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies (see Note B). Transactions among segments are established based on negotiation among the parties.\nDifferences between segment totals and Alcoa Corporation’s consolidated totals for line items not reconciled are in Corporate.\nThe following are detailed descriptions of Alcoa Corporation’s reportable segments:\nBauxite. This segment represents the Company’s global bauxite mining operations. A portion of this segment’s production represents\nthe offtake from equity method investments in Brazil (prior to the MRN sale in April 2022) and Guinea, as well as AWAC’s share of\nbauxite production related to an equity investment in Saudi Arabia. The bauxite mined by this segment is sold primarily to internal\ncustomers within the Alumina segment; a portion of the bauxite is sold to external customers. Bauxite mined by this segment and used\ninternally is transferred to the Alumina segment at negotiated terms that are intended to approximate market prices; sales to third-\nparties are conducted on a contract basis. Generally, this segment’s sales are transacted in U.S. dollars while costs and expenses are\ntransacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are the Australian dollar and the Brazilian real. Most of the\noperations that comprise the Bauxite segment are part of AWAC (see Principles of Consolidation in Note A)."

      "text": "82\nAlumina. This segment represents the Company’s worldwide refining system, which processes bauxite into alumina. The alumina\nproduced by this segment is sold primarily to internal and external aluminum smelter customers; a portion of the alumina is sold to\nexternal customers who process it into industrial chemical products. Approximately two-thirds of Alumina’s production is sold under\nsupply contracts to third parties worldwide, while the remainder is used internally by the Aluminum segment. Alumina produced by\nthis segment and used internally is transferred to the Aluminum segment at prevailing market prices. A portion of this segment’s third-\nparty sales are completed through the use of alumina traders. Generally, this segment’s sales are transacted in U.S. dollars while costs\nand expenses are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are the Australian dollar, the Brazilian real, and\nthe euro. Most of the operations that comprise the Alumina segment are part of AWAC (see Principles of Consolidation in Note A).\nThis segment also includes AWAC’s 25.1% ownership interest in a mining and refining joint venture company in Saudi Arabia (see\nNote H).\nAluminum. This segment consists of the Company’s (i) worldwide smelting and casthouse system, which processes alumina into\nprimary aluminum, and (ii) portfolio of energy assets in Brazil, Canada, and the United States.\nAluminum’s combined smelting and casting operations produce primary aluminum products, nearly all of which are sold to external\ncustomers and traders. The smelting operations produce molten primary aluminum, which is then formed by the casting operations\ninto either common alloy ingot (e.g., t-bar, sow, standard ingot) or into value-add ingot products (e.g., foundry, billet, rod, and slab). A\nvariety of external customers purchase the primary aluminum products for use in fabrication operations, which produce products\nprimarily for the transportation, building and construction, packaging, wire, and other industrial markets. Results from the sale of\naluminum powder and scrap are also included in this segment, as well as the impacts of embedded aluminum derivatives (see Note P)\nrelated to energy supply contracts.\nThe energy assets supply power to external customers in Brazil and the United States, as well as internal customers in the Aluminum\nsegment (Canadian smelters and Warrick (Indiana) smelter) and, to a lesser extent, the Alumina segment (Brazilian refineries).\nOn March 31, 2021, Alcoa completed the sale of its rolling mill located at Warrick Operations (Warrick Rolling Mill) an integrated\naluminum manufacturing site near Evansville, Indiana (Warrick Operations), to Kaiser Aluminum Corporation (Kaiser) (see Note C).\nResults from the Warrick Rolling Mill are included in this segment through the first quarter of 2021. Alcoa continues to own and\noperate the site’s aluminum smelter and the power plant. On July 1, 2022, Alcoa curtailed one of the three operating smelting potlines\n(54 kmt) at its Warrick Operations site due to operational challenges stemming from labor shortages in the region.\nGenerally, this segment’s aluminum sales are transacted in U.S. dollars while costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the\nlocal currency of the respective operations, which are the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Norwegian krone, the Icelandic króna, the\nCanadian dollar, the Brazilian real, and the Australian dollar.\nThis segment also includes Alcoa Corporation’s 25.1% ownership interest in a smelting joint venture company in Saudi Arabia (see\nNote H)."

This\nproduct can also be consumed for non-metallurgical purposes, such as industrial chemical products.\nPrimary aluminum—Primary aluminum is metal in the form of a common alloy ingot or a value-add ingot (e.g., foundry, billet, rod,\nand slab). These products are sold primarily to customers, that produce products for the transportation, building and construction,\npackaging, wire, and other industrial markets, and traders.\nEnergy—Energy is the generation of electricity, which is sold in the wholesale market to traders, large industrial consumers,\ndistribution companies, and other generation companies.\nFlat-rolled aluminum—Flat-rolled aluminum is metal in the form of sheet, which is sold primarily to customers that produce\nbeverage and food cans, including body, tab, and end stock. As noted above, the Company sold the Warrick Rolling Mill in the first\nquarter of 2021 which represented the Company’s only Flat-rolled aluminum asset. The results of the Warrick Rolling Mill are\nincluded in this product division through the first quarter of 2021."

The LME\npricing component represents the underlying base metal component, based on quoted prices for aluminum on the exchange. The\nregional premium represents the incremental price over the base LME component that is associated with the physical delivery of\nmetal to a particular region (e.g., the Midwest premium for metal sold in the United States). The product premium represents the\nincremental price for receiving physical metal in a particular shape or alloy.\n(3)\nCIF (cost, insurance, and freight) means that the Company pays for these items until the product reaches the buyer’s designated\ndestination point related to transportation by vessel. DAP (delivered at place) means the same as CIF related to all methods of\ntransportation. FOB (free on board) means that the Company pays for costs, insurance, and freight until the product reaches the\nseller’s designated shipping point.\n(4)\nThe net number of days means that the customer is required to remit payment to the Company for the invoice amount within the\ndesignated number of days. LC Sight is a letter of credit that is payable immediately (usually within five to ten business days)\nafter a seller meets the requirements of the letter of credit (i.e. shipping documents that evidence the seller performed its\nobligations as agreed to with a buyer). CAD (cash against documents) is a payment arrangement in which a seller instructs a\nbank to provide shipping and title documents to the buyer at the time the buyer pays in full the accompanying bill of exchange.\nFor the Company’s Energy product division, sales of electricity are based on current market prices.

The\nproject developed by the joint venture consists of a bauxite mine from the Al Ba’itha bauxite deposit in the northern part of Saudi\nArabia, an alumina refinery, a primary aluminum smelter, and an aluminum rolling mill.\nThe joint venture is owned 74.9% by Ma’aden and 25.1% by Alcoa Corporation and originally consisted of three separate companies\nas follows: the bauxite mine and alumina refinery (MBAC), the smelter (MAC), and the rolling mill (MRC). In June 2019, Alcoa\nCorporation and Ma’aden amended the joint venture agreement that governs the operations of each of the three companies that\ncomprise the joint venture. Under the terms of the agreement, Alcoa Corporation transferred its 25.1% interest in MRC to Ma’aden\nand, as a result, has no further direct or indirect equity interest in MRC. In accordance with the June 2019 amended joint venture\nagreement, Ma’aden’s put option and Alcoa Corporation’s call option, relating to additional interests in the joint venture, were\nexercisable for a period of six months after October 1, 2021. On March 31, 2022, Ma’aden’s and Alcoa’s put and call options,\nrespectively, expired with neither party exercising their options.\nThe results for the joint venture for the year ended December 31, 2022 include a charge related to a dispute with an industrial utility for\nperiods in 2021 and 2022 that progressed in early 2023. Alcoa’s share of this charge is $21 which is included in Other (income) expenses, net\non the Statement of Consolidated Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value\nof Alcoa’s investment in this joint venture was $710 and $687, respectively.\nELYSIS Limited Partnership—In June 2018, Alcoa Corporation, Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. (Rio Tinto), and Investissement Québec, a\ncompany wholly-owned by the Government of Québec, Canada, launched the ELYSIS Limited Partnership (ELYSIS). The purpose of\nthis partnership is to advance larger scale development and commercialization of its patent-protected technology that produces oxygen\nand eliminates all direct greenhouse gas emissions from the traditional aluminum smelting process. Alcoa and Rio Tinto plc, as\ngeneral partners, each own a 48.235% stake in ELYSIS, and the Québec provincial government, as a limited partner, owns a 3.53%\nstake. The federal government of Canada and Apple Inc., as well as the Québec provincial government, are providing initial financing\nto the partnership.\nThrough December 31, 2022, the Company has contributed $55 (C$71) toward its investment commitment in ELYSIS. The\nCompany’s basis in the investment has been reduced to zero for its share of losses incurred to date. As a result, the Company has $69\nin unrecognized losses as of December 31, 2022 that will be recognized upon additional contributions into the partnership."

As a result, the Company\nrecorded a loss of $32 on the extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of 2021 in Interest expense, which was comprised of the\nredemption premium and the write-off of deferred financing fees and unamortized debt issuance costs. The cash flows related to the\ntransaction were classified as financing cash flows.\nOn September 30, 2021, the Company redeemed in full $500 aggregate principal amount notes due in 2026 at a redemption price\nequal to 103.5% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. As a result, the Company recorded a loss of $22 on the\nextinguishment of debt in the third quarter of 2021 in Interest expense, which was comprised of the redemption premium and the\nwrite-off of deferred financing fees and unamortized debt issuance costs. The cash flows related to the transaction were classified as\nfinancing cash flows.\nCredit Facilities.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn June 27, 2022, Alcoa Corporation and Alcoa Nederland Holding B.V. (ANHBV), a wholly owned subsidiary of Alcoa Corporation\nand the borrower, entered into an amendment and restatement agreement (the Third Amendment and Restatement) (as amended and\nrestated, the Revolving Credit Facility) that provides additional flexibility to the Company and ANHBV by (i) extending the maturity\ndate of the Revolving Credit Facility from November 2023 to June 2027, (ii) reducing the aggregate commitments under the facility\nfrom $1,500 to $1,250, (iii) releasing the collateral package that had previously secured the Revolving Credit Facility, which will\ncontinue so long as certain credit ratings are maintained, (iv) increasing the maximum leverage ratio from 2.75 to 1.00 to 3.25 to 1.00,\nwhich increases following material acquisitions for four consecutive fiscal quarters following an acquisition, (v) providing a debt\nto capitalization ratio not to exceed .60 to 1.00 to replace the maximum leverage ratio upon a ratings upgrade to investment grade by\nMoody’s Investor Service (Moody’s) or Standard and Poor’s Global Ratings (S&P), and (vi) providing flexibility for dividends and\nother restricted payments, to make investments, and to incur additional indebtedness. The Revolving Credit Facility implements a\nsustainability adjustment to the applicable margin and commitment fee that may result in a positive or negative adjustment based on\ntwo of the Company’s existing sustainability metrics.\nIf Alcoa Corporation or ANHBV, as applicable, fails to have a rating of at least Ba1 from Moody’s and BB+ from S&P, then the\nCompany would be required to execute all security documents to re-secure collateral under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn July 26, 2022, Moody’s upgraded the rating of ANHBV’s senior unsecured notes to Baa3 (investment grade) from Ba1 and set the\ncurrent outlook to stable.\nIn addition to the financial covenants, the Revolving Credit Facility includes several customary affirmative and negative covenants\n(applicable to Alcoa Corporation and certain subsidiaries described as restricted), that, subject to certain exceptions, include\nlimitations on (among other things): indebtedness, liens, investments, sales of assets, restricted payments, entering into restrictive\nagreements, a covenant prohibiting reductions in the ownership of AWAC entities, and certain other specified restricted subsidiaries\nof Alcoa Corporation, below an agreed level. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains customary events of default, including\nfailure to make payments under the Revolving Credit Facility, cross-default and cross-judgment default, and certain bankruptcy and\ninsolvency events.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants. There were no borrowings outstanding at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, and no amounts were borrowed during 2022 and 2021 under the Revolving Credit Facility."

      "text": "95\nStock-based Compensation\nRestricted stock units are generally granted in either January or February each calendar year to eligible employees (the Company’s\nBoard of Directors also receive certain stock units; however, these amounts are not material). Time-based restricted stock units\n(RSUs) generally cliff vest on the third anniversary of the award grant date. The Company also grants performance restricted stock\nunits (PRSUs), which are subject to performance conditions. Prior to 2021, stock options were historically granted at the closing\nmarket price of Alcoa Corporation’s common stock on the date of grant and grade vested over a three-year service period (1/3 each\nyear) with a ten-year contractual term. As of January 1, 2021, the Company no longer grants stock options.\nThe final number of PRSUs earned is dependent on Alcoa Corporation’s achievement of certain targets over a three-year measurement\nperiod for grants. For PRSUs granted in 2020, the award was earned after the end of the measurement period of January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2022 based on performance against four measures: (1) the Company’s total shareholder return measured\nagainst the ranked total shareholder return of the Standard & Poor’s Metals and Mining Select Industry Index components; (2) a pre-\nestablished return-on-equity target; (3) an improvement in proportional net debt; and (4) a reduction in carbon intensity in both\nrefining (through reduced carbon dioxide emissions) and smelting (through increased production from renewable energy) operations.\nFor PRSUs granted in 2021, the award will be earned after the end of the measurement period of January 1, 2021 through December\n31, 2023 based on performance against four measures: (1) the Company’s total shareholder return measured against the ranked total\nshareholder return of the Standard & Poor’s Metals and Mining Select Industry Index components; (2) a pre-established return-on-\nequity target; (3) an improvement in proportional net debt; and (4) a reduction in carbon intensity in both refining (through reduced\ncarbon dioxide emissions) and smelting (through increased production from renewable energy) operations. For PRSUs granted in\n2022, the award will be earned after the end of the measurement period of January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024 based on\nperformance against three measures: (1) the Company’s total shareholder return measured against the ranked total shareholder return\nof the Standard & Poor’s Metals and Mining Select Industry Index components; (2) a pre-established return-on-equity target; and (3) a\nreduction in carbon intensity in both refining (through reduced carbon dioxide emissions) and smelting (through increased production\nfrom renewable energy) operations.\nIn 2022, 2021, and 2020, Alcoa Corporation recognized stock-based compensation expense of $40, $39, and $25, respectively, of\nwhich approximately 85% to 100% was related to stock units in each period. There was no stock-based compensation expense\ncapitalized in 2022, 2021, or 2020.\nStock-based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value of the applicable equity grant. For both RSUs and PRSUs, the\nfair value was equivalent to the closing market price per share of Alcoa Corporation’s common stock on the date of grant in the\nrespective periods. For stock units with a market condition, the fair value was estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo\nsimulation model, which generated a result of $126.86, $39.88, and $21.43 per unit in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The Monte\nCarlo simulation model uses certain assumptions to estimate the fair value of a market-based stock unit, including volatility (65.25%,\n60.19%, and 41.65% in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, for the Company) and a risk-free interest rate (1.71%, 0.22%, and 1.38%\nin 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively), to estimate the probability of satisfying market conditions. For stock options, the fair value\nwas estimated on the date of grant using a lattice pricing model, which generated a result of $6.12 per option in 2020. There were no\nstock options granted in 2022 and 2021. The lattice pricing model uses several assumptions to estimate the fair value of a stock option,\nincluding an average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, annual forfeiture rate, exercise behavior, and contractual life.\nThe activity for stock units and stock options during 2022 was as follows:\nStock units\nStock options\nNumber of\nunits\nWeighted\naverage\nFMV\nper unit\nNumber of\noptions\nWeighted\naverage\nexercise\nprice\nOutstanding, January 1, 2022\n4,702,546\n$\n22.23\n910,420\n$\n29.61\nGranted\n624,441\n67.50\n—\n—\nExercised\n—\n—\n(686,097)\n31.50\nConverted\n(1,056,571)\n30.07\n—\n—\nExpired or forfeited\n(100,726)\n26.63\n(3,727)\n21.13\nPerformance share adjustment\n436,525\n18.00\n—\n—\nOutstanding, December 31, 2022\n4,606,215\n26.08\n220,596\n23.88\nThe number of Converted units includes 308,125 shares withheld to meet the Company’s statutory tax withholding requirements\nrelated to the income earned by the employees as a result of vesting in the units."

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nDefined Benefit Plans\nAlcoa sponsors several defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees in the U.S. and foreign locations. Pension benefits\ngenerally depend on length of service, job grade, and remuneration. Substantially all benefits are paid through pension trusts that are\nsufficiently funded to ensure that all plans can pay benefits to retirees as they become due. Most salaried and non-bargaining hourly\nU.S. employees hired after March 1, 2006 and most bargaining hourly U.S. employees hired after January 1, 2020 participate in a\ndefined contribution plan instead of a defined benefit plan.\nThe Company also maintains health care postretirement benefit plans covering certain eligible U.S. retired employees and certain\nretirees from foreign locations. Generally, the medical plans are unfunded and pay a percentage of medical expenses, reduced by\ndeductibles and other coverage. The Company retains the right, subject to existing agreements, to change or eliminate these benefits.\nAll salaried and certain non-bargaining hourly U.S. employees hired after January 1, 2002 and certain bargaining hourly U.S.\nemployees hired after July 1, 2010 are not eligible for postretirement health care benefits.\nAs of January 1, 2022, the pension benefit plans and the other postretirement benefit plans covered an aggregate of approximately\n22,000 and approximately 22,000 participants, respectively.\n2022 Plan Actions. In 2022, management initiated the following actions to certain pension plans:\nAction #1 – In the third quarter of 2022, settlement accounting and related plan remeasurements were triggered within Alcoa’s U.S.\npension plans as a result of the Company’s purchase of group annuity contracts to transfer the obligation to pay the remaining\nretirement benefits of approximately 4,400 retirees and beneficiaries from its U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The transfer of\napproximately $1,000 in both plan obligations and plan assets was completed in August 2022. As a result, Alcoa recorded a\n$5 increase to Accrued pension benefits and a $27 increase to Other noncurrent assets and recognized a non-cash settlement loss of\n$617 (pre- and after-tax) in Restructuring and other charges, net on the Statement of Consolidated Operations.\nAction #2 – In the third quarter of 2022, settlement accounting and related plan remeasurements were triggered within Alcoa’s U.S.\npension plans as a result of participants electing lump sum payments. Alcoa recognized a non-cash settlement loss of $11 (pre- and\nafter-tax) in Restructuring and other charges, net on the Statement of Consolidated Operations.\nAction #3 – In the third quarter of 2022, settlement accounting and a related plan remeasurement was triggered within Alcoa’s U.S.\nsalaried pension plan as a result of participants electing lump sum payments. Alcoa recorded a $23 increase to Accrued pension\nbenefits and a $12 decrease to Other noncurrent assets and recognized a non-cash settlement loss of $1 (pre- and after-tax) in\nRestructuring and other charges, net on the Statement of Consolidated Operations.\nAction #4 – In the third quarter of 2022, settlement accounting and a related plan remeasurement was triggered within Alcoa’s\nAustralian pension plan as a result of participants electing lump sum payments. Alcoa recorded a $21 increase to Other noncurrent\nassets and recognized a non-cash settlement gain of $3 (pre- and after-tax) in Restructuring and other charges, net on the Statement of\nConsolidated Operations.\nAction #5 – In the fourth quarter of 2022, settlement accounting was triggered within Alcoa’s U.S. pension plans as a result of\nparticipants electing lump sum payments.

In 2021, management initiated the following actions to certain pension and other postretirement benefit plans:\nAction #1 – On March 31, 2021, Alcoa completed the sale of the Warrick Rolling Mill to Kaiser Aluminum Corporation for total\nconsideration of $670, which included the assumption of $69 in other postretirement benefit liabilities. Approximately 1,150\nemployees at the rolling operations, which includes the casthouse, hot mill, cold mills, and coating and slitting lines, became\nemployees of Kaiser. As a result, the affected plan was remeasured, including an update to the discount rate used to determine the\nbenefit obligation of the plan. Accrued other postretirement benefits reflects a decrease of $40 related to the remeasurement in\naddition to the $69 assumed by Kaiser. Further, Alcoa recognized a curtailment gain of $17 (pre- and after-tax) and a settlement loss\nof $26 (pre- and after-tax).\nAction #2 – In the second quarter of 2021, settlement accounting and a related plan remeasurement was triggered within Alcoa’s U.S.\nsalaried pension plan as a result of a high number of participants electing lump sum payments. This includes former employees of the\nWarrick Rolling Mill, as well as other Alcoa employees making this election at retirement. Alcoa recorded a $90 decrease to Accrued\npension benefits related to this remeasurement and recognized a settlement loss of $39 (pre- and after-tax).\nAction #3 – In the third quarter of 2021, settlement accounting and a related plan remeasurement was triggered within Alcoa’s U.S.\nsalaried pension plan as a result of participants electing lump sum payments. Alcoa recorded a $7 increase to Accrued pension benefits\nrelated to this remeasurement and recognized a settlement loss of $7 (pre- and after-tax).\nAction #4 – In the third quarter of 2021, settlement accounting and a related plan remeasurement was triggered within Alcoa’s\nAustralian pension plan as a result of participants electing lump sum payments. Alcoa recorded a $38 decrease to Accrued pension\nbenefits related to this remeasurement and recognized a settlement loss of $1 (pre- and after-tax).\nAction #5 – In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company purchased a group annuity contract to transfer the obligation to pay the\nremaining retirement benefits of approximately 800 retirees and deferred vested participants from one of its Suriname pension plans to\nan insurance company. The transfer of $55 in both plan obligations and plan assets were completed on October 19, 2021. As a result,\nthe Company recorded a settlement loss of $63 (pre- and after-tax) in Restructuring and other charges, net on the Statement of\nConsolidated Operations in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nAction #6 – In the fourth quarter of 2021, settlement accounting and related plan remeasurements were triggered within Alcoa’s U.S.\npension plans as a result of the Company purchasing group annuity contracts to transfer the obligation to pay remaining retirement\nbenefits of approximately 14,000 retirees and beneficiaries from its U.S. defined benefit pension plans and transferred approximately\n$1,540 in both plan obligations and plan assets. The transfers were completed on November 23, 2021 and December 16, 2021. As a\nresult, the Company recorded a $84 decrease to Accrued pension benefits related to this remeasurement and recognized a non-cash\nsettlement loss of $848 (pre- and after-tax) in Restructuring and other charges, net on the Statement of Consolidated Operations in the\nfourth quarter of 2021.\nAction #7 – In the fourth quarter of 2021, settlement accounting and related plan remeasurements were triggered within Alcoa’s U.S.\npension plans as a result of participants electing lump sum payments (and the group annuity contracts discussed in Action 6 above).\nAlcoa recorded a $1 decrease to Accrued pension benefits related to this remeasurement and recognized a settlement loss of $10 (pre-\nand after-tax)."

In 2020, management initiated the following actions to certain pension and other postretirement benefit plans:\nAction #1 – In February 2020, the Company entered into a new, six-year collective bargaining agreement with the Union of\nProfessional and Office Workers of the Alcoa Smelter of Baie-Comeau in Canada. Under the agreement, all unionized office\nemployees that are participants in one of the Company’s defined benefit pension plans ceased accruing retirement benefits for future\nservice effective January 1, 2021. This change affected approximately 20 employees, who were transitioned to a target benefit plan,\nwhere the funding risk is assumed by the employees. The Company will contribute approximately 12% of these participants’ eligible\nearnings to the new plan on an annual basis. Participants already collecting benefits or who terminated with a vested benefit under the\ndefined benefit pension plan were not affected by these changes.\nAction #2 – In February 2020, the Company notified all non-unionized hourly employees of Aluminerie de Deschambault, who are\nparticipants in one of the Company’s defined benefit pension plans, that they will cease accruing retirement benefits for future service\neffective January 1, 2021. This change affected approximately 430 employees, who were transitioned to a to a member-funded\npension plan, where the funding risk is assumed by the employees. The Company will contribute approximately 12% of these\nparticipants’ eligible earnings to the new plan on an annual basis. Participants already collecting benefits or who terminated with a\nvested benefit under the defined benefit pension plan were not affected by these changes.\nAction #3 – In April 2020, as part of the Company’s portfolio review, Alcoa announced that it will curtail the remaining capacity at its\nIntalco smelter in Ferndale, Washington amid declining market conditions. The full curtailment was completed during the third\nquarter of 2020, and the workforce was reduced by approximately 685 people. As a result, curtailment accounting was triggered in the\nU.S. hourly defined benefit pension and retiree life plans (3a and 3b in the below table, respectively).\nAction #4 – In September 2020, the Company and the United Steelworkers jointly notified certain U.S. retirees that their medical and\nprescription drug coverage will be provided through an insured group Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug plan and will\ninclude an increase to participant contributions, effective January 1, 2021. These changes affected approximately 8,600 participants.\nAlthough the plan change and related remeasurement increased the other postretirement benefit liability by $74, the plan change\nlowered the Company’s expected cash requirements for the program over the next five years.\nAction #5 – In October 2020, the Company offered lump sum buyouts to specific participants in its U.S. defined benefit pension\nplans. As a result, the Company paid approximately $33 from plan assets on December 31, 2020 to approximately 430 participants,\nwas relieved of the corresponding pension obligation of $35, and recognized a settlement loss of $44 (pre- and after-tax).\nAction #6 – On November 30, 2020, Alcoa announced an agreement to sell the Warrick Rolling Mill to Kaiser. The sale closed on\nMarch 31, 2021. Approximately 1,170 employees at the rolling operations, which includes the casthouse, hot mill, cold mills, and\ncoating and slitting lines, will become employees of Kaiser once the transaction is complete. As a result, Alcoa recognized a pension\ncurtailment loss of $5 (pre- and after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2020."

The underlying cash flows of the high-quality corporate bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to\nsatisfy the Company’s plan obligations multiple times. If a deep market of high-quality corporate bonds does not exist in a country,\nthen the yield on government bonds plus a corporate bond yield spread is used."

For 2023, management anticipates that 6.21% will be\nthe weighted average expected long-term rate of return.\nAssumed health care cost trend rates for U.S. other postretirement benefit plans were as follows (non-U.S. plans are not material):\n2022\n2021\n2020\nHealth care cost trend rate assumed for next year\n7.0%\n5.5%\n5.5%\nRate to which the cost trend rate gradually declines\n5.0%\n4.5%\n4.5%\nYear that the rate reaches the rate at which it is assumed to remain\n2028\n2026\n2026\nThe assumed health care cost trend rate is used to measure the expected cost of gross eligible charges covered by the Company’s other\npostretirement benefit plans.

Investment risk is controlled by rebalancing to target allocations on a\nperiodic basis and ongoing monitoring of investment manager performance.\nThe portfolio includes an allocation to investments in long-duration corporate credit and government debt, public and private market\nequities, intermediate duration corporate credit and government debt, global-listed infrastructure, high-yield bonds and bank loans,\nreal estate, and securitized credit.\nIn late 2022, management began restructuring the asset portfolios of certain non-U.S. pension plans. The new strategy will increase\nthe amount and duration of the fixed income asset portfolios to reduce exposure to interest rates and will be substantially implemented\nby the end of the first quarter in 2023.\nInvestment practices comply with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations in the respective jurisdictions, including the\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) in the United States.\nThe following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the trustees to measure the fair value of pension plan assets. For\nplan assets measured at net asset value, this refers to the net asset value of the investment on a per share basis (or its equivalent) as a\npractical expedient. Otherwise, an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each type of asset is generally classified\nis provided (see Note P for the definition of fair value and a description of the fair value hierarchy).\nEquities—These securities consist of: (i) direct investments in the stock of publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. companies and are\nvalued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded (generally classified in\nLevel 1); (ii) the plans’ share of commingled funds that are invested in the stock of publicly traded companies and are valued at net\nasset value; and (iii) direct investments in long/short equity hedge funds and private equity (limited partnerships and venture capital\npartnerships) and are valued at net asset value."

      "text": "104\nFunding and Cash Flows. It is Alcoa’s policy to fund amounts for defined benefit pension plans sufficient to meet the minimum\nrequirements set forth in applicable country benefits laws and tax laws, including ERISA for U.S. plans. From time to time, the\nCompany contributes additional amounts as deemed appropriate.\nIn 2022, 2021, and 2020, cash contributions to Alcoa’s defined benefit pension plans were $17, $579, and $343.\nDuring 2020, the Company initially deferred approximately $200 in pension contributions under provisions in the U.S. Government’s\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. With ample cash on hand and having achieved its objective to hold\ncash during uncertain times in 2020, the Company made a $250 pension contribution to its U.S. pension plans in late December to\ncover both the deferred contributions due on January 4, 2021 and a discretionary prepayment. During 2021, Alcoa made $500 in\nunscheduled contributions to certain U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The additional contributions were discretionary in nature and\nwere funded with net proceeds from a March 2021 debt issuance (see Note M) plus available cash on hand. There were no\ndiscretionary contributions made in 2022.\nAlcoa’s minimum required contribution to defined benefit pension plans in 2023 is estimated to be $75, of which approximately $55 is\nfor U.S. plans. Under ERISA regulations, a plan sponsor that establishes a pre-funding balance by making discretionary contributions\nto a U.S. defined benefit pension plan may elect to apply all or a portion of this balance toward its minimum required contribution\nobligations to the related plan in future years. In 2023, management intends to make such election related to the Company’s U.S.\nplans.\nBenefit payments expected to be paid to pension and other postretirement benefit plan participants are as follows:\nYear ending December 31,\nPension\nbenefits\nOther\npostretirement\nbenefits\n2023\n$\n195\n$\n55\n2024\n190\n55\n2025\n190\n50\n2026\n190\n50\n2027\n195\n45\n2028 through 2032\n915\n210\n$\n1,875\n$\n465\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe Company sponsors savings and investment plans in several countries, primarily in Australia and the United States. In the United\nStates, employees may contribute a portion of their compensation to the plans, and Alcoa matches a specified percentage of these\ncontributions in equivalent form of the investments elected by the employee. Also, the Company makes contributions to a retirement\nsavings account based on a percentage of eligible compensation for certain U.S. employees that are not able to participate in Alcoa’s\ndefined benefit pension plans. The Company’s expenses related to all defined contribution plans were $71 in 2022, $72 in 2021, and\n$73 in 2020.\nMember-funded Pension Plans\nThe Company contributes to member-funded pension plans for the employees of Aluminerie de Bécancour Inc. and Aluminerie de\nDeschambault in Canada. Alcoa makes contributions to the plans based on a percentage of the employees’ eligible compensation. The\nCompany’s expenses related to the member-funded pension plans were $17 in 2022, $17 in 2021, and $10 in 2020.\nTarget Benefit Plan\nThe Company contributes to a target benefit plan for the employees of Baie-Comeau in Canada. Alcoa makes contributions to the plan\nbased on a percentage of the employees’ eligible compensation. The Company’s expenses related to the target benefit plan were $9 in\n2022, and $9 in 2021."

      "text": "105\nP. Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments\nFair Value. The Company follows a fair value hierarchy to measure its assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were primarily derivative instruments. In addition, the\nCompany measures its pension plan assets at fair value (see Note O). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell\nan asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value\nhierarchy distinguishes between (i) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent\nsources (observable inputs) and (ii) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best\ninformation available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives\nthe highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to\nunobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\n•\nLevel 1—Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted\nassets or liabilities;\n•\nLevel 2—Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly\nor indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar\nassets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability\n(e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or\nother means; and,\n•\nLevel 3—Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.\nDerivatives. Alcoa Corporation is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations, including the risks of changing\ncommodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Alcoa Corporation’s commodity and derivative activities\ninclude aluminum, energy, foreign exchange, and interest rate contracts, which are held for purposes other than trading. They are used\nto mitigate uncertainty and volatility, and to cover underlying exposures. While Alcoa does not generally enter into derivative\ncontracts to mitigate the risk associated with changes in aluminum price, the Company may do so in isolated cases to address discrete\ncommercial or operational conditions. Alcoa is not involved in trading activities for energy, weather derivatives, or other nonexchange\ncommodities.\nAlcoa Corporation’s commodity and derivative activities are subject to the management, direction, and control of the Strategic Risk\nManagement Committee (SRMC), which consists of at least three members, including the chief executive officer, the chief financial\nofficer, and the chief commercial officer. The remaining member(s) are other officers and/or employees of the Company as the chief\nexecutive officer may designate from time to time. The SRMC meets on a periodic basis to review derivative positions and strategy\nand reports to the Audit Committee of Alcoa Corporation’s Board of Directors on the scope of its activities.\nAlcoa Corporation’s aluminum and foreign exchange contracts are predominately classified as Level 1 under the fair value hierarchy.\nAll of the Level 1 contracts are designated as either fair value or cash flow hedging instruments (except as described below). Alcoa\nCorporation also has several derivative instruments classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy, which are either designated as\ncash flow hedges or undesignated. Alcoa includes the changes in its equity method investee’s Level 2 derivatives in Accumulated\nother comprehensive loss.\nThe following tables present the detail for Level 1 and 3 derivatives (see additional Level 3 information in further tables below):\n2022\n2021\nBalance at December 31,\nAssets\nLiabilities\nAssets\nLiabilities\nLevel 1 derivative instruments\n$\n84\n$\n14\n$\n19\n$\n29\nLevel 3 derivative instruments\n52\n1,212\n2\n1,293\nTotal\n$\n136\n$\n1,226\n$\n21\n$\n1,322\nLess: Current\n134\n200\n14\n274\nNoncurrent\n$\n2\n$\n1,026\n$\n7\n$\n1,048\n2022\n2021\nYear ended December 31,\nUnrealized loss\nrecognized in Other\ncomprehensive loss\nRealized loss reclassed\nfrom Other\ncomprehensive loss to\nearnings\nUnrealized loss\nrecognized in Other\ncomprehensive loss\nRealized loss reclassed\nfrom Other\ncomprehensive loss\nLevel 1 derivative instruments\n$\n116\n$\n35\n$\n(28)\n$\n(10)\nLevel 3 derivative instruments\n(247)\n(345)\n(759)\n(279)\nNoncontrolling and equity interest (Level 2)\n12\n(6)\n5\n(6)\nTotal\n$\n(119)\n$\n(316)\n$\n(782)\n$\n(295)\nThe 2022 realized gain of $35 on Level 1 cash flow hedges was comprised of a $40 gain recognized in Sales and a $5 loss recognized\nin Cost of goods sold.

Additionally, Alcoa uses Level 1 aluminum derivative instruments to manage exposures to\nchanges in the LME associated with the Alumar (Brazil) restart (April 2022 through December 2023) and the San Ciprián (Spain)\nstrike (expired October 2022). As a result of a delay with the Alumar restart, it became probable that certain of the original forecasted\ntransactions would not occur by the end of the originally specified time period and Alcoa dedesignated certain aluminum sell\nforwards. The Company reclassified the related unrealized gain of $20 included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Sales\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022. In conjunction with the dedesignations, the Company entered into aluminum buy forwards\nin 2022 for the same volume and periods which were also not designated. The unrealized and realized gains and losses on the\naluminum buy and sell forwards that are not designated will offset resulting in no impact to Alcoa’s earnings.\nAlcoa Corporation uses Level 1 foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure related to euro\npower purchases in Norway (expires December 2026), krone capital expenditures in Norway (expires June 2025), and U.S. dollar\nalumina and aluminum sales in Brazil (expires December 2024).\nDerivative instruments classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy represent those in which management has used at least one\nsignificant unobservable input in the valuation model. Alcoa Corporation uses a discounted cash flow model to fair value all Level 3\nderivative instruments. Inputs in the valuation models for Level 3 derivative instruments are composed of the following: (i) quoted\nmarket prices (e.g., aluminum prices on the 10-year LME forward curve and energy prices), (ii) significant other observable inputs\n(e.g., information concerning time premiums and volatilities for certain option type embedded derivatives and regional premiums for\naluminum contracts), and (iii) unobservable inputs (e.g., aluminum and energy prices beyond those quoted in the market, and\nestimated credit spread between Alcoa and the counterparty). For periods beyond the term of quoted market prices for aluminum,\nAlcoa Corporation estimates the price of aluminum by extrapolating the 10-year LME forward curve. For periods beyond the term of\nquoted market prices for the Midwest premium, management estimates the Midwest premium based on recent transactions. Where\nappropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads, and credit considerations. Such adjustments\nare generally based on available market evidence (Level 2). In the absence of such evidence, management’s best estimate is used\n(Level 3). If a significant input that is unobservable in one period becomes observable in a subsequent period, the related asset or\nliability would be transferred to the appropriate classification (Level 1 or 2) in the period of such change (there were no such transfers\nin the periods presented). There were no sales or settlements of Level 3 derivative instruments in the periods presented.\nLevel 3 derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2022 are described in the table below:\nDescription\nDesignation\nContract\nTermination\nUnobservable\nInputs Impacting\nValuation\nSensitivity to Inputs\nPower contracts\nEmbedded derivative that indexes the\nprice of power to the LME price of\naluminum plus the Midwest premium\nCash flow hedge of\nforward sales of\naluminum\nMarch 2026\nDecember 2029\nFebruary 2036\nLME price,\nMidwest premium\nand MWh per year\nIncrease in LME price and/or the\nMidwest premium results in a higher cost\nof power and an increase to the derivative\nliability\nEmbedded derivative that indexes the\nprice of power to the LME price of\naluminum\nCash flow hedge of\nforward sales of\naluminum\nSeptember 2027\nLME price and\nMWh per year\nIncrease in LME price results in a higher\ncost of power and an increase to the\nderivative liability\nEmbedded derivative that indexes the\nprice of power to the credit spread\nbetween the Company and the\ncounterparty\nNot designated\nOctober 2028\nEstimated credit\nspread\nWider credit spread results in a higher\ncost of power and increase in the\nderivative liability\nFinancial contracts\nHedge power prices\nNot designated\nJune 2026\nLME price and\npower price\nLower prices in the power market or\nhigher LME prices result in an increase in\nthe derivative liability\nHedge power prices\nCash flow hedge of\nforward sales of power\nMarch 2023\nPower price\nHigher prices in the power market results\nin an increase in the derivative liability"

If the underlying items were included in the analysis, the gains or losses on the futures contracts may be\noffset. Actual results will be determined by several factors that are not under Alcoa Corporation’s control and could vary significantly\nfrom those factors disclosed.\nAlcoa Corporation is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the above instruments, as well as\ncredit or performance risk with respect to its hedged customers’ commitments. Alcoa Corporation does not anticipate nonperformance\nby any of these parties. Contracts are with creditworthy counterparties and are further supported by cash, treasury bills, or irrevocable\nletters of credit issued by carefully chosen banks. In addition, various master netting arrangements are in place with counterparties to\nfacilitate settlement of gains and losses on these contracts.\nOther Financial Instruments.

The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of the\ninstruments. The fair value amounts for Cash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash were classified in Level 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy.\nShort-term borrowings and Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year. The fair value of Long-term debt, less\namount due within one year was based on quoted market prices for public debt and on interest rates that are currently available to\nAlcoa Corporation for issuance of debt with similar terms and maturities for non-public debt.

As a result, the reserve for Uncertain tax positions that was established in 2018 was released in 2020.\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. tax legislation known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA) was enacted. In 2018, the\nCompany made an accounting policy election to include as a period cost the tax impact generated by including Global Intangible Low-\nTaxed Income provisions (GILTI) in U.S. taxable income. During 2020, the U.S. Treasury Department finalized regulations\nimplementing the GILTI provisions of the TCJA. Included in these regulations is an exclusion from GILTI for income subject to a\nhigh rate of foreign tax, which permits taxpayers to elect to apply the exception to previously filed tax returns. During 2020, an\namended tax return was filed for 2018 to make this election. As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of ($138) in 2020 to\nreflect the re-establishment of certain U.S. Federal net operating loss carryforwards and a corresponding tax charge of $138 to record a\nfull valuation allowance against the increased deferred tax asset.\nCertain income earned by AWAB is eligible for a tax holiday, which decreases the tax rate on this income from 34% to 15.25%,\nwhich will result in future cash tax savings. The holiday related to production at the Alumar refinery will end on December 31, 2027,\nand the holiday related to the operation of the Juruti (Brazil) bauxite mine will end on December 31, 2026. In 2020, deferred tax assets\nexpected to reverse in the holiday period were revalued at the holiday rate. This resulted in a discrete income tax charge of $15 in\n2020. In 2021, it was determined that the deferred taxes associated with the tax holiday would be fully exhausted within the holiday\nperiod and the amounts were therefore maintained on the balance sheet at the holiday tax rate. In 2022, the Company’s projection of\nthe reversal of deferred tax assets during the holiday tax period was lowered, and as a result, the remainder was revalued at the\nstatutory rate of 34%, resulting in a discrete income tax benefit of $33, which is included in Tax holidays, above.\nIn October 2022, Alcoa completed the liquidation of Alcoa Saudi Rolling Inversiones S.L. (ASRI), a wholly owned subsidiary that\npreviously held the Company’s investment in the Ma’aden Rolling Company. This liquidation resulted in a deductible loss in the\nNetherlands and a tax benefit of $94 was recognized in 2022, however, this tax benefit was substantially offset by a valuation\nallowance.\nIn December 2022, Alcoa commenced an internal reorganization to reduce its number of legal entities in Norway from four to one to\nsimplify accounting and treasury functions and reduce external costs. As a result of the simplification, the Company recorded a\ndeferred tax expense of $30 in 2022."

Of the $87 net deferred tax asset included under the Foreign\ncolumn in the table above, approximately 85% relates to five of Alcoa’s income tax filers (the “Foreign Filers”) as follows: a $108 net\ndeferred tax asset for Alcoa Canada Company in Canada; a $96 net deferred tax asset for AWAB in Brazil; a $43 net deferred tax\nasset for Alcoa Lauralco Management Company in Canada; a $33 net deferred tax asset for Alcoa Wolinbec Company in Canada; and,\na $207 net deferred tax liability for AofA in Australia.\nThe future realization of the net deferred tax asset for each of the Foreign Filers was based on projections of the respective future\ntaxable income (defined as the sum of pretax income, other comprehensive income, and permanent tax differences), exclusive of\nreversing temporary differences and carryforwards. The realization of the net deferred tax assets of the Foreign Filers is not dependent\non any future tax planning strategies."

      "text": "112\nThe Foreign Filers do not have a history of tax loss carryforwards expiring unused. Additionally, tax loss carryforwards have an\ninfinite life under the income tax code in Brazil. However, utilization of an existing tax loss carryforward is limited to 30% of taxable\nincome in a particular year in Brazil.\nAccordingly, management concluded that the net deferred tax assets of the Foreign Filers referenced above will more likely than not\nbe realized in future periods, resulting in no need for a partial or full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022.\nIn December 2022, Alcoa recorded a valuation allowance of $217 against the net deferred tax assets of Alumínio, of which $150\nrelated to the balance as of December 31, 2021. The 2022 full valuation allowance for Alumínio was a result of Alumínio’s three-year\ncumulative loss position for the period ended December 31, 2022. Although the Company entered into aluminum contracts to manage\nexposures associated with the restart, these contracts were held by another legal entity, and the associated realized gains are not\navailable to Alumínio to offset the restart losses. While management believes Alumínio will return to profitability in the future with\nthe restart of the Alumar smelter, current volatility in the market does not provide a reliable basis for concluding that it is more likely\nthan not that Alumínio’s net deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of tax loss carryforwards with indefinite life, will be realized.\nAlumar smelter profitability in future periods could prompt the Company to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax asset and\nassess the possibility of a reversal of the valuation allowance, which could have a significant impact on net income in the quarter the\nvaluation allowance is reversed.\nThe Company’s subsidiaries in Iceland have a full valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets, which was established in\n2015 and 2017, as the Company believed it was more likely than not that these tax benefits would not be realized. Strong market\nconditions in the first half of 2022 prompted management to reevaluate the realizability of the deferred tax asset and assess the\npossibility of a reversal of the valuation allowance. However, after weighing all available positive and negative evidence as of\nDecember 31, 2022, management’s position continues to be that it is more likely than not that Alcoa Corporation would not realize the\nbenefit of these deferred tax assets and continues to have a full valuation allowance recorded against Iceland deferred tax assets.\nIn 2021, Alcoa recorded a valuation allowance of $103 against the net deferred tax assets of Alúmina Española, S.A. (Española).\nManagement concluded that it was more likely than not that Española’s net deferred tax assets, which consisted primarily of tax loss\ncarryforwards, would not be realized as the entity’s sole operating asset, the San Ciprián refinery, was in a three-year cumulative loss\nposition for the period ended December 31, 2021. This cumulative loss position was the result of recent operating losses due to the\nhigh energy costs in Spain and the impact of the refinery workers’ strike on the fourth quarter of 2021. After weighing all available\npositive and negative evidence as of December 31, 2022, management’s position continues to be that it is more likely than not that\nAlcoa Corporation would not realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets and continues to have a full valuation allowance recorded\nagainst the deferred tax assets.\nThe following table details the changes in the valuation allowance:\nDecember 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n(2,062)\n$\n(2,127)\n$\n(1,778)\nEstablishment of new allowances(1)\n(150)\n(103)\n—\nNet change to existing allowances(2)\n(151)\n139\n(315)\nForeign currency translation\n30\n29\n(34)\nBalance at end of year\n$\n(2,333)\n$\n(2,062)\n$\n(2,127)\n(1)\nThis line item reflects valuation allowances initially established as a result of a change in management’s judgment regarding the\nrealizability of deferred tax assets.\n(2)\nThis line item reflects movements in previously established valuation allowances, which increase or decrease as the related\ndeferred tax assets increase or decrease. Such movements occur as a result of remeasurement due to a tax rate change and\nchanges in the underlying attributes of the deferred tax assets, including expiration of the attribute and reversal of the temporary\ndifference that gave rise to the deferred tax asset.\nUndistributed net earnings. Certain earnings of Alcoa’s foreign subsidiaries are deemed to be permanently reinvested outside the\nUnited States. The cumulative amount of Alcoa’s foreign undistributed net earnings deemed to be permanently reinvested was\napproximately $2,794 as of December 31, 2022. Alcoa Corporation has several commitments and obligations related to the\nCompany’s operations in various foreign jurisdictions; therefore, management has no plans to distribute such earnings in the\nforeseeable future. Alcoa Corporation continuously evaluates its local and global cash needs for future business operations and\nanticipated debt facilities, which may influence future repatriation decisions. If these earnings were distributed in the form of\ndividends or otherwise, we could be subject to foreign income or withholding taxes and state income taxes. Due to the uncertainty of\nthe manner in which the undistributed earnings would be brought back to the United States and the tax laws in effect at that time, it is\nnot practicable to estimate the tax liability that might be incurred if such earnings were remitted to the U.S."

With few exceptions, the Company is not subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior\nto 2014. The U.S. federal income tax filings of the Company’s U.S. consolidated tax group have been examined through the 2018 tax\nyear. Foreign jurisdiction tax authorities are in the process of examining income tax returns of several of Alcoa’s subsidiaries for\nvarious tax years. Excluding the Australia tax matter discussed in Note S, the period under foreign examination includes the income\ntax years from 2012 through 2021. For U.S. state income tax purposes, the Company and its subsidiaries remain subject to income tax\nexaminations for the 2017 tax year and forward.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, AofA paid approximately $74 (A$107) to the ATO related to the tax dispute described in Note S. Upon\npayment, AofA recorded a noncurrent prepaid tax asset, as the Company continues to believe it is more likely than not that AofA’s tax\nposition will be sustained and therefore is not recognizing any tax expense in relation to this matter. In accordance with Australian tax\nlaws, the initial interest assessment and additional interest are deductible against AofA’s taxable income resulting in approximately\n$169 (A$219) in 2020, $14 (A$19) in 2021, and $15 (A$22) in 2022 in lower cash tax payments. Interest compounded in future years\nis also deductible against AofA’s income in the respective periods. If AofA is ultimately successful, the interest deduction would\nbecome taxable as income in the year the dispute is resolved. In addition, should the ATO decide in the interim to reduce any interest\nalready assessed, the reduction would be taxable as income at that point in time. During 2022, AofA continued to record its tax\nprovision and tax liability without effect of the ATO assessment, since it expects to prevail. The tax payable will remain on AofA’s\nbalance sheet as a noncurrent liability, increased by the tax effect of subsequent periods’ interest deductions, until dispute resolution,\nwhich is expected to take several years. The noncurrent liability resulting from the cumulative interest deductions was approximately\n$174 (A$260) and $174 (A$238) at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe reserve balance for unrecognized tax benefits is included in Noncurrent income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. A\nreconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) was as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n4\n$\n4\n$\n29\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years\n2\n—\n—\nReductions for tax positions of prior years\n—\n—\n(26)\nExpiration of the statute of limitations\n(1)\n—\n—\nForeign currency translation\n—\n—\n1\nBalance at end of year\n$\n5\n$\n4\n$\n4\nFor all periods presented, a portion of the balance at end of year pertains to state tax liabilities, which are presented before any offset\nfor federal tax benefits. The effect of unrecognized tax benefits, if recorded, that would impact the annual effective tax rate for 2022,\n2021, and 2020 would be 1%, 0%, and 3%, respectively, of Income before income taxes. In 2018, the Company recorded a charge of\n$30 (€26), including $10 (€9) for interest, in Provision for income taxes on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations\nto establish a liability for its 49% share of the estimated loss on a disputed income tax matter (see Spain in the Tax section of Note S).\nIn 2020, the Company received a favorable final ruling in the Supreme Court of Spain on the Spain tax matter and recorded income of\n$32 (€26) from the reversal of the 2018 entry and the interest expense accrued through 2019. This change is reflected in the above\ntable as Reductions for tax positions of prior years in the amount of $21 (€17), which is exclusive of interest previously charged to\nexpense. The remainder of the change in Reductions for tax positions of prior years is primarily related to changes in Brazil income\ntax positions. There were no material changes in Reductions for tax positions of prior years in 2021 or 2022. Alcoa does not anticipate\nthat changes in its unrecognized tax benefits will have a material impact on the Statement of Consolidated Operations during 2023.\nIt is the Company’s policy to recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of the Provision for income taxes\non the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. In 2022, 2021, and 2020 Alcoa recognized $1, $0, and $0, in interest and\npenalties, respectively. Due to the expiration of the statute of limitations, settlements with tax authorities, and refunded overpayments,\nthe Company also recognized interest income of $1, $0, and $13 in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and\n2021, the amount accrued for the payment of interest and penalties was $3 and $2, respectively.\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes a 15% minimum tax on book income of\ncertain large corporations, a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases after December 31, 2022, and several tax incentives to promote\nclean energy. This legislation did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31,\n2022.\nR. Asset Retirement Obligations\nAlcoa records AROs related to legal obligations associated with the standard operation of bauxite mines, alumina refineries, and\naluminum smelters. These AROs consist primarily of costs associated with mine reclamation, closure of bauxite residue areas, spent\npot lining disposal, and landfill closures. The Company also recognizes AROs for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to\nthe demolition of facilities and for any significant lease restoration obligations, if required by a lease agreement."

These include currently or previously\nowned or operated facilities and adjoining properties, and waste sites, including Superfund (Comprehensive Environmental Response,\nCompensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)) sites.\nAlcoa Corporation’s environmental remediation reserve balance reflects the most probable costs to remediate identified environmental\nconditions for which costs can be reasonably estimated. The following table details the changes in the carrying value of recorded\nenvironmental remediation reserves:\nBalance at December 31, 2019\n$\n335\nLiabilities incurred\n7\nCash payments\n(19)\nReversals of previously recorded liabilities\n(1)\nBalance at December 31, 2020\n322\nLiabilities incurred\n21\nCash payments\n(23)\nReversals of previously recorded liabilities\n(17)\nForeign currency translation and other\n6\nBalance at December 31, 2021\n309\nLiabilities incurred\n32\nCash payments\n(26)\nReversals of previously recorded liabilities\n(30)\nForeign currency translation and other\n(1)\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n$\n284\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the current portion of the remediation reserve balance was $58 and $44, respectively.\nIn 2022, the Company incurred liabilities of $32 primarily related to $14 for the closure of the previously curtailed magnesium smelter\nin Addy (Washington), $6 for estimates for environmental remediation at the Point Henry site, $4 for a new phase of work at the\nformer East St. Louis site and $9 for environmental activities at various sites. These charges are recorded in Cost of goods sold and\nRestructuring and other charges, net (see Note D) on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. Payments related to\nremediation expenses applied against the reserve were $26 in 2022. These amounts include mandated expenditures as well as those not\nrequired by any regulatory authority or third party.

These charges are primarily recorded in Cost of goods\nsold and Restructuring and other charges, net on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. These amounts include\nmandated expenditures as well as those not required by any regulatory authority or third-party. Further, the Company recorded\nreversals of reserves of $17 related to:\n•\n$7 due to the determination that previously estimated site remediation is not required at the previously closed Tennessee site;\n•\n$5 due to lower costs for waste treatment at a previously closed Suriname site; and,\n•\n$5 due to lower costs for site remediation related to a previously closed site in Brazil.\nIn 2020, the Company incurred liabilities of $7 which were primarily related to ongoing remediation work at various sites.

In management’s judgment, the Company’s reserves are sufficient to satisfy the\nprovisions of the respective action plans. Upon changes in facts or circumstances, a change to the reserve may be required. The\nCompany’s significant sites include:\nPoços de Caldas, Brazil—The reserve associated with the 2015 closure of the Alcoa Alumínio S.A. smelter in Poços de Caldas,\nBrazil, is for remediation of historic smelting operations, spent potlining storage and disposal areas.\nFusina and Portovesme, Italy—Alcoa Corporation’s subsidiary Alcoa Trasformazioni S.r.l. has remediation projects underway for\nits closed smelter sites at Fusina and Portovesme which have been approved by the Italian Ministry for Ecologic Transition (MET).\nSoil remediation at the Fusina site was mostly completed in the first half of 2022, however, the scope of the project was changed to\ninclude the northwest area of the site; approval of the change is expected in the second half of 2023 with completion by the end of\n2024. Soil remediation at the Portovesme site was completed in the first half of 2022.\nSuriname—The reserve associated with the 2017 closure of the Suralco refinery and bauxite mine is for treatment and disposal of\nrefinery waste and soil remediation. The work began in 2017 and is expected to be completed at the end of 2025.\nHurricane Creek, Arkansas—The reserve associated with the 1990 closure of two mining areas and refineries near Hurricane Creek,\nArkansas is for ongoing monitoring and maintenance for water quality surrounding the mine areas and residue disposal areas.\nMassena, New York—The reserve associated with the 2015 closure of the Massena East smelter by the Company’s subsidiary,\nReynolds Metals Company, is for subsurface soil remediation to be performed after demolition of the structures. Remediation work\ncommenced in 2021 and will take four to eight years to complete.\nPoint Comfort, Texas—The reserve associated with the 2019 closure of the Point Comfort alumina refinery is for disposal of\nindustrial wastes contained at the site, subsurface remediation, and post-closure monitoring and maintenance. The final remediation\nplan is currently under review, which may result in a change to the existing reserve.\nSherwin, Texas—In connection with the 2018 settlement of a dispute related to the previously-owned Sherwin alumina refinery, the\nCompany’s subsidiary, Copano Enterprises LLC, accepted responsibility for the final closure of four bauxite residue waste disposal\nareas (known as the Copano facility). Work commenced on the first residue disposal area in 2018 and will take up to three additional\nyears to complete, depending on the nature of its potential re-use. Other than ongoing maintenance and repair activities, work on the\nnext three areas has not commenced but is expected to be completed by 2048, depending on its potential re-use.\nLongview, Washington— In connection with a 2018 Consent Decree and Cleanup Action Plan with the State of Washington\nDepartment of Ecology, the Company’s subsidiary, Northwest Alloys as landowner, accepted certain responsibilities for future\nremediation of contaminated soil and sediments at the site located near Longview, Washington. In December 2020, the lessee of the\nland, who was a partner in the remediation of the site, filed for bankruptcy and exited the site in January 2021. Remediation design\nchanges for consolidation and remediation of the onsite industrial waste landfills, groundwater remediation, and post-closure\nmonitoring and maintenance at the site was completed in 2021.\nAddy, Washington—The reserve associated with the 2022 closure of the Addy magnesium smelter facility is for site-wide\nremediation and investigation and post-closure monitoring and maintenance. Remediation work is not expected to begin until 2024\nand will take three to five years to complete. The final remediation plan is currently being developed, which may result in a change to\nthe existing reserve.\nOther Sites—The Company is in the process of decommissioning various other plants and remediating sites in several countries for\npotential redevelopment or to return the land to a natural state. In aggregate, there are approximately 30 remediation projects at these\nother sites that are planned or underway. These activities will be completed at various times in the future with the latest expected to be\nin 2026, after which ongoing monitoring and other activities may be required. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the reserve balance\nassociated with these activities was $50 and $62, respectively."

      "text": "117\nTax\nBrazil (AWAB)— In March 2013, AWAB was notified by the Brazilian Federal Revenue Office (RFB) that approximately\n$110 (R$220) of value added tax credits previously claimed were being disallowed and a penalty of 50% was assessed. Of this\namount, AWAB received $41 (R$82) in cash in May 2012. The value added tax credits were claimed by AWAB for both fixed assets\nand export sales related to the Juruti bauxite mine and São Luís refinery expansion for tax years 2009 through 2011. The RFB has\ndisallowed credits they allege belong to the consortium in which AWAB owns an interest and should not have been claimed by\nAWAB. Credits have also been disallowed as a result of challenges to apportionment methods used, questions about the use of the\ncredits, and an alleged lack of documented proof. AWAB presented defense of its claim to the RFB on April 8, 2013. In February\n2022, the RFB notified AWAB that it had inspected the value added tax credits claimed for 2012 and disallowed $4 (R$19). In its\ndecision, the RFB allowed credits of $14 (R$65) that were similar to those previously disallowed for 2009 through 2011. In July 2022,\nthe RFB notified AWAB that it had inspected the value added tax credits claimed for 2013 and disallowed $13 (R$70). In its decision,\nthe RFB allowed credits of $16 (R$84) that were similar to those previously disallowed for 2009 through 2011. The decisions on the\n2012 and 2013 credits provide positive evidence to support management’s opinion that there is no basis for these credits to be\ndisallowed. AWAB received the 2012 allowed credits with interest of $9 (R$44) in March 2022 and the 2013 allowed credits with\ninterest of $6 (R$31) in August 2022. AWAB will continue to dispute the credits that were disallowed for 2012 and 2013. If AWAB is\nsuccessful in this administrative process, the RFB would have no further recourse. If unsuccessful in this process, AWAB has the\noption to litigate at a judicial level. Separately from AWAB’s administrative appeal, in June 2015, a new tax law was enacted\nrepealing the provisions in the tax code that were the basis for the RFB assessing a 50% penalty in this matter. As such, the estimated\nrange of reasonably possible loss for these matters is $0 to $45 (R$239). It is management’s opinion that the allegations have no basis;\nhowever, at this time, the Company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome for this matter.\nAustralia (AofA)— In December 2019, AofA received a statement of audit position (SOAP) from the Australian Taxation Office\n(ATO) related to the pricing of certain historic third-party alumina sales. The SOAP proposed adjustments that would result in\nadditional income tax payable by AofA. During 2020, the SOAP was the subject of an independent review process within the ATO. At\nthe conclusion of this process, the ATO determined to continue with the proposed adjustments and issued Notices of Assessment (the\nNotices) that were received by AofA on July 7, 2020. The Notices asserted claims for income tax payable by AofA of approximately\n$143 (A$214). The Notices also included claims for compounded interest on the tax amount totaling approximately $474 (A$707).\nOn September 17, 2020, the ATO issued a position paper with its preliminary view on the imposition of administrative penalties\nrelated to the tax assessment issued to AofA. This paper proposed penalties of approximately $86 (A$128).\nAofA disagreed with the Notices and with the ATO’s proposed position on penalties. In September 2020, AofA lodged formal\nobjections to the Notices. In the fourth quarter of 2020, AofA provided a submission on the ATO’s imposition of interest and also\nsubmitted a response to the ATO’s position paper on penalties. After the ATO completes its review of AofA’s response to the\npenalties position paper, the ATO could issue a penalty assessment.\nTo date, AofA has not received a response to its submission on the ATO’s imposition of interest or its response to the ATO’s position\npaper on penalties.\nThrough February 1, 2022, AofA did not receive a response from the ATO on AofA’s formal objections to the Notices and, on that\ndate, AofA submitted statutory notices to the ATO requiring the ATO to make decisions on AofA’s objections within a 60-day period.\nOn April 1, 2022, the ATO issued its decision disallowing the Company’s objections related to the income tax assessment, while the\nposition on penalties and interest remains outstanding.\nOn April 29, 2022, AofA filed proceedings in the Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) against the ATO to contest the\nNotices, a process which could last several years. The AAT held the first directions hearing on July 25, 2022 ordering AofA to file its\nevidence and related materials by November 4, 2022, ATO to file its materials by April 14, 2023 and AofA to file reply materials by\nMay 26, 2023. AofA filed its evidence and related materials on November 4, 2022. The Company maintains that the sales subject to\nthe ATO’s review, which were ultimately sold to Aluminium Bahrain B.S.C., were the result of arm’s length transactions by AofA\nover two decades and were made at arm’s length prices consistent with the prices paid by other third-party alumina customers.\nIn accordance with the ATO’s dispute resolution practices, AofA paid 50% of the assessed income tax amount exclusive of interest\nand any penalties, or approximately $74 (A$107), during the third quarter 2020, and the ATO is not expected to seek further payment\nprior to final resolution of the matter. If AofA is ultimately successful, any amounts paid to the ATO as part of the 50% payment\nwould be refunded. AofA funded the payment with cash on hand and recorded the payment within Other noncurrent assets as a\nnoncurrent prepaid tax asset; the related December 31, 2022 balance is $72 (A$107).\nFurther interest on the unpaid tax will continue to accrue during the dispute. The initial interest assessment and the additional interest\naccrued are deductible against taxable income by AofA but would be taxable as income in the year the dispute is resolved if AofA is\nultimately successful. AofA applied this deduction beginning in the third quarter of 2020 which reduced cash tax payments by\napproximately $169 (A$219) in 2020, $14 (A$19) in 2021, and $15 (A$22) in 2022. This amount has been reflected within Other\nnoncurrent liabilities and deferred credits as a noncurrent accrued tax liability; the related December 31, 2022 balance is\n$174 (A$260)."

      "text": "118\nThe Company continues to believe it is more likely than not that AofA’s tax position will be sustained and therefore is not recognizing\nany tax expense in relation to this matter. However, because the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain at this time, the\nCompany cannot predict the potential loss or range of loss associated with the outcome, which may materially affect its results of\noperations and financial condition. References to any assessed U.S. dollar amounts presented in connection with this matter have been\nconverted into U.S. dollars from Australian dollars based on the exchange rate in the respective period.\nAofA is part of the Company’s joint venture with Alumina Limited, an Australian public company listed on the Australian Securities\nExchange. The Company and Alumina Limited own 60% and 40%, respectively, of the joint venture entities, including AofA.\nOther\nSpain— In July 2019, the Company completed the divestiture of the Avilés and La Coruña (Spain) aluminum facilities to PARTER\nCapital Group AG (PARTER) in a sale process endorsed by the Spanish government and supported by the workers’ representatives\nfollowing a collective dismissal process.\nIn connection with the divestiture, Alcoa committed to make financial contributions to the divested entities of up to $95; a total of $78\nwas paid through December 31, 2021.\nIn early 2020, PARTER sold a majority stake in the facilities to an unrelated party. Alcoa had no knowledge of the subsequent\ntransaction prior to its announcement and on August 28, 2020, Alcoa filed a lawsuit with the Court of First Instance in Madrid,\nSpain asserting that the sale was in breach of the sale agreement between Alcoa and PARTER.\nRelated to this subsequent sale transaction, certain proceedings and investigations have been initiated by or at the request of the\nemployees of the facilities against their current employers, the new owners of the current employers, and Alcoa, alleging that certain\nagreements from the 2019 collective dismissal process remain in force and that, under such agreements, Alcoa remains liable for\ncertain related employment benefits. One such proceeding is a collective case before the Spanish National Court, filed on November\n10, 2020, wherein the workers’ representatives and employees are seeking to have the terms of a Collective Dismissal Agreement\nsigned between Alcoa and the workers in January 2019 be fulfilled. Other proceedings include: a second collective claim filed in\nNational Court on behalf of employees that were not affected by the 2019 collective dismissal process, numerous individual labor\nclaims filed in the labor courts of Avilés and La Coruña and the initiation of a separate criminal investigation by the National Court.\nOn June 15, 2021, the Spanish National Court ruled that the collective dismissal agreement for the divested Avilés and La Coruña\naluminum facilities should be applied to the situation of the claimant workers, and that Alcoa should be liable for the severance of\nthose employees to the extent they were affected by the 2019 collective dismissal process. Alcoa appealed this ruling to the Supreme\nCourt of Spain.\nIn July 2021, the Spanish National Court appointed a judicial director to oversee the facilities and later declared the facilities\ninsolvent. In early 2022, the insolvency administrators appointed by the courts (one for each facility) announced their intention to\ncollectively dismiss all employees at the two facilities.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company recorded a charge of $77 in Restructuring and other charges, net to reflect its estimate for the\nagreement reached with the workers of the divested Avilés and La Coruña facilities (Spain) to settle various legal disputes related to\nthe 2019 divestiture.\nIn April 2022, the Company received unanimous acceptance of the offer from all active workers of the divested Avilés and La Coruña\nfacilities and a Global Settlement Agreement (GSA) was fully executed. The Company recorded a charge of $2 in Restructuring and\nother charges, net in the quarter ended June 30, 2022 to reflect an update to its estimated liability for the GSA. The Company expects\nto make cash payments in 2023 upon completion of certain administrative and judicial approvals.\nGeneral\nIn addition to the matters discussed above, various other lawsuits, claims, and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted\nagainst Alcoa Corporation, including those pertaining to environmental, safety and health, commercial, tax, product liability,\nintellectual property infringement, employment, and employee and retiree benefit matters, and other actions and claims arising out of\nthe normal course of business. While the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial, the ultimate liability is not readily\ndeterminable because of the considerable uncertainties that exist. Accordingly, it is possible that the Company’s liquidity or results of\noperations in a particular period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters. However, based on facts currently\navailable, management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse\neffect, individually or in the aggregate, on the financial position of the Company."

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, AofA had an asset of $285 and $304, respectively, representing\nprepayments made under the agreement for future gas transmission services.\nValue added tax credits—The Value added tax (VAT) credits (federal and state) relate to two of the Company’s subsidiaries in\nBrazil, AWAB and Alumínio, concerning the São Luís smelter and refinery and the Juruti mine. This refinery pays VAT on the\npurchase of goods and services used in the alumina production process. The credits generally can be utilized to offset the VAT\ncharged on domestic sales of alumina and aluminum.\nIn March 2021, the Brazil Federal Supreme Court provided clarification on an earlier ruling that found the inclusion of state VAT\nwithin the federal VAT tax base to be unconstitutional. After receiving further clarification from the court in August 2021, the\nCompany finalized the amount of its recovery claim and submitted the claim to the tax authorities in the fourth quarter and received\nacknowledgment of the claim in January 2022. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recorded $95 of additional\nVAT credits in Other noncurrent assets, $47 payable to Arconic Corporation within Other noncurrent liabilities, $34 in Sales, and $14\nof interest income within Other (income) expenses, net. The amount due to Arconic Corporation represents VAT payments related to\nan Arconic subsidiary previously owned by Alumínio for a portion of the claim years and covered under agreements related to the\nSeparation Transaction (see Note A).\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, after an assessment of the future realizability of the state VAT credits, the Company established an\nallowance on the accumulated state VAT credit balances and recorded a $107 charge in Restructuring and other charges, net, on the\naccompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. With the restart of the Alumar smelter in São Luís, Brazil and its first metal\nsales in June 2022, the Company now has the ability to monetize these credits. In June 2022, the Company reversed the allowance\nwith a credit of $83 to Restructuring and other charges, net and reversed the subsequent additions to the valuation allowance with a\ncredit of $46 to Cost of goods sold (same accounts as when incurred).\nOther Noncurrent Liabilities and Deferred Credits\nDecember 31,\n2022\n2021\nNoncurrent accrued tax liability (S)\n$\n174\n$\n174\nAccrued compensation and retirement costs\n95\n120\nOperating lease obligations (T)\n59\n64\nDeferred energy credits\n37\n54\nValue added tax credits payable to Arconic Corporation\n51\n47\nNoncurrent restructuring reserve (D)\n3\n43\nDeferred alumina sales revenue\n28\n36\nNoncurrent site separation reserve (C)\n—\n26\nOther\n39\n35\n$\n486\n$\n599"

During 2022, these credits were repaid and cash was received for 2021 San Ciprián smelter carbon dioxide emission credits\n($30). The terms of the credits require the Company to comply with certain conditions for a period of three years. These deferred\ncredits will be recognized as a reduction to Cost of goods sold once it is determined to be probable the Company will satisfy all\nconditions. Should the Company not meet all conditions during the three-year period, the credits will be repaid to the governmental\nagency.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Norwegian government approved a 2023 budget proposal that sets a floor for the carbon dioxide\ncompensation to be paid in 2023 based on 2022 power purchased. The Company recorded an adjustment of $25 in the fourth quarter\nof 2022 to Cost of goods sold to reverse amounts accrued for 2022 credits earned through September 30, 2022 under the prior carbon\ndioxide compensation program.\nValue added tax credits payable to Arconic Corporation—See, Other noncurrent assets—Value added tax credits, above.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nDecember 31,\n2022\n2021\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,363\n$\n1,814\nCurrent restricted cash\n55\n4\nNoncurrent restricted cash\n56\n106\n$\n1,474\n$\n1,924\nOn December 29, 2021, the Company announced the two-year curtailment of the San Ciprián aluminum smelter in Spain. As a result\nof the agreement reached between Alcoa and the San Ciprián workers’ representatives, the Company has restricted cash of $103 to be\nmade available in the future to cover capital expenditures and future restart costs associated with the planned restart at the end of the\ncurtailment period.\nCash Flow Information\nCash paid for interest and income taxes was as follows:\n2022\n2021\n2020\nInterest, net of amount capitalized\n$\n100\n$\n191\n$\n135\nIncome taxes, net of amount refunded\n504\n152\n183\nV.

Alcoa plans that all pots will be restarted by\nOctober 1, 2025, and from October 1, 2025 until the end of 2026, the minimum production will be 75 percent of the annual capacity of\n228 kmt. Under the terms of the updated agreement, the Company is responsible for certain employee obligations during the extended\ncurtailment period. As a result, the Company will record charges of approximately $50 (pre- and after-tax) in the first quarter of 2023\nin Restructuring and other charges, net on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. Cash outlays related to these obligations are\nexpected in 2024 and 2025. In connection with the updated agreement, the Company made additional commitments of $78 for capital\nimprovements at the site to be spent primarily between 2024 and 2025.\nIn January 2023, the Company reduced production at the Kwinana (Australia) refinery by approximately 30 percent in response to a\ndomestic natural gas shortage in Western Australia due to production challenges experienced by key gas suppliers.\nBeginning in January 2023, the financial information provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) for the activities of the\nbauxite mines and the alumina refineries was combined, and accordingly the Company changed its operating segments. Beginning\nwith the first quarter of 2023, the Company will report its financial results in the following two segments: (i) Alumina, and (ii)\nAluminum. Segment information for all prior periods presented will be updated to reflect the new segment structure."
