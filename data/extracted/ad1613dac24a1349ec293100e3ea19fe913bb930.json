We may also make forward-looking statements in \nother reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to stockholders, and in press releases.  In addition, our \nrepresentatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements relate to future events and typically address our expected future business and financial performance.  Statements in \nthis report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements.  Words such as \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"aspire,\" \"believe,\" \n\"seek,\" \"see,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"may,\" \"target,\" and similar expressions and variations or negatives of these words, typically identify such forward-\nlooking statements.  These include, among others, statements relating to:\n•\nrelationships with and financial condition of our significant customers;\n•\nfluctuations in credit market conditions, general global economic and political conditions, and foreign currency exchange rates;\n•\nour ability to maintain a reliable, secure computing environment;\n•\ncontinued market acceptance of our products and services;\n•\nour ability to continuously develop and enhance products in a timely, cost-effective, technically advanced, and competitive manner;\n•\nour ability to deliver our solutions in a timely fashion within budget, particularly large software implementations;\n•\nour dependency on the industries in which we serve;\n•\nour ability to meet our financial expectations;\n•\nincreasing competition in our market from companies of greater size and with broader presence;\n•\nour ability to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses or assets to achieve expected strategic, operating, and \nfinancial goals;\n•\nour ability to protect our intellectual property rights;\n•\nour ability to conduct business in the international marketplace;\n•\nour ability to comply with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations; and \n•\nrisks related to the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by federal securities laws.\nForward-looking statements are based on management’s beliefs, assumptions and expectations of future events and trends that are subject to \nrisks and uncertainties.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and actual future results and trends may differ materially \nfrom historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors.  We have included important \nfactors in this Form 10-K, particularly under \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from any \nforward-looking statement. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.  For additional information \nconcerning factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our reports on Form \n10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").\n3"

This will change the way we work, live, and interact bringing a new digital reality to everything we do.  For \nCommunication Service Providers (\"CSPs\"), it provides new revenue sources beyond connectivity, information, and communications \nservices.  For consumers, it enables personalized new digital capabilities in a simpler to consume and engage model.  But, behind these \n‘simple’ user experiences are complex B2B, B2C, and B2B2X platforms, rich collaboration ecosystems, and a web of partnerships which \nare underpinned by open application programming interfaces, or APIs, distributed architecture, and microservices technology.  Our \nsolutions are architected to bring speed, agility, and interoperability while maintaining the operational stability, security, reliability, and \nscalability needed to power these complex ecosystems.  We enable companies to bring new services to market with hyper speed and scale \nwith our revenue management platforms which are key to growing revenue and profits in a digital world.\nTransformational Customer Experiences:  Delivering exceptional customer experience is a critical strategic lever that companies need to \nexcel at in order to grow faster, improve retention, and strengthen customer loyalty.  We believe customer experience is the number one \ndifferentiator for businesses today. \nWe provide some of the biggest brands in the world with strategic insights, experience design, customer journey management, business \nintelligence analytics, and customer communication solutions aimed at driving extraordinary customer experiences and better business \noutcomes.  We help companies deliver unique customer experiences across both traditional and digital channels creating moments that are \npersonalized, predictive, and proactive.\nToday, companies use many different communication channels to interact with customers including website, call center, physical location, \nSMS text, print, and more.  Each of these channels generates a massive amount of information that can be harnessed by these companies \nto craft extraordinary customer journeys.  Each customer touchpoint illuminates key moments of truth that are pivotal in growing customer \nacquisition and retention.  Continuous active customer profiling and decisioning for care and commerce – based on real-time and stored \ndata from a variety of sources – provides value to our customers by powering them with insights needed to optimize every interaction with \ntheir customers. \nThese solutions are designed to help the end consumers easily interact with our customers’ brands through their preferred channel of \nchoice.  We take a holistic approach to orchestrating end-to-end customer experiences that helps brands see, think, act and react in real-\ntime to drive conversion, retention, and loyalty.  Our approach yields better business results with quicker time to value and lower risk.\nPayments:  We continue to see an increase in the velocity and the expectations from our merchants and partners that make digital \npayments table stakes for every facet of their customer's life – whether that be paying rent, property taxes, gym memberships, educational \nfees, or other goods and services.\nAt CSG, we have been recognized as a leader in payments, providing a full end-to-end SaaS payments platform, allowing organizations to \naccept electronic check/ACH, debit and credit card payments, and offer the ability to receive funds quicker via same-day ACH.  With one of \nthe most robust and complete payments platforms in the market, we enable integrated software vendors (ISV) to differentiate their solution \nstack by offering a fully customizable payments platform that seamlessly integrates into existing architectures to help their customers scale \npayments smarter and faster.  Our all-in-one payments platform simplifies and enables businesses and governments to onboard merchants \nquickly, deliver ongoing innovation, and address the changing market demands in digital payments.

Our pre-integrated approach, combined with \nour deep domain experts managing the applications, allow our customers to scale their operations and do what matters most – focus on \nsatisfying their end customers and growing their businesses.\nOver the past several years, two of the largest drugstore chains in the United States (“U.S.”) and one of the largest retailers used our technology \nto help improve their digital customer experience related to COVID-19 vaccinations, appointment scheduling, prescription refill notifications, and \nother transactional engagements.  During 2022, we won and signed a large new contract expansion with one of these leading drugstore chains.  \nOver the past couple of years, we also helped one of the largest financial services providers in the U.S. streamline and personalize their mortgage \nand auto lending processes in a digital world with our journey orchestration and analytics offerings.  And, we helped some of the largest CSPs in \nthe world scale and grow their enterprise and consumer businesses by consolidating, standardizing, and automating their disparate systems to a \nmodern platform that can manage complex ecosystems, new digital B2B marketplaces, 5G deployments, and multi-sided business models.  On \nthis front, during 2022, we largely completed the migration of approximately 14 million Charter Communications customer accounts from a \ncompetitor’s platform.  This six-year contract with Charter was the largest contract in our history.\nWhy We Win\nAt CSG, many of our significant customer relationships span decades.  To earn the right to do business with companies for that length of time, you \nneed to be trusted, dependable, and innovative.  You need to be bold, future-forward, relentlessly focused, passionate, customer obsessed, \npeople-centric, innovative – and most importantly – you need to deliver.  \nWe do all of this by constantly obsessing over the needs and success of our customers as we help them design and deliver exceptional, digitally-\nenabled, customer and employee experiences.  We believe in innovating jointly with our current and potential future customers to anticipate \nfuture-market trends and then redesign and technologically-enable personalized engagements with their consumer and enterprise customers.  \nAnd, since our modular solutions are mission-critical systems at the heart of our customers’ business, operational excellence, security, and \nreliability will always be our top priority.\nIn addition, working side-by-side with some of the biggest and most innovative companies in the world helps us to develop breakthrough \ntechnologies that address the market’s most pressing needs today and into the future.\nHow We Grow\nWe believe the successful execution of our goals will allow us to accelerate our revenue and earnings growth, and therefore, create long-term \nsustained value for our customers, employees, and stockholders. \nOur strategic focus is underpinned by our key business priorities:\nHarnessing the best culture, the best talent, and the most energized and globally diverse team:  Our global employees and leaders \ncontinue to be CSG’s greatest competitive differentiator.  As a purpose-driven, SaaS platform company, we foster a culture where we \nprioritize employee experience, learning, and development to provide a workplace environment where our employees can do their best \nwork and thrive.  We foster a culture of diversity, equity, and belonging for all employees.  By being customer-obsessed every day, CSG will \ncontinue to win big in the market.\nAccelerating our revenue growth:  We continue to target accelerated long-term organic revenue growth and unlock significant value with \ndisciplined strategic, financially-attractive acquisitions.  Accelerating our growth will enable CSG to add scale and operating leverage in \norder to create greater customer and shareholder value.  We look to acquire capabilities, proven product platforms, market share in high-\ngrowth industry verticals, and human capital talent.  In today’s challenging macro-economic environment, we will remain highly disciplined \nand strive to ensure that every acquisition meets our four criteria: strategic fit, culture/integration fit, financial fit, and risk/return profile.\nCreating and leading with category-defining technology:  Our broad portfolio of industry-leading solutions provide our customers with a \ncompetitive advantage.  These solutions enable customers to efficiently manage their traditional businesses while being able to quickly \ndeliver new digital services and a more personalized and relevant experience to their consumers.  We will continually add relevant \ncapabilities to what we do as a company, both in terms of our people and our solutions.  \n6"

We do this by putting the customer at the heart of our decision-making and by continuing to raise the bar on our agility, \ndelivery capabilities, efficiency, and reliability to power our customers’ success.\nBecoming the SaaS technology provider of choice for CSPs:  We have a strong presence in the world’s largest CSPs technology \necosystem with our award-winning revenue management platforms.  However, as these companies wrestle with new competitors, changes \nin customer demands, and disruptive technologies like 5G, they need a partner that can provide them with a suite of solutions that can help \nthem turn these challenges into opportunities, higher revenues, and greater operating profits.  With our vast portfolio of solutions, we can \nhelp service providers launch and scale new digital services quickly, provide a great customer experience across any channel, and simplify \nand monetize B2B2X ecosystems and marketplaces, across industry verticals.  \nExpanding into big, higher growth industry verticals:  Brands in many large, high-growth industry verticals rely on and need the \ntechnology products and platforms that CSG provides.  We are focused on increasing the amount of revenue we generate from customers \noutside of the CSP industry. While we’ve made significant progress over the years, we have significant opportunities to expand our footprint \nin these verticals. CSG is helping some of the biggest brands in retail, healthcare, financial services, and government digitize and \nmodernize their revenue management, customer experience and payments capabilities.  \nCustomers\nWe work with some of the world’s leading brands in a wide variety of industry verticals. These range from working with leading CSPs like Charter, \nComcast, MTN, Airtel Africa, DISH, Mobily, Verizon, AT&T, American Movil, and Telstra.  Outside of the CSP space, we work with hundreds of \nother customers and over 98,000 active merchants including some of the largest financial services companies, three of the largest pharmacy \nretailers in the U.S., property management companies, and state and local governments. \nCustomers that represented 10% or more of our revenue for 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions, except percentages): \n  \n  \n \n2022\n  \n  \n2021\n  \n  \n  \n \nAmount\n     \n \n% of Revenue\n  \n  \nAmount\n     \n \n% of Revenue\n  \nCharter\n  \n \n$\n221         \n20 %    $\n221         \n21 % \nComcast\n  \n \n  \n214         \n20 %      \n216         \n21 % \nSee the Significant Customer Relationships section of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) for additional information regarding \nour business relationships with these key customers. \nProfessional Services\nWe employ professional services experts globally who bring both deep domain expertise and a wide range of skills – including solution \narchitecture, project management, systems implementation, system integration, and business consultancy – to every services project.  We apply \na structured methodology to each of our engagements, leveraging consistent world-class processes, best-practice program management, and \nsystemized templates in the deployment of our solutions. \nSales and Marketing\nWe organize our sales efforts to customers primarily within our geographically dispersed, dedicated account teams, with senior level account \nmanagers who are responsible for winning new customers, expanding our business with existing customers, and renewing existing contracts.  In \naddition, we have partnerships and alliances with leading industry participants.  The account teams are supported by sales support personnel \nwho are experienced in the various industry-leading solutions that we provide.

We compete with both independent providers and in-house developers of revenue \nmanagement, digital monetization, customer experience, and payments systems.  Our current competitors include companies who deliver on-\npremise bespoke custom offerings (i.e., Amdocs Limited, NEC Netcracker), software solutions (i.e., Salesforce, Adobe, Pegasystems, Twilio), \ninternally developed enterprise applications, network operators (i.e., Ericsson, Huawei), large outsourced transactional communications \ncompanies (i.e., Intrado, Fiserv), systems integrators (i.e., Accenture, Tech Mahindra) and large payments processors (i.e., FIS and Fiserv) and \npayments specialists (i.e., Stripe and Nuvei/Paya).\nProprietary Rights and Licenses \nWe rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, and patent laws in the U.S. and similar laws in other countries, and non-\ndisclosure, confidentiality, and other types of contractual arrangements to establish, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights in our \nsolutions.

This means fostering a diverse, industry leading employee \nexperience focused on employee choice and flexibility, providing programs and events focusing on wellbeing and mental health of all \nteam members, and inspiring collaborative and connected teams. \n•\nWinning with Talent by attracting and retaining the best, most diverse global talent; accelerating time to productivity, integration, \nand engagement; embedding diversity, equity, and inclusion considerations into our strategy; and ensuring our global team members \nthrive in an inclusive environment.  In addition to our already competitive pay and benefits, we continue to introduce many new \nbenefits and programs that are designed to promote mental and physical wellness. \n•\nGrow@CSG by developing bold, agile, inventive team members and leaders; innovating talent development and succession \nplanning; and expanding cross-company and cross-unit rotations and promotions.  We continue to expand our personalized learning \nplatform and internal talent marketplace, which allows employees to browse open roles, see their skills match for roles they might be \ninterested in, and receive curated learning pathways designed to provide them the skills they need to take on more responsibility or \nmove to an entirely different role or department.   \nWe believe that our culture and our team members are a key reason our customers continue to rely on us to help them achieve their business \ngoals and objectives and do business with us for years.  \nAs of December 31, 2022, we employed over 5,700 people, of which approximately 41% were in North America, 42% were in our locations in \nAsia-Pacific and Australia, 10% were in our locations in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, and 7% in our locations in South and Central \nAmerica.  \nAs of December 31, 2022, our workforce was approximately 64% male, 36% female, and less than 1% nonbinary or undeclared.  The \nrace/ethnicity of our U.S. workforce was 67% White, 12% Asian, 8% Hispanic or Latino, 7% Black or African American, <1% American \nIndian/Alaskan Native, <1% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 1% two or more races, and 5% unknown or undeclared. \nWe believe our employee relations are good and we work hard to constantly improve in this area. \nSocial Impact & Responsibility \nWe aspire to envision, invent, and create a better, more inclusive and future ready world by channeling the power of all.  To accomplish that, we \nare focusing on these key areas: \nExpanding Our Community Impact:  We support Community Based Organizations (“CBOs”) that provide underrepresented communities the \nopportunity to participate, thrive, and make a lasting impact on the technology industry across the globe.   We continue to expand our \npartnerships with CBOs like WeMakeChange and Earthday.org.  In addition, we've continued our commitment to CSG's Global Days of Action, \nwhere we give every team member an opportunity (two free days) to volunteer their time in the community impact area of their choosing.\nEnhancing Our Environmental Stewardship:  With employees in over 20 countries and serving customers globally, this is a vital and important \nfocus area.  We seek to work with partners that are committed to reducing and recycling waste, investing in green energy, and responsible \nsourcing to create a more sustainable future.  Reducing global emissions is critical, and we are working towards disclosing our carbon footprint. \nWith the goal of reducing our environmental impact, we’ve established a baseline to drive improvement in our environmental performance as part \nof our ongoing business strategy and operating methods. \nEnabling Digital Inclusion:  We strive to develop technological solutions that promote social progress and make navigating the digital world easier \nfor anyone, anywhere in the world.  We also believe that diverse experiences and perspectives help bring out the best ideas, drive innovation, and \nachieve transformative results to benefit the clients we serve.  We are committed to digital inclusivity, doing the right thing for the users of our \nproducts, and taking action to improve the accessibility of our digital products and services. \n9"

Risk Factors \n \nWe or our representatives from time-to-time may make or may have made certain forward-looking statements, whether orally or in writing, \nincluding without limitation, any such statements made or to be made in MD&A contained in our various Securities and Exchange Commission \n(“SEC”) filings or orally in conferences or teleconferences.  We wish to ensure that such statements are accompanied by meaningful cautionary \nstatements, so as to ensure, to the fullest extent possible, the protections of the safe harbor established in the Private Securities Litigation Reform \nAct of 1995.\nWe operate in rapidly changing and evolving markets throughout the world addressing the complex needs of industry leaders in the telecom, \nbroadband, cable media, retail, healthcare, financial services, insurance, government and other industries.  As a result, new risk factors will likely \nemerge and currently identified risk factors will likely evolve in their scope.  Further, as we enter new market sectors as well as new geographic \nmarkets, we could be subject to new regulatory requirements that increase the risk of non-compliance and the potential for economic harm to us \nand our customers.  Accordingly, the risk factors and any forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to and are \naccompanied by the following meaningful cautionary statements:\n•\nIf any of the following risk factors would occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of \noperations, and/or trading price of our common stock. \n•\nThis list of risk factors is not exhaustive, and management cannot predict all of the relevant risk factors, nor can it assess the \npotential impact, if any, of such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any risk factor, or combination of risk factors, may \ncreate. \n•\nThere can be no assurances that forward-looking statements will be accurate indicators of future actual results, and it is likely that \nactual results will differ from results projected in the forward-looking statements, and that such differences may be material. \nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe Derive a Significant Portion of Our Revenue from a Limited Number of Customers, and the Loss of the Business of a Significant \nCustomer Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Position and Results of Operations.\nOver the past decade, the global communications industry has experienced significant consolidation, resulting in a large percentage of the market \nbeing served by a limited number of CSPs, with greater size and scale, and there are possibilities of further consolidation.  Consistent with this \nmarket concentration, we generate over 40% of our revenue from our two largest customers, which are Charter and Comcast, which each \nindividually accounted for over 10% or more of our total revenue.  See the Significant Customer Relationships section of MD&A for a brief \nsummary of our business relationship with these customers.\nThere are inherent risks whenever a large percentage of total revenue is concentrated with a limited number of customers.  Such risks include, \nbut are not limited to, a significant customer:  (i) undergoing a formalized process to evaluate alternative providers for solutions and services we \nprovide; (ii) terminating or failing to renew their contracts with us, in whole or in part, for any reason; (iii) significantly reducing the number of \ncustomer accounts processed on our solutions, the price paid for our solutions and services, or the scope of solutions and services that we \nprovide; or (iv) experiencing significant financial or operating difficulties. \nOur industry is highly competitive, and as a result, it is possible that a competitor could increase its footprint and share of customers serviced at \nour expense or a customer could develop their own internal solutions.  While our customers may incur costs in switching to our competitors or \ndeveloping their own solutions, they may do so for a variety of reasons, including: (i) price; (ii) dissatisfaction with our solutions or service levels, \nincluding our ability to adequately protect their data; or (iii) dissatisfaction with our relationship. \nA Reduction in Demand for Our Revenue Management Platforms Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Position and \nResults of Operations.\nHistorically, a substantial percentage of our total revenue has been generated from our SaaS platforms and related solutions.  Our platforms and \nsolutions are expected to continue to provide a large percentage of our total revenue in the foreseeable future.  Any significant reduction in \ndemand for these products could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n11"

      "text": "The Delivery of Our Solutions is Dependent on a Variety of Computing and Processing Environments and Communications Networks \nWhich May Not Be Available or May Be Subject to Security Attacks.\nOur solutions are generally delivered through a variety of sources including public and hybrid cloud, third-party data center and other service \nproviders, and internally operated computing and processing environments (collectively referred to hereafter in this section as “Systems”).  We \nand/or end users are connected to the Systems through a variety of public and private communications networks, which we will collectively refer \nto herein as “Networks”.  Our solutions are generally considered to be mission critical customer management systems by our customers.  As a \nresult, our customers are highly dependent on the consistent availability and uncompromised security of the Networks and Systems to conduct \ntheir business operations. \nNetworks and Systems are subject to the risk of an extended interruption, outage, or security breach due to many factors such as: (i) changes to \nthe Systems and Networks for such things as scheduled maintenance and technology upgrades, or conversions to other technologies, service \nproviders, or physical location of hardware; (ii) failures or lack of continuity of services from public cloud or third-party data center and other \nservice providers; (iii) defects and/or critical security vulnerabilities in software program(s); (iv) human and machine error; (v) acts of war and/or \nnature; (vi) intentional, unauthorized attacks from computer “hackers”, or cyber-attacks; and (vii) using the Systems to perpetrate identity theft \nthrough unauthorized authentication to our customers’ customers’ accounts.\nMost recently, the global marketplace is experiencing an ever-increasing exposure to both the number and severity of cyber-attacks.  In particular, \nransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and can lead to significant reputational harm, loss of data, operational disruption, and \nsignificant monetary loss.  Organized criminals, nation state threat actors, and motivated hacktivists have the possibility of impacting our Systems, \nNetworks, data, and business operations. We may not be able or willing to respond to any such attacks due to policy, laws, or other regulations.  \nIn addition, we continue to expand our use of third-party Systems and Networks with our solution offerings thereby permitting, for example, our \ncustomers’ customers to use the Internet to review account balances, order services or execute similar account management functions.  Access \nto Networks and Systems via the Internet has the potential to increase their vulnerability to unauthorized access and corruption, as well as \nincreasing the dependency of the Systems’ reliability on the availability and performance of the Internet and end users’ infrastructure they obtain \nthrough other third-party providers. \nThe method, manner, cause and timing of an extended interruption, outage, or security breach in third-party and/or the Networks or Systems are \nimpossible to predict.  As a result, there can be no assurances that these Networks and Systems will not fail or suffer a security breach or that the \nthird-party and/or our business continuity or remediation plans will adequately mitigate the negative effects of a disruption or security breach to the \nNetworks or Systems.  Further, our property, technology errors and omissions, contractual relationship with third-party providers, and business \ninterruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that we incur as a result of such interruptions or security breaches.  Should \nthe Networks or Systems: (i) experience an extended interruption or outage; (ii) have their security breached; (iii) have their data lost, corrupted or \notherwise compromised; and/or (iv) fail to meet contractual requirements related to our cybersecurity program, it would impede our ability to meet \nour delivery obligations, and likely have an immediate impact to the business operations of our customers.  In addition, this would most likely \nresult in damaging our reputation as well as our long-term ability to attract and retain new customers.  The loss of confidential information could \nresult in losing the customers’ confidence, as well as claims for contractual breach, and imposition of penalties, fines, and/or damages.  These \nrisks will increase as our business continues to expand to include new solutions, technologies, verticals, and markets.  These risks, individually or \ncollectively, could result in an adverse material impact to our business.\nWe May Not Be Able to Efficiently and Effectively Implement New Solutions or Migrate Customers and Merchants onto Our Solutions.\nOur continued growth plans include the implementation of new solutions, as well as migrating both new and existing customers and merchants to \nour solutions.  Such implementations or migrations (collectively referred to hereafter in this section as “implementations”), regardless of whether \nthey involve new solutions or new customers, have become increasingly more difficult because of the sophistication, complexity, \ninterdependencies of the various software and network environments, and the impact to our customers’ and merchants’ underlying business \nprocesses.  In addition, the complexity of the implementations increases when the arrangement includes other vendors participating in the project, \nincluding but not limited to, prime and subcontractor relationships with our company.  For these reasons, implementations subject our customers \nand merchants to potential business disruption, which could cause them to delay or even cancel future implementations.  \nAs a result, there is a risk that we may experience cancellations, delays, or unexpected costs associated with implementations.  In addition, our \ninability to complete implementations in an efficient and effective manner could damage our reputation in the global marketplace, adversely \nimpacting our financial results and/or reducing our opportunity to grow our organic business with both new and existing customers and merchants. \n12"

      "text": "We May Not Be Successful in the Integration or Achievement of Financial Targets of Our Acquisitions. \nAs part of our growth strategy, we seek to acquire assets, technology, access to new markets, human capital talent and businesses which will \nprovide the technology and personnel to expedite our solutions and services development efforts, provide complementary solutions, or provide \naccess to new markets and customers. \nAcquisitions involve a number of risks and potential disruptions, including: (i) expansion into new markets and business ventures; (ii) the \nrequirement to understand local business practices; (iii) the diversion of management’s attention to the integration of acquired operations and \npersonnel; (iv) being bound by acquired customer or vendor contracts with unfavorable terms; and (v) potential adverse effects on a company’s \noperating results for various reasons, including, but not limited to, the following items: (a) the inability to achieve financial targets; (b) the inability \nto achieve certain integration expectations, operating goals, and synergies; (c) costs incurred to exit current or acquired contracts or restructuring \nactivities; (d) costs incurred to service acquisition debt, if any; and (e) the amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets. \nDue to the multiple risks and potential disruptions associated with any acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in \nachieving our expected strategic, operating, and financial goals for any such acquisition(s).\nWe May Not Be Able to Respond to Rapid Technological Changes. \nThe market for our solutions is characterized by rapid changes in technology and is highly competitive with respect to the need for timely \ninnovations and new product and technology introductions.  As a result, we believe that our future success in sustaining and growing our revenue \ndepends upon: (i) our ability to continuously expand, adapt, modify, maintain, and operate our solutions to address the increasingly complex and \nevolving needs of our customers without sacrificing the reliability or quality of the solutions; (ii) the integration of acquired technologies and their \nwidely distributed, complex worldwide operations; and (iii) creating and maintaining an integrated suite of products and technologies which are \nportable to new verticals.  In addition, the market is demanding that our solutions have greater architectural flexibility and interoperability, and that \nwe are able to meet the demands for technological advancements to our solutions at a greater pace.  Our attempts to meet these demands \nsubject our R&D efforts to greater risks.  As a result, substantial and effective R&D and solution investment will be required to maintain the \ncompetitiveness of our solutions in the market.  Technical problems may arise in developing, maintaining, integrating, and operating our solutions \nas the complexities continue to increase.  Development projects can be lengthy and costly, and may be subject to changing requirements, \nprogramming difficulties, a shortage of qualified personnel, and/or unforeseen factors which can result in delays.  In addition, we may be \nresponsible for the implementation of new solutions and/or the conversion of customers to new solutions, and depending upon the specific \nsolution, we may also be responsible for operations of the solution. \nThere is an inherent risk in the successful development, implementation, migration, integration, and operation of our solutions as the technological \ncomplexities, and the pace at which we must deliver these solutions to market, continue to increase.  The risk of making an error that causes \nsignificant operational disruption to a customer, or results in incorrect processing of customer or vendor data that we perform on behalf of our \ncustomers, increases proportionately with the frequency and complexity of changes to our solutions and new delivery models.  There can be no \nassurance: (i) of continued market acceptance of our solutions; (ii) that we will be successful in the development of enhancements or new \nsolutions that respond to technological advances or changing customer needs at the pace the market demands; or (iii) that we will be successful \nin supporting the implementation, conversion, integration, and/or operations of enhancements or new solutions. \nWe May Incur Material Restructuring or Reorganization Charges in the Future. \nIn the past, we have recorded restructuring and reorganization charges related to involuntary employee terminations, various facility \nabandonments, and various other restructuring and reorganization activities.  We continually evaluate ways to reduce our operating expenses \nthrough restructuring plans, including more effective utilization of our assets, workforce, and operating facilities.  As a result, there is a risk, which \nis increased during economic downturns and with expanded global operations, that we may incur material restructuring or reorganization charges \nin the future. \n13"

      "text": "We Rely on A Limited Number of Third-Party Vendor Relationships to Execute Our Business Which Exposes Us to Supply Chain \nDisruptions, Cost Increases, and Cyberattacks.\nWe rely on third-party providers for software, distributed computing infrastructure environments (or commonly referred to as “cloud” computing \nservices), processing, and other suppliers to deliver our solutions to our customers.  Our ability to deliver according to our contractual \ncommitments and market demands depends significantly on being able to obtain the necessary licenses, components, computing capacity, and \nother vital services and supplies as needed and on competitive terms.  Our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our \nability to obtain timely deliveries from our suppliers and partners.  In addition, if a third party were to experience a material breach of their \ninformation technology systems which results in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction, or unauthorized disclosures of customers' or \nemployees' data or confidential information of the Company stored in such systems, including through cyberattacks or other external or internal \nmethods, it could result in a material loss of revenue from the potential adverse impact to our reputation, our ability to retain or attract new \ncustomers, potential disruption or loss of services from the vendor and disruption to our business.  Such a breach could also result in contractual \nclaims, and it could lead to our being named as a party in litigation brought by or on behalf of impacted individuals.  Although we strive to avoid \nsingle-source supplier solutions, this is not always possible.  Failure by any of our third-party vendors could interrupt our operations and the \ndelivery of our solutions, and/or substantially increase our costs.  Additionally, if these third-party vendors would decide to significantly increase \nour costs, due to inflationary pressures or otherwise, it could have an adverse financial impact to our business as we may have limited third-party \noptions and the ability to shift to a competing solution, or redesign our solutions would take considerable time, effort, and money.  \nOur Global Operations Subject Us to Additional Risks. \nWe currently conduct a portion of our business outside the U.S. We are subject to certain risks associated with operating globally including the \nfollowing items: \n•\nOur solutions may not meet local or legal requirements; \n•\nFluctuations and unexpected changes in foreign currency exchange rates that may be due to inflation and interest rate spreads;\n•\nStaffing and managing of our global operations at a reasonable cost; \n•\nLonger sales cycles for new contracts; \n•\nLonger collection cycles for customer billings or accounts receivable, as well as heightened customer collection risks, especially in \ncountries with high inflation rates and/or restrictions on the movement of cash out of the country; \n•\nTrade barriers; \n•\nGovernmental and economic sanctions; \n•\nComplying with varied legal and regulatory requirements across jurisdictions; \n•\nGrowing requirements related to human rights and occupational safety and health;\n•\nReduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; \n•\nInability to recover value added taxes and/or goods and services taxes in foreign jurisdictions; \n•\nPolitical and financial instability and threats of terrorism and/or war;  \n•\nA potential adverse impact to our overall effective income tax rate resulting from, among other things: \no\nOperations in foreign countries with higher tax rates than the U.S.; \no\nThe inability to utilize certain foreign tax credits; and \no\nThe inability to utilize some or all of losses generated in one or more foreign countries. \nOne or any combination of these or other risks could have an adverse impact on our operations and business.\n14"

      "text": "Failure to Deal Effectively with Fraud, Fictitious Transactions, Bad Transactions, and Negative Experiences Could Increase Our Loss \nRate and Harm Our Payments Business, and Could Severely Diminish Merchant and Consumer Confidence in and Use of Our Services. \nIn the event that merchants do not fulfill their obligations to consumers, or a consumer disputes a transaction for various reasons, we may incur \nlosses as a result of chargebacks and/or claims from consumers.  We would seek to recover such losses from the merchant; however, we may \nnot be able to recover the amounts in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay or the deposit does not cover the damages.  While we have \nestablished financial reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves for \nindividual merchants may be insufficient.  We may also incur losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase, from consumer \nfraud, from erroneous transactions, and as a result of consumers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in their bank accounts \nto satisfy payments.  In addition, if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, we could lose the ability to \nprocess credit card transactions, which would significantly impact our payments business.  We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk \nof fraud, including underwriting and risk management procedures and processes.  These measures need to be continually updated to address \nemerging means of perpetrating fraud or to accommodate new solution offerings, but the increase in costs could adversely impact our business. \nOur Use of Open Source Software May Subject Us to Certain Intellectual Property-Related Claims or Require Us to Re-Engineer Our \nSoftware, Which Could Harm Our Business.\nWe use open source software in connection with our solutions, processes, and technology.  Companies that use or incorporate open source \nsoftware into their solutions have, from time to time, faced claims challenging their use, ownership and/or licensing rights associated with that \nopen source software.  As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming certain rights to what we believe to be open source software.  \nSome open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of \nthe source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code available on unfavorable terms or at no cost. In addition \nto risks related to license requirements, use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as \nopen source licensors generally do not provide warranties, support, or controls with respect to origin of the software.  Use of open source \nsoftware also complicates compliance with export-related laws.  While we take measures to protect our use of open source software in our \nsolutions, and comply with applicable laws, open source license terms may be ambiguous, and many of the risks associated with usage of open \nsource software cannot be eliminated.  If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to release our \nproprietary source code, re-engineer our software, discontinue the sale of certain solutions in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished \non a timely basis, or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts. \nFailure to Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights or Claims by Others That We Infringe Their Intellectual Property Rights Could \nSubstantially Harm Our Business, Financial Position and Results of Operations. \nWe rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, and patent laws in the U.S. and similar laws in other countries, and non-\ndisclosure, confidentiality, and other types of contractual arrangements to establish, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights in our \nsolutions.  Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or misappropriated.  \nFurther, our contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information or provide an adequate remedy in the \nevent of unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information.  Others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, \nwhich may complicate our assertion of trade secret rights against such parties.  Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to \nenforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our \ncompetitive business position.  In addition, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.  \nTherefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying or \nuse, which could adversely affect our competitive position. \nAlthough we hold a limited number of patents and patent applications on some of our solutions, we do not rely upon patents as a primary means \nof protecting our rights in our intellectual property.  In any event, there can be no assurance that our patent applications will be approved, any \nissued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property, or such patents will not be challenged by third parties.  Also, much of our business \nand many of our solutions rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain \nlicenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms. \nFinally, third parties may claim that we, our customers, licensees or other parties indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property \nrights.  Even if we believe that such claims are without merit, they can be time consuming and costly to defend and distract management and \ntechnical staff attention and resources.  Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected solutions, enter into \ncostly settlement or license agreements or pay material damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from \nmarketing or selling certain of our solutions.  Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be \nunable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on reasonable pricing terms or at all, or \nsubstitute similar technology from another source, our business could be adversely impacted.  Our failure to adequately establish, maintain, and \nprotect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n15"

      "text": "Our Alliances with Strategic Partners Could Put Our Business at Risk if the Partner Does Not Perform as Expected.\nWe rely on long-term strategic partnerships and alliances with leading industry participants to develop new technologies, deliver large customer \nimplementations and products, and execute strategic growth.  If our strategic partners encounter financial or other business difficulties, if their \nstrategic objectives change, or if they no longer perceive us to be an attractive alliance partner, they may no longer desire or be able to participate \nin our partnerships and alliances.  Our business could be hurt if we are unable to continue one or more of our alliances.  We participate in large \nprojects where various other companies provide services and products that are integrated into systems to meet customer requirements.  If any of \nthe services or products that any other company provides have any defects or problems causing the integrated systems to malfunction or \notherwise fail to meet customer requirements, our reputation and business could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur Business is Highly Dependent on the Global Communications Industry. \nSince a large percentage of our revenue is generated from customers that operate within the global communications industry, we are highly \ndependent on the health and the business trends occurring within this industry (in particular for our North American cable and satellite customers).  \nKey factors within this industry that could potentially impact our customers’ businesses, and thus, our business, are as follows: \n•\nKey Market Conditions:  The global communications industry has undergone significant fluctuations in growth rates and capital \ninvestment cycles in the past decade. \nIn addition, changes in demand for traditional services for CSPs are causing them to seek new revenue sources, while also \nmanaging their cost structure and quality of service delivery during their business transformation.  The result is that many CSPs are \ndelaying investment decisions on legacy systems, directing investment towards internal development and engineering efforts and \nmaking investments in new solutions to drive their business forward into new areas.  However, cost pressures and/or our ability to \ndevelop solutions to meet their future needs may begin to cause a decline in new revenue opportunities and adversely impact our \nbusiness. \n•\nMarket Consolidation:  The pace of consolidation within the industry continues to accelerate as CSPs look to increase the scale of \ntheir operations and footprint within the entire digital communications ecosystem.   Potential byproducts of this consolidation that \ncould impact us are as follows: (i) there could be fewer providers in the market, each with potentially greater bargaining power and \neconomic leverage due to their larger size, which may result in our having to lower our prices to remain competitive, retain our \nmarket share, or comply with the surviving customer’s current more favorable contract terms; and (ii) the controlling entity in a \nconsolidation that is not our current customer, may acquire one of our existing customers and choose to consolidate both entities \nonto the controlling entity’s customer management platform, thus reducing and possibly eliminating our business with our existing \ncustomer. \nAlso, as consolidated entities execute on their revenue and operational synergies, there is generally a slowdown in decision-making \non discretionary spending and/or on new business initiatives which could adversely impact our quarterly and annual financial results.  \n•\nCompetition:  Our customers operate in a highly competitive environment.  Our competitors include companies who deliver on-\npremise bespoke custom offerings (i.e., Amdocs Limited, NEC Netcracker), software solutions (i.e., Salesforce, Adobe, \nPegasystems, Twilio), internally developed enterprise applications, network operators (i.e., Ericsson, Huawei), large outsourced \ntransactional communications companies (i.e., Intrado, Fiserv), systems integrators (i.e., Accenture, Tech Mahindra) and large \npayments processors (i.e., FIS and Fiserv) and payments specialists (i.e., Stripe and Nuvei/Paya).  Should these competitors be \nsuccessful in their strategies, it could threaten our customers’ market share, pricing power, and level of services delivered.  These \nthreats could negatively impact our customers’ revenue, putting pressure on our source of revenue, as generally speaking, these \ncompanies do not use our core solutions and there can be no assurance that new entrants will become our customers.  In addition, \ndemand for spectrum, network bandwidth and content continue to increase and any changes in the regulatory environment could \nhave a significant impact to not only our customers’ businesses, but in our ability to help our customers be successful. \nThe above industry factors are impacting our customers’ businesses, and thus could cause delays, cancellations/loss of business, and/or \ndownward pricing pressure on our sales and services.  This could cause us to either fall short of revenue expectations or have a cost model that \nis misaligned with revenue.  \n16"

      "text": "We Face Significant Competition in Our Industry. \nThe market for our solutions is highly competitive.  We directly compete with both independent providers and in-house solutions developed by \nexisting and potential customers.  In addition, some independent providers are entering into strategic alliances with other independent providers, \nresulting in either new competitors, or competitors with greater resources.  Many of our current and potential competitors have significantly \ngreater financial, marketing, technical, and other competitive resources than our Company, many with significant and well-established domestic \nand international operations.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new \ncompetitors. \nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nThe Occurrence or Perception of a Security Breach or Disclosure of Confidential Personally Identifiable Information Could Harm Our \nBusiness.\nIn providing solutions to our customers, we transmit, use, store and otherwise process, confidential and personally identifiable information (“PII”) \nincluding health, financial, and other personal information.  Our treatment of such information is subject to contractual restrictions and federal, \nstate, and foreign data privacy laws and regulations, which continue to evolve resulting in greater scrutiny and regulation over the protection of \nPII. \nIn response to these evolving restrictions and regulations (which include, without limitation, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \n(“HIPAA”), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), \nthe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), and other U.S. federal and state financial privacy laws and regulations, the European Union’s General \nData Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the South Africa Protection of Personal Information Act (“POPIA”) and the Brazilian General Data \nProtection Low (“LGPD”)), we have implemented and maintain administrative, technical, and physical security measures and it is our standard \npractice to contractually require our service providers to whom we disclose data (including PII) to implement and maintain reasonable privacy, \ndata protection, and information security measures, in each case to protect against loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized access to or disclosure of \nsuch information, and otherwise comply with these laws and regulations.  These measures include standard industry practices (e.g., payment \ncard industry (“PCI”) requirements), periodic security reviews of our systems by independent parties, secure development practices, network \nfirewalls, policy directives, procedural controls, training of our personnel, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus applications.  However, due to \nthe inherent risks and complexities of defending against cybercrime and other information security incidents, these measures may fail to \nadequately protect this information. Any failure on our part to protect the security and privacy of PII and other confidential information, or \notherwise comply with data privacy laws and regulations may subject us to contractual liability and damages, loss of business, damages from \nindividual claimants (including class action litigation), substantial fines/penalties, criminal prosecution, and unfavorable publicity. \nEven the mere perception of a security breach or inadvertent disclosure of PII could damage our reputation and inhibit market acceptance of our \nsolutions.  In addition, third-party vendors that we engage to perform services for us may unintentionally release PII or otherwise fail to comply \nwith applicable laws and regulations.  Under our terms of service and our contracts with customers, if there is a breach of PII that we process, we \ncould be liable to the customer for their losses and related expenses.  As new laws and regulations emerge and evolve and as our business \ncontinues to expand to include new products and technologies, these risks will likely continue to increase, and our compliance costs are likely to \nincrease substantially as well.  Bad actors, individual and State sponsored, will increasingly attempt to compromise our security controls or gain \nunauthorized access to our, and our customers’, sensitive information and PII.  Further, because a significant number of our employees work \nremotely, these security risks may increase.  We have implemented heightened monitoring of our Networks and Systems, but cannot guarantee \nthat our efforts, or those of third parties on whom we rely or with whom we partner, will be successful in preventing any such information security \nincidents or attacks.\nWe May Be Subject to Enforcement Actions or Financial Penalties with Payments Regulation in the U.S.  \nMany states in which we operate have laws that govern payments activities and have implemented various definitions and licensing requirements \nfor entities deemed to be money transmitters, including licensure.  We have applied for and been issued money transmitter licenses in a majority \nof states, and for those states where we have applied and not yet received licensure, we could be subject to enforcement actions and financial \npenalties and other costs.  An enforcement action could result in restrictions on, or a prohibition on engaging in, the business of money \ntransmission in one or more states and it could delay or prevent us from obtaining a money transmitter license in one or more states.  \nEnforcement actions could also result in reputational harm to our business and force us to cease or limit certain aspects of our business or \nprevent us from growing our business.  Further, laws governing payments activities may evolve and changes in such law could affect our ability to \nprovide our solutions or services in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all.  \n17"

      "text": "There are substantial costs and potential solution changes involved in maintaining such licenses, and we could be subject to fines or other \nenforcement action if we are found to have violated applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including those related to licensing \nand supervision, anti-money laundering, the Bank Secrecy Act, financial privacy, and cybersecurity and data security.  These factors could impose \nsubstantial additional costs and involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our solutions or services, or could require \nsignificant and costly operational changes or prevent us from providing our solutions or services in a given market.  These limitations may \nadversely affect our ability to grow our business. \nWe may also be subject to card association and network rules and requirements, and violations of such rules and requirements could result in \nfines or the inability to use third-party networks to conduct our business.\nWe Are Subject to Various Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Laws and Regulations. \nWe are subject to various anti-money laundering (“AML”) and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations that prohibit, among other things, \nour involvement in processing the proceeds of criminal activities.  We maintain AML Compliance Policies and Procedures applicable to our \npayments processing business which policies are intended to comply with any applicable U.S. federal and foreign requirements.  The laws or their \napplication, our interpretation of the laws, and/or our services may change so that we could be subject to additional regulation and incur additional \ncosts of compliance.  We may not be able to meet additional regulatory requirements or the cost of adhering to such requirements could be \nsubstantial or could severely impact our ability to continue to maintain and/or grow our payments processing business or retain merchants or \npartners.  The regulations of other countries and/or any increased compliance costs associated with such regulations, could prevent us from \nentering new markets for our services.\nOur Global Operations Require Us to Comply With Applicable U.S. and International Laws and Regulations. \nDoing business on a global basis requires our Company and our subsidiaries to comply with the laws and the regulations of the U.S. government \nand various international jurisdictions.  In addition, the number of countries enacting anti-corruption laws and related enforcement activities is \nincreasing.  These regulations place restrictions on our operations, trade practices and trade partners, as such we may face increasing \ncompliance and legal costs in operating our trade compliance program.  In particular, our global operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-\ncorruption laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act and economic sanction programs \nadministered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”).  \nThe FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining \nbusiness.  In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, \nwhich are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the \nestablishment of “off books” slush funds from which such improper payment can be made.  As part of our business, we regularly deal with state-\nowned business enterprises, the employees of which are considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA.  In addition, some of the \ninternational locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have higher than normal levels of corruption.  We inform our \npersonnel and third-party sales representatives of the requirements of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws, including, but not limited to their \nreporting requirements.  We have also developed and will continue to develop and implement systems for formalizing contracting processes, \nperforming due diligence on agents and partners while improving our recordkeeping and auditing practices regarding these regulations.  However, \nthere is no guarantee that our employees, third-party sales representatives or other agents have not or will not engage in conduct undetected by \nour processes and for which we might be held responsible under the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws. \nEconomic sanctions programs restrict our business dealings with certain countries and individuals.  As a global provider, we are exposed to a \nheightened risk of violating OFAC regulations.  Violations of these laws and regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, \ninjunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and \nimprisonment.  While we actively screen and monitor the global companies and individuals that we do business with, utilizing a risk-based \napproach, there is no guarantee that we have not or will not, through the lack of accurate information, changing customer business structures, \nprocess failure, oversight, or error, have violations occur.\n18"

      "text": "General Risks\nOur Business May be Disrupted and Our Results of Operations and Cash Flows May be Adversely Affected by a Global Pandemic.\nThe significance of the impact of a global pandemic on our operations depends on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to \naccurately predict or effectively respond to, including, among others:\n•\nthe effect on global economic activity and the resulting impact on our customer’s businesses, their credit and liquidity, and their \ndemand for our solutions and services, as well as their ability to pay;\n•\nour ability to deliver and implement our solutions in a timely manner, including as a result of supply chain disruptions and related cost \nincreases; and \n•\nactions taken by U.S., foreign, state, and local governments, suppliers, and individuals in response to the outbreak.\nWhile we have significant sources of cash and liquidity and access to a committed credit line, a prolonged period of generating lower cash from \noperations could adversely affect our financial condition and the achievement of our strategic objectives.\nFailure to Attract and Retain Our Key Management and Other Highly Skilled Personnel Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our \nBusiness. \nOur future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key management, sales, product development, professional services, \nand operational personnel.  We believe that our future success also depends on our ability to attract and retain a diverse, highly skilled technical, \nmanagerial, operational, and sales and marketing personnel, including, in particular, personnel in the areas of R&D, professional services, and \ntechnical support.  Competition for qualified personnel at times can be intense, particularly in the areas of R&D, conversions, software \nimplementations, and technical support which could lead to increased costs to attract and/or retain personnel.  This risk is heightened with a \nwidely dispersed customer base and employee populations, and potential inflationary pressures on wages.  For these reasons, we may not be \nsuccessful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments \nand new solution delivery objectives. \nVariability of Our Quarterly Revenue and Our Failure to Meet Revenue and Earnings Expectations Would Negatively Affect the Market \nPrice of Our Common Stock.\nFrom time to time, we may experience variability in quarterly revenue and operating results. Common causes of failure to meet revenue and \noperating profit expectations include, among others:\n•\nInability to close and/or recognize revenue on certain transactions in the period originally anticipated;\n•\nInability to accurately forecast payments transaction volumes and related transaction costs;\n•\nDelays in renewal of multiple or individually significant agreements;\n•\nInability to renew existing customer or vendor arrangements at anticipated rates;\n•\nDelays in timing of initiation and/or implementation of significant projects or arrangements;\n•\nInability to meet customer expectations materially within our cost estimates;\n•\nChanges in spending and investment levels;\n•\nInflationary pressures;\n•\nSignificant increase in our cost of borrowing;\n•\nForeign currency fluctuations; and\n•\nEconomic and political conditions.\nShould we fail to meet our revenue and earnings expectations of the investment community, by even a relatively small amount, it could have a \ndisproportionately negative impact upon the market price of our common stock.\n19"

Long-lived assets are required to be evaluated for \npossible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.  We \nutilize our market capitalization, third party valuation and/or cash flow models as the primary basis to estimate the fair value amounts used in our \nlong-lived asset impairment valuations.

As a result, our year-over-year results of operations may not be comparable \nbetween years due to the timing of the transactions.  The comparable differences have been described below where relevant or significant.\nThe 2021 acquired businesses have been operating at a lower operating margin than our organic business operations as time is required to \nrealize the expected synergies, thus, having a dilutive impact on our operating results.  In June 2022, our management team, with the support of \nour Board, decided to dissolve the MobileCard business as it was not meeting its projected targets.  See Note 8 to our Financial Statements for \nfurther details of the dissolution of MobileCard.\n24"

Revenue for 2022 was $1,089.8 million, a 4.1% increase when compared to $1,046.5 million for 2021, with the increase primarily \nattributed to the continued growth of our revenue management solutions, as over three-fourths of the increase was attributed to organic growth.\nOperating Results.  Operating income for 2022 was $78.7 million, or a 7.2% operating income margin percentage, compared to $124.2 million, or \nan 11.9% operating income margin percentage for 2021.  The decrease in operating income in 2022 can be mainly attributed to the $41.4 million \nincrease in restructuring and reorganization charges related mainly to an operating margin improvement initiative that began in the second quarter \nof 2022.\nDiluted Earnings Per Share (“EPS”).  Diluted EPS for 2022 was $1.41 compared to $2.26 for 2021, with the decrease mainly attributed to the \nincrease in restructuring and reorganization charges, discussed further below. \nBalance Sheet and Cash Flows.  As of December 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $150.4 million, \ncompared to $233.7 million as of December 31, 2021.  Cash flows from operating activities for 2022 were $63.6 million, compared to $140.2 \nmillion for 2021.  See the Liquidity section below for further discussion of our cash flows.\n25"

      "text": "Significant Customer Relationships \nA large percentage of our historical revenue has been generated from our two largest customers, which are Charter Communications Inc. \n(“Charter”) and Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”).\nCharter.  For 2022 and 2021, revenue from Charter was $221 million, for both periods, representing approximately 20% and 21%, respectively, of \nour total revenue.  Our agreement with Charter runs through December 31, 2027, and will automatically be extended for an additional one-year \nterm, subject to Charter achieving certain conditional processing minimums on July 1, 2027, unless Charter provides us with written notice of non-\nrenewal.\nDuring 2021 and 2022, Charter migrated approximately five million customer accounts and nine million customer accounts, respectively, onto our \nplatforms from a competitor's product, substantially completing the consolidation of Charter's residential and small and medium business internet, \nvideo, and landline voice customer accounts.\nA copy of the Charter agreement and related amendments, with confidential information redacted, is included in the exhibits to this Form 10-K. \nComcast.  For 2022 and 2021, revenue from Comcast was $214 million and $216 million, respectively, representing approximately 20% and 21% \nof our total revenue.  Our agreement with Comcast runs through December 31, 2024 for processing and other related solutions, and through \nDecember 31, 2025 for print and mail services for residential customer accounts, with the option to extend the processing agreement for an \nadditional one-year term.\nA copy of the Comcast agreement and related amendments, with confidential information redacted, is included in the exhibits to this Form 10-K. \nStock-Based Compensation Expense \nStock-based compensation expense is included in the following captions in our Income Statements as follows (in thousands): \n \n \n \n2022\n   \n2021\n   \nCost of revenue\n  $\n4,706     $\n4,561    \nResearch and development\n   \n3,744      \n3,276    \nSelling, general and administrative\n   \n19,495      \n13,743    \nRestructuring and reorganization charges\n   \n(702 )    \n(180 )  \nTotal stock-based compensation expense\n  $\n27,243     $\n21,400    \nThe increase in stock-based compensation expense between years is mainly due to:  (i) our 2022 awards having a higher grant date \nfair value and the time-based awards having a three-year vest term (as compared to previous grants having a four-year vest term); (ii) \nthe full year impact of performance-based awards issued in the fourth quarter of 2021; and (iii) our 2021 performance-based awards \ntracking above their performance objectives.\nSee Notes 2 and 13 to our Financial Statements for additional discussion of our stock-based compensation expense. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to select \nappropriate accounting policies, and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies.  In applying our \naccounting policies, different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in our \nFinancial Statements. \nWe have identified the most critical accounting policies that affect our financial position and the results of our operations.  These critical \naccounting policies were determined by considering our accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or \nassessments.  Our most critical accounting policies identified relate to:  (i) revenue recognition; (ii) impairment assessments of long-lived assets; \n(iii) income taxes; and (iv) loss contingencies. These critical accounting policies, as well as our other significant accounting policies, are disclosed \nin the notes to our Financial Statements. \n26"

      "text": "Revenue Recognition.  Revenue is recognized upon conclusion that a contract with a customer exists. Such conclusion is made by us when the \ncontract is legally enforceable and certain criteria, including collectability, are met.  In making our determination of collectability, we consider a \nnumber of factors depending upon the specific aspects of an arrangement, which may include, but is not limited to, the following items: (i) an \nassessment of the customer’s specific credit worthiness, evidenced by its current financial position and/or recent operating results, credit ratings, \nand/or a bankruptcy filing status (as applicable); (ii) the customer’s current accounts receivable status and/or its historical payment patterns with \nus (as applicable); (iii) the economic condition of the industry in which the customer conducts the majority of its business; and/or (iv) the economic \nconditions and/or political stability of the country or region in which the customer is domiciled and/or conducts the majority of its business.  The \nevaluation of these factors, and the ultimate determination of collectability, requires significant judgments to be made by us.  Our judgments could \nhave a significant effect to the amount and timing of revenue recognized in any period.\nOur contracts with customers include SaaS based revenue management platform arrangements, managed services arrangements, SaaS \npayments platform arrangements, software license and service arrangements, professional services arrangements, and bundled service \narrangements.  The revenue recognition policies that involve the most complex and subjective decisions or assessments that may have a material \nimpact on our operations relate to the accounting for revenue management platform arrangements, software license and service arrangements, \nand bundled service arrangements.\nOur SaaS based revenue management platform arrangements are complex agreements that typically include multiple performance obligations.  \nKey factors considered in accounting for these arrangements include the following criteria:  (i) identification of performance obligations within the \ncontract; (ii) determination of the transaction price given the variable nature of the consideration, if any, and significance of the consideration; (iii) \ndetermination of stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation and the allocation of value between the performance obligations; and \n(iv) calculation of revenue recognized in each period. The evaluation of these factors and ultimate revenue recognition decision requires \nsignificant judgements to be made by us.  Depending on the significance of variable consideration, if any, number of solutions/services, complex \npricing structures and long-term nature of these types of contracts, our judgements and estimates made in this area could have a significant effect \non the amount and timing of revenue recognized in any period.  In addition, certain solutions and arrangements require us to assess whether we \nare a principal to the transaction (gross revenue) or an agent to the transaction (net revenue). Such assessments can have a significant effect on \nthe amount of total revenue recognized.\nOur software license, maintenance and other professional services arrangements may include multiple performance obligations which may be \ncomplex and require considerable judgement.  Key factors considered in accounting for these arrangements include the following criteria:  (i) \nidentification of performance obligations within the contract; (ii) assessment of whether services included in the arrangement represent significant \nproduction, modification or customization of the software (as applicable), such that the delivery of the software license and other professional \nservices required to implement the software represent one combined performance obligation; (iii) determination of the transaction price for the \ncontract as these types of arrangements may include both fixed and variable consideration; (iv) determination of stand-alone selling price for each \nperformance obligation including the allocation of value between performance obligations; and (v) estimates to measure progress for delivery.  \nThe evaluation of these factors and ultimate revenue recognition decision requires significant judgements to be made by us.  We generally \ndetermine stand-alone selling prices using pricing calculations (which include regional market factors) for our software license fees and \nmaintenance, and cost-plus margins for services.  The pricing calculations can be complex and require estimates based on volumes. Additionally, \nour use of an hours-based method of accounting for software license and other professional services performance obligations that are satisfied \nover time requires estimates of total project revenue and costs, along with the expected hours necessary to complete a project.  Changes in \nestimates as a result of additional information as work progresses on a project are inherent characteristics of this method of revenue recognition \nas we are exposed to business risks in completing these types of performance obligations.  The estimation process to support our hours-based \nrecognition method is more difficult for projects of greater length and/or complexity.  Our judgments and estimates could:  (i) have a significant \neffect on revenue recognized in any period by changing the amount and/or the timing of the revenue recognized; and/or (ii) impact the expected \nprofitability of a project, including whether an overall loss on an arrangement has occurred.\nOur contracts are subject to modification via amendment, change requests, and/or statement of works.  Such modifications may occur frequently.  \nThe accounting for contract modifications is complex and requires significant judgements to be made by us as to whether the contract \nmodification is treated as either a separate contract or part of the existing contract.  Our judgements could have a significant effect on the revenue \nrecognized in any period by changing the amount and/or timing of the revenue recognized.\nOur contracts typically include service level agreements or other incentives which may result in refunds or credits to our customers.  Failure to \nmeet service level standards under the terms of the contract represent adjustments to the overall consideration (reductions in revenue) and may \nneed to be estimated at the outset of the arrangement as part of the overall variable consideration.  Such estimates require significant judgement \nby us and may impact the amount and/or timing of the revenue recognized.\n27"

      "text": "Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets.  Long-lived assets relate primarily to property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, \nsoftware, acquired customer contracts, and customer contract costs.  These assets are required to be evaluated for possible impairment as \nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.  A long-lived asset (or group of \nlong-lived assets) is impaired if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with that asset, without consideration of interest, are \ninsufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long-lived asset.  Once deemed impaired, even if by $1, the long-lived asset is written down to its \nfair value which could be considerably less than the carrying amount or future undiscounted cash flows.  The determination of estimated future \ncash flows and, if required, the determination of the fair value of a long-lived asset, are by their nature, highly subjective judgments.  Changes to \none or more of the assumptions utilized in such an analysis could materially affect our impairment conclusions for long-lived assets. \nIncome Taxes.  We are required to estimate our income tax liability in each jurisdiction in which we operate, including U.S. federal, state, and \nforeign income taxes. \nVarious judgments are required in evaluating our income tax positions and determining our provisions for income taxes.  We regularly assess the \nlikelihood of the future realization of our deferred income tax assets.  To the extent we believe that it is not more likely than not that a deferred \nincome tax asset will be realized, a valuation allowance is established.  During the ordinary course of our business, there are certain transactions \nand calculations for which the ultimate income tax determination may be uncertain.  In addition, we may be subject to examination of our income \ntax returns by various tax authorities which could result in adverse outcomes.  For these reasons, we establish a liability associated with \nunrecognized tax benefits based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest may be due.  We adjust this liability based upon changing \nfacts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the closing of a tax year upon the expiration of a statute of limitations, or the \nrefinement of an estimate. Should any of the factors considered in determining the adequacy of this liability change significantly, an adjustment to \nthe liability may be necessary. Due to the potential significance of these issues, such an adjustment could be material. \nOne of the more complex items within our income tax expense is the determination of our annual research and experimentation income tax credit \n(“R&D tax credit”).  We have incurred approximately $120 - $140 million annually in R&D expense over the last three years.  The calculation of the \nR&D tax credit involves the identification of qualifying projects, as well as an estimation of the qualifying costs for such projects.  Due to the size, \nnature, and the number of projects worked on in any given year, the calculation can become complex and certain judgments are necessary in \ndetermining the amount of the R&D tax credits claimed. \nLoss Contingencies.  In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to potential claims related to various items including but not limited to the \nfollowing:  (i) legal and regulatory matters; (ii) vendor contracts; (iii) solution and service delivery matters; and (iv) labor matters.  Accounting and \ndisclosure requirements for loss contingencies requires us to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments in or range of potential outcomes for \nthese matters. A determination of the amount of reserves for such contingencies, if any, is based on an analysis of the issues, often with the \nassistance of legal counsel.  The evaluation of such issues, and our ultimate accounting and disclosure decisions, are by their nature, subject to \nvarious estimates and highly subjective judgments. Should any of the factors considered in determining the adequacy of any required reserves \nchange significantly, an adjustment to the reserves may be necessary.  Due to the potential significance of these issues, such an adjustment \ncould be material. \nDetailed Discussion of Results of Operations \nThe following discussion includes a comparison of our results of operations and liquidity for 2022 compared to 2021.  For a discussion of the 2021 \ncompared to 2020, please refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in \nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 18, 2022.\nTotal Revenue. Total revenue for 2022 was $1,089.8 million, a 4.1% increase when compared to $1,046.5 million for 2021.  The increase in total \nrevenue can be primarily attributed to the continued growth of our revenue management solutions, as over three-fourths of the increase was \nattributed to organic growth.  This resulted mainly from increased payments volumes, conversions of customer accounts onto our solutions, other \nancillary services, and increased revenue related to implementation projects.  During 2022, we successfully converted onto our solutions \napproximately six million Charter customer accounts in June and an additional three million Charter customer accounts in November.\nWe use the location of the customer as the basis of attributing revenue to individual countries and corresponding geographic region.  Revenue by \ngeographic region for 2022 and 2021 was as follows (in thousands):\n \n \n2022\n \n \n2021\n \nAmericas (principally the U.S.)\n \n$\n928,096  \n  $\n887,428  \nEurope, Middle East, and Africa\n \n \n115,980  \n   \n117,431  \nAsia Pacific\n \n \n45,676  \n   \n41,628  \nTotal revenue\n \n$\n1,089,752  \n  $\n1,046,487  \n28"

      "text": "Total Operating Expenses.  Our operating expenses for 2022 increased 9.6% to $1,011.0 million, from $922.3 million for 2021.  The increase in \noperating expenses can mainly be attributed to increased restructuring and reorganization costs, discussed below, the full-year impact of the \nadditional expenses from the 2021 acquired businesses, inflationary and supply-chain pressures, increased staffing related to recently closed \nlarge deals and future projects, and increased travel expenses.\nCost of Revenue (Exclusive of Depreciation).  Our cost of revenue consist principally of the following:  (i) computing capacity and network \ncommunications costs; (ii) statement production costs (e.g., labor, paper, envelopes, equipment, equipment maintenance, etc.); (iii) transaction \nfees, which are primarily comprised of fees paid to third-party payment processors and financial institutions and interchange fees;  (iv) customer \nsupport organizations (e.g., our customer support call center, account management, etc.); (v) professional services organization; (vi) various \nproduct delivery and support organizations (e.g., managed services delivery, product management, product maintenance, etc.); (vii) third-party \nsoftware costs and/or royalties related to certain software products; (viii) facilities and infrastructure costs related to the statement production and \nsupport organizations; and (ix) amortization of acquired intangibles.  The costs related to new solution development (including significant \nenhancements to existing products and services) are included in R&D expense. \nThe cost of revenue for 2022 increased 4.0% to $565.2 million, from $543.2 million for 2021, reflective of the increase in revenue year-over-year, \nand can be mainly attributed to higher employee-related costs, including the full-year impact of the increased staffing from the 2021 acquired \nbusinesses.  Total cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue for 2022 and 2021 was 51.9%, for both periods. \nR&D Expense (Exclusive of Depreciation).  R&D expense for 2022 was $137.9 million, a 2.4% increase when compared to $134.7 million for \n2021, with the increase mainly attributed to the R&D activities of the 2021 acquired businesses.  \nOur R&D efforts are focused on the continued evolution of our solutions that enable our customers worldwide to provide a more personalized \ncustomer experience while introducing new digital solutions.  This includes the continued investment in our products and integration of the \nrecently acquired assets into our solutions. \nAs a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense for 2022 and 2021 was 12.7% and 12.9%, respectively.  We anticipate the level of R&D \ninvestment in the near-term to be relatively consistent with 2022.\nSG&A Expense (Exclusive of Depreciation).  SG&A expense for 2022 increased 10.9% to $238.0 million, from $214.7 million for 2021. The \nincrease in SG&A expense between 2022 and 2021 is primarily due to increases in employee-related costs, to include wage inflation, stock-based \ncompensation, and travel expense; and increased investments in items such as cyber-security, ESG and DE&I initiatives.  As a percentage of total \nrevenue, SG&A expense for 2022 and 2021 was 21.8% and 20.5%, respectively. \nDepreciation Expense.  Depreciation expense for all property and equipment is reflected separately from cost of revenue and the other \ncomponents of operating expenses.  Depreciation expense for 2022 was $23.6 million, a 4.8% decrease from $24.8 million for 2021.  As a result \nof our office space consolidation undertaken as part of our flexible work approach during 2022, we incurred $4.4 million of accelerated \ndepreciation related to leasehold improvements and machinery and equipment, which was recorded to restructuring and reorganization charges, \ndiscussed below.\nRestructuring and Reorganization Charges. In 2022 and 2021, we implemented cost reduction and efficiency initiatives that resulted in \nrestructuring and reorganization charges of $46.3 million and $4.9 million, respectively. The restructuring and reorganization charges for 2022 \nrelate mainly to the following:\n•\nreal estate restructuring charges to include impairment charges of $23.1 million and accelerated depreciation of $4.4 million, as we \ncontinue to rationalize our real estate footprint to reflect our flexible work approach;\n•\nnet impairment charges of $7.0 million recorded in the second quarter of 2022 related to the dissolution of our controlling interest in \nMobileCard, discussed above; and\n•\nreduction in workforce resulting in restructuring charges related to involuntary terminations of $7.7 million.\nSee Note 8 to our Financial Statements for additional information regarding these initiatives. \n29"

The decrease in operating income in 2022 can be mainly attributed to the increase in restructuring and \nreorganization charges related mainly to an operating margin improvement initiative that began in the second quarter of 2022, and to a lesser \ndegree, an increase in SG&A expense, discussed above.\nInterest Expense and Amortization of Original Issue Discount (“OID”).  Our interest expense relates primarily to our 2016 Convertible Notes and \nour 2021 Credit Agreement.  Interest expense for 2022 was $16.4 million, a 12.8% increase from $14.6 million for 2021, with the increase due to \nus having a higher average debt balance outstanding during 2022 and increasing interest rates in 2022 as compared to 2021.\nSee Note 5 to our Financial Statements for additional discussion of our long-term debt, to include the non-cash interest expense related to the \namortization of the OID related to our 2016 Convertible Notes. \nLoss on Derivative Liability Upon Debt Conversion.  In March 2022, we settled our 2016 Convertible Notes for approximately $242 million in cash.  \nAs a result of the conversion of the 2016 Convertible Notes, we recognized a $7.5 million loss on a derivative liability related to the change in our \nstock price over the observation period prior to settlement.  \nSee Note 5 to our Financial Statements for further discussion.\nOther, net.  Other, net for 2022 was $5.0 million of other income, an $11.0 million change when compared to $6.0 million of other expense for \n2021.  The other income in 2022 is primarily the result of foreign currency transaction gains due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar.  \nThe other expense in 2021 is primarily related to obtaining control of MobileCard at which time, the fair value of our pre-existing equity investment \nwas remeasured, resulting in a $6.2 million non-cash loss as of the acquisition date (see Note 7 to our Financial Statements).\nIncome Tax Provision.

As of December 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of \n$150.4 million, compared to $233.7 million as of December 31, 2021. We generally invest our excess cash balances in low-risk, short-term \ninvestments to limit our exposure to market and credit risks.\nAs part of our 2021 Credit Agreement, we have a $450.0 million senior secured revolving loan facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that \nexpires in September 2026, the 2021 Revolver.  As of December 31, 2022, we had $275.0 million outstanding on the 2021 Revolver.  In January \n2023 we borrowed an additional $15.0 million under the 2021 Revolver and currently have $160.0 million available to us.  The 2021 Credit \nAgreement contains customary affirmative, negative, and financial covenants.  As of December 31, 2022, and the date of this filing, we believe we \nare in compliance with the provisions of the 2021 Credit Agreement. \nOur cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances as of the end of the indicated periods were located in the following geographical \nregions (in thousands): \n \n \nDecember 31,\n   \nDecember 31,\n \n \n \n2022\n   \n2021\n \nAmericas (principally the U.S.)\n \n$\n91,569    \n$\n164,561  \nEurope, Middle East and Africa\n \n \n49,099    \n \n56,368  \nAsia Pacific\n \n \n9,768    \n \n12,743  \nTotal cash, equivalents and short-term investments\n \n$\n150,436    \n$\n233,672  \nWe generally have ready access to substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances, but may face limitations \non moving cash out of certain foreign jurisdictions due to currency controls and potential negative economic consequences. \n30"

      "text": "As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.0 million of cash restricted as to use primarily to collateralize guarantees and outstanding letters of credit \nincluded in our total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance. In addition, we had $238.7 million of settlement and merchant \nreserve assets which are deemed restricted due to contractual restrictions with the merchants and restrictions arising from our policy and \nintention.  It has historically been our policy to segregate settlement and merchant reserve assets from our operating cash balances and we \nintend to continue to do so.   \nCash Flows From Operating Activities.  We calculate our cash flows from operating activities beginning with net income, adding back the impact \nof non-cash items or non-operating activity (e.g., depreciation, amortization, amortization of OID, impairments, gain/loss from debt \nextinguishments/conversions, unrealized foreign currency transactions gain/loss, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation, etc.), and \nthen factoring in the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nOur primary source of cash is from our operating activities. Our current business model consists of a significant amount of recurring revenue \nsources related to our long-term revenue management solutions and managed services arrangements (primarily billed monthly), payments \ntransaction services (primarily billed monthly), and software maintenance agreements (which may be billed monthly, quarterly, or annually). This \nrecurring revenue base provides us with a reliable and predictable source of cash. In addition, software license fees and professional services \nrevenue are sources of cash, but the payment streams for these items are less predictable. \nThe primary use of our cash is to fund our operating activities. Over half of our total operating costs relate to labor costs (both employees and \ncontracted labor) for the following: (i) compensation; (ii) related fringe benefits; (iii) incentive compensation; and (iv) reimbursements for travel and \nentertainment expenses. Other operating expenses consist of: (i) computing capacity and related services and communication lines for our \noutsourced cloud-based business; (ii) paper, envelopes, and related supplies for our statement processing solutions; (iii) transaction fees paid in \nconjunction with the delivery of services under our payment services contracts; (iv) hardware and software maintenance; and (v) rent and related \nfacility costs. These items are purchased under a variety of both short-term and long-term contractual commitments.  A discussion of our material \ncontractual obligations is provided below. \nOur 2022 and 2021 net cash flows from operating activities, broken out between operations and changes in operating assets and liabilities, for the \nindicated quarterly periods are as follows (in thousands):\n \n \n \n   \n \n   \nNet Cash\n \n \n \n \n   \nChanges in\n   \nProvided by\n \n \n \n \n   \nOperating\n   \n(Used In) Operating\n \n \n \n \n   \nAssets and\n   \nActivities –\n \n \n \nOperations\n   \nLiabilities\n   \nTotals\n \nCash Flows from Operating Activities:\n \n     \n     \n   \n2022:\n \n     \n     \n   \nMarch 31 (1)(2)\n  $\n49,687  \n  $\n(55,236 )\n  $\n(5,549 )\nJune 30 (2)(3)\n   \n36,881  \n   \n(44,597 )\n   \n(7,716 )\nSeptember 30 (2)\n   \n35,852  \n   \n(13,014 )\n   \n22,838  \nDecember 31 (2)\n   \n37,339  \n   \n16,685  \n   \n54,024  \nTotal\n  $\n159,759  \n  $\n(96,162 )\n  $\n63,597  \n \n \n     \n     \n   \n2021:\n \n     \n     \n   \nMarch 31 (1)(4)\n  $\n49,377  \n  $\n(51,601 )\n  $\n(2,224 )\nJune 30\n   \n42,707  \n   \n1,746  \n   \n44,453  \nSeptember 30\n   \n42,197  \n   \n3,883  \n   \n46,080  \nDecember 31\n   \n44,524  \n   \n7,390  \n   \n51,914  \nTotal\n  $\n178,805  \n  $\n(38,582 )\n  $\n140,223  \n(1)\nCash flows from operating activities for the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 reflect the negative impacts of the payment of the 2021 \nand 2020 year-end accrued employee incentive compensation in the first quarter subsequent to the year-end accrual for those \nitems.\n(2)\nCash flows from operating activities were negatively impacted by the capitalization of certain R&D expenses for tax purposes, as \nrequired by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, beginning in 2022.

      "text": "Variations in our net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities are generally related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities \n(related mostly to fluctuations in timing at quarter-end of customer payments and changes in accrued expenses), and generally over longer \nperiods of time, do not significantly impact our cash flows from operations.\nSignificant fluctuations in key operating assets and liabilities between 2022 and 2021 that impacted our cash flows from operating activities are as \nfollows: \nBilled Trade Accounts Receivable \nManagement of our trade billed accounts receivable is one of the primary factors in maintaining strong cash flows from operating activities.  \nThese balances include significant billings for several non-revenue items (primarily postage, sales tax, and deferred revenue items). As a \nresult, we evaluate our performance in collecting our billed trade accounts receivable through our calculation of Days Billings Outstanding \n(“DBO”) rather than a typical Days Sales Outstanding (“DSO”) calculation. \nOur gross and net billed trade accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts receivable (“Allowance”) as of the end of \nthe indicated quarterly periods, and the related DBOs for the quarters then ended, are as follows (in thousands, except DBOs): \n \nQuarter Ended\n \nGross\n   \nAllowance\n   \nNet Billed\n   \nDBOs\n \n2022:\n \n     \n     \n     \n   \nMarch 31\n  $\n243,292     $\n(4,924 )   $\n238,368      \n70  \nJune 30\n   \n241,682      \n(5,105 )    \n236,577      \n66  \nSeptember 30\n   \n243,829      \n(4,998 )    \n238,831      \n66  \nDecember 31\n   \n279,717      \n(5,528 )    \n274,189      \n64  \n \n \n     \n     \n     \n   \n2021:\n \n     \n     \n     \n   \nMarch 31\n  $\n250,743     $\n(3,718 )   $\n247,025      \n70  \nJune 30\n   \n226,774      \n(3,546 )    \n223,228      \n68  \nSeptember 30\n   \n246,317      \n(3,157 )    \n243,160      \n65  \nDecember 31\n   \n248,567      \n(4,250 )    \n244,317      \n66  \nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 94% and 96%, respectively, of our billed trade accounts receivable balances were less \nthan 60 days past due.  \nWe may experience adverse impacts to our DBOs if and when customer payment delays occur.  However, these recurring monthly \npayments that cross a reporting period-end do not raise collectability concerns, as payment is generally received subsequent to quarter-\nend.  All other changes in our gross and net billed accounts receivable reflect the normal fluctuations in the timing of customer payments at \nquarter-end, as evidenced by our relatively consistent DBO metric.  \nAs a global provider of solutions and services, a portion of our billed trade accounts receivable balance relates to international customers.  \nThis diversity in the geographic composition of our customer base may adversely impact our DBOs as longer billing cycles (i.e., billing terms \nand cash collection cycles) are an inherent characteristic of international software and professional services transactions.  For example, our \nability to invoice and collect arrangement fees may be dependent upon, among other things: (i) the completion of various customer \nadministrative matters, local country billing protocols and processes (including local cultural differences), and non-customer administrative \nmatters; (ii) meeting certain contractual invoicing milestones; (iii) the overall project status in certain situations in which we act as a \nsubcontractor to another vendor on a project; or (iv) due to currency controls in certain foreign jurisdictions. \nUnbilled Trade Accounts Receivable\nUnbilled trade accounts receivable increased $17.0 million to $52.8 million as of December 31, 2022, from $35.8 million as of December 31, \n2021, due primarily to large implementation projects where various milestone and contractual billing dates have not yet been reached or \ndelayed.  Unbilled trade accounts receivable are an inherent characteristic of certain software and services transactions and may fluctuate \nbetween quarters, as these types of transactions typically have scheduled invoicing terms over several quarters, as well as certain \nmilestone billing events.\nIncome Taxes Payable/Receivable\nNet income taxes payable/receivable (current and non-current) as of December 31, 2022 was a net income taxes payable balance of $7.6 \nmillion, compared to a net income taxes receivable balance of $2.0 million as of December 31, 2021.  This net $9.6 million change is \nprimarily due to the timing of our estimated Federal and state income tax payments.\n32"

Our typical investing activities consist of purchases and sales of short-term investments and purchases of \nsoftware, property and equipment, which are discussed below.  Additionally, during 2021, we made cash payments of $63.6 million related to \nacquisitions of and investments in businesses (see Note 7 to our Financial Statements).

We continually evaluate the possible uses of our excess cash balances and will likely purchase and \nsell additional short-term investments in the future. \nPurchases of Software, Property and Equipment\nOur annual capital expenditures for software, property and equipment for 2022 and 2021 were $37.0 million and $26.6 million, respectively.  \nOur capital expenditures for these periods consisted principally of investments in:  (i) computer hardware; (ii) software and related \nequipment; and (iii) statement production equipment and infrastructure.\nCash Flows From Financing Activities.  Our financing activities typically consist of various debt-related transactions and activities with our \ncommon stock, which are discussed below. \nIssuance of Common Stock\nProceeds from the issuance of common stock for 2022 and 2021 were $3.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively, and relate primarily to our \nemployee stock purchase plan. \nCash Dividends Paid on Common Stock \nDuring 2022 and 2021, the Board approved dividend payments totaling $33.7 million and $32.7 million, respectively.  During 2022 and \n2021, we paid dividends of $33.5 million and $32.6 million, respectively, with the differences between the amount approved and paid \nattributed to dividends accrued on unvested incentive shares that are paid upon vesting.\nRepurchase of Common Stock\nDuring 2022 and 2021 we repurchased approximately 1,498,000 shares and 733,000 shares of our common stock under the guidelines of \nour Stock Repurchase Program for $87.9 million and $36.0 million, respectively.\nAdditionally, outside of our Stock Repurchase Program, during 2022 and 2021, we repurchased from our employees and then canceled \napproximately 138,000 shares and 130,000 shares, of our common stock for $8.7 million and $6.3 million, respectively, in connection with \nminimum tax withholding requirements resulting from the vesting of restricted stock under our stock incentive plans. \nThrough December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have paid $96.7 million and $42.3 million, respectively, for our total repurchases of common \nstock, with any differences when compared to the amounts purchased attributed to the timing of the settlement.\nDeferred Acquisition Payments\nDuring 2022 we made deferred acquisition payments related to our Kitewheel and DGIT acquisitions of $2.0 million and $0.3 million, \nrespectively.\n33"

Below are the key items to consider in assessing our current sources of capital resources:\n•\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments.  As of December 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term \ninvestments of $150.4 million, of which approximately 55% is in U.S. dollars and held in the U.S.  Included in cash and cash \nequivalents is $1.0 million of restricted cash.  For the remainder of the monies denominated in foreign currencies and/or located \noutside the U.S., we do not anticipate any material amounts being unavailable for use in funding our business, but may face \nlimitations on moving cash out of certain foreign jurisdictions due to currency controls and potential negative economic \nconsequences. \n•\nOperating Cash Flows.  As described in the Liquidity section above, we believe we have the ability to generate strong cash flows to \nfund our operating activities and act as a source of funds to meet our capital resource needs, although we may experience quarterly \nvariations in our cash flows from operations related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. \n•\nRevolving Loan Facility.  As part of our 2021 Credit Agreement, we have a $450.0 million revolving loan facility, our 2021 Revolver.  \nAs of  December 31, 2022, we had $275.0 million outstanding on our 2021 Revolver.  In January 2023, we borrowed an additional \n$15.0 million and currently have $160.0 million available to us.  Our long-term debt obligations are discussed in more detail in Note 5 \nto our Financial Statements.\nUses/Potential Uses of Capital Resources.  Below are the key items to consider in assessing our uses/potential uses of capital resources: \n•\nCommon Stock Repurchases.  We have made repurchases of our common stock in the past under our Stock Repurchase Program.  \nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 2.1 million shares authorized for repurchase remaining under our Stock Repurchase Program.  \nOur 2021 Credit Agreement places certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our common stock.  \nUnder our Stock Repurchase Program, we may repurchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, \nincluding through an accelerated stock repurchase plan or under a SEC Rule 10b5-1 plan.  The actual timing and amount of share \nrepurchases are dependent on the current market conditions and other business-related factors.  Our common stock repurchases \nare discussed in more detail in Note 12 to our Financial Statements.\nDuring 2022, we repurchased 1,498,000 shares of our common stock for $87.9 million (weighted-average price of $58.71 per share) \nunder our Stock Repurchase Program. \nOutside of our Stock Repurchase Program, during 2022, we repurchased from our employees and then cancelled 138,000 shares of \nour common stock for $8.7 million in connection with minimum tax withholding requirements resulting from the vesting of restricted \nstock under our stock incentive plans.\n•\nCash Dividends.  During 2022, the Board declared dividends totaling $33.7 million.  Going forward, we expect to pay cash dividends \neach year in March, June, September, and December, with the amount and timing subject to the Board’s approval. \n•\nExecutive Transition. In 2020 and 2021, we entered into Separation Agreements with our former President and CEO, and former \nCFO, which included commitments to pay additional compensation of $9.1 million, for which approximately $5 million was paid in \n2021, approximately $3 million was paid in 2022, and approximately $1 million will be paid in 2023.\n35"

In 2022 we made DGIT holdback payments of $0.3 million.  Additionally, \nthere are provisions for up to approximately $13 million of potential future earn-out payments.  The earn-out period is through \nSeptember 30, 2025.  As of December 31, 2022 we accrued $0.3 million related to potential earn-out payments.\nOur acquisitions are discussed in more detail in Note 7 to our Financial Statements.  As part of our growth strategy, we are \ncontinually evaluating potential business and/or asset acquisitions and investments in market share expansion with our existing and \npotential new customers and expansion into verticals outside the global communications market.  \n•\nCapital Expenditures.  During 2022, we spent $37.0 million on capital expenditures.\n•\nStock Warrants.  We have issued stock warrants with an exercise price of $26.68 per warrant to Comcast as an incentive for \nComcast to convert new customer accounts onto our solutions.  Once vested, Comcast may exercise the stock warrants and elect \neither physical delivery of common shares or net share settlement (cashless exercise).  Alternatively, the exercise of the stock \nwarrants may be settled with cash based solely on our approval, or if Comcast were to beneficially own or control in excess of \n19.99% of the common stock or voting of the Company.  As of December 31, 2022, 1.0 million Stock Warrants were outstanding, \nnone of which were vested.\nThe stock warrants are discussed in more detail in Note 12 to our Financial Statements.  \n•\nLong-Term Debt.  As of December 31, 2022, our long-term debt consisted of our 2021 Credit Agreement which includes: (i) \noutstanding 2021 Term Loan borrowings of $140.6 million; and (ii) outstanding 2021 Revolver borrowings of $275 million.  During \n2022, we borrowed $245.0 million from our 2021 Revolver to settle our 2016 Convertible Notes for $242.3 million and an additional \n$45.0 million for general corporate purposes.  During 2022, we repaid $15.0 million of the revolver borrowings.  As of December 31, \n2022, there were no remaining 2016 Convertible Notes outstanding.\nOur 2021 Credit Agreement mandatory repayments for the next twelve months are $7.5 million and the cash interest expense \n(based upon current interest rates) for the 2021 Term Loan and 2021 Revolver (to include an additional $15.0 million that was \nborrowed in January 2023, assuming no further amounts are borrowed, and the amount is not repaid) are $8.9 million and $18.6 \nmillion, respectively.  We have the ability to make prepayments without penalties on our 2021 Credit Agreement.\nOur long-term debt obligations are discussed in more detail in Note 5 to our Financial Statements.   \nIn summary, we expect to continue to have material needs for capital resources going forward, as noted above.  We believe that our current cash, \ncash equivalents and short-term investments balances and our 2021 Revolver, together with cash expected to be generated in the future from our \ncurrent operating activities, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital resource requirements for at least the next twelve months.  We believe \nwe could obtain additional capital through other debt sources which may be available to us if deemed appropriate.\n36"

      "text": "Item  7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \nMarket risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices.  As of December 31, 2022, we are exposed to various \nmarket risks, including changes in interest rates, fluctuations and changes in the market value of our cash equivalents and short-term \ninvestments, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  We have not historically entered into derivatives or other financial instruments for \ntrading or speculative purposes. \nInterest Rate Risk \nLong-Term Debt.  The interest rates on our 2021 Credit Agreement are based upon an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin, or an \nalternate base rate (\"ABR\") plus an applicable margin.  The 2021 Credit Agreement includes LIBOR transition language in which we can elect an \nABR, a Eurodollar rate, an alternate currency term rate, or an alternate currency daily rate.  See Note 5 to our Financial Statements for further \ndetails related to our long-term debt. \nA hypothetical adverse change of 10% in the December 31, 2022 adjusted LIBOR rate would not have a material impact upon our results of \noperations. \nMarket Risk \nCash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments.  Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $150.4 million and \n$205.6 million, respectively.  Certain of our cash balances are swept into overnight money market accounts on a daily basis, and at times, any \nexcess funds are invested in low-risk, somewhat longer term, cash equivalent instruments and short-term investments.  Our cash equivalents are \ninvested primarily in institutional money market funds, commercial paper, and time deposits held at major banks.  We have minimal market risk for \nour cash and cash equivalents due to the relatively short maturities of the instruments. \nOur short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $0.1 million and $28.0 million, respectively.  Currently, we utilize short-term \ninvestments as a means to invest our excess cash only in the U.S. The day-to-day management of our short-term investments is performed by a \nlarge financial institution in the U.S., using strict and formal investment guidelines approved by our Board.  Under these guidelines, short-term \ninvestments are limited to certain acceptable investments with: (i) a maximum maturity; (ii) a maximum concentration and diversification; and (iii) a \nminimum acceptable credit quality.  At this time, we believe we have minimal liquidity risk associated with the short-term investments included in \nour portfolio. \nSettlement and Merchant Reserve Assets.  We are exposed to market risk associated with cash held on behalf of our merchants related to our \npayment processing services.  As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $238.7 million and $186.3 million, respectively, of cash collected on \nbehalf of our merchants.  The cash is held in accounts with various major financial institutions in the U.S. and Canada in an amount equal to at \nleast 100% of the aggregate amount owed to our merchants.  These balances can significantly fluctuate between periods due to activity at the \nend of the period and the day in which the period ends.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nDue to foreign operations around the world, our balance sheet and income statement are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk due to the \nfluctuations in the value of currencies in which we conduct business.  While we attempt to maximize natural hedges by incurring expenses in the \nsame currency in which we contract revenue, the related expenses for that revenue could be in one or more differing currencies than the revenue \nstream. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated approximately 88% of our revenue in U.S. dollars.  We expect that, in the foreseeable \nfuture, we will continue to generate a very large percentage of our revenue in U.S. dollars. \nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying amounts of our monetary assets and monetary liabilities on the books of our non-U.S. \nsubsidiaries in currencies denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of those non-U.S. subsidiaries are as follows (in \nthousands, in U.S. dollar equivalents): \n \n \nDecember 31, 2022\n   \nDecember 31, 2021\n \n \n \nMonetary\n   \nMonetary\n   \nMonetary\n   \nMonetary\n \n \n \nLiabilities\n   \nAssets\n   \nLiabilities\n   \nAssets\n \nPounds sterling\n  $\n(119 )   $\n601     $\n(4 )   $\n1,829  \nEuro\n   \n(425 )    \n1,992      \n(297 )    \n2,702  \nU.S. Dollar\n   \n(597 )    \n31,646      \n(541 )    \n30,212  \nSouth African Rand\n   \n-      \n-      \n(95 )    \n3,631  \nOther\n   \n(72 )    \n503      \n(10 )    \n976  \nTotals\n  $\n(1,213 )   $\n34,742     $\n(947 )   $\n39,350  \n \nA hypothetical adverse change of 10% in the December 31, 2022 exchange rates would not have had a material impact upon our results of \noperations. \n37"

The \nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and \nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  The Company’s \ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: \n(i)\nPertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the \nassets of the Company; \n(ii)\nProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in \naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made \nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and \n(iii)\nProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the \nCompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of \nDecember 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring \nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the \nconsolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive \nincome, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes \n(collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those \nconsolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the \neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial \nReporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a \npublic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. \nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain \nreasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal \ncontrol over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material \nweakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also \nincluded performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable \nbasis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial \nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A \ncompany’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in \nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance \nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and \ndirectors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any \nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that \nthe degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nOmaha, Nebraska\nFebruary 17, 2023\n40"

      "text": "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nCSG Systems International, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CSG Systems International, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for \neach of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In \nour opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, \n2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in \nconformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the \nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated \nFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 17, 2023 \nexpressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on \nthese consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be \nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain \nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our \naudits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error \nor fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the \namounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and \nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe \nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was \ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the \nconsolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical \naudit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating \nthe critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAgreements with significant customers\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company generated 40% of its revenue from its two largest customers \n(significant customers). The agreements with these significant customers are complex and subject to modification in the form of \namendments, change requests, or statements of work, which can occur frequently. The accounting for these agreements requires \nsignificant judgments to be made by the Company, specifically whether a new or revised agreement is treated as either a separate contract \nor modification of an existing contract. The judgments could significantly affect revenue recognized in any period. \nWe identified the evaluation of agreements with significant customers as a critical audit matter. Due to the subjectivity and complexity in the \napplication of the portion of the accounting standard related to contract modifications, the assessment of the Company’s judgments \nregarding whether each new or revised agreement is treated as a separate contract or modification of an existing contract required a higher \ndegree of auditor judgment. \nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the \noperating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s revenue recognition process. This included controls over \nmonitoring and evaluating agreements with significant customers. For certain new or revised agreements with significant customers, we \nobtained and read the agreement, performed an independent analysis of the accounting treatment as a separate contract or modification of \nan existing contract, and compared our conclusions to those made by the Company.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\nOmaha, Nebraska\nFebruary 17, 2023\n41"

      "text": "NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nGeneral \nCSG Systems International, Inc. (the “Company”, “CSG”, or forms of the pronoun “we”), a Delaware corporation, was formed in October 1994 and \nis based in Denver, Colorado. We are a purpose-driven, SaaS platform company with revenue management and digital monetization, customer \nexperience, and payments solutions serving a wide variety of industry verticals.  Our cloud-first architecture and customer-centric approach help \ncompanies around the world acquire, monetize, engage, and retain their B2B (business-to-business), B2C (business-to-consumer), and B2B2X \n(business-to-business-to-consumer) customers.  Over the years, we have focused our research and development (“R&D”) and acquisition \ninvestments on expanding our solution set to address the complex, transformative needs of our customers.  We are a member of the S&P \nSmallCap 600 and Russell 2000 indices. \nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements (“Financial Statements”) are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples (“GAAP”) in the United States of America (“U.S.”). \n2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies \nPrinciples of Consolidation.  Our Financial Statements include all of our accounts and our subsidiaries’ accounts. All material intercompany \naccounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nTranslation of Foreign Currency.  Our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency of the countries in which they operate as their functional \ncurrency.  Their assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.  Revenue, \nexpenses, and cash flows are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period.  Foreign currency translation adjustments \nare included in comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity.   Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of \nnet income.\nUse of Estimates in Preparation of Our Financial Statements.  The preparation of our Financial Statements requires management to make \nestimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of \nthe date of our Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ \nfrom those estimates.  The more critical accounting estimates and related assumptions that may affect our financial position and results of \noperations are in the areas of: (i) revenue recognition; (ii) impairment assessments of long-lived assets; (iii) income taxes; and (iv) loss \ncontingencies. \nReclassifications.  Certain amounts within our net cash provided by operating activities on our Statements of Cash Flows for 2021 and 2020 have \nbeen reclassified to conform to the 2022 presentation.\nRevenue Recognition.  Our revenue from customer contracts is measured based on consideration specified in our contracts as discussed further \nbelow.  We recognize revenue for our products and services separately if there are distinct performance obligations.   A product or service, or \ngroup of products or services, has a distinct performance obligation if it is separately identifiable from other items in the context of the contract \nand if our customer can benefit from the product or service on their own or with other resources that are readily available to that customer.  We \nrecognize revenue when we satisfy our performance obligations by transferring control of a particular product or service, or group of products or \nservices, to our customers, as described in more detail below.  Taxes assessed on our products and services based on governmental authorities \nat the time of invoicing are generally excluded from our revenue.\n47"

      "text": "SaaS and Related Solutions \nOur SaaS and related solutions include: (i) our revenue management platforms and various related ancillary services; (ii) our managed services \noffering in which we operate software solutions (primarily our software solutions) on behalf of our customers; and (iii) our SaaS payments \nplatform.  \nWe contract for our SaaS based solutions using long-term arrangements whose terms have typically ranged from three to five years.  These \narrangements consist of a series of multiple services delivered daily or monthly, to include such things as: (i) revenue management platforms; (ii) \nrelated products and services (e.g., field service management tools, consumer credit verifications, etc.); (iii) digital enablement and delivery \nfunctions; and (iv) customer statement invoice printing and mailing services.  The fees for these services typically are billed to our customers \nmonthly based upon actual monthly volumes and/or usage of services (e.g., the number of customer accounts maintained on our solutions, the \nnumber of transactions processed on our solutions, and/or the quantity and content of the monthly statements and mailings processed through \nour solutions).\nFor SaaS based solution contracts, the total contract consideration (including impacts of discounts or incentives) is primarily variable dependent \nupon actual monthly volumes and/or usage of services; however, these contracts can also include ancillary fixed consideration in the form of one-\ntime, monthly, or annual fees.  The pricing of products and services in these contracts is generally at stand-alone selling price, with no allocation \nof value between the individual performance obligations.  In situations where we do an allocation, we determine stand-alone selling price based \non established pricing and/or cost, plus an applicable margin. Revenue is generally recognized based on activities performed over a series of \ndaily or monthly periods. \nWe contract for managed services using long-term arrangements whose terms have typically ranged from three to five years.  Under managed \nservices agreements, we operate software products (primarily our software solutions) on behalf of our customers: (i) out of a customer’s data \ncenter; (ii) out of a data center we own and operate; or (iii) out of a third-party data center we contract with for such services.  Managed services \ncan also include us providing other services, such as transitional services, fulfillment, remittance processing, operational consulting, back office, \nand end-user billing services. \nFor managed services contracts, the total contract consideration is typically a fixed monthly fee, but these contracts may also have variable fee \ncomponents.  The fees for these services typically are billed to our customers on a monthly basis.  Unless managed services are included with a \nsoftware license contract (as discussed further below), there is generally only one performance obligation and revenue is recognized for these \narrangements on a ratable basis as the services are performed. \nOur contracts for SaaS payments platform solutions are generally month-to-month or fixed term with automatic renewals. Services provided under \nthese arrangements primarily include Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) transaction processing, credit/debit card processing, web-based and \ntelephone payment processing, and real-time check verification and authentication services.  The fees for these services typically are billed on a \nmonthly basis. \nOur SaaS payments platform solutions are comprised of one performance obligation.  Revenue for these services is based primarily on a fee per \ntransaction or a percentage of the transaction principal, and are recognized as delivered over a series of daily service periods.  Transaction fees \ncollected from merchants are recognized as revenue on a gross basis when we are the principal in completing the payment processing \ntransaction.  As a principal to the transaction, we control the service of processing payments on our platform.  We bear primary responsibility for \nthe fulfillment of the payment service, contract directly with the merchant, and have full discretion in determining the fee charged to our customers \nwhich is independent of the costs we incur when we utilize payment processors or other financial institutions to perform services on our behalf.  \nWe therefore bear full margin risk when completing a payment processing transaction.   Transaction fees are primarily comprised of fees paid to \nthird-party payment processors and other financial institutions and interchange fees paid in conjunction with the delivery of service to customers \nunder our payments services contracts.  These fees are recognized in cost of revenue.  \nFees related to set-up or implementation activities for both SaaS and related solutions and managed services contracts are generally deferred \nand recognized ratably over the related service period to which the activities relate.\nDepending on the significance of variable consideration, number of products/services, complex pricing structures, and long-term nature of these \ntypes of contracts, the judgments and estimates made in this area could have a significant effect on the amount and timing of revenue recognized \nin any period.\n48"

      "text": "Software and Services \nOur software and services revenue relates primarily to: (i) software license sales on either a perpetual or term license basis; and (ii) professional \nservices to implement the software.  Our software and services contracts are often contracted in bundled arrangements that include the software \nlicense and related implementation services, and may also include maintenance, managed services, and/or additional professional services. \nFor our software arrangements, total contract consideration is allocated between the separate performance obligations based on stand-alone \nselling prices for software licenses, cost plus applicable margin for third-party licenses and/ or services, and established pricing for maintenance.  \nThe initial sale of our software products generally requires significant production, modification, or customization, such that the delivery of the \nsoftware license and related professional services required to implement the software represent one combined performance obligation that is \nsatisfied over time based on hours worked (i.e., hours-based method).  We are using hours worked on the project, compared against expected \nhours to complete the project, as the measure to determine progress toward completion as we believe it is the most appropriate metric to \nmeasure such progress.  The software and services fees are generally fixed fees billed to our customers on a milestone or date basis.\nThe determination of the performance obligations and allocation of value for software license arrangements require significant judgment.  We \ngenerally determine stand-alone selling prices using pricing calculations (which include regional market factors) for our software license fees and \nmaintenance, and cost-plus margins for services.  Additionally, our use of an hours-based method of accounting for software license and other \nprofessional services performance obligations that are satisfied over time requires estimates of total project revenue and costs, along with the \nexpected hours necessary to complete a project.  Changes in estimates as a result of additional information or experience on a project as work \nprogresses are inherent characteristics of this method of revenue recognition as we are exposed to business risks in completing these types of \nperformance obligations.  The estimation process to support our hours-based recognition method is more difficult for projects of greater length \nand/or complexity.  The judgments and estimates made for these types of obligations could: (i) have a significant effect on revenue recognized in \nany period by changing the amount and/or the timing of the revenue recognized; and/or (ii) impact the expected profitability of a project, including \nwhether an overall loss on an arrangement has occurred.  To mitigate the inherent risks in using this hours-based method, we track our current \nhours expended against our estimates on a periodic basis and continually reevaluate the appropriateness of our estimates. \nIn certain instances, we sell software license volume upgrades, which provide our customers with the right to use our software to process higher \ntransaction volume levels.  In these instances, we analyze the contract to determine if the volume upgrade is a separate performance obligation \nand if so, we recognize the value associated with the software license as revenue on the effective date of the volume upgrade. \nA portion of our professional services revenue is contracted separately (e.g., business consulting services, etc.). Such contracts can either be on \na fixed-price or time-and-materials basis.  Revenue from fixed-price professional service contracts is recognized using an estimated hours-based \nmethod (discussed above), as these professional services represent a performance obligation that is satisfied over time.  Revenue from \nprofessional services contracts billed on a time-and-materials basis is recognized as the services are performed.\nMaintenance \nOur maintenance revenue relates primarily to support of our software once it has been implemented and placed in service.  Maintenance revenue \nis recognized ratably over the software maintenance period as services are provided.  Our maintenance consists primarily of customer and \nproduct support, technical updates (e.g., bug fixes, etc.), and unspecified upgrades or enhancements to our software products.  If specified \nupgrades or enhancements are offered in a contract, they are accounted for as a separate performance obligation. Maintenance may be invoiced \nto our customers on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis.\nTransaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2022, our aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations is approximately \n$1.7 billion, which is made up of fixed fee consideration and guaranteed minimums expected to be recognized in the future related to performance \nobligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied).  We expect to recognize approximately 75% of this amount by the end of 2025, with the \nremaining amount recognized by the end of 2036.  We have excluded from this amount variable consideration expected to be recognized in the \nfuture related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied.  The majority of our future revenue is related to our SaaS and related solutions \ncustomer contracts that includes variable consideration dependent upon a series of monthly volumes and/or daily usage of services and have \ncontractual terms ending from 2023 through 2036.  \n49"

We pass through to our customers the cost of postage that is incurred on behalf of those customers, and typically require an advance \npayment on expected postage costs.  These advance payments are included in customer deposits in the accompanying Consolidated Balance \nSheets (“Balance Sheets” or “Balance Sheet”) and are classified as current liabilities regardless of the contract period.  We net the cost of postage \nagainst the postage reimbursements for those customers where we require advance deposits and include the net amount (which is not material) \nin SaaS and related solutions revenue.  \nCash and Cash Equivalents.  We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less as of the date of purchase \nto be cash equivalents.  As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our cash equivalents consist primarily of institutional money market funds, \ncommercial paper, and time deposits held at major banks.  For the cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies and/or located \noutside the U.S., we do not anticipate any material amounts being unavailable for use in running our business, but may face limitations on moving \ncash out of certain foreign jurisdictions due to currency controls and potential negative economic consequences.\nRestricted Cash.  Restricted cash includes cash that is legally or contractually restricted, as well as our settlement and merchant reserve assets \n(discussed below).  The nature of the restrictions on our settlement and merchant reserve assets consists of contractual restrictions with the \nmerchants and restrictions arising from our policy and intention.  It has historically been our policy to segregate settlement and merchant reserve \nassets from our operating cash balances and our intention is to continue to do so.  As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $1.0 million and \n$1.4 million, respectively, of restricted cash that serves to collateralize bank guarantees and outstanding letters of credit included in cash and \ncash equivalents in our Balance Sheets.  \nShort-term Investments and Other Financial Instruments.  Our financial instruments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 include cash and cash \nequivalents, short-term investments, settlement and merchant reserve assets and liabilities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and debt.  \nDue to their short maturities, the carrying amounts of cash equivalents, settlement and merchant reserve assets and liabilities, accounts \nreceivable, and accounts payable approximate their fair value. \nOur short-term investments and certain cash equivalents are considered “available-for-sale” and are reported at fair value in our Balance Sheets, \nwith unrealized gains and losses, net of the related income tax effect, excluded from earnings and reported in a separate component of \nstockholders’ equity.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses were not material in any period presented. \nPrimarily all short-term investments held by us as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 have contractual maturities of less than two years from the \ntime of acquisition.  Our short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted almost entirely of fixed income securities.  \nProceeds from the sale/maturity of short-term investments in 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $28.0 million, $90.5 million, and $56.5 million, \nrespectively. \n51"

See Note 5 for discussion \nregarding our debt. \nSettlement and Merchant Reserve Assets and Liabilities.  Settlement assets and settlement liabilities represent cash collected on behalf of \nmerchants via payments processing services which is held for an established holding period until settlement with the customer.  The holding \nperiod is generally one to four business days depending on the payment model and contractual terms with the customer.  During the holding \nperiod, cash is subject to restriction and segregation based on the nature of our custodial relationship with the merchants.  Should we fail to remit \nthese funds to our merchants, the merchant’s sole recourse would be against us, for payment.  These rights and obligations are set forth in the \ncontracts between us and the merchants.  Settlement assets are held with various major financial institutions and a corresponding liability is \nrecorded for the amounts owed to the customer.  At any given time, there may be differences between the cash held and the corresponding \nliability due to the timing of operating-related cash transfers. \nMerchant reserve assets/liabilities represent deposits collected from merchants to mitigate our risk of loss due to nonperformance of settlement \nobligations initiated by those merchants using our payments processing services, or non-payment by customers for services rendered by us.  We \nperform a credit risk evaluation on each customer based on multiple criteria, which provides the basis for the deposit amount required for each \nmerchant.  For the duration of our relationship with each merchant, we hold their reserve deposits with major financial institutions.  We hold these \nfunds in separate accounts and are fully offset by corresponding liabilities.\nThe following table summarizes our settlement and merchant reserve assets and liabilities as of the indicated periods (in thousands):\n \n \nDecember 31, 2022\n \n \nDecember 31, 2021\n \n \n \nAssets\n \n \nLiabilities\n \n \nAssets\n \n \nLiabilities\n \nSettlement assets/liabilities\n $\n219,368  \n  $\n218,525    \n$\n171,505    \n$\n170,514  \nMerchant reserve assets/liabilities\n  \n19,285  \n   \n19,285    \n \n14,762    \n \n14,762  \nTotal\n \n$\n238,653  \n  $\n237,810    \n$\n186,267    \n$\n185,276  \n52"

      "text": "Concentrations of Credit Risk.  In the normal course of business, we are exposed to credit risk.  The principal concentrations of credit risk relate to \ncash deposits, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable.  We regularly monitor credit risk exposures and take steps to \nmitigate the likelihood of these exposures resulting in a loss. We hold our cash deposits, cash equivalents, and short-term investments with \nfinancial institutions we believe to be of sound financial condition. \nWe generally do not require collateral or other security to support accounts receivable.  We evaluate the credit worthiness of our customers in \nconjunction with our revenue recognition process, as well as through our ongoing collectability assessment process for accounts receivable.  We \nmaintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and \nother information.  We use various judgments and estimates in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable.  See \nNote 3 for additional details of our concentration of accounts receivable. \nThe activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is as follows (in thousands): \n  \n \n \n2022\n \n \n2021\n \n \n2020\n \nBalance, beginning of year\n  $\n4,250    \n$\n3,628    \n$\n3,735  \nAdditions to expense\n   \n1,295    \n \n1,102    \n \n1,481  \nWrite-offs\n   \n(8 )\n   \n(466 )\n   \n(1,532 )\nOther\n   \n(9 )\n   \n(14 )\n   \n(56 )\nBalance, end of year\n  $\n5,528  \n  $\n4,250    \n$\n3,628  \nProperty and Equipment.  Property and equipment are recorded at cost (or at estimated fair value if acquired in a business combination) and are \ndepreciated over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years.  Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their \neconomic life or the lease term.  Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.  Depreciation \nexpense for property and equipment is reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income (\"Income Statement\" or \"Income Statements\") \nseparately in the aggregate and is not included in the cost of revenue or the other components of operating expenses, except for accelerated \ndepreciation expense that is included in our restructuring and reorganization charges (see Note 8).\nSoftware.  We expend substantial amounts on R&D, particularly for new solutions, and enhancements of existing products and services.  For \ndevelopment of software solutions that are to be licensed by us, we expense all costs related to the development of the software until \ntechnological feasibility is established.  For development of software to be used internally (e.g., cloud-based systems software), we expense all \ncosts prior to the application development stage. \nDuring 2022, 2021, and 2020, we expended $137.9 million, $134.7 million, and $122.8 million, respectively, on R&D projects. We did not \ncapitalize any R&D costs in 2022, 2021, and 2020, as the costs subject to capitalization during these periods were not material.  We did not have \nany capitalized R&D costs included in our December 31, 2022 and 2021 Balance Sheets. \nRealizability of Long-Lived Assets.  We evaluate our long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for possible impairment whenever events or changes \nin circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.  A long-lived asset is impaired if estimated future \nundiscounted cash flows associated with that asset are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long-lived asset.  If deemed impaired, the \nlong-lived asset is written down to its estimated fair value. \nGoodwill.  We evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as well as we may evaluate our goodwill on a more periodic basis (e.g., \nquarterly) if events occur or circumstances change that could indicate a potential impairment may have occurred.  Goodwill is considered \nimpaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit which includes the goodwill is greater than the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. \nContingencies.  We accrue for a loss contingency when: (i) it is probable that an asset has been impaired, or a liability has been incurred; and (ii) \nthe amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  The determination of loss contingencies is subject to various judgments and estimates.  We \ndo not record the benefit from a gain contingency until the benefit is realized. \nEarnings Per Common Share (“EPS”).  Basic and diluted EPS amounts are presented on the face of our Income Statements.\nThe reconciliation of the basic and diluted EPS denominators related to the common shares is included in the following table (in thousands):\n \n \n \n2022\n \n \n2021\n   \n2020\n \nBasic weighted-average common shares\n \n  \n31,028      \n31,776      \n32,010  \nDilutive effect of restricted common stock\n \n \n \n270      \n234    \n268  \nDiluted weighted-average common shares\n \n  \n31,298      \n32,010  \n  \n32,278  \n53"

Stock-based compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted to employees and non-\nemployee directors.  We measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date of the award, based on the estimated fair value of the award, \nand recognize the cost (net of estimated forfeitures) over the requisite service period. \nIncome Taxes.  We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method.  Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the \namount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected future tax \nconsequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for \nthe year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in \nincome in the period that includes the enactment date.\nAccounting Pronouncements Adopted.  In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and \nContracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. (“ASU 2020-06”), which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of \nliabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity.  ASU 2020-06 also amends the related EPS \nguidance.  ASU 2020-06 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and could be adopted on either a fully retrospective or \nmodified retrospective basis.  We elected to adopt this ASU using the modified retrospective transition method in which a $9.8 million cumulative-\neffect adjustment was made to our January 1, 2022 accumulated earnings and additional paid-in capital balances. \n3.\nSegment Reporting and Significant Concentration\nSegment Information.  We have evaluated how our chief operating decision maker has organized our Company for purposes of making operating \ndecisions and assessing performance, and have concluded that as of December 31, 2022, there is one reportable segment. \nSolutions and Services.  Our solutions and services help companies around the world monetize and digitally enable the customer experience by \naccurately capturing, managing, generating, and optimizing the interactions and revenue associated with their customers.  We generate a \nsubstantial percentage of our revenue from customers utilizing Advanced Convergent Platform (ACP), a private SaaS platform, and related \nsolutions (e.g., field force automation, analytics, electronic bill presentment, etc.) within the North American cable and satellite markets.  In \naddition, a smaller portion of our revenue is generated from our public SaaS revenue management and payments platform, serving customers \nglobally.  In addition, we license certain solutions (e.g., mediation, partner management, rating, and charging) and provide our professional \nservices to implement, configure, and maintain these solutions.  These solutions are sometimes provided under a managed service arrangement, \nwhere we assume long-term responsibility for delivering and maintaining our solutions and related operations under a defined scope and specified \nservice levels.\nSignificant Customers.  A large percentage of our revenue has been generated from our two largest customers, which are Charter \nCommunications, Inc. (“Charter”) and Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”).\nRevenue from these customers represented the following percentages of our total revenue for the following years: \n \n \n2022\n   \n2021\n   \n2020\n \nCharter\n \n20 %   \n21 %   \n21 %\nComcast\n \n20 %   \n21 %   \n22 %\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the percentage of net billed accounts receivable balances attributable to these customers were as follows: \n \n \n \nAs of December 31,\n \n \n \n2022\n   \n2021\n \nCharter\n  \n22 %   \n23 %\nComcast\n  \n17 %   \n20 %\nWe expect to continue to generate a large percentage of our future revenue from our significant customers.  There are inherent risks whenever a \nlarge percentage of total revenue is concentrated with a limited number of customers.  Should a significant customer: (i) terminate or fail to renew \ntheir contracts with us, in whole or in part for any reason; (ii) significantly reduce the number of customer accounts processed on our solutions, \nthe price paid for our solutions and services, or the scope of solutions and services that we provide; or (iii) experience significant financial or \noperating difficulties, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.  \n54"

The 2021 Credit Agreement includes LIBOR transition language in which we can elect an ABR, a \nEurodollar rate, an alternate currency term rate, or an alternate currency daily rate.\nThe 2021 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative, negative, and financial covenants that places limits on our ability to: (i) incur \nadditional indebtedness; (ii) create liens on its property; (iii) make investments; (iv) enter into mergers and consolidations; (v) sell assets; (vi) \ndeclare dividends or repurchase shares; (vii) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; (viii) prepay certain indebtedness; and (ix) issue capital \nstock of subsidiaries.  We must also meet certain financial covenants to include: (i) a maximum total leverage ratio; (ii) a maximum first-lien \nleverage ratio; and (iii) a minimum interest coverage ratio.  In conjunction with the 2021 Credit Agreement, we entered into a security agreement \nin favor of Bank of America N.A, as collateral agent (the “Security Agreement”).  Under the Security Agreement and 2021 Credit Agreement, \ncertain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed its obligations, and have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure the obligations \nunder the 2021 Credit Agreement and such guarantees.\nDuring 2022, we made $7.5 million of principal repayments on our 2021 Term Loan.  As of December 31, 2022, our interest rate on the 2021 Term \nLoan is 6.355% (adjusted LIBOR plus 1.625% per annum), effective through March 31, 2023, and our commitment fee on the 2021 Revolver is \n0.20%. \nIn March 2022, we borrowed $245.0 million from our 2021 Revolver to settle our 2016 Convertible Notes (see below). Additionally, throughout \n2022, we also borrowed $45.0 million from the 2021 Revolver for general corporate purposes, and repaid $15.0 million of this amount, resulting in \ntotal borrowings on our 2021 Revolver as of December 31, 2022 of $275.0 million. In January of 2023, we borrowed an additional $15.0 million on \nthe 2021 Revolver, leaving us currently with $160.0 million available.  \nIn conjunction with the closing of the 2021 Credit Agreement, we incurred financing costs of $3.0 million.  When combined with the remaining \ndeferred financing costs of the 2018 Credit Agreement, financing costs of $3.7 million had been deferred and are being amortized to interest \nexpense using the effective interest method over the related term of the 2021 Credit Agreement. Additionally, as certain lenders from the 2018 \nCredit Agreement chose not to participate in the 2021 Credit Agreement syndication group, we wrote-off $0.1 million of unamortized debt issuance \ncosts and recognized a loss on the extinguishment of the 2018 Credit Agreement.\n2016 Convertible Notes.  In March 2016, we completed an offering of $230 million of 4.25% senior convertible notes due March 15, 2036 (the \n“2016 Convertible Notes”) to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  The 2016 \nConvertible Notes were unsecured obligations and paid 4.25% annual cash interest, payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September \n15 of each year.\nThe 2016 Convertible Notes were convertible at the option of the note holders upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain \nperiods. During the period from, and including, December 15, 2021 to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, \n2022 (the “Conversion Period”), the 2016 Convertible Note holders were able to convert all or any portion of their 2016 Convertible Notes at the \nconversion rate then in effect (17.7621 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2016 Convertible Notes).  For the 2016 \nConvertible Notes presented during this Conversion Period, the settlement amount was equal to the sum of the daily settlement amounts for each \nof the following 40 consecutive trading days during the period of January 12, 2022 to March 10, 2022 (the “Observation Period”).\nUnder the original terms of the 2016 Convertible Notes Indenture (the “2016 Notes Indenture”), we could settle conversions of the 2016 \nConvertible Notes by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election.  In \nNovember 2021, we entered into the First Supplemental Indenture to the 2016 Notes Indenture, in which we made an irrevocable election to \nsettle the par amount in cash.  On December 15, 2021, we notified holders of the 2016 Convertible Notes that we elected a cash settlement \nmethod for any conversions of the 2016 Convertible Notes during the period of December 15, 2021 to March 14, 2022.\nOn December 27, 2021, we notified holders of the 2016 Convertible Notes that we had elected to redeem all of the outstanding notes on March \n15, 2022, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount.  Holders could still convert their 2016 Convertible Notes at any time prior to the \nclose of business on March 14, 2022.\nDuring the Conversion Period, $229.1 million principal amount of the 2016 Convertible Notes were converted.  On March 15, 2022, we paid each \nconverting holder that exercised their conversion right, cash in an amount equal to $1,053.68 per each $1,000 principal amount of 2016 \nConvertible Notes being converted, for a total cash payment of $241.4 million.  The remaining principal amount of $0.9 million that was not \nconverted by the holders was redeemed and paid for on March 15, 2022 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount.  Total settlement \nof the 2016 Convertible Notes was $242.3 million.\nAs a result of our irrevocable election made in December 2021 to settle all conversions during the Conversion Period (discussed above) in cash, \na derivative liability was created and required to be separated from the debt upon conversion by the holders.  There were no conversions as of \nDecember 31, 2021.  At the close of the Observation Period, as a result of the conversions in March 2022, we recognized a $7.5 million loss on \nderivative liability upon debt conversion due to the related change in our stock price over the Observation Period.

Interest expense for 2022, \n2021, and 2020 includes amortization of deferred financing costs of $1.0 million, $1.9 million, and $1.9 million, respectively.  The weighted-\naverage interest rate on our debt borrowings, including amortization of OID, amortization of deferred financing costs, and commitment fees on the \nrevolving loan facility, for 2022, 2021, and 2020, was approximately 4%, 5%, and 5%, respectively. \n6.\nLeases \nWe have operating leases for: (i) real estate which includes office space and our design and delivery centers; (ii) our outsourced data center \nenvironment, as discussed further in Note 11; and (iii) operating equipment.  Our leases have remaining terms through 2031, some of which \ninclude options to extend the leases for up to an additional ten years.  For leases commencing prior to 2019, we used the noncancelable term to \ncalculate the related right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability.  The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion.  \nAdditionally, certain of our leases include payments that are adjusted periodically for inflation.  \nWe have made an accounting policy election not to recognize on our Balance Sheets, leases with an initial term of twelve months or less, for any \nclass of underlying asset.  We have also made an election for real estate leases beginning in 2019 and later, not to separate the lease and non-\nlease components, but rather account for the entire arrangement as a single lease component (a practical expedient allowed under ASU No. \n2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASC 842”)).  For our outsourced data center environment agreement, we have concluded that there are lease and \nnon-lease components, and we have allocated the consideration in the agreement on a relative stand-alone price basis.  Due to the significant \nassumptions and judgements required in accounting for leases (to include whether a contract contains a lease, the allocation of the consideration, \nand the determination of the discount rate), the judgements and estimates made could have a significant effect on the amount of assets and \nliabilities recognized.\nWe sublease certain of our leased real estate to third parties.  These subleases have remaining lease terms through 2031 and certain subleases \nhave renewal terms that can extend the lease for up to an additional two years.  \nThe components of lease expense for 2022, 2021, and 2020 was as follows (in thousands):\n \n \n2022\n \n \n2021\n \n \n2020\n \nOperating lease expense\n \n$\n21,516    \n$\n26,131    \n$\n26,360  \nVariable lease expense\n \n \n4,103    \n \n4,530    \n \n4,518  \nShort-term lease expense\n \n \n1,105    \n \n582    \n \n625  \nSublease income\n \n \n(2,246 )  \n \n(2,596 )  \n \n(2,066 )\nTotal net lease expense\n \n$\n24,478    \n$\n28,647    \n$\n29,437  \n59"

The following are the key restructuring and reorganizational activities we incurred over the last three \nyears that have impacted our results from operations.\nDuring 2022 we implemented the following restructuring and reorganizational activities:\n•\nIn connection with our workplace of the future philosophy, we consolidated or closed office space at thirteen of our leased real estate \nlocations in Australia, India, Sweden, and the U.S., resulting in restructuring charges of $23.1 million related to the impairments of \noperating lease right-of-use assets, furniture and fixtures, and leasehold improvements, and $4.4 million of accelerated depreciation.\n•\nIn June 2022, our management team, with the support of our Board, decided to dissolve the MobileCard business, in which we had \nacquired a controlling interest in July of 2021 (see Note 7).  MobileCard was not meeting its projected targets.  As a result, we \nrecorded net impairment charges of $7.0 million, to include the write-offs of the remaining acquired intangible assets, goodwill, and \nthe noncontrolling interest.  We also terminated approximately 40 employees, which resulted in restructuring charges related to \ninvoluntary terminations of $0.6 million.\n•\nWe reduced our workforce by approximately 100 employees, mainly in North America, as a result of organizational changes and \nefficiencies, to include a margin improvement initiative that began in the second quarter of 2022.  As a result, we incurred \nrestructuring charges related to involuntary terminations of $7.1 million.\nDuring 2021 we implemented the following restructuring and reorganizational activities:\n•\nWe reduced our workforce by approximately 100 employees, mainly in North America, as a result of organizational changes and \nefficiencies.  As a result, we incurred restructuring charges related to involuntary terminations of $3.4 million.\n•\nWe modified one of our real estate leases resulting in an earlier termination date.  As a result, we incurred restructuring charges \nrelated to the accelerated depreciation of furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements of $1.2 million.\nDuring 2020 we implemented the following restructuring and reorganizational activities:\n•\nWe reduced our workforce by approximately 80 employees, mainly in North America, as a result of organizational changes and \nefficiencies.  As a result, we incurred restructuring charges related to involuntary terminations of $4.2 million.\nThe activities discussed above resulted in total charges for 2022, 2021, and 2020 of $46.3 million, $4.9 million, and $5.3 million, respectively, \nwhich have been reflected as a separate line item in our Income Statements. \n62"

Under the terms of SEZ, CSG qualifies for a reduced \nincome tax rate on operations within the SEZ for a period of up to 10 years, beginning in 2018.

The effective tax rates in Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom differ from the statutory rates of 30%, 12.5%, and \n19% respectively, due to changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, withholding taxes incurred, and the impact of foreign exchange \nrecognition on certain intercompany loans.\nThe difference between our income tax provision computed at the statutory Federal income tax rate and our financial statement income tax is \nsummarized as follows (in thousands): \n \n \n \n2022\n   \n2021\n   \n2020\n \nProvision at Federal rate of 21%\n $\n12,764     $\n21,199     $\n17,925  \nState income taxes, net of Federal impact\n  \n2,079      \n4,882      \n3,430  \nResearch and experimentation credits\n  \n(1,560 )    \n(2,062 )    \n(2,705 )\nStock award vesting\n  \n(1,355 )    \n(538 )    \n(540 )\nTax uncertainties\n  \n(227 )    \n69      \n(403 )\nSection 162(m) compensation limitation\n  \n2,326      \n1,610      \n4,494  \nForeign rate differential\n  \n571      \n592      \n462  \nValuation allowance for deferred tax assets\n  \n638      \n1,427      \n1,002  \nWithholding tax\n  \n1,948      \n2,305      \n2,572  \nOther impact of foreign operations\n  \n422      \n(468 )    \n621  \nStatutory rate change\n  \n303      \n(299 )    \n71  \nConvertible debt premium\n  \n(1,017 )    \n—      \n—  \nOther\n  \n(171 )    \n(102 )    \n(284 )\nTotal income tax provision\n $\n16,721  \n  $\n28,615  \n  $\n26,645  \nWe have undistributed earnings of approximately $70 million from certain foreign subsidiaries.

Amortization of such \ncapitalized expenditures are allowed over a 5-year period if incurred domestically or a 15-year period if incurred outside the United States.  Of the \ntotal R&D related deferred income tax assets (net of applicable amortization) as of December 31, 2022, in the table above, Federal and state was \n$28.2 million with the remaining amount attributable to foreign R&D credits. \nWe regularly assess the likelihood of the future realization of our deferred income tax assets.  To the extent we believe that it is more likely than \nnot that a deferred income tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established.  As of December 31, 2022, we believe we will \ngenerate sufficient taxable income in the future such that we will realize 100% of the benefit of our U.S. Federal deferred income tax assets, thus \nno valuation allowance has been established.  As of December 31, 2022, we have state and foreign deferred income tax assets (net of federal \nbenefit related to state and foreign income tax jurisdictions) of $3.2 million and $34.7 million, respectively, and have established valuation \nallowances against those state and foreign income tax deferred income tax assets of $2.0 million and $26.0 million, respectively. \nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have an acquired U.S. Federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward of approximately $13 million and \n$18 million, respectively, which will begin to expire in 2029 and can be utilized through 2033.  The acquired U.S. Federal NOL carryforward is \nattributable to the pre-acquisition periods of acquired businesses. The annual utilization of this U.S. Federal NOL carryforward is limited pursuant \nto Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  In addition, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have: (i) state NOL \ncarryforwards of approximately $42 million and $41 million, respectively, which will expire beginning in 2023 with a portion of the losses available \nover an indefinite period of time; and (ii) foreign subsidiary NOL carryforwards of approximately $104 million and $116 million, respectively, which \nwill expire beginning in 2031, with a portion of the losses available over an indefinite period of time.     \nAccounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.  We are required to estimate our income tax liability in each jurisdiction in which we operate, \nincluding U.S. Federal, state, and foreign income tax jurisdictions.  Various judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our tax positions \nand determining our provisions for income taxes.  There are certain transactions and calculations for which the ultimate income tax determination \nmay be uncertain.  In addition, we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by various foreign, federal, state, or local tax \nauthorities, which could result in adverse outcomes.  For these reasons, we establish a liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits based \non estimates of whether additional taxes and interest may be due.  This liability is adjusted based upon changing facts and circumstances, such \nas the closing of a tax audit, the expiration of a statute of limitations or the refinement of an estimate. \n65"

If recognized, the $2.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022, would favorably impact our effective \ntax rate in future periods. \nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state and local jurisdictions, and many foreign jurisdictions.  The U.S., \nU.K., India, and Australia are the primary taxing jurisdictions in which we operate.  The years open for audit vary depending on the taxing \njurisdiction. We estimate that it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by up to $0.6 million over \nthe next twelve months due to completion of tax audits and the expiration of statute of limitations.\n10.\nEmployee Retirement Benefit Plans \nWe sponsor a defined contribution plan covering substantially all of our U.S.-based employees.  Eligible participants may defer up to 100% of \ntheir eligible pay, subject to certain limitations, as pre-tax, Roth, or traditional after-tax contributions.   We make certain matching, and at our \ndiscretion, non-elective employer contributions to the plan.  All contributions are subject to certain IRS limits.  The expense related to these \ncontributions for 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $13.2 million, $12.4 million, and $12.1 million, respectively.  We also have defined contribution-type \nplans for certain of our non-U.S.-based employees.  The total contributions made to these plans in 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $6.6 million, $6.1 \nmillion, and $4.8 million, respectively. \n11.\nCommitments, Guarantees and Contingencies \nService Agreements.  We have an agreement with Ensono, Inc. (“Ensono”) to provide us outsourced computing services through September 30, \n2025.  We outsource the computer processing and related services required for the operation of our SaaS platforms.  Our proprietary software \nand other software applications are run in an outsourced data center environment in order to obtain the necessary computer processing capacity \nand other computer support services without us having to make the substantial capital and infrastructure investments that would be necessary for \nus to provide these services internally.  Our customers are connected to the outsourced data center environment through a combination of private \nand commercially provided networks.  Our SaaS platforms are generally considered to be mission critical customer management systems by our \ncustomers.  As a result, we are highly dependent upon Ensono for system availability, security, and response time. \nGuarantees.  In the ordinary course of business, we may provide guarantees in the form of bid bonds, performance bonds, or standby letters of \ncredit.  As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.8 million of restricted assets used to collateralize these guarantees, with $1.0 million included in \ncash and cash equivalents and $0.8 million included in other non-current assets. \nWe have performance guarantees in the form of surety bonds and money transmitter bonds, both issued through a third-party that are not \nrequired to be on our Balance Sheet.  As of December 31, 2022, we had performance guarantees of $3.4 million.  We are ultimately liable for \nclaims that may occur against these guarantees.  We have no history of material claims or are aware of circumstances that would require us to \npay under any of these arrangements.  We also believe that the resolution of any claim that may arise in the future, either individually or in the \naggregate, would not be material to our Financial Statements.  As of December 31, 2022, we had total aggregate money transmitter bonds of \n$19.0 million outstanding.

From time-to-time, these arrangements may also include provisions for \npossible liquidated damages or other financial remedies for our non-performance, or in the case of certain of our solutions, provisions for \ndamages related to service level performance requirements.  The service level performance requirements typically relate to system availability \nand timeliness of service delivery.  As of December 31, 2022, we believe we have adequate reserves, based on our historical experience, to cover \nany reasonably anticipated exposure as a result of our nonperformance for any past or current arrangements with our customers. \nIndemnifications Related to Officers and the Board of Directors.  Other guarantees include promises to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless our \ndirectors, and certain officers. Such indemnification covers any expenses and liabilities reasonably incurred by a person, by reason of the fact that \nsuch person is, was, or has agreed to be a director or officer, in connection with the investigation, defense, and settlement of any threatened, \npending, or contemplated action, suit, proceeding, or claim.  We maintain directors’ and officers’ (“D&O”) insurance coverage to protect against \nsuch losses. We have not historically incurred any losses related to these types of indemnifications and are not aware of any pending or \nthreatened actions or claims against any officer or member of our Board.  As a result, we have not recorded any liabilities related to such \nindemnifications as of December 31, 2022.  In addition, as a result of the insurance policy coverage, we believe these indemnification agreements \nare not significant to our results of operations.  \nLegal Proceedings.  From time-to-time, we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of \nbusiness.  \n12.\nStockholders’ Equity \nStock Repurchase Program.  We currently have a stock repurchase program, approved by our Board, authorizing us to repurchase shares of our \ncommon stock from time-to-time as market and business conditions warrant (the “Stock Repurchase Program”).  During 2022, 2021, and 2020, \nwe repurchased 1,497,000 shares of our common stock for $87.9 million (weighted–average price of $58.71 per share), 733,000 shares of our \ncommon stock for $36.0 million (weighted-average price of $49.13 per share), and 624,000 shares of our common stock for $26.3 million \n(weighted-average price of $42.13 per share), respectively, under a Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b5-1 Plan.  \nAs of December 31, 2022, the remaining number of shares available for repurchase under the Stock Repurchase Program totaled 2.1 million \nshares.  \nStock Repurchases for Tax Withholdings.  In addition to the above-mentioned stock repurchases, during 2022, 2021, and 2020, we repurchased \nand then cancelled approximately 138,000 shares, 130,000 shares, and 254,000 shares for $8.7 million, $6.3 million, and $11.9 million, \nrespectively, of common stock from our employees in connection with minimum tax withholding requirements resulting from the vesting of \nrestricted stock under our stock incentive plans. \nCash Dividend.  During 2022, 2021, and 2020 our Board approved total cash dividends of $1.06 per share, $1.00 per share, and $0.94 per share \nof common stock, totaling $33.7 million, $32.7 million, and $30.9 million, respectively. \n67"

      "text": "Warrants.  In 2014, in conjunction with the execution of an amendment to our current agreement with Comcast, we issued stock warrants (the \n“Warrant Agreement”) for the right to purchase up to 2.9 million shares of our common stock (the “Stock Warrants”) as an additional incentive for \nComcast to convert customer accounts onto our solutions based on various milestones.  The Stock Warrants have a ten-year term and an \nexercise price of $26.68 per warrant.  \nOf the total Stock Warrants issued, 1.9 million Stock Warrants have vested and been exercised.  As of December 31, 2022, 1.0 million Stock \nWarrants remain issued, none of which have vested.  The remaining unvested Stock Warrants will be accounted for as a customer contract cost \nasset once the performance conditions necessary for vesting are considered probable.\nOnce vested, Comcast may exercise the Stock Warrants and elect either physical delivery of common shares or net share settlement (cashless \nexercise).  Alternatively, the exercise of the Stock Warrants may be settled with cash based solely on our approval, or if Comcast were to \nbeneficially own or control in excess of 19.99% of the common stock or voting of the Company. \n13.\nEquity Compensation Plans \nStock Incentive Plan.  Our stockholders have approved the issuance of up to 25.0 million shares under the Amended and Restated 2005 Stock \nIncentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”).  Shares reserved under the 2005 Plan can be granted to officers and other key employees of our Company and \nits subsidiaries and to non-employee directors of our Company in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance unit awards, \nrestricted stock awards, or stock bonus awards.  Shares granted under the 2005 Plan in the form of a performance unit award, restricted stock \naward, or stock bonus award are counted toward the aggregate number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2005 Plan as \ntwo shares for every one share granted or issued in payment of such award.  As of December 31, 2022, 3.9 million shares were available for \nissuance, with 3.5 million shares available for grant.      \nRestricted Stock.  We generally issue new shares (versus treasury shares) to fulfill restricted stock award grants. Restricted stock awards are \ngranted at no cost to the recipient.  Historically, our restricted stock awards have vested annually primarily over two to four years with no \nrestrictions other than the passage of time (i.e., the shares are released upon calendar vesting with no further restrictions) (or “Time-Based \nAwards”).  Unvested Time-Based Awards are typically forfeited and cancelled upon termination of employment with our Company.  Certain Time-\nBased Awards become fully vested (i.e., vesting accelerates) upon a change in control, as defined, and the subsequent involuntary termination of \nemployment, or death.  The fair value of the Time-Based Awards (determined by using the closing market price of our common stock on the grant \ndate) is charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.  \nWe also issue restricted stock shares to key members of management that vest upon meeting pre-established financial and operational \nperformance objectives (“Performance-Based Awards”).  The structure of the performance goals for the Performance-Based Awards has been \napproved by our stockholders. Certain Performance-Based Awards become fully vested (i.e., vesting accelerates) upon a change in control, as \ndefined, and the subsequent involuntary termination of employment.  The fair value of the Performance-Based Awards (determined by using the \nclosing market price of our common stock on the grant date) is charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the performance period (generally \ntwo-years).\nAdditionally, we issue restricted stock to key members of management which vest upon the achievement of specified Company market valuations \nand conditions (\"Market-Based Awards\").  During 2022, we issued Market-Based Awards to key members of management, which vest upon \nmeeting a relative shareholder return performance achievement tier (\"2022 Market-Based Awards\").  Certain 2022 Market-Based Awards become \nfully vested (i.e., vesting accelerates) upon a change in control, as defined, and the subsequent involuntary termination of employment.  The fair \nvalue of the 2022 Market-Based Awards (determined using a Monte Carlo valuation method) is charged to expense on a straight-line basis over a \nthree-year performance period.\nDuring 2020, we issued Market-Based Awards for 0.1 million to certain members of executive management which vest upon meeting pre-\nestablished share price targets over a four-year period (\"2020 Market-Based Awards\"). The 2020 Market-Based Awards become fully vested upon \na change in control, as defined, and the subsequent involuntary termination of employment. The fair value of the 2020 Market-Based Awards \n(determined using a Monte Carlo valuation method), is charged to expense over the estimated service period for each separately vesting portion \nof the award as if the award is, in-substance, multiple awards.\n68"

The total market value of restricted stock shares vesting during 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $26.4 million, $21.0 million, and \n$32.8 million, respectively. \n1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.  As of December 31, 2022, we have an employee stock purchase plan whereby 2.9 million shares of our \ncommon stock have been reserved for sale to our U.S. employees through payroll deductions.  The price for shares purchased under the plan is \n85% of market value on the last day of the purchase period.  Purchases are made at the end of each month.  During 2022, 2021, and 2020, \n58,362 shares, 64,342 shares, and 68,552 shares, respectively, were purchased under the plan for $3.0 million ($44.95 to $55.46 per share), $2.6 \nmillion ($36.63 to $48.98 per share), and $2.5 million ($32.20 to $42.35 per share), respectively.  As of December 31, 2022, 1.2 million shares \nremain eligible for purchase under the plan. \nStock-Based Compensation Expense.  We recorded stock-based compensation expense of $27.2 million, $21.4 million, and $25.2 million, \nrespectively, for 2022, 2021, and 2020.  As of December 31, 2022, there was $36.2 million of total compensation cost related to unvested awards \nnot yet recognized. This amount, excluding the impact of forfeitures, is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years. \nWe recorded a deferred income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense during 2022, 2021, and 2020, of $5.7 million, $4.9 \nmillion, and $5.8 million, respectively.  The actual income tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from the vesting of restricted stock for 2022, \n2021, and 2020, totaled $4.5 million, $4.4 million, and $4.0 million, respectively. \nModification of Stock-Based Awards.  In August 2020, we entered into a Separation Agreement, with our then-current President and Chief \nExecutive Officer (“CEO”) which included a provision that accelerated the vesting of approximately 198,000 shares of unvested restricted stock on \nDecember 30, 2020.  This modification resulted in a reversal of stock-based compensation expense in 2020 of $2.7 million. The fair value of the \nmodified award of $8.4 million was recognized ratably from the date of modification through the resignation date, all of which was recognized in \n2020. \n69"
