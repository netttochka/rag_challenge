      "text": "CoreCard Corporation \n \nTo the Shareholders of CoreCard Corporation, \n \nIt was an interesting year for shareholders of the company as they have followed the path of the CCRD share price. Normally, I \ndon’t even talk about stock prices as they are not in the realm of what management can control but the last couple of years has \nbeen, to say the least, interesting. It seems like for a while we had collective hallucination that money was always free, and we \nlived in a world with endless liquidity. Valuation of companies formerly relied on PE (Profit/Earning) but in this era companies get \nhigher values without any E (Earnings). Stock prices, including ours, did not reflect any historical reality. We would say the same \nwhen the stock was extraordinarily high ($50+) as when it was very low (~$20).  As someone said, free money is like a virus that \nturns the brain to mush!  \n \nOur stock performance was excellent the past year in comparison with the other modern fintech companies. While disappointed \nat moments in time with how we are valued, it is good to know that our financial performance is recognized and valued as we \nhave an important E when looking at PE! \n \nWe are old school and still believe discounted cash flow is an important measure of value along with appropriate adjustments. \nWe do not risk capital gratuitously and we build for endurance while avoiding that which may be the current fleeting trend of the \nmonth. The customer is always first and slightly ahead of shareholders and employees because we believe to do otherwise \nwould destroy value for all. We strive to make ourselves indispensable to our customers while keeping a long-term focus. \nIndispensable means they absolutely want to do business with us because of the premium capabilities they see in CoreCard and \nnot because they have no other choices. \n \nWe also believe management should be held accountable for setting reasonable expectations and doing what they said they \nwould do. And stock price should take that into account. Trust is important for shareholders, customers, and employees. We \nstrive to hit the mark with all three.   \n \nLast year we achieved a new high in revenues and earnings and we have started the new year strong as expected but without \nanother large chunk of license revenue (also as expected). We continue on the “journey” that I spoke about in the letter last year \nand see our revenue from sources other than our largest customer continuing to grow. This will help with potential shareholders \nwho focus on the risk of customer concentration. \n \nI know our foundation is solid and strong and often say we are building the company brick by brick. That may seem contradictory \nthis year as we know we will have less license revenue so it is highly unlikely we will achieve the same revenues and earnings in \n2023 as achieved in 2022.  But in reality, all of our business is expected to grow other than the license revenue. Perhaps keeping \nthe “brick by brick” analogy, we are putting a door or window in the building instead of another brick. \n \nWhile I am not going to walk down the path of many larger CEO letters where they opine on the macro markets and make \npredictions (often wrong or meaningless), I will say the banking turmoil experienced in the first quarter 2023 can possibly have \nsome impact on your company. It would be easy to predict the executive in charge of their bank card programs reporting that \nthey have decided to move from a legacy processor to a more modern processor (CoreCard) and the bank board of directors \nsaying “NO - don’t rock the boat. We don’t want any attention!” But, if it happens, it will also pass as the macro environment \nchanges. \n \nOne of the bits of advice I give start-ups (I have worked with Georgia Tech and many others over the years as a part of civic \nservice and angel investing) is to not count on larger corporations to always be logical. Entrepreneurs often assume that \neveryone is like them when, in fact, decision makers in larger enterprises are simply not risk takers. That calculation must be built \ninto your plan. It is built into the CoreCard plan which is why we talk about brick by brick. When the decision makers see the \nbuilding (enterprise/offering) you provide is mature enough, they can then take the lower risk to work with you. More importantly, \nwhen they can point to others who took the risk and “won”, they also can take the risk. \n \nAs we move from a very good year to a year that will not “appear” to be as good, we will be making a conscious and deliberate \neffort to not be just “good” but to be “great” as a company and with our products. Without recognizing the goal and making the \neffort, inertia always wins. It is a battle to move the company to the next level and we want you to know we don’t assume it will"

What we did last year or years ago is not relevant. \n \nLast year I mentioned our “boiler plate” that quickly describes who we are. In writing this letter, I realized that the “boiler plate” \nhad changed. Does that mean it was wrong previously and now we have it right? The answer is NO. It simply means the \nmessage continues to grow clearer as we get feedback from our customers. Corecard is now “The GOLD standard of Modern \nIssuer Processing.” We are a profitable, PROVEN, modern technology provider of embedded finance and revolving credit card \nservices at SCALE with large portfolio CONVERSION experience! \n \nI’ll end with similar words found in the letter last year - When you combine an elite, experienced, and well-trained team who truly \ncares about each other and cares for their partners with the GOLD standard of modern issuer processing software, with partners \nwho demand and expect excellence, with stable financial resources providing a foundation for growth, I think you can expect to \ncontinue to see bricks added to that foundation at a good pace. \nThanks to our shareholders, customers, and great team members we can continue building."

      "text": "1 \n \n \nPROXY STATEMENT \nFOR THE ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS TO BE HELD JUNE 1, 2023 \n \nWe are sending this Proxy Statement to the shareholders of CoreCard Corporation (the “company”) in connection with the solicitation of \nproxies by the Board of Directors (the “Board”) to be voted at the 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”) of CoreCard \nCorporation and any adjournment thereof. The Annual Meeting will be held on June 1, 2023 at our principal executive offices located at \nOne Meca Way, Norcross, Georgia 30093 at 4:00 p.m. local time. We expect to mail this Proxy Statement and the accompanying proxy \nto shareholders on or about April 14, 2023. \n \nVOTING \nGeneral \n \nThe securities that can be voted at the Annual Meeting consist of common stock of CoreCard Corporation, $.01 par value per share. Each \nshare entitles its owner to one vote on each matter submitted to the shareholders. There are no cumulative voting rights. The record of \nshareholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting was taken as of the close of business on April 11, 2023.  On that date, we had \noutstanding and entitled to vote 8,502,735 shares of common stock with each share entitled to one vote. \n \nQuorum \n \nA majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock must be present, in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the Annual \nMeeting. We will treat shares subject to abstentions or broker non-votes as present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining a \nquorum. Broker non-votes occur when a bank, broker, or other nominee of shares held in street name is not permitted to vote without \ninstructions from the shareholder and such instructions have not been given. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted as a vote cast \nand will have no effect on the vote on any proposal. \n \nRequired Vote \n \nA. Russell Chandler, III and Kathryn Petralia, the incumbent nominees for election as director, will be reelected if more votes are cast “For” \nthan are cast “Against” them. If more votes are cast Against, the nominee is required to submit their resignation subject to acceptance by the \nBoard of Directors (the “Board”).  The other members of the Board will determine the action to be taken with respect to the resignation and \nwill publicly announce their decision and the rationale therefor. \n \nWith respect to Proposal 2 – TO APPROVE, BY A NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE, THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE \nOFFICERS, the proposal will be approved if more votes are cast “For” than are cast “Against” the proposal.  The proposal is advisory and \nnonbinding. The Board will review the result of the vote and take it into account when making future compensation decisions. \n \nProxies \n \nAt the Annual Meeting, the persons named as proxies will vote all properly executed proxy cards delivered in connection with this solicitation \nand not revoked in accordance with the directions given. Shareholders should specify their choices with regard to each proposal to be voted \nupon on the accompanying proxy card. If no specific instructions are given with regard to a proposal to be voted upon, then the shares \nrepresented by a signed proxy card will be voted “FOR” such proposal. If any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, \nthe persons named as proxies will vote upon such matters according to their judgment. \n \nSome of our shareholders hold their shares through a broker, bank, custodian or other nominee, rather than directly in their own name. \nThis is commonly referred to as holding shares in “street name.” If you hold shares in street name, these proxy materials are being \nforwarded to you by your broker, bank, custodian or other nominee, which is considered, with respect to such shares, to be the shareholder \nof record. As the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you have the right to direct the nominee how such shares should be \nvoted. You also have the right to attend the Annual Meeting. However, since you are not the shareholder of record, you must first obtain \na signed proxy from the shareholder of record giving you the right to vote the shares at the Annual Meeting. Your broker, bank, custodian \nor other nominee has enclosed or provided you voting instructions for you to use in directing the nominee how to vote your shares or \nobtain a proxy from the nominee. \n \nYou may revoke your proxy in connection with this solicitation at any time prior to voting at the Annual Meeting by: \n \ngiving written notice to the Secretary of the company at One Meca Way, Norcross, Georgia 30093, or \n \nexecuting and delivering to the Secretary a later dated proxy, or \n \nvoting in person at the Annual Meeting."

Such costs include charges by brokers, fiduciaries and \ncustodians for forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of stock held in their names. We may solicit proxies by mail, telephone and \npersonal contact by directors, officers, and employees of the company without additional compensation. \n \nMultiple Shareholders Sharing the Same Address \n \nIf you and other residents at your mailing address own shares of common stock in street name, your broker or bank may have sent you a \nnotice that your household will receive only one Annual Report to Shareholders and Proxy Statement. This practice is known as \n“householding,” and is designed to reduce our printing and postage costs.

In 2018, she was named to \nForbes’ list of the World’s Most Powerful Women. The Board considered Ms. Petralia’s background as an executive officer, her experience in \nthe FinTech industry, her experience in management and her operational and strategic insight in determining that she should serve as a \ndirector of the company. The Board has determined that Ms. Petralia qualifies as an independent director under the rules of NYSE. \n \nJ. Leland Strange has served as our President since 1983 and our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board since 1985. The Board \nconsidered Mr. Strange’s many years of experience as the company’s CEO, his familiarity with the industries and customers which our \noperating companies serve, and his past experience on several boards of directors and audit and compensation committees of other publicly \ntraded companies in determining that he should serve as a director of the company.   \n \nThere are no family relationships among any of the company’s directors or executive officers. \n \nThere have been no events under any bankruptcy act, no criminal proceedings and no judgments or injunctions material to an evaluation of \nthe ability and integrity of any director, executive officer or control person of the company during the past ten years. There are no proceedings \nto which any director, officer, affiliate, any owner of record or beneficially of more than 5 percent of our common stock, or any security holder \nof the company is an adverse party to the company or has a material interest adverse to the company. \n \nFour of the directors and all of the members of the Audit Committee are independent, as such term is defined in the listing standards of the \nNYSE and the rules of the SEC. The Audit Committee meets the composition requirements of NYSE’s listing (as defined by the rules of \nNYSE). As a result of Ms. Camp’s decision not to stand for reelection, the Board reduced the size of the Board from five members to four, \neffective as of the date of the annual meeting. \n \nBoard Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight \n \nThe Chief Executive Officer serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company. Given the size and scope of the company’s \noperations, the company believes that the leadership structure of the Board, which as of the date of the annual meeting will consist of four \ndirectors of which three are independent, is appropriate. There is no lead independent director because there has been no need for such a \nrole based on the continuity resulting from the tenure of the directors and the small size of the Board. Given the character, size and scope of \nthe company’s operations and the stability and long tenure of its workforce and management team, there is limited exposure to external risks \nother than general business, product and market risks. General business and operational risks are handled primarily by senior executive \nmanagement and discussed during regular Board meetings as necessary. The company has limited, if any, exposure related to financial \ninstruments, environmental issues, off balance sheet entities and such external risks. The Board reviews treasury risks, financial and \naccounting risks, legal and compliance risks, information technology security and cybersecurity risks and risks related to internal control over \nfinancial reporting. The Audit Committee, which consists of the independent directors, provides risk oversight as part of the company’s internal \ncontrols process and regularly reviews reports from management and external auditors on risk analysis and tests of the design and \neffectiveness of the company’s internal controls. The Board considered and has determined that risks arising from its compensation policies \nand practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company. This determination was based on the limited nature \nof the company’s compensation program. The full board also has oversight of enterprise risk management and considers strategic risks and \nopportunities on a regular basis.  \n \nMeetings and Committees of the Board of Directors \n \nThe Board met five times during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation \nCommittee and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Audit Committee of the Board met five times in 2022. During 2022, \nthe Audit Committee consisted of Mr. Chandler (chair), Mr. Moise and Ms. Camp. In 2022, the Audit Committee appointed the company’s \nindependent auditor to review its report on the 2022 audit and the 2022 quarterly reviews, and carried out a number of other responsibilities, \nas outlined in the Audit Committee Charter.  \n \nAll members of the Audit Committee currently meet the applicable independence and qualifications standards of the NYSE. The Board has \ndetermined that Mr. Chandler is a financial expert as defined by the rules of the SEC and is financially sophisticated as defined in the listing \nstandards of NYSE. The Board based this determination, in part, on Mr. Chandler’s experience in actively supervising senior financial and \naccounting personnel and in overseeing the preparation of financial statements as the audit committee chair of publicly-traded companies."

In addition, The Compensation Committee may appoint one or more subcommittees consisting of one or more \nmembers of the Compensation Committee and may delegate to any subcommittee or Compensation Committee member such Committee \nauthority, responsibilities and duties as the Compensation Committee sees fit. Neither the Compensation Committee nor management has \nengaged a compensation consultant to provide advice or recommendations on the form or amount of executive or director compensation. \nFrom time to time, the Compensation Committee has sought input from publicly available data compiled by executive officers of the company \nrelating to compensation paid to executive officers and directors in similar size, publicly traded companies in the same geographic area or \nindustry as the company. The Compensation Committee has also solicited input from the CEO with respect to compensation of non-CEO \nexecutive officers.  \n \nThe Compensation Committee considers compensation data based on a comparator group. Our comparator group is intended to be \nrepresentative of the market in which we compete most directly for executive talent. The selection of companies comprising our comparator \ngroup is based on similarity in revenue size, lines of business, participation in global markets and market capitalization. The peer group is \nconstructed to target CoreCard near the median of the composite ranking of the financial and operating metrics of the companies in the \ncomparator group. The comparator group used in 2021 to set 2022 compensation was: \nPaySign \nAmerican Software \nMarqeta \nRepay \n \nThe Board has a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee consisting of four independent directors, Mr. Chandler, Mr. Moise, Ms. \nPetralia and Ms. Camp (chair). The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met twice in 2022. The Nominating and Corporate \nGovernance Committee was established to assist the Board with (i) Board and committee organization, membership and function, (ii) oversight \nof the evaluation of director qualifications and performance, and (iii) corporate governance. As part of these responsibilities, the Nominating \nand Corporate Governance Committee evaluates candidates for service as directors of the Company, conducts the Board’s annual self-\nassessment process and recommends corporate governance principles for adoption by the Board. The Nominating and Corporate \nGovernance Committee will consider candidates recommended by shareholders. Shareholder recommendations must comply with the \nprocedures for director nominations set forth in Article Three, Section 3.9, of the Company’s Bylaws and applicable law. \n \nIn 2022, each director attended all meetings of the Board and Committees on which they served. In March 2023, the Board elected Kathryn \nPetralia to serve on the Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance committees. \n \nExecutive Officers \n \nThe following information is provided about our non-director executive officer: \n \nName\nAge\nPosition / Principal Occupation\nMatthew A. White\n41\nChief Financial Officer and Secretary\n \nMatthew A. White was elected on January 22, 2019, as Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary. Mr. White was previously serving as \nVP Finance and CFO of CoreCard Software, the main operating subsidiary of CoreCard and he will continue to serve in that role. Prior to \njoining CoreCard Software Mr. White held various accounting and financial reporting positions at Humana and, most recently, Equifax. Prior \nto that he was a Senior Manager in the audit practice at Deloitte and is a licensed CPA. \n \nThe Board of Directors elects the executive officers to serve until they are removed, replaced or resign."

Given the nature of our business, the small number of executives and the significant ownership \nheld by Mr. Strange, the Compensation Committee believes that a straight-forward compensation plan that is economical to administer and \nthat consists of a reasonable base salary and appropriate periodic bonuses is appropriate for the company. None of the Named Executive \nOfficers has an employment agreement with the company and the company does not have any corporate non-equity incentive plans or \nnonqualified deferred compensation plans. From time to time, officers may be awarded bonuses to recognize achievement of corporate or \nsubsidiary goals or other accomplishments. Mr. Strange and Mr. White were awarded bonuses in 2021 and 2022 in recognition of the growth \nof the company in 2021 and 2022. No options were re-priced in the two year period ended December 31, 2022. All Other Annual Compensation \nshown above includes matching contributions by the company to the respective accounts of the executive officers pursuant to the terms of \nour Tax-Deferred Savings and Protection Plan (the “401(k) Plan”).

The independent auditors are \nresponsible for performing an independent audit of the company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with auditing standards \nof the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and for issuing a report thereon. As outlined in more detail \nin the Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee’s responsibility is generally to approve all services provided by and compensation \npaid to the independent auditors; review the adequacy of the company’s internal and disclosure controls and risk management practices; \nreview and monitor the annual audit of the financial statements including the financial statements produced and notes thereto; review SEC \nfilings containing the company’s financial statements; regularly meet with the independent auditors and management in separate sessions; \nand authorize investigations into any matter within the scope of their responsibilities. During fiscal year 2022 and through March 15, 2023, \namong its other activities, the Audit Committee: \n \n \nengaged the independent auditors and established their compensation; \n \nreviewed and discussed with management and the independent auditors the audited financial statements of the company as of \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 and for the years then ended; \n \ndiscussed with the independent auditors their reviews of the quarterly unaudited financial statements of the company for fiscal \n2022; \n \ndiscussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB and \nthe SEC; and \n \nreceived from the independent auditors the written disclosures and written affirmation of their independence required by PCAOB \nRule 3526 and discussed with the auditors the firm’s independence. \n \nBased upon the reviews and discussions summarized above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board (and the Board has \napproved) that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 \nfor filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n \nAUDIT COMMITTEE \nA. Russell Chandler, III (Chair) \nPhilip H. Moise \nElizabeth W. Camp \n \n \nNominations Process \n \nThe Board has appointed a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee consisting of four independent directors, A. Russell \nChandler, III, Philip H. Moise, Elizabeth W. Camp and Kathryn Petralia. The same individuals also nominate the officers of the company \nfor election by the Board. As a result of Ms. Camp’s decision not to stand for reelection the Board reduced the size of the Board from five \nmembers to four, effective as of the date of the annual meeting.  \n \nThe Board has not previously formed a policy with respect to consideration of candidates nominated by shareholders since there have \nbeen no such nominations. However, it is the Board’s intent to consider any security holder nominees that may be properly and timely put \nforth in the future. The Board has not identified any specific, minimum qualifications or skills that it believes must be met by a nominee for \ndirector. The company does not have a specific policy with respect to diversity in identifying nominees for director. In considering \nnominations for the 2022 Annual Meeting, the Board reviewed the appropriate size of the Board and the skills and characteristics of \ndirectors in the context of the current make-up, background and experience of the Board and the requirements and needs of the company \nin the foreseeable future. Security holders wishing to nominate a candidate for consideration at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders in \n2024 should submit the nominee’s name, affiliation and other pertinent information along with a statement as to why such person should \nbe considered for nomination. Such nominations should be addressed to the Board in care of the Secretary of the company and be \nreceived no later than 60 days before the date of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Board will evaluate any such nominees in a \nmanner similar to that for all director nominees.  \n \nMajority Voting in Uncontested Director Elections \nOur bylaws contain a majority voting standard for the election of directors in an uncontested election. Accordingly, each nominee must be \nelected by the vote of a majority of the votes cast by the shares present in person or represented by proxy. A “majority of the votes cast” \nmeans that the number of shares voted “for” a director’s election must exceed the number of votes “against” such nominee, excluding \nabstentions. Abstentions do not count as a vote “for” or “against” a director."

      "text": "12 \nIn addition, our Board has adopted a director resignation policy governing procedures in the event that a director does not receive a \nmajority of the votes cast. Pursuant to the Board’s director resignation policy, if an incumbent director fails to receive the required vote for \nre‑election in an uncontested election, that director shall promptly tender, to the Board or its Chairperson, his or her resignation from the \nBoard and from those Board committees on which the director serves, conditioned upon Board acceptance. The Nominating Committee \nwill promptly consider such resignation and then make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation tendered \nby such director. The Board will act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the recommendation of the Nominating Committee \nas well as other potentially relevant factors, no later than 180 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The director \nwhose resignation is under consideration shall not participate in the deliberations of the Nominating Committee or of the Board with respect \nto his or her resignation. \nThe Nominating Committee, in making its recommendation, and the Board, in making its decision, may consider any factors or other \ninformation that it considers appropriate and relevant, including any stated reasons why the shareholders voted against or withheld votes \nfrom such director, the director’s tenure, the director’s qualifications, the director’s past and expected contributions to the Board, and the \noverall composition of the Board, including whether accepting the resignation as tendered would cause the Company to fail to meet the \nrequirements of any law, regulation, or rule, including but not limited to those of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or the \nlisting standards of the NYSE. \nFollowing the Board’s decision, the Company will promptly disclose the Board’s decision regarding whether to accept or reject the director's \nresignation offer in a Form 8-K furnished to the SEC. If the Board has decided to reject the tendered resignation or to pursue any additional \naction, then the disclosure will include the rationale behind the decision. \nCommunication Between Security Holders and the Board of Directors \n \nSecurity holders and other interested parties wishing to communicate with members of the Board should send a letter to the Secretary of \nthe company with instructions as to which director(s) is to receive the communication. The Secretary will forward the written communication \nto each member of the Board identified by the sender or, if no individual director is identified, to all members of the Board. The company \nhas not in the past required members of the Board to attend each Annual Meeting of Shareholders because the formal meetings have \nbeen attended by very few shareholders and have generally been very brief and procedural in nature. The Board will continue to monitor \nshareholder interest and attendance at future meetings and reevaluate this policy as appropriate. \n \n \nPROPOSAL 2 – TO APPROVE, BY A NON-BINDING, ADVISORY VOTE, THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED \nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS \n \nWe are asking our shareholders to provide advisory approval of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, as described in the \nExecutive Compensation section of this Proxy Statement. While this vote is advisory and non-binding on the company, it will provide \ninformation to our Compensation Committee regarding investor sentiment about our executive compensation philosophies, policies and \npractices which the Compensation Committee will be able to consider for the remainder of 2023 and beyond. The compensation of our Named \nExecutive Officers and our compensation philosophies and practices are described in the Executive Compensation discussion and \naccompanying tables.   \n \nThe Compensation Committee endeavors to provide compensation arrangements that are reasonable given the company’s size, the nature \nof its business and the executive’s duties and that align pay with creating shareholder value, minimize risky behavior, and reward the executive \nfor his/her contribution to achieving our business goals. Given the nature of our business, the small number of our executives, and the \nsignificant ownership held by Mr. Strange, the Compensation Committee believes that a straight-forward compensation plan that is economical \nto administer and that consists of a reasonable base salary and appropriate periodic bonuses is appropriate for the company. \n \nNeither the approval nor the disapproval of this proposal will be binding on us or the Board or will be construed as overruling decisions by us \nor the Board. The company intends to provide shareholder advisory votes on its compensation of Named Executive Officers annually. \n \nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” PROPOSAL 2 APPROVING \nTHE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. \n \n \nCODE OF ETHICS \n \nThe company has adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to all directors, officers, and employees.  The Code of Ethics is posted in the Investor \nRelations section of our website at www.corecard.com.  The company discloses on its website, within the time required by the rules of the \nSEC, any waivers of, or amendments to, the Code of Ethics for the benefit of an executive officer."

All statements, trend analyses and other information contained in the following discussion \nrelative to markets for our products and trends in revenue, gross margins and anticipated expense levels, as well as \nother statements including words such as “may”, “will”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “intend”, “plan”, “estimate”, “expect”, \n”strategy” and “likely”, and other similar expressions constitute forward-looking statements. Prospective investors \nand current shareholders are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future \nperformance and involve risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those \ncontemplated by such forward-looking statements. A number of the factors that we believe could impact our future \noperations are discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of \nOperations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. CoreCard undertakes no obligation to update or revise its forward-looking \nstatements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in future operating \nresults except as required by law. \n \n \nITEM 1.   \nBUSINESS \n \nOverview \n \nCoreCard Corporation, a Georgia corporation, and its predecessor companies have operated since 1973 and its securities have been \npublicly traded since 1980. In this report, sometimes we use the terms “Company”, “us”, “ours”, “we”, “Registrant” and similar words to \nrefer to CoreCard Corporation and subsidiaries. Our executive offices are located in Norcross, Georgia and our website is \nwww.corecard.com. \n \nWe are primarily engaged in the business of providing technology solutions and processing services to the financial technology and \nservices market, commonly referred to as the FinTech industry. Our operations are conducted through our affiliate companies located \nin Romania, India, the United Arab Emirates and Colombia, as well as the corporate office in Norcross, Georgia which provides \nsignificant administrative, human resources and executive management support. CoreCard’s foreign subsidiaries are CoreCard SRL \nin Romania, CoreCard Software Pvt Ltd in India, CoreCard Colombia SAS in Colombia and CoreCard Software DMCC in the United \nArab Emirates, that perform software development and testing as well as processing operations support. \n \nFor further information about trends and risks likely to impact our business, please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of \nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.  \n \nCoreCard designs, develops and markets a comprehensive suite of software solutions to program managers, accounts receivable \nbusinesses, financial institutions, retailers and processors to manage their credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, private label cards, \nfleet cards, buy now pay later programs, loyalty programs and accounts receivable and loan transactions. CoreCard utilizes the same \ncore software solution in its processing operations as it sells to licensees, although licensees typically request a variety of \ncustomizations which may or may not deviate from the core software solution offering. \n \nThe CoreCard software solutions allow companies to offer any type of transacting account or card issuing program as well as \ninstallment and revolving loans, to set up and maintain account data, to record advances and payments, to assess fees, interest and \nother charges, to resolve disputes and chargebacks, to manage collections of accounts receivable, to generate reports and to settle \ntransactions with financial institutions and network schemes."

      "text": "2 \n \nThe CoreCard proprietary software applications are based on CoreCard’s core financial transaction processing platform \n(CoreENGINE™) and address the unique requirements of customers and program managers that issue or process: \n \n \nCredit Cards/Loans – revolving or non-revolving credit issued to consumer or business accounts (with or without a \nphysical card) that typically involve interest, fees, settlement, collections, etc. Within this market, CoreCard offers software \nspecifically tailored to handle private label cards, network branded (i.e., MasterCard, VISA, American Express or Discover) \nbank cards, fleet cards, loans of any type, or any other type of “system of record” accounts receivable.   \n \nPrepaid/Debit Cards – pre-loaded funds drawn down for purchase or cash withdrawal typically involving a variety of fees \nbut no interest. Numerous examples exist including gift cards, loyalty/reward cards, health benefit cards, payroll and \nbenefits disbursement, student aid disbursement, government assistance payments, corporate expense cards, transit \ncards and any other type of “system of record” stored value accounts.  \nThe CoreCard software solutions allow customers to optimize their card account management systems, improve customer retention, \nlower operating costs and create greater market differentiation. The CoreCard solutions are feature-rich, have web interfaces including \na standard library of APIs and contain financial transaction processing solutions that allow customers to automate, streamline and \noptimize business processes associated with the set-up, administration, management and settlement of credit, prepaid and loan \naccounts, to process transactions, and to generate reports and statements for these accounts. In addition, because the CoreCard \nproducts are designed to run on lower cost, scalable PC-based servers, rather than expensive legacy mainframe computers, \ncustomers may benefit from lower overall costs since the solution provides scalability by adding additional servers as card volume \ngrows. The CoreCard product functionality includes embedded multi-lingual, multi-currency support, web-based interface, real-time \nprocessing, complex rules-based authorizations, account hierarchies, documented APIs for easy integration to the backend \nfunctionality and robust fee libraries. These features support customer-defined pricing and payment terms and allow CoreCard’s \ncustomers to create new and innovative card programs to differentiate themselves in the marketplace and improve customer retention.   \n \nWe believe CoreCard is unique among software companies because it offers a full array of card and account management software \nsolutions, available either for in-house license or outsourced processing by CoreCard’s processing business (“Processing Services”) \nat the customer’s option. CoreCard also provides customers with a unique option to license the same CoreCard software that is used \nin the CoreCard processing environment and transfer it in-house for customer-controlled processing at a later date.    \n \n \nLicense – CoreCard sells a software license to a customer who then runs the CoreCard software system, configured for the \ncustomer’s unique requirements, at a customer controlled location. It usually requires substantial additional resources from \nCoreCard to customize or operate the licensed software. CoreCard is de-emphasizing the license option. \n \nProcessing Services – CoreCard offers processing services that allow customers to outsource their card processing \nrequirements to CoreCard. CoreCard manages all aspects of the processing functions using its proprietary software configured \nfor each processing customer.  \nWe continue to add resources to expand upon our infrastructure investment to support CoreCard’s Processing Services line of \nbusiness. CoreCard processes prepaid cards and credit cards (private label and open loop/network) for a number of customers and \nanticipates steadily growing this business further in 2023 and future years. CoreCard has multiple secure processing data centers at \nthird party locations, is certified as compliant with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards and has an SOC 1 and \nSOC 2 independent audit report that can be relied on by its prepaid and credit processing customers. It has obtained certification from \nAmerican Express, Discover, MasterCard, Visa, Star and Pulse.  \n \nCoreCard added Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. as a customer in 2018, referred to as “Customer A” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial \nStatements, which represented 75% and 71% of our consolidated revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and \n2021, respectively. We expect future professional services, maintenance, and license revenue from this customer in 2023 and future \nyears, however the amount and timing will be dependent on various factors not in our control such as the number of accounts on file \nand the level of customization needed by the customer. \n \nCoreCard has relationships with several financial institutions that are important for network certification, referrals for processing or \nprogram managers, and sponsoring prospective card programs.   \nCoreCard has Program Manager capabilities in addition to processing services, which has allowed us to gain additional experience \nand adding the potential for increased revenue, although we do not expect any significant revenue impact as a Program Manager in \nthe near term.   \n \nCoreCard’s principal target markets include consumer revolving credit portfolios, accounts receivable businesses, prepaid card \nissuers, retail and private-label issuers (large and small), small third-party processors, and small, mid-size and large financial"

CoreCard competes with third-party card \nprocessors that allow customers to outsource their account transaction processing rather than acquire software to manage their \ntransactions in-house. CoreCard competes with several larger and more established processors. Many of CoreCard’s competitors, \nespecially certain processors, have significantly more financial, marketing and development resources than CoreCard and have large, \nestablished customer bases often tied to long-term contracts. CoreCard believes it can compete successfully in its selected markets \nby providing to its licensed software customers and processing customers a robust technology platform, greater system flexibility and \nmore customer-driven marketing options. Additionally, the size and flexibility of CoreCard makes it possible to get to market more \nquickly with customized, flexible programs. Under our Processing Services option, customers can contract with CoreCard to provide \nprocessing services for their accounts using CoreCard software configured to the customer’s preferences, with an option to license \nthe same software and bring it in-house when and if the customer decides to become its own processor in the future. We believe this \ntransition path for customers is unique in the industry. \n \nThe CoreCard software platform and modules include CoreCREDIT™, CoreENGINE™, CoreISSUE™, CoreFRAUD™, \nCoreCOLLECT™, CoreAPP™, CoreMONEY™ and CoreACQUIRE™. Using a proprietary, base transaction processing platform \ncalled CoreENGINE, the CoreCard application modules have been further enhanced to meet the specific requirements of different \nmarket segments; for instance, CoreISSUE™ is available in different versions tailored to the requirements for issuing prepaid cards, \nfleet cards, bank cards or private label cards/accounts as well as accounts receivable management. In addition, CoreCard configures \nand/or customizes its robust base modules with additional or specific functionality to meet each customer’s requirements. The \nCompany has developed and licensed such products to customers in the prepaid, fleet, private label, retail and credit markets. As is \ntypical of most software companies, CoreCard expects to continually enhance and upgrade its existing software solutions and to \ndevelop additional modules to meet changing customer and market requirements. To date, CoreCard has focused its extensive \ndevelopment and limited sales activities on building a base of customers in each of its target markets, as well as putting in place the \ninfrastructure and processes to be able to scale the business successfully, particularly for the Processing Services business. \n \nHistorically, most of the Company’s sales have resulted from prospects contacting CoreCard based on an online search or through \nindustry referrals. CoreCard typically sells its products directly to customers, often in competitive situations, with relatively long sales \nand implementation cycles.   \n \nWe have several revenue streams. We receive software license fees that vary depending upon the number of licensed users, number \nof accounts on the system, and the number of software modules licensed. We also derive service revenue from implementation, \ncustomization, and annual maintenance and support contracts for our licensed software. Processing customers pay an implementation \nand setup fee plus monthly service fees, primarily based on number of accounts, under a contract with a term of generally three or \nmore years.  Depending on factors such as contract terms, customer implementation and testing schedule, and extent of customization \nor configuration required and whether we are licensing or processing, the timing of revenue recognition on contracts may lead to \nconsiderable fluctuation in revenue and profitability. There are often delays in implementation cycles, especially for processing \ncustomers, due to third party approvals or processes that are outside of CoreCard’s control and thus it is difficult to predict with certainty \nwhen we will be able to begin recognizing revenue on new contracts.    \n \nCoreCard’s licensed software products are used by its customers to manage and process various credit, debit and prepaid card \nprograms and there are a number of federal and state regulations governing the issuance of and the processing of financial \ntransactions associated with such cards. CoreCard’s customers are required to comply with such regulations and, to the extent that \ncustomers depend on their licensed CoreCard software to manage and process their card accounts, the CoreCard software features \nand functionality must allow customers to comply with the various governmental regulations. CoreCard continually evaluates applicable \nregulations and regularly upgrades and enhances its software to help its customers meet their obligations to comply with current and \nanticipated governmental regulations. As part of CoreCard’s processing business, CoreCard provides compliance-related services, \nincluding data and network security, customer identification screening and regular reporting, which enable its customers to be in \ncompliance with applicable governmental regulations including but not limited to the Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering \nregulations with final responsibility for compliance resting with the customer. Depending on the extent of changes and new \ngovernmental regulations, CoreCard will regularly incur additional costs to modify its software and services to be compliant. CoreCard \nhas no costs related to compliance with environmental laws.  \n \nOur business is not considered seasonal although the use of certain of our products may grow with the summer travel season for our \nMiddle East customers and higher end-of-year spending patterns and possibly cause a small revenue increase during these periods."

We derive our product revenue from licensing our comprehensive suite of financial transaction management software to \nfinancial institutions, retailers, processors and accounts receivable businesses to manage their credit and debit cards, prepaid \ncards, private label cards, fleet cards, buy now pay later programs, loyalty programs, and accounts receivable and loan \ntransactions. Our service revenue consists of fees for software maintenance and support for licensed software products, fees for \nprocessing services that we provide to companies that outsource their financial transaction processing functions to us, and \nprofessional services primarily for software customizations provided to both license and processing customers. \nOur results vary in part depending on the size and number of software licenses recognized as well as the value and number of \nprofessional services contracts recognized in a particular period. As we continue to grow our Processing Services business, we \ncontinue to gain economies of scale on the investments we have made in the infrastructure, resources, processes and software \nfeatures developed over the past number of years to support this growing side of our business. We are adding new processing \ncustomers at a faster pace than we are adding new license customers, resulting in steady growth in the processing revenue stream. \nHowever, we also receive license revenue and are experiencing growth in our professional services revenue due to the addition of \nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. as a customer in 2018, referred to as “Customer A” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nIn total, this customer represented 75 percent and 71 percent of our consolidated revenues for 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect \nfuture professional services, maintenance and license revenue from this customer in 2023 and future years; however, the amount and \ntiming will be dependent on various factors not in our control such as the number of accounts on file and the level of customization \nneeded by the customer. License revenue from this customer, similar to other license arrangements, is tiered based on the number of \nactive accounts on the system. Once the customer achieves each tier level, they receive a perpetual license up to that number of \naccounts; inactive accounts do not count toward the license tier. The customer receives an unlimited perpetual license at a maximum \ntier level that allows them to utilize the software for any number of active accounts. They previously used the software for a single \ninstitution. In the first quarter of 2022 they added an additional customer, resulting in additional one-time license fees. Support and \nmaintenance fees are charged based on the tier level achieved and increase at new tier levels. \n \nThe infrastructure of our multi customer environment is scalable for the future. A significant portion of our expense is related to \npersonnel, including more than 1,100 employees located in India, Romania, the United Arab Emirates and Colombia. In 2017, we \nopened a second office in India, located near Mumbai, to enable us to attract the level of talent required for our software development \nand testing. In October 2020, we opened an office in Dubai, United Arab Emirates to support CoreCard’s expansion of processing \nservices into new markets in the Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa and European regions. In October 2021, we opened a new location \nin Bogotá, Colombia to support existing customers and continued growth. Our ability to hire and train employees on our processes \nand software impacts our ability to onboard new customers and deliver professional services for software customizations. In addition, \nwe have certain corporate office expenses associated with being a public company that impact our operating results. \n \nOur revenue fluctuates from period to period and our results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future \nperiods. It is difficult to predict the level of consolidated revenue on a quarterly basis for various reasons, including the following: \n \nSoftware license revenue in a given period may consist of a relatively small number of contracts, and contract values \ncan vary considerably depending on the software product and scope of the license sold. Consequently, even minor \ndelays in delivery under a software contract, which may be out of our control, could have a significant and \nunpredictable impact on the consolidated revenue that we recognize in a given quarterly or annual period.  \n \nCustomers may decide to postpone or cancel a planned implementation of our software for any number of reasons, \nwhich may be unrelated to our software or contract performance, that may affect the amount, timing and \ncharacterization of our deferred and/or recognized revenue."

We intend to use cash balances to support the domestic and international \noperations associated with our CoreCard business and to expand our operations in the FinTech industry through financing the \ngrowth of CoreCard and, if appropriate opportunities become available, through acquisitions of businesses in this industry. In April \n2021, the Board authorized $10 million for our share repurchase program, all of which has been utilized. We made share \nrepurchases of $5.3 million in 2022, and $9.7 million in repurchases in 2021. In May 2022, the Board authorized an additional $20 \nmillion for our share repurchase program. We have approximately $18.3 million of authorized share repurchases remaining at \nDecember 31, 2022. \nResults of Operations \n \nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to \nConsolidated Financial Statements presented in this Annual Report.  \nRevenue – Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $69,765,000 which represents a 45 percent increase over \n2021. \n \nRevenue from services was $53,688,000 in 2022, which represents a 27 percent increase from 2021 revenue of \n$42,383,000. Revenue from transaction processing services, software maintenance and support services, and professional \nservices were greater in 2022 as compared to 2021 due to an increase in the number of customers and accounts on file and \nan increase in the number and value of professional services contracts completed in 2022. We expect that processing \nservices will continue to grow as our customer base increases; however, the time required to implement new customer \nprograms could be delayed due to third party integration and approval processes and other factors. It is difficult to predict \nwith accuracy the number and value of professional services contracts that our customers will require in a given period. \nCustomers typically request our professional services to modify or enhance their CoreCard software implementation based \non their specific business strategy and operational requirements, which vary from customer to customer and period to \nperiod. \n \nRevenue from products, which includes software license fees, was $16,077,000 in 2022, an increase of 174 percent from \n2021 revenue of $5,865,000. The increase results from our largest customer adding a new institution to our platform in the \nfirst quarter of 2022, resulting in one-time license fees, as discussed above, and multiple new tiers due to the additional \nactive accounts added from a conversion completed in the first quarter of 2022 and account growth from existing customers. \n \nCost of Revenue – Total cost of revenue was 47 percent of total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and \n2021. The increase in higher margin license revenue was offset by investments made in our processing infrastructure in recent \nyears including hardware and software purchases and increased hiring in India. Cost of revenue includes costs to provide annual \nmaintenance and support services to our installed base of licensed customers, costs to provide professional services and costs to \nprovide our financial transaction processing services. The cost and gross margins on such revenues can vary considerably from \nperiod to period depending on the customer mix, customer requirements and project complexity as well as the mix of our U.S. and \noffshore employees working on the various aspects of services provided. In addition, we continue to devote the resources \nnecessary to support our growing processing business, including direct costs for regulatory compliance, infrastructure, network \ncertifications and customer support. Investments in our infrastructure in recent years are in anticipation of adding customers in \nfuture periods. As such, we will not experience economies of scale unless we add additional customers, as anticipated. This may \nbe subject to change in the future if new regulations or processing standards are implemented causing us to incur additional costs \nto comply. \n \nOperating Expenses – For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, total operating expenses from consolidated operations \nwere higher as compared to the corresponding period in 2021 primarily due to higher development expenses and higher general \nand administrative expenses. Development expenses were higher mainly due to payroll for additional offshore technical personnel. \nAdditionally, we hired additional onshore and offshore technical personnel to work on the development of an updated platform. \nGeneral and administrative expenses increased due to higher salaries expenses due to an increase in headcount.

Our client base increased in 2022 and 2021 with minimal marketing efforts as we continue \nto have prospects contact us via online searches and industry referrals; however, we will continue to re-evaluate our marketing \nexpenditures as needed to competitively position the Processing Services business.  \n \nInvestment Income (Loss) – Investment Income (Loss) was a loss of $1,144,000 in 2022 and loss of $172,000 in 2021. The 2022 \ninvestment losses primarily relate to a fourth quarter 2022 impairment charge on an equity method investment, partially offset by \nincome on equity method investments. Investment losses in 2021 relate to losses on equity method investments, we did not record \nany impairments in 2021. \n \nOther Income, net – Other Income, net was $226,000 in 2022 and $277,000 in 2021. The decrease is primarily due to lower interest \nincome resulting from lower cash balances, partially offset by higher interest rates. \n \nIncome Taxes – We recorded income tax expense of $5,154,000 and $2,724,000 in 2022 and 2021, respectively, an effective \ntax rate of 27.1% and 23.2% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to higher \nincome in foreign locations, partially offset by a higher foreign tax credit. We expect our future effective tax rate to be within the \nrange of 25-27%. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources   \n \nOur cash balance at December 31, 2022 was $20,399,000 compared to $29,244,000 at December 31, 2021. During the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022, cash provided by operations was $9,864,000 compared to cash provided by operations of $8,915,000 for the \nyear ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to a higher net income, higher depreciation and amortization, non-cash \nimpairment charges, partially offset by higher accounts receivable balances, higher tax payments and lower deferred revenue. The \nincrease in accounts receivable relates to timing of invoices and payments primarily from our largest customer. There are no material \ndisputes related to the outstanding balances, some of which is past due at December 31, 2022, however we have concluded the entire \nbalance is collectible. \n \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we invested $1,000,000 in a privately held supply chain financing company and made an \n$800,000 investment in a privately held identity and professional services company with ties to the FinTech industry, which is described \nin more detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we invested $6,944,000 \nin publicly traded multi sector corporate and municipal debt securities, offset by related maturities of $1,975,000, which is described in \nmore detail in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we used $8,735,000 of cash to acquire computer equipment and related software primarily \nto enhance our existing processing environment in the U.S. as well for computer equipment for the technical resources added in our \nIndia office.   \n \nWe do not expect to pay any regular or special dividends in the foreseeable future. We expect to have sufficient liquidity from cash on \nhand as well as projected customer payments to support our operations and capital equipment purchases in the foreseeable future. \nCurrently we expect to use cash in excess of what is required for our current operations for opportunities we believe will expand our \nFinTech business, as exemplified in transactions described in Note 3, although there can be no assurance that appropriate \nopportunities will arise. In April 2021, the Board authorized $10 million for our share repurchase program, all of which has been utilized. \nIn May 2022, the Board authorized an additional $20 million for share repurchases. We made share repurchases of $5.3 million in \n2022, and $9.7 million in share repurchases in 2021. We have approximately $18.3 million of authorized share repurchases remaining \nat December 31, 2022. \n \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n \nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements \nwhich have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these \nfinancial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and \nexpenses. We consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and valuation of investments to be critical policies \ndue to the estimation processes involved in each. For a detailed description on the application of these and other accounting policies, \nsee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements."

      "text": "9 \n \nRevenue Recognition – Product revenue consists of fees from software licenses. Service revenue consists of fees for processing \nservices; professional services for software customization, consulting, and training; reimbursable expenses; and software \nmaintenance and customer support.  \n \nOur software license arrangements generally fall into one of the following four categories: \n \n \nan initial contract with the customer to license certain software modules, to provide services to get the customer live on the \nsoftware (such as training and customization) and to provide post contract support (“PCS”) for a specified period of time \nthereafter, \n \npurchase of additional licenses for new modules or for tier upgrades for a higher volume of licensed accounts after the initial \ncontract,  \n \nother optional standalone contracts, usually performed after the customer is live on the software, for services such as new \ninterfaces or custom features requested by the customer, additional training and problem resolution not covered in annual \nmaintenance contracts, or \n \ncontracts for certain licensed software products that involve an initial fee plus recurring monthly fees during the contract life.  \n \nAt contract inception, we assess the products and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance \nobligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a product or service (or bundle of products or services) that is distinct. A \nperformance obligation is distinct if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a \ncustomer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. To identify our \nperformance obligations, we consider all of the products or services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are \nexplicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. We recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance \nobligation by transferring control of a product or service to a customer. Our revenue recognition policies for each of the situations \ndescribed above are discussed below. \n \nOur software licenses generally have significant stand-alone functionality to the customer upon delivery and are considered to be \nfunctional intellectual property. Additionally, the purpose in granting these software licenses to a customer is typically to provide \nthe customer a right to use our intellectual property. Our software licenses are generally considered distinct performance \nobligations, and revenue allocated to the software license is typically recognized at a point in time upon delivery of the license. \nInitial implementation fees do not meet the criteria for separate accounting because the software usually requires significant \nmodification or customization that is essential to its functionality. We recognize revenue related to implementations over the life of \nthe customer once the implementation is complete.  \n \nWe account for the PCS element contained in the initial contract based on relative standalone selling price, which is annual renewal \nfees for such services, and PCS is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the period specified in the contract as we \ngenerally satisfy these performance obligations evenly using a time-elapsed output method over the contract term given there is \nno discernible pattern of performance. Upon renewal of the PCS contract by the customer, we recognize revenues ratably on a \nstraight-line basis over the period specified in the PCS contract. All of our software customers purchase software maintenance and \nsupport contracts and renew such contracts annually. \n \nCertain initial software contracts contain specified future service elements for scheduled completion following the implementation, \nand related recognition, of the initial license. In these instances, after the initial license recognition, where distinct future \nperformance obligations are identified in the contract and we could reliably measure the completion of each identified performance \nobligation, we have recognized revenue at the time the individual performance obligation was completed.  \n \nPurchases of additional licenses for tier upgrades or additional modules are generally recognized as license revenue in the period \nin which the purchase is made for perpetual licenses. \n \nServices provided under standalone contracts that are optional to the customer and are outside of the scope of the initial contract \nare single element services contracts. These standalone services contracts are not essential to the functionality of the software \ncontained in the initial contract and generally do not include acceptance clauses or refund rights as may be included in the initial \nsoftware contracts, as described above.  Revenues from these services contracts, which are generally performed within a relatively \nshort period of time, are recognized when the services are complete or in some cases as the services are provided. These revenues \ngenerally re-occur as contracts are renewed. Payment terms for professional services may be based on an upfront fixed fee with \nthe remainder due upon completion or on a time and materials basis."

      "text": "10 \n \n \nFor contracts for licensed software which include an initial fee plus recurring monthly fees for software usage, maintenance and \nsupport, we recognize the total fees ratably on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the contract as services revenue.   \n \nRevenues from processing services are typically volume- or activity-based depending on factors such as the number of accounts \nprocessed, number of accounts on the system, number of hours of services or computer resources used. For processing services \nwhich include an initial fee plus recurring monthly fees for services, we recognize the initial fees ratably on a straight-line basis \nover the estimated life of the contract as services revenue. The payment terms may include tiered pricing structures with the base \ntier representing a minimum monthly usage fee. For processing services revenues, we stand ready to provide continuous access \nto our processing platforms and perform an unspecified quantity of outsourced and transaction-processing services for a specified \nterm or terms. Accordingly, processing services are generally viewed as a stand-ready performance obligation comprised of a \nseries of distinct daily services. We typically satisfy our processing services performance obligations over time as the services are \nprovided. \n \nTechnology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our products or service \nofferings. We are often responsible for billing the client in these arrangements and transmitting the applicable fees to the third \nparty. We determine whether we are responsible for providing the actual product or service as a principal, or for arranging for the \nsolution or service to be provided by the third party as an agent. Judgment is applied to determine whether we are the principal or \nthe agent by evaluating whether we have control of the product or service prior to it being transferred to the customer. The principal \nversus agent assessment is performed at the performance obligation level. Indicators that we consider in determining if we have \ncontrol include whether we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified product or service to the \ncustomer, whether we have inventory risk and discretion in establishing the price the customer ultimately pays for the product or \nservice. Depending upon the level of our contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers, we \nhave arrangements where we are the principal and recognize the gross amount billed to the customer and other arrangements \nwhere we are the agent and recognize the net amount retained.  \n \nRevenue is recorded net of applicable sales tax. \n \nDeferred revenue consists of advance payments by software customers for annual or quarterly PCS, advance payments from \ncustomers for software licenses and professional services not yet delivered, and initial implementation payments for processing \nservices or bundled license and support services in multi-year contracts. Deferred revenue is classified as long-term until such \ntime that it becomes likely that the services or products will be provided within 12 months of the balance sheet date. \n \nValuation of Investments – We hold minority interests in non-publicly traded companies whose values are not readily determinable \nand are based on management’s estimate of realizability of the value of the investment. Future adverse changes in market conditions, \npoor operating results, lack of progress of the investee company or its inability to raise capital to support its business plan could result \nin investment losses or an inability to recover the current carrying value of the investment. Our policy with respect to minority interests \nis to record an impairment charge when we conclude an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary. \nAt least quarterly, we review our investments to determine any impairment in their carrying value and we write-down any impaired \nasset at quarter-end to our best estimate of its current realizable value.  \n \nWe have an equity investment with a privately held identity and professional services company with ties to the FinTech industry. In \n2021, the company transferred its advisory business to a new entity. We contributed our note receivable of $2,806,000 and $800,000 \nof cash for a 28% stake in the new entity. We continue to hold a 40% ownership interest in the original media and events company. In \nthe fourth quarter of 2022, based on the entity’s decision to exit the media and events business and wind down its operations, we \nrecorded an impairment charge of $1,450,000, included in investment income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, \nto reduce the carrying value of the investee company to $0.  \n \nWe evaluate on a continuing basis whether any impairment indicators are present that would require additional analysis or write-downs \nof our remaining investments. While we have not recorded an impairment related to these remaining investments as of December 31, \n2022, variations from current expectations could impact future assessments resulting in future impairment charges. \n \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n \nWe do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material adverse \neffect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations."

It is difficult to predict future quarterly and annual results with certainty.  \n \nAmong the numerous factors that may affect our consolidated results of operations or financial condition are the following: \n \n \nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., our largest customer, represented 75% of our consolidated revenues for the twelve months \nended December 31, 2022.  In the event of material failures to meet contract obligations related to the services provided, \nthere is risk of breach of contract and loss of the customer and related future revenues. Additionally, loss of the customer \nand related future revenues or a reduction in revenues could result if they or their customers choose an alternative service \nprovider, build an in-house solution, or decide to exit the business or service line that falls under the services that we \nprovide for them. \n \nWeakness or instability in the global financial markets could have a negative impact due to potential customers (most of \nwhom perform some type of financial services) delaying decisions to purchase software or initiate processing services. \n \nIncreased federal and state regulations and reluctance by financial institutions to act as sponsor banks for prospective \ncustomers could result in losses and additional cash requirements. \n \nDelays in software development projects could cause our customers to postpone implementations or delay payments, \nwhich would increase our costs and reduce our revenue and cash. \n \nWe could fail to deliver software products which meet the business and technology requirements of our target markets \nwithin a reasonable time frame and at a price point that supports a profitable, sustainable business model.  \n \nOur processing business is impacted, directly or indirectly, by more regulations than our licensed software business. If we \nfail to provide services that comply with (or allow our customers to comply with) applicable regulations or processing \nstandards, we could be subject to financial or other penalties that could negatively impact our business.  \n \nA security breach in our platform could expose confidential information of our customers’ account holders, hackers could \nseize our digital infrastructure and hold it for ransom or other cyber risk events could occur and create material losses in \nexcess of our insurance coverage. \n \nSoftware errors or poor quality control may delay product releases, increase our costs, result in non-acceptance of our \nsoftware by customers or delay revenue recognition. \n \nWe could fail to expand our base of customers as quickly as anticipated, resulting in lower revenue and profits and \nincreased cash needs.  \n \nWe could fail to retain key software developers and managers who have accumulated years of know-how in our target \nmarkets and company products or fail to attract and train a sufficient number of new software developers and testers to \nsupport our product development plans and customer requirements at projected cost levels.  \n \nIncreasing and changing government regulations in the United States and foreign countries related to such issues as data \nprivacy, financial and credit transactions could require changes to our products and services which could increase our \ncosts and could affect our existing customer relationships or prevent us from getting new customers. \n \nDelays in anticipated customer payments for any reason would increase our cash requirements and could adversely \nimpact our profits. \n \nCompetitive pressures (including pricing, changes in customer requirements and preferences, and competitor product \nofferings) may cause prospective customers to choose an alternative product solution, resulting in lower revenue and \nprofits (or losses). \n \nOur future capital needs are uncertain and depend on a number of factors; additional capital may not be available on \nacceptable terms, if at all.  \n \nVolatility in the markets, including as a result of political instability, civil unrest, war or terrorism, or pandemics or other \nnatural disasters, such as the recent outbreak of coronavirus, could adversely affect future results of operations and could \nnegatively impact the valuation of our investments. \n \nOther general economic and political conditions could cause customers to delay or cancel purchases."

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that \nany controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the \ndesired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource \nconstraints and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative \nto their costs. \n \nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. As of the end of \nthe period covered by this Annual Report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the \nCompany’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the \ndesign and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. \nBased upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls \nand procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level.   \n \n(b) \nChanges in internal control over financial reporting \nWe regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve \ncontrols and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. \n \nThere were no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors identified in connection \nwith this evaluation that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to \nmaterially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.   \n \n(c) \nManagement’s report on internal control over financial reporting \nThe management of CoreCard Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial \nreporting as defined in Rule 13a – 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company maintains accounting and \ninternal control systems which are intended to provide reasonable assurance that the assets are safeguarded against loss from \nunauthorized use or disposition, transactions are executed in accordance with management’s authorization and accounting records \nare reliable for preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of \nAmerica."

Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is \nsubject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be \ncircumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material \nmisstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these \ninherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process \nsafeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, risk.  \n \nThe Company’s management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December \n31, 2022.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of \nthe Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the \nperiod ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n \nBasis for Opinion \n \nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these \nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight \nBoard (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal \nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit \nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or \nfraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. \nAs part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of \nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such \nopinion. \n \nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to \nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence \nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used \nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe \nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n \nCritical Audit Matters \n \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were \ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material \nto the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical \naudit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating \nthe critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which \nthey relate. \n \nCritical Audit Matter – Revenue Recognition – Refer to Note 1 of the Financial Statements."

Should the evaluation indicate impairment of the investment, and the \ncircumstances indicate that the impairment is other than temporary impairment, the impairment is recognized through a reduction of \nthe carrying amount of the investment. \nConcluding on identifying events or circumstances regarding the recoverability of an investment carrying amount, measuring \nimpairment, and determining if impairment is other than temporary, involve significant and complex management judgment, specific \nto a particular investment. \n \nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit: \nOur principal audit procedures related to the Company’s process for equity method investment other than temporary impairment \nevaluation included: \n- \nWe evaluated the internal controls related to the identification of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the \ncarrying amount of an investment might not be recoverable. \n- \nWe obtained and read management’s equity method investment assessment documentation for evaluating events or \nchanges that may indicate that the carrying amount of an investment might not be recoverable. \n- \nWe reviewed management’s assessment of events or changes in circumstances for reasonableness. \n- \nWe evaluated management’s significant accounting policies related to the identification of other than temporary \nimpairment."

      "text": "F-9 \nORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n \nOrganization – In this document, terms such as the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our” and “CoreCard” refer to CoreCard Corporation, a Georgia \ncorporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. \n \nConsolidation – The financial statements include the accounts of our majority owned and controlled non-U.S. subsidiary companies after \nelimination of material inter-company accounts and transactions. \n \nNature of Operations – Our operations are conducted through our affiliate companies in Romania, India, Dubai and Colombia, as well as the \ncorporate office in Norcross, Georgia which provides significant administrative, human resources and executive management support. CoreCard \nprovides technology solutions and processing services to the financial technology and services market, commonly referred to as the FinTech \nindustry.   \n \nUse of Estimates – In preparing the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, \nmanagement makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets \nand liabilities at the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also affect amounts of revenues and expenses during \nthe reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Areas where we use estimates and make assumptions are to determine \nour allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of our investments, depreciation and amortization expense, accrued expenses and deferred \nincome taxes.   \n \nTranslation of Foreign Currencies – We consider that the respective local currencies are the functional currencies for our foreign operations. \nWe translate assets and liabilities to U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates. We translate income and expense items at average rates of \nexchange prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss as a separate \ncomponent of stockholders’ equity. Upon sale of an investment in a foreign operation, the currency translation adjustment component \nattributable to that operation is removed from accumulated other comprehensive loss and is reported as part of gain or loss on sale of \ndiscontinued operations. \n \nCash and cash equivalents – Cash and cash equivalents include cash and money market accounts with an original maturity of three months \nor less. Carrying value approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of the balances. \n \nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts – Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms. \nThey are stated at the amount management expects to collect. We sell our software products and transaction processing services to companies \ninvolved in a variety of industries that provide some form of credit or prepaid financing options or perform financial services. We perform \ncontinuing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and we do not require collateral. The amount of accounting loss for which \nwe are at risk in these unsecured receivables is limited to their carrying value.  \n \nSenior management reviews accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectible. We include \nany accounts receivable balances that are estimated to be uncollectible in our overall allowance for doubtful accounts.  After all attempts to \ncollect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Based on the information available to us, we believe our \nallowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2022 is adequate. However, actual write-offs might exceed the recorded allowance. Refer \nto Note 4 for additional information.   \n \nProperty and Equipment – Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-\nline method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related asset. Upon \nretirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting \ngain or loss is credited or charged to income. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. We continually evaluate whether \nevents and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of property and equipment may warrant revision, or \nthat the remaining balance of these assets may not be recoverable. An asset is considered to be impaired when its carrying amount exceeds \nthe sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the \nimpairment loss, if any, which is equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value, is charged to current operations.   \n \nInternal-use software and system development costs incurred to develop or obtain software, which is intended for internal use, are not \ncapitalized until the preliminary project stage is completed and management, with the relevant authority, authorizes and commits to funding a \nsoftware project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs \nincurred during a software development project’s preliminary stage and post-implementation stage are expensed as incurred. Application \ndevelopment activities that are eligible for capitalization include software design and configuration, development of interfaces, coding, testing, \nand installation. Capitalized internal-use software and systems costs are subsequently amortized on a straight-line basis over a three to seven-\nyear period after project completion and when the related software or system is ready for its intended use. There was no amortization expense \nrelated to internal-use software in the periods ended December 31, 2022 or 2021."

These expenses are included in general and \nadministrative expenses or, for assets associated with our processing data centers, are included in cost of services.   \n \nIntangible Assets – The Company has intangible assets that consist of customer relationships that are recorded in connection with acquisitions \nat their fair value based on the purchase price of the asset. Customer relationships are amortized over the life of the related contract. Intangible \nassets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment following the same approach as long-lived assets. Amortization expense related to intangible \nassets was $133,000 in 2022 and $100,000 in 2021. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the value of intangible assets net of \naccumulated amortization was $167,000 and $300,000, included in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n \nMarketable Securities – The Company's marketable securities include corporate and municipal debt securities. The Company's marketable \nsecurities are accounted for as securities available-for-sale and are classified within current assets in the consolidated balance sheets as the \nCompany may sell these securities at any time for use in its operations, even prior to maturity. The Company carries these marketable securities \nat fair value, and records any unrealized gain and loss, net of taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of \nstockholders’ equity. The Company records any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities in investment income (loss) on \nits Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n \nManagement regularly reviews whether marketable securities are other-than-temporarily impaired. If any impairment is considered other-than-\ntemporary, the Company writes down the investment to its then fair value and records the corresponding charge through investment income \n(loss) on its Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n \nInvestments – For entities in which we have a 20 to 50 percent ownership interest and over which we exercise significant influence, but do not \nhave control, we account for investments in privately-held companies under the equity method, whereby we record our proportional share of \nthe investee’s net income or net loss as an adjustment to the carrying value of the investment. We account for investments of less than 20 \npercent in non-marketable equity securities of corporations at the lower of cost or market. Our policy with respect to investments is to record \nan impairment charge when we conclude that an investment has experienced a decline in value. We have elected to use the measurement \nalternative for our non-marketable equity securities, defined as cost adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar \ninvestments of the same issuer, less impairment. At least quarterly, we review our investments to determine any impairment in their carrying \nvalue and we write-down any impaired asset at quarter-end to our best estimate of its current realizable value. Any such charges could have \na material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations and are generally not predictable in advance.  \n \nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the aggregate value of investments was $5,180,000 and $6,355,000, respectively.  \n \nFair Value of Financial Instruments – The carrying value of cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts \npayable and certain other financial instruments (such as accrued expenses and other current assets and liabilities) included in the \naccompanying consolidated balance sheets approximates their fair value principally due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.    \n \nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, trade accounts and notes receivable. \nOur available cash is held in accounts managed by third-party financial institutions.  Cash may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, or FDIC, insurance limits. While we monitor cash balances on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate, these \nbalances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash; \nhowever, we can provide no assurances that access to our cash will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. \n \nA concentration of credit risk may exist with respect to trade receivables, as a substantial portion of our customers are concentrated in the financial \nservices industry."

Historically, we have not \nexperienced significant losses related to receivables from individual customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic \narea. \n \nFair Value Measurements – In determining fair value, we use quoted market prices in active markets. Generally accepted accounting principles \n(“GAAP”) establishes a fair value measurement framework, provides a single definition of fair value, and requires expanded disclosure \nsummarizing fair value measurements. GAAP emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity specific \nmeasurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in \npricing an asset or liability. \n \nGAAP establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of \nunobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable input be used when available. Observable inputs are based on data obtained from \nsources independent of the Company that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect \nthe Company’s assumptions about the estimates market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best \ninformation available in the circumstances.   \n \nThe hierarchy is measured in three levels based on the reliability of inputs: \n \n• Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Valuation \nadjustments and block discounts are not applied to Level 1 instruments. \n \n• Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in less active, dealer or broker markets. Fair values are primarily obtained from third party pricing \nservices for identical or comparable assets or liabilities. \n \n• Level 3 - Valuations derived from other valuation methodologies, including pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, \nand not based on market, exchange, dealer, or broker-traded transactions. Level 3 valuations incorporate certain assumptions and projections \nthat are not observable in the market and significant professional judgment is needed in determining the fair value assigned to such assets or \nliabilities. \n \nIn instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in \nthe fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value \nmeasurement in its entirety. \n \nThe fair value of equity method investments has not been determined as it is impracticable to do so due to the fact that the investee companies \nare relatively small, early stage private companies for which there is no comparable valuation data available without unreasonable time and \nexpense.  \n \nThe following tables present the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value: \n \nDecember 31 2022\n(in thousands)\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal Fair Value\nCash equivalents\n  Money market accounts\n$  17,496\n$        −\n$       −\n$  17,496\nMarketable securities\n   Corporate and municipal \ndebt securities\n4,973 \n− \n− \n4,973 \nTotal assets\n$  22,469\n$        −\n$       −\n$  22,469\n \nDecember 31, 2021\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal Fair Value\nCash equivalents\n  Money market accounts\n$  26,866\n$        −\n$       −\n$  26,866\nMarketable securities\n   Corporate and municipal \ndebt securities\n− \n− \n− \n− \nTotal assets\n$  26,866\n$        −\n$       −\n$  26,866"

      "text": "F-12 \nRevenue Recognition – Product revenue consists of fees from software licenses. Service revenue consists of fees for processing services; \nprofessional services for software customization, consulting, training; reimbursable expenses; and software maintenance and customer \nsupport.  \n \n \nOur software license arrangements generally fall into one of the following four categories: \n \n \nan initial contract with the customer to license certain software modules, to provide services to get the customer live on the software \n(such as training and customization) and to provide post contract support (“PCS”) for a specified period of time thereafter, \n \npurchase of additional licenses for new modules or for tier upgrades for a higher volume of licensed accounts,  \n \nother optional standalone contracts, usually performed after the customer is live on the software, for services such as new interfaces or \ncustom features requested by the customer, additional training and problem resolution not covered in annual maintenance contracts, or \n \ncontracts for certain licensed software products that involve an initial fee plus recurring monthly fees during the contract life.  \n \nAt contract inception, we assess the products and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for \neach promise to transfer to the customer a product or service (or bundle of products or services) that is distinct. A performance obligation is \ndistinct if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own \nor with other resources that are readily available to the customer. To identify our performance obligations, we consider all of the products or \nservices promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. We recognize \nrevenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a customer. Our revenue recognition \npolicies for each of the situations described above are discussed below. \n \nOur software licenses generally have significant stand-alone functionality to the customer upon delivery and are considered to be functional \nintellectual property. Additionally, the purpose in granting these software licenses to a customer is typically to provide the customer a right to \nuse our intellectual property. Our software licenses are generally considered distinct performance obligations, and revenue allocated to the \nsoftware license is typically recognized at a point in time upon delivery of the license. Initial implementation fees do not meet the criteria for \nseparate accounting because the software usually requires significant modification or customization that is essential to its functionality. We \nrecognize revenue related to implementations over the life of the customer once the implementation is complete.  \n \nWe account for the PCS element contained in the initial contract based on relative standalone selling price, which is annual renewal fees for \nsuch services, and PCS is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the period specified in the contract as we generally satisfy these \nperformance obligations evenly using a time-elapsed output method over the contract term given there is no discernible pattern of performance. \nUpon renewal of the PCS contract by the customer, we recognize revenues ratably on a straight-line basis over the period specified in the \nPCS contract. All of our software customers purchase software maintenance and support contracts and renew such contracts annually. \n \nCertain initial software contracts contain specified future service elements for scheduled completion following the implementation, and related \nrecognition, of the initial license. In these instances, after the initial license recognition, where distinct future performance obligations are \nidentified in the contract and we could reliably measure the completion of each identified performance obligation, we have recognized revenue \nat the time the individual performance obligation was completed.  \n \nPurchases of additional licenses for tier upgrades or additional modules are generally recognized as license revenue in the period in which the \npurchase is made for perpetual licenses. \n \nServices provided under standalone contracts that are optional to the customer and are outside of the scope of the initial contract are single \nelement services contracts. These standalone services contracts are not essential to the functionality of the software contained in the initial \ncontract and generally do not include acceptance clauses or refund rights as may be included in the initial software contracts, as described \nabove.  Revenues from these services contracts, which are generally performed within a relatively short period of time, are recognized when \nthe services are complete or in some cases as the services are provided. These revenues generally re-occur as contracts are renewed. \nPayment terms for professional services may be based on an upfront fixed fee with the remainder due upon completion or on a time and \nmaterials basis. \n \nFor contracts for licensed software which include an initial fee plus recurring monthly fees for software usage, maintenance and support, we \nrecognize the total fees ratably on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the contract as services revenue.   \n \nRevenues from processing services are typically volume- or activity-based depending on factors such as the number of accounts processed, \nnumber of accounts on the system, number of hours of services or computer resources used. For processing services which include an initial \nfee plus recurring monthly fees for services, we recognize the initial fees ratably on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the contract \nas services revenue. The payment terms may include tiered pricing structures with the base tier representing a minimum monthly usage fee."

      "text": "F-13 \nFor processing services revenues, we stand ready to provide continuous access to our processing platforms and perform an unspecified \nquantity of outsourced and transaction-processing services for a specified term or terms. Accordingly, processing services are generally viewed \nas a stand-ready performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct daily services. We typically satisfy our processing services \nperformance obligations over time as the services are provided. \n \nTechnology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our products or service offerings. We are \noften responsible for billing the client in these arrangements and transmitting the applicable fees to the third party. We determine whether we \nare responsible for providing the actual product or service as a principal, or for arranging for the solution or service to be provided by the third \nparty as an agent. Judgment is applied to determine whether we are the principal or the agent by evaluating whether we have control of the \nproduct or service prior to it being transferred to the customer. The principal versus agent assessment is performed at the performance \nobligation level. Indicators that we consider in determining if we have control include whether we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the \npromise to provide the specified product or service to the customer, whether we have inventory risk and discretion in establishing the price the \ncustomer ultimately pays for the product or service. Depending upon the level of our contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering \nsolutions to end customers, we have arrangements where we are the principal and recognize the gross amount billed to the customer and \nother arrangements where we are the agent and recognize the net amount retained. \n \nRevenue is recorded net of applicable sales tax. \n \nDeferred Revenue – Deferred revenue consists of advance payments by software customers for annual or quarterly PCS, advance payments \nfrom customers for software licenses and professional services not yet delivered, and initial implementation payments for processing services \nor bundled license and support services in multi-year contracts.  We do not anticipate any loss under these arrangements. Deferred revenue \nis classified as long-term until such time that it becomes likely that the services or products will be provided within 12 months of the balance \nsheet date. \n \nCost of Revenue – For cost of revenue for software contracts, we capitalize the contract specific direct costs, which are included in other \ncurrent assets and other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize the costs when the associated revenue is \nrecognized. Cost of revenue for services includes direct cost of services rendered, including reimbursed expenses, pass-through third party \ncosts, and data center, network association and compliance costs for processing services. We also capitalize the initial implementation fees \nfor processing services contracts and recognize the costs over the life of the contract when the corresponding revenue is recognized. \n \nSoftware Development Expense – Development costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.  Contract specific software \ndevelopment costs are capitalized and recognized when the related contract revenue is recognized. \n \nWarranty Costs –The warranty related to software license contracts consists of a defined number of months (usually three) of PCS after the \ngo-live date, which is accrued as of the go-live date and recognized over the warranty period.  \n \nLegal Expense – Legal expenses for continuing operations are recorded as a component of general and administrative expense in the period \nin which such expenses are incurred.    \n \nStock Based Compensation – We record compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards by recognizing the unamortized grant \ndate fair value on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of each award. We have estimated forfeiture rates based on our historical \nexperience. Stock option compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, has been recognized as a component of \ngeneral and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. We recorded $210,000 and $319,000 of stock-\nbased compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.   \n \nPursuant to the 2020 Non-employee Directors’ Stock Incentive Plan, there were 8,808 shares granted in the year ended December 31, 2022, \nand a total of 4,443 shares were granted in the year ended December 31, 2021. No options were granted in 2022 or 2021.  \n \nThe fair value of the grants are being amortized over the vesting period for the options. All of the Company’s stock-based compensation \nexpense relates to stock options and stock grants. All stock options were vested and compensation cost recognized as of December 31, 2022. \n \nIncome Taxes – We account for income taxes under the liability method. We record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates \nfor the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences \nbetween the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities. We assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate \nsufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets. We record a valuation allowance, as necessary, to reduce our deferred tax assets \nto the amount of future tax benefit that we estimate is more likely than not to be realized. \n \nWe record tax benefits for positions that we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under audit examinations. We assess the \npotential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals. We recognize interest and penalties accrued \nrelated to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We adjust our income"

Further, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04, ASU No. 2019-05, ASU 2019-10 and \nASU 2019-11 to provide additional guidance on the credit losses standard. The ASUs are effective for interim and annual periods beginning \nafter December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASUs is on a modified retrospective basis. We plan to adopt the ASUs \non January 1, 2023. The ASUs are currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n \nIn March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-02 \"Financial Instruments - Credit \nLosses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures\" (ASU 2022-02), which eliminates the accounting guidance for \ntroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) by creditors that have adopted ASU 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): \nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\" and enhances certain disclosure requirements. The ASU is effective for interim and \nannual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASUs is on a modified retrospective basis. \nWe plan to adopt the ASUs on January 1, 2023.

This standard \nsimplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions to the guidance in Topic 740 related to the approach for intra-\nperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside \nbasis differences. The new guidance also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates \nand clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill and allocating consolidated income taxes to \nseparate financial statements of entities not subject to income tax. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, \n2020, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2021 and the adoption did not have a material impact on \nthe Consolidated Financial Statements. \n \nIn January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, Investments-Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures \n(Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815 (“ASU 2020-\n01”), which clarifies certain interactions between the guidance to account for certain equity securities, investments under the equity method of \naccounting and forward contracts or purchased options to purchase securities under Topic 321, Topic 323 and Topic 815. For public entities, \nASU 2020-01 is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020.

In June 2019, we converted the Loan Agreement and all Promissory \nNotes into equity resulting in ownership of 40 percent of the company. In the fourth quarter of 2022, based on the entity’s decision to exit the \nmedia and events business and wind down its operations, we recorded an impairment charge of $1,450,000, included in investment income \n(loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, to reduce the carrying value of the investee company to $0 as of December 31, 2022. \nThe carrying value of our investment was $1,822,000 at December 31, 2021, included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In \n2021, the company transferred its advisory business to a new entity. We contributed our note receivable of $2,806,000 and $800,000 of cash \nfor a 28% ownership interest in the new entity. The carrying value of our investment in the new entity was $4,180,000 and $3,615,000 at \nDecember 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We account for these \ninvestments using the equity method of accounting which resulted in income of $275,000 and losses of $172,000 for the twelve months ended \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, included in investment income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  \n \nOn December 30, 2016 we signed an agreement to invest $1,000,000 in a privately held technology company and program manager in the \nFinTech industry. The investment was funded on January 4, 2017. In the quarter ended June 30, 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of \n$250,000 to reduce the carrying value due to the investee’s limited funding to support its operation and sales and marketing efforts. In the \nquarter ended March 31, 2020, due to the uncertainty from the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we determined \nthat the fair value of our investment was $0 and therefore we recorded an impairment charge of $750,000, included in investment loss on the \nConsolidated Statement of Operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. CoreCard remains in an ongoing business relationship with the \ncompany pursuant to a Processing Agreement and a Program Management Services Agreement. CoreCard is positioned to assume the \nprogram management aspects of the investee company if the need should arise to ensure their program(s) ongoing viability and the completion \nof the Processing Agreement with CoreCard. As program manager for this company, we receive cash periodically to fund the customer’s \nvarious programs. We held $651,000 and $706,000 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in cash on behalf of this customer which is \nincluded in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

We have maintained a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets resulting from \nunrealized capital losses as we are not able to conclude that is it more likely than not that these will be realized due to the unpredictability of \nfuture capital gains.

Our policy is to \nrecognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. There were no accrued \ninterest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits, nor was any interest expense recognized during the periods presented. \nWe have determined we have no uncertain tax positions. \nWe file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return for all subsidiaries in which our ownership equals or exceeds 80%, as well as individual \nsubsidiary returns in various states and foreign jurisdictions.

The 2003 Plan authorized the issuance of up to 450,000 \noptions to purchase shares of common stock to officers and key employees, with vesting of such options occurring equally over a 3-year time \nperiod.  In 2013, the 2003 Plan expired with 197,500 options ungranted. \n3 The 2015 Incentive Stock Plan (the “2015 Plan”) was approved by shareholders in June 2015, which authorizes the issuance of up to 750,000 \noptions to purchase shares of common stock to employees and key consultants and advisors. \n4 The Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan (the “Directors Plan”) was instituted in August 2000 that authorized the issuance of up to \n200,000 options to purchase shares of common stock to non-employee directors. Upon adoption of the Directors Plan, each non-employee \ndirector was granted an option to acquire 5,000 shares.

The Directors Plan expired in 2011, with 60,000 options ungranted. \n5 The 2011 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan (the “2011 Directors Plan”) was approved by shareholders in May 2011 with essentially the \nsame terms and conditions as the Directors Plan. \n6 The 2020 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”) was approved by shareholders in August 2020, which replaces \nthe 2011 Director Plan and authorizes the issuance of 200,000 shares of common stock to non-employee directors. We expect to grant each \nindependent director $50,000 of stock on the date of each subsequent Annual Meeting. \n7  In May 2022, shareholders approved the 2022 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2022 Plan”), which replaces the 2015 Plan and \nauthorizes the issuance of 750,000 shares of common stock to employees.
