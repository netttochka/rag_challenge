Those \nresources contribute to new technologies, such as electric vehicles \nand wind turbines, and critical infrastructure. Our fertiliser products \nplay an important role in enabling sustainable food production to \nmeet the rapidly rising demand for food around the world.\nWith a rich technology heritage, IPL’s key technology drivers  \nare to improve safety, productivity & efficiency, and sustainability. \nAnd we continue to invest in the development of new technologies  \nand our service offering.\nWe have an ambition to reach Net Zero operational emissions by \n2050, or sooner if practicable. Our climate change management \nstrategy is focused on four key pillars: \n1.\t Ensuring strong governance;\n2.\t Reducing operational emissions; \n3.\t Delivering products and strategies that reduce  \nScope 3 emissions; and \n4.\t Managing strategic business risks and opportunities. \nOur Net Zero Pathway shows the key enablers and technologies \nrequired to reduce our emissions, along with the expected \ntimeframe for each. \n(1)\t\n®DigiShot and CyberDet are registered trademarks of DetNet South Africa (Pty) Limited.\nGlobal footprint\nServing high quality customers with technological solutions across \nsix continents, including Australia, North America, Europe, Asia, \nSouth America and Africa, we manufacture ammonium nitrate-\nbased explosives and initiating systems, nitrogen and phosphorus \nfertilisers, and nitrogen related industrial and specialty chemicals. \nWe have major manufacturing sites across Australia and the US, with \nkey sites in Cheyenne (Wyoming, USA), Louisiana (Missouri, USA), \nWaggaman (Louisiana, USA), Moranbah (QLD, Australia), Geelong \n(VIC, Australia) and Phosphate Hill (QLD, Australia).\nFurther strengthening each business are a number of key \ninvestments. The acquisition of Titanobel – a leading French \nindustrial explosives manufacturer – allows the Dyno Nobel  \nbusiness to leverage its technology into new and profitable  \nmarkets in Europe, Middle East and Africa. The Incitec Pivot  \nFertilisers business has acquired a majority stake in Australian Bio \nFert Pty Ltd (ABF), with plans to develop and deliver a new category \nof sustainable fertilisers. And finally, our Easy Liquids (formerly Yara \nNipro) acquisition will enable IPF to better serve customers through \na strengthened storage and distribution network and improve  \nsecurity of supply of a diverse range of liquid products for dealers, \nagents, and agronomists.\nDyno Nobel\nDelivering advanced technology through  \npractical innovation\nDyno Nobel is IPL’s international explosives and technical blasting \nservices business and one of the largest industrial explosives \ndistributors in North America and Australia. Blasting is an essential \nstep in extracting the minerals required to meet the world’s demand \nfor power, infrastructure and consumer goods.

      "text": "15\nIncitec Pivot Limited Annual Report 2022\nKey business announcements & highlights\nFuture looks \ndifferent\nIPL’s demerger proposal, with the intention to create two market leading companies in Dyno Nobel and \nIncitec Pivot Fertilisers, was announced. The demerger is subject to final Board approval, shareholder and \nother third-party approvals. Strategic review of Waggaman plant to be undertaken in light of positive \noutlook for global ammonia market and external interest in the plant.\nTitanobel acquisition\nAcquired 100% of the shares in Explinvest, the holding company of the Titanobel Group – a leading \nFrench industrial explosives manufacturer and drilling, blasting and technical services provider.\nWaggaman CO2 \nSequestration Plans\nA Front End Engineering Design (FEED) study is underway for a Carbon Capture Facility at Waggaman \ncapable of processing up to 950,000 metric tonnes of CO2 to transport via a pipeline to a permanent \ngeological sequestration site. Emissions from the plant represent 45 per cent of Dyno Nobel’s \ntotal greenhouse gas emissions. If it proceeds, this project alone could reduce these emissions by \napproximately 30% against the 2020 baseline, or about 800,000 tonnes of CO2e per year.\nEasy Liquids  \nacquisition\nAcquired the Easy Liquids (formerly Yara Nipro) business to provide increased liquid fertiliser options  \nand enhanced security of supply for farmers across the east coast of Australia. \nGreen ammonia \nproduction a  \nstep closer\nPartnering with Fortescue Future Industries, IPL commenced a FEED study into the industrial-scale \nproduction of green ammonia at our Gibson Island fertiliser manufacturing facility. The proposal under \ninvestigation involves the construction of a new ~500MW hydrogen electrolysis facility at the site to \nproduce green hydrogen as well as the retrofitting of IPL’s existing ammonia manufacturing facility to  \nrun on the green hydrogen produced onsite. Should the project proceed to a final investment decision,  \nit would be Australia’s first industrial scale green ammonia production facility.\nNational AdBlue \ncritical shortage \nresponse \nWorking closely with the Federal Government, IPL mobilised expert teams to work on expanding \nmanufacturing capability and increase Australia’s supply of AdBlue – an essential product to keep  \ndiesel vehicles moving.\nMajority stake  \nin Australian  \nBio Fertilisers \nAcquired a majority stake in Australian Bio Ferts (ABF) which is seeking to develop a new category  \nof sustainable fertilisers for Australian farmers.\nGibson Island  \ntransition\nMade the difficult decision to cease traditional fertiliser manufacturing at IPL’s Brisbane-based Gibson \nIsland plant after exhaustive efforts were unable to secure an affordable long-term gas supply.  \nThe potential conversion of Gibson Island manufacturing assets shows our commitment to pursuing \nopportunities to help create a more sustainable world in the new and emerging opportunities stemming \nfrom green ammonia.\nRecognised  \nWorld Safety Day  \nand International  \nWomen’s Day\nHeld World Safety Day events globally throughout IPL as a well-timed opportunity to affirm on our \ncommitment to Zero Harm and our safety fundamentals. Also celebrated the women in our lives and  \ntheir achievements as part of International Women’s Day 2022, with a focus on “break the bias”. \nEncouraging a gender equal world free of bias, stereotypes, and discrimination, where difference  \nis not only valued but celebrated were some of the ideas explored."

      "text": "CHAIRMAN’S REPORT\n16\nIncitec Pivot Limited Annual Report 2022\nThe strategic progress of both our explosives and fertilisers \nbusinesses during the year led to our announcement in May  \nof our intention to demerge these two different businesses during \n2023.  With two separate dedicated boards, leadership teams, \nand appropriate capital structures, these two iconic businesses \nwill be positioned to thrive and pursue their respective strategies \nunencumbered. \nAlso, in November 2022 and consistent with our long-term strategy,  \nwe announced a strategic review of our ownership in our ammonia \nproduction plant in Waggaman, Louisiana, with the timing driven \nby interest from a number of credible counterparties. The strategic \nreview of  Waggaman means that the timeline for the demerger will \nbe delayed by approximately 6-12 months.\nWe continue to invest significantly in a number of projects to \naddress climate change on our journey to Net Zero by 2050.  \nThese projects are positioned to deliver our medium term absolute \nGHG reduction target and, have the potential to deliver a more than \n42% emission reduction for IPL’s current portfolio by 2030. \nI am pleased to announce that we were once again included in the \nS&P Global Dow Jones Sustainability Index due to our Company \nBenchmarking Score for 2022. We improved our 2021 score, \npositioning ourselves well against our industry peers and improving \nour own score by 15 points over the past decade. These results \nvalidate the work we are doing to improve the sustainability of  \nyour company. \nFinancial performance \nWe reported a 162% increase in Earnings Before Interest and Tax \n(EBIT) excluding individually material items (IMIs) to $1,485m. \nOur Net Profit after Tax (excluding IMIs) of $1,027m, is up 186% \ncompared to the prior year. \nDyno Nobel Americas reported EBIT of US$532.8m, up from \nUS$141.2m, with strong second half manufacturing performance \ncapturing favourable commodity markets. However, a lag in \npassing through price increases to address inflation impacted \nexplosives margins in the second half.\nDyno Nobel Asia Pacific delivered EBIT of $162m, up 16%, \nreflecting strong volumes and growth from technology sales.\nFertilisers EBIT increased to $614m, up from $268.4m, with \nmanufacturing more than doubling earnings during the year.\nWe retained a strong balance sheet with net debt of $1bn \nand Net Debt/ EBITDA ratio ex IMIs of 0.5x, down from 1.1x.\nWith the improved earnings performance, strong cash \ngeneration and balance sheet strength, the Board was \npleased to announce a record final dividend of 17 cents  \nper share, taking our total dividend to 27 cents per share. \nIn addition, the Board has announced an on-market share  \nbuyback of up to $400m over the next 12 months. \nWe also continue to focus on improving our return on invested \ncapital (ROIC) and in 2022 we achieved a 13.8% ROIC, up from 5.8% \nin the prior year.\nThe Board will continue to focus on ensuring we have an appropriate \ncapital structure to support the opportunities ahead for the \nbusiness, as well as delivering strong returns for shareholders. \n2022 has been a stand-out year for the IPL Group, marked by a record result against a backdrop  \nof geo-political and economic challenges in the aftermath of the pandemic. \nAs we look towards 2023, our improved performance and strategic progress has positioned the \nbusiness well to capitalise on the favourable market conditions. We have very good momentum  \nand we remain absolutely focused on our corporate strategy."

      "text": "17\nIncitec Pivot Limited Annual Report 2022\nTowards the demerger \nThe Board believes that significant value can be unlocked by the \nseparation of the explosives and fertilisers businesses, with both \noperating in large and attractive markets that value their industry \nleading technology and products. \nWith increased focus and appropriate capital structures, processes \nand policies for each business, these two iconic, but different \nbusinesses will be unencumbered to pursue their respective and \nunique destinies.\nNow, more than ever, we are seeing the increasing importance of \nfood security and mining extraction to the world, as well as the rapid \nacceleration towards decarbonisation and electrification.\nThere is unprecedented opportunity for us to accelerate our growth \nthrough the development of technology and customer solutions and \nto capture the significant potential in the resources and agricultural \nsectors.\nAnd given how quickly the world is changing and the opportunity \nset in front of both businesses – it is clear that separating the two \ncompanies will further empower them to more successfully capture \nthese markets. \nThe progress that Jeanne and the team have made to improve the \nreliability of our assets and develop and grow technology, coupled \nwith our overall balance sheet capability, mean that we will pursue  \na separation from a position of strength.\nThis allows us to ensure both businesses will have capital structures \nthat reflect their different earnings profiles and have the capacity  \nto invest in the compelling growth opportunities they have in front \nof them.\nAlso, we know there is a high level of interest for an opportunity \nfor separate exposures to either a premium explosives business, \nor a focused Australian fertilisers business from both existing \nshareholders and prospective shareholders.  This reinforces our  \nview that increased choice for investors will be an important \ncontributor in unlocking value from the separation.\nWe look forward to presenting the demerger proposal in further \ndetail over coming months and to the shareholder vote expected \nwithin the next 12 months.\nWaggaman strategic review \nOur corporate strategy is focused on adding value through \ntechnology solutions for our customers in both of our businesses  \nto grow recurring earnings.  \nThe review of Waggaman is in direct alignment with our long term \ncorporate strategy and addresses the excess commodity exposure  \nto ammonia in our current portfolio.\nGiven the current performance of Waggaman, the outlook for  \nthe global ammonia market and the external interest in this  \nasset, we believe that now is the optimum time for the review  \nand so completing the review will result in a short delay in the  \ndemerger process. \nWe will, of course, look to minimise the delay so as to retain the \nmomentum we have established with the demerger process.  \nOur people\nDuring the year, as travel once again became possible,  the Board \nwas able to visit our people on the ground with Board visits to \nTownsville, Gibson Island, Geelong and Werribee in Australia and  \nSalt Lake City, Waggaman and Carthage in the USA. These visits \nprovide us with important opportunities to gain more insights  \ninto the business, our people and our customers.  \nIn the lead up to the demerger, we have made some exciting \nappointments for a future, stand-alone fertilisers business. \nIn June, we were delighted to announce Michael Carroll as Chairman-\ndesignate of the fertilisers business. Mike is a highly experienced \ndirector and has a long history working in the agricultural sector \nacross finance, fertilisers and agricultural services.\nIn addition, current IPL Board member, Greg Robinson, will join  \nMike on the future board as a non-executive director. Greg will  \nbe a valuable addition, bringing knowledge of the fertilisers \nbusiness, along with extensive experience across the resources, \nenergy and finance sectors.\nWe have also appointed the CEO-designate and CFO-designate for \nthe fertilisers business with Christine Corbett and Chris Opperman \ntaking on these roles and establishing what is a very capable senior \nmanagement team to lead the business both in the lead up to, and \nfollowing, the demerger. \nI would like to sincerely thank our Managing Director & CEO Jeanne \nJohns and the Executive Team for their impressive leadership, and \nall our people for their incredible hard work and dedication to IPL \nthroughout the year. \nI would also like to thank my fellow Board members for their \ncontribution throughout the year.\nLooking ahead, your company is in a strong position as we enter \nFY23 with both of our businesses performing well in very attractive \nmarkets and with great opportunities to be able to continue creating \nvalue for our shareholders and all other stakeholders. We have clear \nstrategic directions established for both businesses and will be \nworking diligently to deliver on those strategies over the coming \nyear. \nBrian Kruger \nChairman"

While our personal  \nsafety recordable rate stayed flat, I was pleased that injuries  \nthat resulted in serious harm continued to decrease for the  \nthird year running.\nWe continue on our journey to Net Zero by 2050, or earlier if \npracticable. In 2022, we progressed four significant projects to \nachieve this – Moranbah tertiary nitrous oxide abatement, \nWaggaman geological sequestration, the conversion of our \nGibson Island manufacturing facility to green ammonia, and \nnitrous oxide abatement for our Louisiana, Missouri, facility.   \nI am pleased that these four projects aim to deliver in excess  \nof 42% GHG emission reductions against our 2020 baseline,  \nfor our current portfolio. We will be re-visiting our medium-term \ntarget next year as these projects progress and following the \nrelease of the Science Based Targets Initiative target setting \nmethodology for the chemicals sector.\n(1)\t Results from a field trial conducted in a ryegrass pasture system in south–western \nVictoria show the application of EEF with the inhibitor DMPP reduced N2O \nemissions by 73% when compared to urea application alone. See the Australian \nGovernment Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment Climate \nResearch Program: Reducing Nitrous Oxide Emissions, p.5\nWe also made significant progress in identifying and measuring the \nScope 3 GHG emissions in our supply chains. In collaboration with a \ncustomer, we measured GHG emission reductions of 25% with the \nuse of our premium technology DeltaE, which is currently being \nverified by an independent third party. Our enhanced efficiency \nfertilisers have also demonstrated an ability to reduce emissions \nfrom their use by up to 70% (1) dependent upon the application,  \nfor our farming customers.  \nIt is my pleasure to report a company record performance for the 2022 financial year along with the \nsignificant strategic progress made during the year.  \nThis performance is the result of a resilient and adaptive team working to offset the impacts of the \npandemic, supply chain disruptions, shortages of key materials and skilled people, and inflationary \npressure. I thank our people across the business for both their extraordinary efforts and the terrific \noutcome under these challenging circumstances."

      "text": "19\nIncitec Pivot Limited Annual Report 2022\nBusiness performance \n2022 represents the best financial performance in IPL corporate \nhistory with $1,027m NPAT excluding IMIs.  \nOur Waggaman plant delivered US$344m in FY22 after US$70m in \ninsurance recovery related to the February outage caused by a third- \nparty original construction issue. I am very pleased to report that \nthe plant continues to run reliably above the 95% manufacturing \nexcellence target since its restart in April.  \nOur explosive businesses operate in two of the best mining regions \nin the world, Australia and North America.\nIn North America, our explosives EBIT of US$110m was down 13% \ndue to the lag in recovering energy, inflation, and supply chain cost \nincreases.  Overall volumes grew with good sales growth of our \npremium technology of electronic detonators and further Delta E \nuptake. The volume growth was driven by strong performance in \nQuarry and Construction and an increase in coal demand. Metals \nwere slightly down due to temporary customer mine outages, \npartially offset by growth in the Western US and Eastern Canada.  \nOur manufacturing Agriculture and Industrial Chemicals segment \ndelivered a record US$79m due to strong operations at St. Helens \nfacility post the 2021 turnaround, capturing the available margin.\nIn our Asia Pacific region, EBIT increased 16% to $162m reflecting \nstrong customer and technology growth with a 14% increase in \npremium emulsions and an 18% increase in electronic detonators.  \nAmmonium nitrate supply continues to be tight in both of our \nexplosives markets and our businesses are well situated to capture \nprojected positive pricing upon contract renewals over the next  \nfew years.\nOur fertilisers business delivered an EBIT of $614m, up 129%, as \nthe business captured the upswing in commodity pricing while \ndelivering a major planned turnaround at Phosphate Hill. The \ndisruption in contracted natural gas supply from the Northern \nTerritory to Phosphate Hill was managed to ensure the plant \ncontinued throughout the period at full rates. Natural gas will be \nsecured for the coming year until full contracted supply is expected \nto resume in February. Distribution earnings remained resilient \nin a volatile supply and pricing environment, supported by good \ndemand and agricultural conditions. \nProgressing our strategic agenda\nWe made excellent progress across our strategic agenda for both \nbusinesses during the year.\nWe completed our purchase of Titanobel, entering the French \nquarry and construction market and providing access to Western \nAfrican markets, with future facing mineral opportunities. The low \npenetration of technology in key European and African markets, \nespecially electronic detonators, is a large opportunity for this \nbusiness. When combined with our existing Nitromak business in \nTurkey, we have a compelling foundation to grow our explosives \nbusiness across the EMEA region.\nOur soil health strategy was furthered with the purchase of Yara \nNipro (now renamed Easy Liquids) and the increased ownership in \nAustralian BioFerts. With these purchases, we will extend our fertiliser \noffering to more organic bio fertilisers and expand our offer in \nliquid specialty products, which are both growing segments of the \nfertilisers market.  \nAlong with our pathway to Net Zero for each of our businesses, \nthese purchases set the foundation for our intention to demerge \nand create two sector leading companies to pursue their different \ndestinies.\nLeadership \nWe are pleased to have CEO-designate of our fertiliser business, \nChristine Corbett, join the business. Christine joins the company \nwith a wealth of executive experience in energy, e-commerce, retail \nand logistics, and will join the Executive Team running the fertilisers \nbusiness until the demerger takes place. \nFurther strengthening our Executive Team, I am very pleased to \nwelcome Paul Victor as our CFO. Paul brings strong financial and \nbusiness experience from his previous CFO role with the publicly \nlisted entity Sasol of South Africa.  \nWe are proud of our culture of valuing people and their development \nwhich has led to the opportunity to promote some of our key talent.  \nUpon embedding the manufacturing facilities inside our business \nunits, I was pleased to appoint Stephenie DeNichilio as our Chief HSE \nand Operations Excellence Officer during the year. Rob Mill likewise \njoined the Executive Team as Chief People Officer.  \nI want to offer my thanks to the dedicated teams across our \nbusinesses for their contributions to the company’s success.  \nI would also like to extend my thanks to the Board for their \ninvaluable support during the year.\nLooking forward\nThe supply/demand fundamentals for our products continue to look \nvery favourable as we enter the new year. Our priority is to capture \nthese tailwinds while managing supply disruptions and inflationary \npressure. We remain focused on safe, reliable operations, serving our \ncustomers with leading technology solutions, and enhancing our \nsupply chain resilience.\nWe continue to invest in both our businesses in line with the macro \ntrends of decarbonising the world’s energy while meeting growing \ndemand for food and materials. With investment in our strategy, we \nare targeting in the medium term for mid-to-high single digit growth \nin our explosives business and doubling our fertiliser distribution \nearnings through soil health offerings and improved supply \npositions.\nOur focus entering the new year is to maintain our momentum in \nearnings while we pursue the strategic option review for Waggaman. \nDemerger preparations will continue as we look to unlock additional \nvalue from these two iconic companies so they can pursue their \nrespective destinies. \nJeanne Johns \nManaging Director & CEO"

      "text": "OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW\n22\nIncitec Pivot Limited Annual Report 2022\nFY22 Business Review\nThe Group reported FY22 Earnings Before Interest and Tax excluding \nIMI’s (EBIT) of $1,485m, an increase of $919m compared to pcp. Major \nmovements for the year were as follows:\nManufacturing Performance: Aside from the one-off incident at \nWALA, the plant operated at nameplate capacity throughout the \nyear. With the exception of Phosphate Hill where production rates \nwere below nameplate leading into the turnaround, manufacturing \nreliability saw strong improvements at IPL’s other ammonia plants. \nThis is a positive reflection of the investment made by IPL into \nimproving plant reliability over the past 4 years. \nThe net financial impact of planned turnarounds was negligible \nwith the favourable impact of turnarounds in FY21 at Waggaman, \nMoranbah and St Helens offset by the impact of the Phosphate Hill \nturnaround in FY22. The Cheyenne turnaround, scheduled for later in \nFY23, is the last of the plants scheduled for its turnaround as part of \nthe reliability improvement plan.\nReliable production at around nameplate capacity has been \nachieved at all plants following the turnarounds.\nPhosphate Hill Gas: Phosphate Hill’s contracted gas supply was \ndisrupted throughout the year due to the performance of a third \nparty provider. To maintain production and capitalise on a high DAP \nprice, gas was purchased on the spot market at an incremental cost \nto contract of $41m. IPF’s gas supplier has advised that full quantities \nare expected to be restored by February 2023.\nDepreciation: The $7m net favourable depreciation impact is largely \ndriven by the impairment of the Gibson Island manufacturing \nfacility (recognised in September 2021) resulting in a decrease \nin depreciation expense of $23m in the fertilisers business. This \nwas partially offset by additional charges resulting from the three \nmajor turnarounds completed in FY21 (Waggaman, St Helens and \nMoranbah).\nWALA Incident: An incident occurred in mid-February 2022  \n(net $83m)  which brought the plant down for repairs for \napproximately 8 weeks at a cost of $182m (US$128m). The insurance \nclaim was finalised during the year and resulted in a recovery of \napproximately $99m (US$70m).  \nAmericas Explosives: The $11m improvement was supported by \nstrong market growth primarily across the Coal and Q&C sectors. \nEnd market coal production has been supported by elevated natural \ngas prices, while construction rates remain strong despite escalating \ninflation.  Further to this, the business results were negatively \nimpacted by a lagging impact of passing on the continuous price \nincreases experienced during the year.\nAsia Pacific Explosives: Dyno Nobel’s premium technology \nsuite continues to deliver strong results underpinning the $32m \nimprovement in earnings. Increased sales of key offerings such as \nDelta E, Cyber Det and Electronics contributed an additional $8m in \nearnings compared with the pcp, with a further $7m benefit coming \nfrom new customers looking to gain access to Dyno’s advanced \ntechnology. As previously communicated to the market, a further \n$11m earnings improvement came from the less profitable WA \ncontracts rolling off in FY22. The international businesses continue \nto recover from the impacts of COVID with an increase in offshore \nearnings (primarily Turkey) of approximately $10m. Unfavourable \nweather conditions negatively impacted the result by $4m. \nAsia Pacific Fertilisers: The $9m decrease in distribution earnings \nprimarily relates to a reduction in domestic sales volume and costs \nassociated with investment in the distribution network. Heavy rains \nin key regions in Southern Queensland and NSW impacted fertiliser \napplication, while high prices also resulted in reduced demand. \nThe extreme price volatility during the year was managed through \nselective procurement and stock management decisions – resulting \nin year on year volume reduction. However, strong margins (on a \ndollar per tonne basis) were realised.\nSupply Chain/Inflation: Despite management action to address \ncost pressures through efficiency improvements and contract \npricing, the speed and extent of global supply chain pressures \nand rising inflation had a negative impact on the FY22 result. The \nimpact was most prominent in the DNA business ($41m of the \n$54m) and includes higher cost of energy, raw materials related to \nInitiating Systems and abnormal freight costs driven by supply chain \ndisruptions. The lag in recovery of these cost increases is expected to \nmaterially reduce in FY23.\nCommodity Prices & Foreign Exchange: Higher commodity \nprices, primarily ammonia and DAP, contributed $920m to the result \ncompared to pcp, with a weaker Australian dollar contributing a \nfurther benefit of $80m.\nCorporate:  Corporate costs increased compared to the pcp.  \nThe increase includes provisioning for legal claims. \nStrategic review of WALA and implications for \nstructural separation of the Explosives and \nFertilisers businesses\nOn 15 November 2022, IPL announced that it had received a number \nof unsolicited approaches in relation to a potential acquisition of its \nammonia manufacturing facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana, \nUSA (WALA). The Company will undertake a review of the strategic \noptions for WALA in the near-term. Under any scenario, IPL intends \nto maintain the strategic value of long-term supply of ammonia from \nWALA into the Dyno Nobel Americas business. An estimate of the \nfinancial impact cannot be made at this point.\nThe strategic review process will have implications for the timing \nof the proposed structural separation of the Incitec Pivot Fertilisers \nand Dyno Nobel businesses which was announced on 23 May \n2022. It is currently anticipated that the previously communicated \ntarget completion date for the separation of early 2023 will likely be \nextended by 6-12 months, pending the completion of the strategic \nreview process for WALA. There has been no impact on the financial \nstatements for FY22 in relation to the proposed structural separation \nother than the costs incurred to date which have been classified \nas an individually material item and disclosed in the notes to the \nfinancial statements."

Mainly driven by an \nincrease in the Gibson Island closure provision of $10m and \nthe interest unwind on long term asset restoration obligation \nprovisions of $5m. This was offset by spend against provisions for \nthe year, primarily in relation to Gibson Island closure preparation.\n\t»\nNet other assets: Increase of $137m. Mainly due to Phosphate \nHill security deposit paid in relation to spot gas purchases \nof $46m, WALA insurance proceeds accrual $35m (of which \napproximately $25m has since been received) and settlement of \nthe payable owing to the bank as part of the trade receivables \nfacility at 30 September 2021 of $58m.\n\t»\nNet Debt: Increase of $32m (decrease of $77m excluding the \nimpact of FX translation). Mainly due to strong cash generation \ndriven by rising commodity prices offset by a reduction in the use \nof trade working capital financing facilities (-$64m), payments \nrelated to sustenance capital expenditure (-$343m), growth \ncapital (-$91m) and payment for acquisitions of Titanobel and \nYara Nipro (-$144m).

Outlined below are the \nmajor earnings movements during the year for each business \nsegment.\nExplosives \nBusiness Performance\nExplosives earnings for FY22 of US$110m was US$16m lower than \nthe pcp principally due to the following:\nEBIT Margins: The rapid impact of inflation, energy costs and supply \nchain interruptions has had a temporary negative impact on EBIT \nmargins.\nManufacturing: The positive earnings impact of US$5m reflects the \nrecovery from outages in FY21 at the Cheyenne, WY. and Louisiana, \nMO, plants. The recovery was partially offset by the impact of minor \noutages at the Louisiana, MO, plant in 2H22.\nCustomer Growth: US$8m growth in volumes, primarily driven by \nQuarries & Construction, where volumes were up 9% on pcp due to \nstrong market fundamentals and market share gain. The elevated \nnatural gas prices also led to a resurgence in end market coal \ndemand (volumes up 19%), driving elevated volumes vs pcp. \nWhile Metals volumes were down overall (-4%) due to customer \nmine closures, 2H22 volumes were supported by the start-up of \nseveral new customers.\nSupply Chain / Inflation: Inflationary pressure, higher energy costs, \nand supply chain dislocation led to a US$29m unfavourable impact \nto earnings:  \n\t»\nInflationary Pressure: US$9m unfavourable impact due to high \ndemand for raw materials and tightness in supply driving up \nmaterial costs at a quicker rate than price recovery.\n\t»\nHigher Energy cost: US$12m increase due to elevated utility and \ncommodity prices. Elevated ammonia and fuel costs, together \nwith higher electricity charges, impacted the cost of production \nand supply.\n\t»\nSupply Chain Dislocation: US$8m increase in costs related \nto scarcity of raw materials, which results in additional freight \nmovements to supply customers and plants, and led to elevated \ncosts to meet customer demand. The rate of inflation increases \nwas unprecedented. Management has worked to reduce the lag \ncaused by continuous cost increases. \nMarket Summary\nQuarry & Construction\n42% of Explosives revenue was generated from the Quarry & \nConstruction sector in FY22 (43% pcp). The strong growth in this \nsector in 1H22 carried over into 2H22 as US infrastructure spending \nand a healthy construction market supported 9% volume growth \ncompared to pcp.\nBase & Precious Metals\n36% of Explosives revenue was generated from the Base & Precious \nMetals sector in FY22 (39% pcp). Volumes decreased by 4% during \nthe year with revenues (in dollar terms) near flat compared to the \npcp. The primary driver of the decreased volume was temporary \ncustomer mine closures and lower seasonal Arctic shipments which \nare expected to return to previous levels in 2H23. These volume \ndecreases were partially offset by volume growth in the Western US.\nCoal\n22% of Explosives revenue was generated from the Coal sector in \nFY22 (18% pcp). Volumes were up 19% versus the pcp as elevated \nnatural gas prices have incentivised the power sector to temporarily \nswitch back to more coal-generated power.\n0\n100\n200\n300\n500\nFY22\nCommodities\nDepreciation\nIncident\n(Incl.

Elevated natural \ngas prices partially offset this favourable movement resulting in a net \nfavourable earnings impact of US$303m.\nManufacturing Reliability: Production at the Waggaman plant \nwas at nameplate capacity preceding, and at nameplate after, the \nreported 1H22 incident.  The recovery from the turnaround and \nweather outages in the pcp resulted in a US$103m benefit. \n1H22 outage: As previously disclosed, the FY22 results were \nimpacted by an 8-week closure of the facility, which resulted in a \nUS$128m negative impact to the result.  IPL recovered approximately \nUS$70m from property insurance coverage, resulting in a net impact \nfrom the outage of US$58m. \nDepreciation: US$8m higher than pcp.  As previously disclosed, \ndepreciation is higher primarily as a result of the FY21 turnaround.\nDiscount to Tampa Ammonia price: The discount realised on sales \npriced at Tampa benchmark in FY22 was approximately 8% prior to \nthe 8-week outage.  The timing of sales volumes contributes to the \ndisconnect between the realised price and the benchmark index, as \nthe outage coincided with highest benchmark months.  \nThe discount realised on sales priced on other benchmarks (primarily \nsales to Dyno’s Louisiana MO facility) performed as expected in the \nelevated Tampa Ammonia pricing market, with FY22 being the first \nyear since operations commenced where the pricing resulted in a \ndiscount to Tampa rather than a premium. Ammonia supply (into \nDyno’s Louisiana, MO facility) and offtake (from Waggaman, LA \nfacility) decisions are continuously evaluated to maximise cash flow \nto the Dyno Nobel Americas business.\nManufacturing\nManufacturing performance in the Explosives and Ag & IC businesses \nduring FY22 was as follows:\nCheyenne, Wyoming: Cheyenne ammonia operations recovered \nfrom unplanned outages in FY21. As a result, ammonia production \nwas up 3% compared to pcp.  Nitric Acid production was negatively \nimpacted due to an unplanned electrical feed outage, resulting in \ndecreased production of 2% compared to pcp. \nLouisiana, Missouri: Overall production was up 16% on the pcp. \nSt Helens, Oregon: Urea and ammonia production from the St \nHelens plant increased 25% and 28% respectively, compared to \nthe pcp, with plant production slightly above expectations post \nturnaround. \nWaggaman, Louisiana: As previously disclosed, the plant operated \nat nameplate capacity up to the February incident that resulted in \nan 8-week closure of the facility.  Following a successful re-start in \nmid-April 2022, the plant operated at nameplate capacity for the \nremainder of FY22.\n(1) \t Waggaman’s ammonia sales prices are based on a combination of index Ammonia Tampa prices and 1-month lagged index Ammonia Tampa prices.

Major movements for the year were due to the following:\nForeign Exchange and Commodity Prices: $472m net increase, \nprimarily driven by higher DAP price ($851/t vs $524/t), higher Urea \nprice ($710/t vs $373/t) and lower AUD:USD exchange rate (0.72 vs \n0.76), partially offset by higher cost sulphur/sulphuric acid. \nCost of Gas – Phosphate Hill: Gas supply disruptions at Phosphate \nHill increasing FY22 gas cost by $41m (~A$10m incurred in 1H22). \nPower and Water Corporation (gas supplier) expect full supply to \nbe restored in February 2023. Additional top-up gas volumes to be \npurchased to make up shortfalls to February 2023 at an estimated \ncost of approximately $60m to $70m in FY23.\nDepreciation: Net $23m reduction in depreciation charges due to \nthe impairment of Gibson Island assets in September 2021 offset \nin part by higher depreciation at Phosphate Hill mainly related to \ncapital expenditure for the construction of critical infrastructure.\nPlanned Plant Shutdowns: Phosphate Hill turnaround completed \nduring 2H FY22. This planned shutdown negatively impacted \nearnings by $74m compared to the pcp. \nManufacturing Reliability: $25m net decrease due to lower than \nexpected production and plant efficiency at Phosphate Hill in the run \nup to the turnaround.\nVolumes and Margins: Distribution volumes were lower as a result \nof lower demand, largely due to higher pricing, wet weather and \nglobal fertiliser supply constraints. Distribution margins when \nmeasured as a function of revenue will naturally decrease when \ncommodity prices increase. Distribution EBIT margin per tonne in \nFY22 was up slightly versus pcp.\nMarket Summary\nTotal Fertilisers Asia Pacific sales volumes of 2,576k metric tonnes \nwas 20% lower than FY21 sales of 3,220k metric tonnes. The planned \n8 week turnaround at Phosphate Hill adversely impacted sales \nvolumes in FY23 as did lower demand, largely due to higher pricing, \nwet weather and global fertilisers supply constraints.\nGlobal fertiliser prices traded significantly higher in FY22 with \nrealised Ammonium Phosphate prices improving by more than 62% \ncompared with the pcp while, despite its volatility, realised Urea \nprices increased 90% over the pcp. The supply and demand dynamic \nremains broadly favourable to support strong prices in the near term. \nProgress on the soil health strategy continues, highlighted by an \nincrease in Nutrient Advantage earnings and the acquisition of the \nYara Nipro liquid fertiliser business.\nFERTILISERS ASIA PACIFIC"

      "text": "OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW\n30\nIncitec Pivot Limited Annual Report 2022\nManufacturing\nManufacturing performance in the Fertilisers Asia Pacific business in \nFY22 was as follows:\nPhosphate Hill\nAmmonium phosphate production decreased to 736k mt, down 23% \non pcp. The lower production was a combination of the planned \nturnaround as well as some critical pieces of equipment operating at \nbelow capacity leading into the turnaround that commenced in early \nMay 2022. \nAmmonium phosphates cost per tonne was impacted by a number \nof factors, the most consequential being the increased cost of gas \nand sulphur. Higher depreciation and some additional repair costs \nleading into the turnaround also contributed to the higher cost per \ntonne. \nGibson Island\nIn response to the critical shortage of AdBlue in the Australian \nmarket resulting from international supply chain disruptions, IPL’s \nGibson Island plant, with the assistance of the Federal Government, \nwas able to rapidly reconfigure its production to uprate the \nproduction of AdBlue and satisfy the Australian demand. \nThe plant produced 405k mt of urea equivalent product, down \n19% on pcp. The majority of the reduced production resulted from \nvarious minor equipment failures and inefficiencies, the majority of \nwhich have been addressed. The plant is on track to close at the end \nof the calendar year.\nOUTLOOK AND SENSITIVITIES\nIPL does not generally provide profit guidance, primarily due to the \nvariability of commodity prices and foreign exchange movements. \nInstead, IPL provides an outlook for business performance \nexpectations and sensitivities to key earnings drivers based on \nmanagement’s current view at the time of this report.  \nOutlook\nDyno Nobel Americas\n\t»\nThe explosives business is well placed to benefit from heightened \nammonium nitrate pricing.\n\t»\nApart from a potential outage of up to 4 weeks to allow the \ninstallation of a replacement cooler (if required) the Waggaman \nplant is expected to produce at nameplate capacity in FY23.  \nThe operational earnings of Waggaman remain subject to \nmovements in ammonia and natural gas prices. \n\t»\nTampa Discount – Ammonia sales from the Waggaman facility \nshould return to the historical contract mix, with tonnes that \nare priced off the Tampa index returning to a 6-8% discount to \nTampa. Should the Tampa benchmark price remain at the recent \nlevel of circa US1,000/mt, when factoring in those sales that  \nare not linked to the Tampa benchmark, the overall discount  \nis expected to be between 13% and 15% in FY23. \n\t»\nAgriculture & Industrial Chemicals earnings remain subject to \nmovements in global fertiliser prices, particularly Urea. \n\t»\nThe St. Helens fertiliser plant is scheduled for a 28 day outage  \nin February 2023 for mid-cycle maintenance. \n\t»\nThe Cheyenne, WY ammonia facility is scheduled for a 55 day \nplanned turnaround in June/July 2023.\n\t»\nCoal demand is expected to be flat to FY22 as higher demand \nbased on elevated natural gas prices and low electric generator \ninventory levels lead to restocking.\n\t»\nQuarry and Construction growth is expected to continue driven \nby residential and infrastructure spending. Growth of 3% to 5%  \nis expected.\n\t»\nMetals - Growth in the overall metals sector is expected to be in \nthe low single digits.\n\t»\nDyno’s market leading technology is expected to support growth \nin future facing commodity markets, with a recent contract win in \nChile a good example.\n\t»\nThe negative impacts of higher inflation, energy costs and supply \nchain dislocations are expected to be mostly recovered in FY23 \nthrough price escalations and contract negotiations.\n\t»\nThe full year earnings from WALA that are attributable to the \nDNA business in FY23 could be impacted by the outcome of the \nannounced strategic review, and the timing of the settlement of \nany sale transaction that may result.\nDyno Nobel Asia Pacific\n\t»\nFavourable pricing conditions on the East Coast of Australia are \nexpected over the re-contracting cycle.\n\t»\nTechnology growth is expected to continue at a run-rate similar \nto the guidance provided in FY20 as customers look to drill more \ncomplex ore bodies and increasingly value productivity, safety \nand environmental improvements.\n\t»\nMoranbah is expected to be negatively impacted by \napproximately $10m due to the cessation of ammonia supply \nfrom Gibson Island (20kt per annum). \n\t»\nSupply Chain and inflationary costs continue to challenge and \nimpact the business. Although efficiency improvements are \nexpected to mitigate the impact, FY23 is expected to see a lag in \nbeing able to recover some of these costs through re-pricing."

These risks, which may occur individually \nor concurrently, could significantly affect the Group’s business and operations. For some of the risks described below, factors such as \ncontinuing global geopolitical uncertainty, supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and global recessionary risks have the potential  \nto exacerbate those risks. IPL is also undertaking a demerger to implement a structural separation of its fertilisers and explosives businesses  \nto create two separately listed companies on the ASX. Some of these risks may be heightened for the businesses on a stand-alone basis. \nThere may be additional risks unknown to IPL and other risks, currently believed to be immaterial, which could become material. In addition, \nany loss from such risks may not be recoverable in whole or in part under IPL’s insurance policies. The treatment strategies noted below are not \nexhaustive and do not remove the risks; while in some cases they may either partially or fully mitigate the exposure, residual risk remains.\nThe Group’s process for managing risk is set out in the Corporate Governance Statement.\nBroad Risk Category Description and potential consequences\nTreatment strategies employed by IPL\nStrategy & Climate \nChange\nIPL operates in highly competitive markets with varying \ncompetitor dynamics and industry structures.

These \nmay include a rapid transition away from fossil fuels, \nwhich would likely significantly decrease demand for \nthermal coal, and a shift to new technologies, such as \nrenewable hydrogen. Growing demand for green and \nblue ammonia creates opportunities in these developing \nmarkets.\nGeopolitical uncertainty borne out of the continuing \nsupply chain challenges in China, impacts from Russia’s \ninvasion of Ukraine and global inflationary pressures \ncould have a negative impact on IPL’s cost base, sales \nand market share and hence the Group’s financial \nperformance.\nThe execution of IPL’s proposed demerger to implement \na structural separation of its fertilisers and explosives \nbusinesses to create two separately listed companies \non the ASX may also adversely impact IPL’s financial \nperformance or reputation.\nIncreased engagement by stakeholders in relation to \nmatters such as supply chain and climate change may  \nalso adversely impact IPL’s financial performance  \nand reputation.\nThe impact of carbon emissions, and governments’ \npolicies and actions to limit them, may have an impact \non IPL’s operations and supply chains.

Our internal promotions increased by 12.6%, demonstrating the depth \nof expertise and capability we have amongst our people. Our focus on candidates with diverse \nbackgrounds continues as a key pillar in ensuring that we build a diverse workforce to deliver \nglobal outcomes.\nThe Americas region launched a centralised Internship Academy as part of the Nobel \nAcademy program, with 67% of the interns diverse in at least one recognised category and  \n43% women. \nOur Australian Graduate Program comprised 58% female engineers in 2022 and has had 0% \nturnover since the program began in 2018.\nInclusive workplace\nWe are committed to providing  \nan inclusive workplace experience  \nwhere our people have the space  \nto authentically be themselves, \ncollaborate, be curious and  \ninspired to deliver.\nInclusive behaviour remains a priority and we continued to build this capability. Inclusive  \nLeader & Respect in the Workplace programs were conducted in the Americas region and  \nthe Upstander Program was utilised in Australia to further broaden inclusive behaviours. \nOur first cultural inclusion survey was piloted in the Americas region to better understand our \nworkplace culture as it relates to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. This approach is currently being \nconsidered for global implementation.\nAs part of delivering our Reconciliation Action Plan commitments in Australia we designed a \nCultural Awareness Program delivered via e-learning. This program is focused on education and \ncontinuing to support our efforts in reconciliation and has seen excellent participation across the \nAustralian business.\nOur approach to work flexibility has matured to enable the balance between workplace \ncollaboration and the shift in employees’ expectations of work life balance. For employees in \noperational roles, we continue to seek opportunities to provide greater flexibility. For employees \nin nonoperational roles, we have a hybrid model allowing for office and homebased working \narrangements (depending on the nature of the role). Our approach to flexible work is also \nunderpinned by Flexible Work policies, enabling collaboration between leaders and employees to \ndetermine flexibility that works for the business and the employee. \nIn 2022, female employees represent 18.5% of our global workforce, a 0.8 percentage point \nincrease on last year’s figure and a 4.5% annual increase on last year’s numbers.

      "text": "47\nIncitec Pivot Limited Annual Report 2022\nOur GHG reduction projects\nIn 2022 we approved a project that will deliver our 2025 reduction target, progressed a range of \nproposed decarbonisation projects to develop a pathway to more than 42% by 2030, and moved \ntowards setting Scope 3 targets. \nPathway to more than 42% operational GHG reduction by 2030 (9)\nMoranbah N2O Tertiary Abatement\nDyno Nobel’s Moranbah ammonium nitrate manufacturing facility \nwas built in 2012 with secondary N2O abatement on the nitric acid \nplant. This has reduced GHG emissions by ~400,000 tCO2e each year \nfor the past nine years. \nDuring 2022, IPL approved the installation of tertiary N2O abatement, \nwhich will provide even greater reductions. A further ~200,000 tCO2e \nwill be abated annually, which equates to a 5% reduction against \nIPL’s 2020 baseline. The project is expected to be installed in 2024 \nand will underpin the achievement of IPL’s 5% by 2025 reduction \ntarget. A similar project is being investigated for our Louisiana, \nMissouri AN facility which if adopted, would achieve a further 7-11% \nreduction against our 2020 baseline. (8)\nWaggaman Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS)\nDuring 2022, a FEED study was approved for a Carbon Capture \nFacility (CCF) at the Waggaman, Louisiana ammonia manufacturing \nfacility. If adopted, the CCF would capture the pure stream of CO2 \ncreated during the ammonia manufacturing process. Due to its high \nconcentration, this CO2 stream is much more economic to process \nthan many other industries’ CO2 streams, with only drying and \ncompression required before transport via pipeline to a permanent \ngeological sequestration site. Memorandums of Understanding \n(MOU’s) have been established with several shortlisted parties to \nwork through options for transport and deep well injection.\nLouisiana is an ideal site for CCS due to its geology, its existing CO2 \npipeline infrastructure, and a range of potential local partners with \nexperience in using proven technology and management techniques \nto meet the very stringent regulatory requirements set by the US EPA \nfor Class VI wells. Subject to the successful completion of the FEED \nstudy, and subject to a final investment decision, construction of the \ncarbon capture unit at Waggaman is expected to begin in 2024 and \nbe completed by the end of 2025. If adopted, this would result in a \n22% reduction against IPL’s 2020 baseline.\nGibson Island Green Ammonia\nThe Gibson Island Green Ammonia project is a partnership between \nIPL and Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) to investigate green \nammonia production at the Incitec Pivot Fertilisers Gibson Island \nsite. The site has used natural gas to produce hydrogen (H2) for the \nmanufacture of ammonia (NH3) since it was built in 1969 (obtaining \nthe nitrogen (N) required from the air). The current model under \nconsideration would involve FFI constructing an on-site water \nelectrolysis plant to produce hydrogen from the electrolysis of \nwater (H2O) using renewable electricity, thereby dramatically \nreducing GHG emissions. FFI would develop and operate the \nhydrogen manufacturing facility, with IPL operating the ammonia \nmanufacturing facility. \nWe are excited to report that the project progressed to FEED stage \nin 2022 and secured a $13.7m ARENA grant. Should the project \nproceed to a final investment decision, it would be Australia’s first \nindustrial scale green ammonia production facility, demonstrating \nexisting infrastructure can be retrofitted to utilise zero-emissions \nenergy sources. \nIf adopted, the proposed water electrolysis facility would produce  \nup to 50,000 tonnes of renewable hydrogen per year and replace  \nall of Gibson Island’s current gas feedstock and 95% of its natural  \ngas energy use. This would result in a 12% reduction against IPL’s \n2020 baseline.\nInvestigating Science Based and Scope 3 Targets\nDuring 2022, we engaged a specialist third party to assist us to \ninvestigate Science Based Targets (SBTs) which are targets verified \nby the Science Based Target Initiative. Part of the work on the way \nto preparing SBTs includes an independent review of Scope 1, 2 and \n3 calculations, as well as preparing Scope 1&2 and Scope 3 future \nemissions trajectories based on our business plans. An assessment \nof our proposed operational decarbonisation projects and Scope 3 \nreduction opportunities was also completed.\nThis work has confirmed our global Scope 1&2 emissions calculations \nwith only minor changes. It also aligned our Scope 3 calculation \nmethodology more fully with the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Calculation \nGuidance, resulting in a more complete Scope 3 inventory and \nbaseline from which to move forward. \nOur business units integrated Scope 3 emissions management  \ninto their business strategies this year, and are targeting FY23 \ndelivery of a management framework with systems in place to  \ntrack and manage Scope 3 by FY25. To assist, a supply chain  \npartner with experience in Scope 3 has been engaged to assist  \nIPL’s businesses in obtaining supplier specific emissions factors and \nseek to work with value chain partners to collaborate on reducing \nScope 3. For more information on our GHG reduction projects see \nIPL’s 2022 Climate Change Report.\n(8) \t IPL’s 2020 operational (Scope 1&2) baseline has been restated from 3,961,222 tCO2e to 3,991,396 tCO2e due to external verification of our global GHG data set by an expert third party. \n(9)\t This diagram is not indicative of firm implementation timeline for each individual project.\nIPL 2020\nBASELINE\n4000kt\n>42%\n reduction \nagainst  \n2020 \nbaseline\n2020\nLOUISIANA MISSOURI (LOMO) \nN2O ABATEMENT\nGIBSON ISLAND \nGREEN AMMONIA\nMORANBAH N20 ABATEMENT \nWAGGAMAN CCS\n(PERMANENT GEOLOGICAL \nSQUESTRATION)\n2030"

Mr Tim Richards is the Company’s lead audit \npartner for the 2022 financial year. \nThe Group may decide to engage the auditor, Deloitte, for the \nprovision of non-audit services, where such services are not in \nconflict with their role as auditor and their expertise and/or detailed \nexperience with the Company may allow cost efficiencies for the \nwork. \nThe Board has considered the position and, in accordance with \nadvice received by the Audit and Risk Management Committee, is \nsatisfied that the provision of non-audit services during the year by \nDeloitte is compatible with the general standard of independence \nfor auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 and does not \ncompromise the external auditor’s independence. \nThe Board also notes: \n\t»\nthe engagements for all non-audit services provided by Deloitte \nwere reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer, and where relevant, \napproved by the Audit and Risk Management Committee, in \naccordance with the Committee’s Charter and the Company’s \npolicy on the engagement of the external auditor for the \nprovision of non-audit services to ensure they do not impact the \nintegrity and objectivity of the auditor; and \n\t»\nthe non-audit services provided by Deloitte did not undermine \nthe general principles relating to auditor independence as set \nout in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, as \nthey did not involve reviewing or auditing the auditor’s own \nwork, acting in a management or decision making capacity for \nthe Group, acting as an advocate for the Group or jointly sharing \neconomic risks or rewards. \nDeloitte provided non-audit services to the amount of $730k during \nthe year ended 30 September 2022 (refer to note 24 to the financial \nstatements). \nThe lead auditor has provided a written declaration that no \nprofessional engagement for the Group has been carried out  \nduring the year that would impair Deloitte’s independence as \nauditor. A copy of the auditor’s independence declaration is set  \nout on page 83 and forms part of this report. \nProceedings on behalf of IPL\nNo application has been made under section 237 of the  \nCorporations Act 2001 in respect of IPL, and there are no proceedings \nthat a person has brought or intervened in on behalf of IPL under \nthat section. \nRounding\nAs the Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations \n(Rounding in Financial/Directors’ Reports) Instrument 2016/191,  \nthe amounts shown in this report and in the financial statements \nhave been rounded off, except where otherwise stated, to the \nnearest one hundred thousand dollars. \nThe Directors’ Report, which includes the OFR and the  \nRemuneration Report, is signed in accordance with a  \nresolution of the directors of Incitec Pivot Limited. \nBrian Kruger \nChairman\nJeanne Johns \nManaging Director & CEO\n15 November 2022"

      "text": "REMUNERATION REPORT\nIntroduction from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee\n(1)\t Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate.\n(2)\t Group Adjusted NPAT means that results have been normalised to remove the impact of foreign exchange and commodity price movements.\nDear Shareholders,\nOn behalf of Incitec Pivot Limited’s (IPL or the Company) \nRemuneration Committee and the Board, I am pleased to  \npresent the Remuneration Report for 2022 which sets out the \nremuneration information for the Managing Director & Chief \nExecutive Officer (MD&CEO), Executive Key Management  \nPersonnel (KMP) and the Non-executive Directors.\nOur approach\nThe Remuneration Committee’s objective is to ensure our \nremuneration framework provides a bridge between shareholder \nvalue and individual performance, whilst ensuring alignment with  \nour other key stakeholders. \nWe ensure individual performance is measured using targets that  \nalign to IPL’s values, long-term strategy and metrics, shorter term \nfinancial targets and relevant individual goals.\nFinancial Year 2022 in review\nThe Company’s safety and sustainability performance continued \nto gain positive momentum. Although TRIFR (1) has been flat, FY22 \nhas seen a material reduction in injury severity and environmental \nincidents. This year we have made good progress on our journey \nto Net Zero with a range of projects advanced to decarbonise \nour operations. The Board and Management remain focused on \ncontinued progress to our sustainability performance. \nThe 2022 financial year was characterised by higher commodity \nprices, supply chain challenges, and ongoing COVID-19 \nuncertainties. These factors continued to make financial target \nsetting very challenging. For financial year 2022, higher commodity \nprices helped deliver a record Headline Group NPAT result of  \n$1,027.1 million. With strong financial results the Company’s share \nprice increased 19.4% from $2.94 to $3.51. Pleasingly with increased \nprofitability in 2022, dividends payments were increased 190%  \nfrom 9.3 cents to 27 cents per share and a share buyback of up  \nto $400 million has been announced.\nHigh commodity prices offset manufacturing related issues \nexperienced at both our Waggaman, Louisiana, USA (WALA)  \nand Phosphate Hill plants. We remain focused on consistent  \nand reliable production.\nSome significant strategic steps have been progressed with the \nplanned demerger of the fertiliser and explosives businesses, the \nacquisition of Titanobel in France, and assessments to convert the \nGibson Island ammonia plant to run on green hydrogen.\nPost the end of the financial year, the 2023 strategic objectives have \nbeen expanded to include the strategic review of the Waggaman \nammonia plant. The strategic review process will have implications \nfor the timing of the proposed demerger of the Incitec Pivot \nFertilisers and Dyno Nobel businesses. The deliverables for both \nprojects have been incorporated into relevant executive strategic \nobjectives for FY23.\nExecutive changes in FY22\nMr Paul Victor commenced as the new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) \non 1 July 2022. Mr Victor has over 30 years’ experience across a range \nof industries, including upstream oil and gas, gold and coal mining, \nchemicals and energy industries for international listed companies.\nFormer CFO, Nick Stratford, left the Company on 31 December 2021 \n(refer section 4.6).\nMr Stephan Titze (President – Incitec Pivot Fertilisers) has retired  \nand left the Company on 30 September 2022 (refer section 4.6).\nWe thank both for their significant contributions to the Company.\nFixed remuneration in FY22\nA new regional manufacturing model was introduced this year. \nDuties for the previous Global Manufacturing & HSE (Health Safety  \n& Environment) role were reassigned geographically to the President \n– Dyno Nobel Americas, the President – Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific,  \nand the President – Incitec Pivot Fertilisers, resulting in increases  \nto their fixed remuneration (refer section 2.2). The MD&CEO did not \nreceive an increase to fixed remuneration in 2022. \nShort-term incentive in FY22\nThe MD&CEO achieved an STI outcome of 64% of maximum and \nthe average Executive KMP STI outcomes was 59.3% of maximum. \nThe STI outcomes were as a result of record Headline Group NPAT \nand strong performance by Executive KMP against their personal \nmeasures. Strategic objectives that have progressed well during \nFY22 include the planned demerger, acquisition of Titanobel and \nprogress on decarbonisation initiatives. \nHSE overall outcomes for the year showed improvement and \nachieved an at target result (refer section 2.3). Sustainability \nmeasures attached to each Executive KMP’s STI delivered above \ntarget outcomes for all but the President – Incitec Pivot Fertilisers, \nwho delivered a result between threshold and target. Group \nAdjusted NPAT (2) was impacted by manufacturing-related issues, \nwhich resulted in an overall outcome below threshold level.\nFor the Dyno business units, adjusted EBIT results for DNA  \ndid not reach threshold and DNAP was between threshold and \ntarget levels. The IPF business unit did not reach threshold for \nadjusted EBIT, largely due to Phosphate Hill production issues. \nSection 2.1 outlines additional information on the Company’s  \nFY22 performance and resulting STI outcomes are provided in \nsection 2.3 of this report.\nLong-term incentive\nThe 2019/22 LTI plan shifted its performance period for the Relative \nTSR condition from an end of financial year to a November 2022 \ntesting date. The decision to move this Relative TSR performance \nperiod was to align the end of the testing period with the release  \nof the Company’s annual results. \nAs a result, only non-TSR performance conditions attached to the \n2019/22 LTI plan can be commented on in this year’s report (refer \nto Section 2.5), with detailed reporting on the 2018/21 tranche \nincluded under Section 2.4. The three metrics for the 2019/22 plan \nare Relative TSR, Return on Invested Capital, and Long Term Value \nMetrics. Although final performance for the Relative TSR component \nwas not known at the time of this report, we expect a higher level of \nvesting for the 2019/22 LTI at around 60% to 80%.\nAs previously disclosed, for the 2018/21 LTI plan with the \nperformance period that ended on 30 September 2021, 15%  \nof performance rights vested. \nFY23 Remuneration framework\nThe FY23 STI remuneration framework is expected to remain largely \nthe same as FY22. With the strategic review of Waggaman, timing \nof the demerger of the Incitec Pivot Fertilisers and Dyno Nobel \nbusinesses is likely to be extended by 6 to 12 months (refer to \nsection 5 for proposed FY23 STI weightings for each Executive KMP). \nAfter a recent salary review, the MD&CEO’s fixed remuneration will \nbe increased by 3.9% in January 2023, the first increase since January \n2019. The performance conditions for the LTI 2022/25 are expected \nto be largely the same as the LTI 2021/24. We are reviewing the \nReturn on Invested Capital (ROIC) metric and expect to move to a \nthree-year average calculation. \nWe continue to review market trends to ensure our remuneration \nframework supports the execution of our strategies to increase \nshareholder value. This objective is balanced with retaining and \nmotivating our key talent and ensuring alignment with our other  \nkey stakeholders. \nWe look forward to ongoing dialogue with, and the support of our \nshareholders, and welcome your feedback and comments on any \naspect of this Report.\nGreg Robinson \nChairman\nREMUNERATION REPORT\n63\nIncitec Pivot Limited Annual Report 2022"

IPL embraces a set of Strategic Value Drivers that underpin the \nCompany’s business and form the platform for the Company’s future earnings growth and shareholder returns. The Company’s commitment  \nto addressing climate change challenges and looking for opportunities in the decarbonisation of the world’s energy systems is at the heart  \nof the business strategy and integrated across all the Strategic Value Drivers:\nZero Harm – Broadening and setting year-on-year improvement objectives across key metrics including environmental care  \nand process safety.\nTalented and Engaged People – One IPL collaborative culture with engaged, diverse and inclusive teams focused on customers  \nand value creation.\nCustomer Focus – Partnering with our customers to create added value and practical solutions for today and the future.\nManufacturing Excellence – Driving consistently high performance across all of our assets and investigating ways to address our \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\nLeading Technology Solutions – Innovation on the ground with practical innovations that our customers can use today to improve  \ntheir operations and environmental outcomes.\nProfitable Growth – Focus on opportunities that are distinctive to our differentiated technology, core markets, core capabilities  \nand market segments.\nUnder the Strategic Value Driver of ‘Talented and Engaged People’, IPL recognises that to generate competitive returns for its shareholders, it \nrequires talented people who are capable, committed and motivated. IPL’s remuneration strategy is designed to support the objectives of the \nbusiness and to enable the Company to attract, retain and reward Executives of the requisite skill and calibre.\nThe key principles of the Company’s remuneration strategy are to:\n\t»\nreward strategic outcomes at both the Group and business unit level that create top quartile long term shareholder value;\n\t»\nrequire integrity and encourage disciplined risk management in business practice;\n\t»\ndrive strong alignment with shareholder interests through delivering part of the reward in the form of equity;\n\t»\nstructure the majority of executive remuneration to be “at risk” and linked to demanding financial and non-financial  \nperformance objectives;\n\t»\nattract and retain the best available talent;\n\t»\nreward Executives for high performance within their role and responsibilities, and ensure rewards are competitive within  \nthe industry and market for their role in respect of pay level and structure; and\n\t»\nensure the remuneration framework is simple, transparent and easily implemented.\n3.3 Executive remuneration governance\nThe remuneration of the Executives is set by the Board, having regard to recommendations from the Remuneration Committee.\nWhere appropriate, the Remuneration Committee of the Board engages external advisors to provide input into the process of reviewing \nExecutive and Non-executive Director remuneration.

      "text": "4.2 Fixed annual remuneration\nExecutives receive their fixed annual remuneration (FAR) in a variety of forms, including cash, superannuation, and any applicable fringe \nbenefits. The Executives’ FAR is set by reference to appropriate benchmark information for each Executive’s role, level of knowledge, skill,  \nresponsibilities and experience. The level of remuneration is reviewed annually in alignment with the financial year and with reference  \nto, among other things, Company and individual performance and market data provided by an appropriately qualified and independent \nexternal data specialist.\n4.3 Short-term incentive\nThe STI is an annual “at risk” incentive which is dependent on the achievement of particular performance measures. The following table \nsummarises the STI plan that applied in the 2022 financial year (2022 STI):\nWhat was the performance \nperiod?\nThe performance period for the 2022 STI was the financial year from 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022.\nWho was eligible for the STI?\nThe MD&CEO and all other Executives participated in the 2022 STI.\nWhat was the target and \nmaximum STI opportunity?\nTarget STI opportunity was 100% of FAR for the MD&CEO, and 60% of FAR for all other Executives. Maximum STI opportunity  \n(for stretch outcomes) was 150% of FAR for the MD&CEO, and 120% of FAR for all other Executives.\nWhat were the Performance \nConditions and Measures?\nPerformance conditions under the STI are determined by the Board for each financial year. The performance conditions  \nfor the 2022 STI are set out below:\nPerformance Conditions\nMeasures to assess satisfaction  \nof Performance Conditions\nRationale for the Performance Conditions\nZero Harm\nSafety performance balanced scorecard \nacross the dimensions of behavioural and \nprocess safety management comprising \ninput and output measures. (1)\nTo align with the Company’s commitment to “Zero \nHarm for Everyone, Everywhere”. In 2017, the Company \nadopted its second five-year Global HSE Strategy to \ncontinue to drive improvement in the Group’s health, \nsafety and environmental performance.\nGroup Financial \nPerformance\nGroup NPAT (Net Profit After Tax). Group \nAdjusted NPAT (2)\nTo align Executive KMP with targeted profits that \nwould contribute to shareholder returns.\nBusiness Unit Financial \nPerformance\nBusiness Unit Adjusted EBIT (Earnings \nBefore Interest and Tax) (2)\nTo ensure robust alignment of performance in a \nparticular business unit with reward for the Executive \nmanaging that business unit.\nSustainability measures\nSustainability measures targeted at an \nExecutive’s area of influence.\nPerformance conditions are designed to align with \nthe overall Sustainability strategy of the business and \nfocuses an Executive on the key short term objectives \nwithin their area of influence, that contribute towards \nthe Company’s longer term milestones.\nStrategic Outcomes\nMeasures based on performance criteria \nfor the execution and implementation \nof strategic objectives and business \npriorities. These include measures related \nto greenhouse gas reduction targets, cost \nreduction initiatives, cash conversion \nrequirements, product innovation and \nprogress towards the demerger of the \nfertiliser and explosives businesses.\nTailored to individual Executive’s role, to drive \nperformance and behaviours consistent with achieving \ncritical aspects of the Group’s strategy.\n(1)\t In assessing the safety balanced scorecard, the Board may, in its discretion, have regard to the results achieved against the measures comprising the \nscorecard without applying a specific weighting to any particular measure. The balanced scorecard category measures include: Personal Safety, Process \nSafety; Environmental; Significant Event Management and the Zero Harm Plan.\n(2)\t Adjusted means that results have been normalised to remove the impact of foreign exchange and commodity price movements.\nWhere any Individually Material Item (IMI) is separately recognised in the financial report, the Board will have discretion to \ninclude or exclude the IMI for the purpose of determining any STI award, taking into account the nature of the IMI and having \nregard to whether, in the circumstances, it would be appropriate for the IMI to be attributable to Management.\nDetermination of the extent to which each of the above measures was satisfied was based on a review by the Board of the \naudited financial report and performance of the Group for the financial year, following the annual performance review process \nfor the Executives.\nAre there minimum \nperformance levels  \nwhich must be achieved \nbefore awards can be  \nmade under the STI?\nFor the 2022 financial year, to ensure STI awards are aligned with business performance outcomes, the Board determined that an \n“STI Financial Gate” would operate. The STI Financial Gate reflects a requirement to exceed a designated level of the Group’s NPAT \nperformance, or all non-safety components of the STI will be capped at a maximum of target payment.\nThe STI Financial Gate does not apply to any awards payable in relation to the Zero Harm performance condition, reflecting the \nprimacy of safety.\nIn relation to the Zero Harm performance condition, the Board retains a discretion to forfeit all or part of the award payable for \nthis performance condition in the event of a fatality or major incident having regard to the circumstances of the incident.\nREMUNERATION REPORT\n73\nIncitec Pivot Limited Annual Report 2022"

As no shares are provided to participants until vesting, performance \nrights have no dividend entitlement. Performance rights expire on vesting or lapsing of the rights.\nWhat is the purpose  \nof the LTI?\nThe LTI is designed to link reward with the key performance drivers which underpin sustainable growth in shareholder value.\nAs rights under the LTI Plans result in share ownership on the achievement of demanding targets, the LTI ties remuneration to \nCompany performance, as experienced by shareholders. The arrangements also support the Company’s strategy for retention \nand motivation of the Executives.\nWhat is the process for \ndetermining eligibility?\nThe decision to grant performance rights under the LTI Plans and to whom they will be granted is made annually by the Board, \nnoting that the grant of performance rights to the MD&CEO is subject to shareholder approval. Grants of performance rights to \nparticipants are based on a percentage of the relevant Executive’s FAR.\nWhat is the maximum  \nLTI opportunity under  \nthe LTI Plans?\nThe maximum LTI opportunities under each LTI Plan are:\n\t»\nfor the MD&CEO, 150% of FAR; and\n\t»\nfor all other Executives, 80% of FAR.\nHow was the number \nof performance rights \ncalculated under the  \nLTI Plans?\nFor the LTI 2021/24 the number of performance rights issued to a participant was based on the market value of the on the \nmarket value of the Company’s shares over the 5 business days immediately after the release of the Company’s full year results in \nthe first year of the performance period, being 12 November 2021.\nEach issuance was determined by dividing the dollar value of the relevant participant’s LTI opportunity by these outcomes.\nWhat are the performance \nconditions, performance \nperiods and status of  \ncurrent LTI Plans?\nLTI Plan\nPerformance Conditions\nWeighting of \nPerformance \nCondition\nPerformance Period\nStatus\nLTI 2021/24\nTSR Condition\nLong Term Value \nMetrics Condition\nAbsolute ROIC Condition\nSustainability Condition\n40%\n15% \n35%\n10%\nNovember 2021 to \nNovember 2024 (TSR \nCondition only) \n1 October 2021 to 30 \nSeptember 2024 (other \nconditions)\nTesting to occur after completion of \nperformance period\nWhen are the performance \nconditions measured?\nAfter the expiry of the relevant performance period, the Board determines whether the performance conditions of the relevant \nLTI Plans are satisfied. The performance conditions are tested once, at the end of the relevant performance period. If the \nperformance conditions are satisfied and the rights vest, the participant is entitled to receive ordinary shares in the Company. \nThe participant does not pay for those shares.\nTo the extent the performance conditions are not satisfied during the performance period, the performance rights will lapse.\nWhat happens if a \nparticipant leaves the \nCompany?\nGenerally, the performance rights granted under the LTI Plans will lapse on a cessation of employment except where the \nparticipant has died, becomes totally and permanently disabled, is retrenched, retires or is terminated without cause. In those \ncircumstances (subject to Board discretion), the number of performance rights retained by the participant will be reduced pro \nrata to reflect the proportion of days worked during the relevant performance period and will be tested in the ordinary course.\nIn what other circumstances \nmay the performance rights \nvest (which may be before \nor after the expiry of the \nperformance period) under \nthe LTI Plans?\nThe Board may provide a notice to the participants specifying that the performance rights will vest at a time stipulated in the \nnotice on the occurrence of one of the following events in relation to the Company:\n\t»\na takeover bid;\n\t»\na change of control;\n\t»\nthe Court ordering a meeting be held in connection with a scheme for the reconstruction of the Company or its \namalgamation with any other companies; or\n\t»\na voluntary or compulsory winding-up.\nIs there a mechanism  \nfor clawback?\nThe LTI Plan includes a clawback provision, which requires the repayment of vested awards where payment has exceeded the \nrestated position. This includes overpayments resulting from a material misstatement or omissions in IPL’s financial statements \non where a participant has materially breached their obligations to the Company.\nREMUNERATION REPORT\n75\nIncitec Pivot Limited Annual Report 2022"

This condition provides shareholder alignment as it takes into account the Company’s share price movement as well as dividends \npaid, relative to other organisations comparable to the Company.\nThe S&P/ASX 100 has been chosen as the comparator group because, having regard to the business segments in which the Company operates \nand, specifically, the absence of a sufficient number of direct comparator companies, the Board considers the S&P/ASX 100 to represent the \nmost appropriate, and objective, comparator group. It also represents the group of companies against which the Company competes for \nshareholder capital. The Board has the discretion to vary the comparator group at any time, including to remove companies from, or include \ncompanies in, the comparator group.\nThe table below sets out the TSR Condition, and the percentage of the performance rights that will vest based on satisfaction of this condition.\nRelative TSR ranking of IPL\n% of performance rights subject to the TSR Condition that will vest\nLess than 50th percentile\nNil\nAt or greater than 50th percentile but less than 75th percentile\nPro rata from 50% on a straight-line basis\nAt 75th percentile or greater\n100%\nLong Term Value Metrics Condition (15%)\nThe Long Term Value Metrics Condition relates to the delivery of significant aspects of the Board approved strategy. The Long Term Value \nMetrics Condition comprises components aligned with the Company’s strategic drivers: Manufacturing Excellence, Profitable Growth and \nCustomer, Practical Technology & Innovation. Each of these strategic drivers has a direct impact on financial outcomes.\nThe table below summarises the Long Term Value Metrics components for the LTI 2021/24:\nScorecard\nLong Term Value \nMetrics Condition\nRationale\nMeasurement criteria\nPerformance goals\nManufacturing \nReliability \nOur integrated platforms and facilities \nacross high quality markets enable us \nto drive advantage in management \nof our supply chain and deliver \ncompetitive value to customers.\nThe stretch goal is Reliability of \n95% by FY24 vs historical baseline \naverage of 85%.

Some of the performance goals involve commercial-in-confidence quantitative \ntargets and, as such, some detailed performance goals are not disclosed, but performance against the goals is disclosed at the end of the \nperformance period. For the LTI 2018/21, these details are set out in section 2.4. For the LTI 2021/24, the relevant details will be set out in the \n2025 Remuneration Report.\nThe Board will determine the outcome for the relevant component of the Long Term Value Metrics Condition under each LTI plan having regard \nto the results achieved against the performance goals across the entirety of the Scorecard for that component. If the Board determines that \nall of the performance goals in respect of a component of the Long Term Value Metrics Condition have been achieved, all of the performance \nrights subject to that component will vest.\nIf not all performance goals in respect of a component of the Long Term Value Metrics Condition are met over the performance period, the \nextent to which that component of the Long Term Value Metrics Condition has been satisfied (if at all) will be determined by the Board. In \ndoing so, the Board will have regard to the results achieved against the performance goals across all of the components of the relevant \nScorecard, without applying a specific weighting to any particular performance goal.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n76\nIncitec Pivot Limited Annual Report 2022\nREMUNERATION REPORT\n76\nIncitec Pivot Limited Annual Report 2022"

ROIC has been selected as it is a key \ndeterminant of efficient use of the capital entrusted to management by shareholders. It also reflects factors that improve shareholder value, \nincluding operational efficiency, capital efficiency, asset utilisation and profitability. ROIC is defined as Net Profit After Tax, excluding interest \nand individually material items, divided by total invested capital (on a rolling 13 month average basis).\nThe table below sets out the Absolute ROIC Condition for the LTI 2021/24, and the percentage of performance rights that will vest based on \nsatisfaction of this condition:\nAbsolute ROIC Targets\n% of performance rights subject to the Absolute ROIC Condition that will vest\nLess than 6.4%\nNil\nAt or above 6.4% but less than 6.8%\nPro rata from 50% on a straight-line basis\n6.8% or greater\n100%\nSustainability Condition (10%)\nThe Sustainability Condition was introduced for the LTI 2021/24 as an additional metric.

Most Executives are engaged on \nsimilar contractual terms, with minor variations to reflect differing circumstances. Each agreement is unlimited in term; however, each \nagreement provides that the Company may terminate an Executive’s employment immediately for cause without any separation payment, \nsave for accrued amounts such as leave, or otherwise without cause, with or without notice, in which case the Company must pay a separation \npayment plus accrued amounts such as leave.\nThe notice period to be provided by the Executives is set out in the table below:\nCurrent Executives\nNotice period to be  \nprovided by the Executive\nNotice period to be  \nprovided by the Company\nJ Johns (1)\n52 weeks\n52 weeks\nP Victor\n26 weeks\n26 weeks\nG Hayne (2)\n26 weeks\n52 weeks\nB Lusk\n26 weeks\n26 weeks\nFormer Executives\nNotice period  \nprovided by the Executive\nNotice period  \nprovided by the Company\nS Titze (3)\n26 weeks\n26 weeks\nN Stratford (4)\n26 weeks\n52 weeks\n(1)\t Ms Johns’ separation payment is equal to 52 weeks of FAR as at the date of termination (subject to the provisions relating to the terminations benefits in Part 2D.2 of the Corporations Act 2001).\n(2)\t Mr Hayne operates under an historical contract which provides for a separation payment equal to 52 weeks of FAR (subject to the termination provisions in the Corporations Act).\n(3)\t Mr Titze ceased as a KMP on 27 July 2022.\n(4)\t Mr Stratford ceased as a KMP on 14 November 2021.\nREMUNERATION REPORT\n77\nIncitec Pivot Limited Annual Report 2022"

Non-executive Director Remuneration\nIPL’s policy is to:\n\t»\nremunerate Non-executive Directors by way of fees and payments which may be in the form of cash and superannuation benefits; and\n\t»\nset the level of Non-executive Directors’ fees and payments to be consistent with the market and to enable the IPL Group to attract and \nretain directors of an appropriate calibre.\nNon-executive Directors are not remunerated by way of options, shares, performance rights, bonuses nor by incentive-based payments.\nNon-executive Directors receive a fee for being a director of the Board and Non-executive Directors, other than the Chairman of the Board, \nreceive additional fees for either chairing or being a member of a Board Committee. The level of fees paid to a Non-executive Director is \ndetermined by the Board after an annual review and reflects a Non-executive Director’s time commitments and responsibilities.\nFor the 2022 financial year, there were no increases to Non-executive Directors’ fees. Fees paid to Non-executive Directors amounted to \n$1,690,000 which was within the $2,000,000 maximum aggregate fee pool approved by shareholders at the 2008 Annual General Meeting.  \nFor the 2023 financial year, the Board has determined that there will be a minor uplift to fees paid to the Remuneration Committee, resulting \nfrom the increase in workload that this Committee has experienced over recent years. The Remuneration Committee Chairperson will now  \nbe paid $40,000 (formerly $35,400) with Remuneration Committee Members receiving $20,000 (formerly $17,700).

Where applicable, comparative disclosures have \nbeen reclassified for consistency with the current period if material.\nThe consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue  \nby the directors on 15 November 2022.\nSubsidiaries\nSubsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Group.  \nThe financial results and financial position of the subsidiaries  \nare included in the consolidated financial statements from  \nthe date control commences until the date control ceases.\nA list of the Group’s subsidiaries is included in note 15.\nJoint arrangements and associates\nA joint venture is an arrangement where the parties have rights  \nto the net assets of the venture.\nA joint operation is an arrangement where the parties each have \nrights to the assets and liabilities relating to the arrangement.\nAssociates are those entities in respect of which the Group has \nsignificant influence, but not control, over the financial and \noperating policies of the entities.\nInvestments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for \nusing the equity method. They are initially recognised at cost, \nand subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial \nstatements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and  \nother comprehensive income of the investees.\nThe interests in joint operations are brought to account recognising \nthe Group’s share of jointly controlled assets; liabilities; expenses; and \nincome from the joint operation.\nA list of the Group’s joint arrangements and associates is included  \nin note 15.\nStatement of compliance\nThe consolidated financial statements are general purpose financial \nstatements which have been prepared in accordance with Australian \nAccounting Standards (including Australian Interpretations) and \nthe Corporations Act 2001. The consolidated financial statements of \nthe Group comply with International Financial Reporting Standards \n(IFRS) and interpretations. The Company is a for-profit entity.\nKey estimates and judgments\nKey accounting estimates and judgments are continually evaluated \nand are based on historical experience and other factors, including \nexpectation of future events that may have a financial impact \non the Group and that are believed to be reasonable under the \ncircumstances.\nThe resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal \nthe subsequent related actual result. The estimates and judgments \nthat have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the \ncarrying amounts of the assets and liabilities within the next financial \nyear are set out in the notes.\nRounding of amounts\nThe Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Legislative Instrument, \nASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/ Directors’ Reports) \nInstrument 2016/191, issued by the Australian Securities and \nInvestments Commission dated 24 March 2016 and, in accordance \nwith that Legislative Instrument, the amounts shown in this report \nand in the financial statements have been rounded, except where \notherwise stated, to the nearest one hundred thousand dollars.\nGlobal economic challenges\nVarious global challenges including inflation, the war in Russia/\nUkraine, global supply chain disruption, tighter global financial \nconditions, renewed Covid-19 outbreaks and lockdown continue to \npose future uncertainties. To date, the negative impact on IPL  \nGroup results has not been significant and no structural changes  \nthat impact the longer term operations and cash flows have  \nbeen identified.  \nStructural Separation\nOn 23 May 2022 the Company announced that it intends to \nimplement a structural separation of its Incitec Pivot Fertilisers and \nDyno Nobel businesses to create two separately listed companies on \nthe Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). There has been no impact \non the financial statements for FY2022 other than the costs incurred \nto date which have been classified as an individually material item  \nand disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.\nAccounting standards issued\nThe Group adopted any amendments to Standards and \nInterpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards  \nBoard (AASB) that are relevant to its operations and effective  \nfor the current year. The adoption of these revised Standards  \nand Interpretations did not have a material impact on the  \nGroup’s result.\nCertain new accounting Standards and Interpretations have  \nbeen issued that are not mandatory for the 30 September 2022 \nreporting period and have not been early adopted by the Group. \nThese Standards and Interpretations are not expected to have a \nmaterial impact on the Group in the current or future reporting \nperiods or on foreseeable future transactions.\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other benchmark \ninterest rates are being replaced by alternative risk-free rates (ARR) \nas part of interbank offer rate (IBOR) reform. USD LIBOR will no \nlonger be published after 30 June 2023. As at 30 September 2022, \nthe Group has not transitioned any of its existing cross currency \nand interest rate swaps to alternative risk-free rates, however it \nis expecting to commence active transition of the existing cross \ncurrency and interest rate swaps portfolio to alternative benchmark \nrates (e.g SOFR benchmark rate) during the first half of FY2023.  \nThe Group is working closely with its Treasury system provider to \nfully manage the transition to alternative benchmark rates.\nThe group has assessed the implication of IBOR reform and expects \nthe impact to be minimal."

Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of \nreturns, trade allowances and amounts collected on behalf of third \nparties. Revenue is recognised for the major business activities on \nthe following basis:\n\t»\nSale of goods and services: revenue from the sale of goods and \nservices is recognised at the point in time when the performance \nobligations under the customer contract are satisfied. This is \ntypically when control of goods or services is transferred to \nthe customer. The fee for the service component is recognised \nseparately from the sale of goods.\n\t»\nTake-or-pay revenue: revenue is recognised in line with the sale \nof goods policy. In circumstances where goods are not taken by \nthe customer, revenue is recognised when the likelihood of the \ncustomer meeting its obligation to ‘take goods’ becomes remote.\n\t»\nInterest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective \ninterest method.\nThe Group disaggregates its revenue per reportable segment as \npresented in note 1, as the revenue within each business unit is \naffected by economic factors in a similar manner.\nGoods and services tax\nRevenues, expenses, assets and liabilities (other than receivables and \npayables) are recognised net of the amount of goods and services \ntax (GST). The only exception is where the amount of GST incurred is \nnot recoverable from the relevant taxation authorities.  \nIn these circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost  \nof the asset or as part of the item of expenditure.\nOther income\nOther income represents gains that are not revenue. This includes \nGovernment grants, royalty income and management fees from \nthe Group’s joint ventures and associates, income from contractual \narrangements that are not considered external sales and \ngovernment grants. IPL received Government grants during the year \nof $48m to fund the increased production of AdBlue at the Gibson \nIsland facility given the shortage in the domestic market. Grant \nincome is recognised as a deduction from the related expense with \nany excess income reported as other income. Government grants \nreceived in advance are recognised on the balance sheet as deferred \nincome and released to the profit and loss once the related expense \nis incurred."

Tax expense is recognised in the profit or \nloss, unless it relates to items that have been recognised in equity (as \npart of other comprehensive income). In this instance, the related tax \nexpense is also recognised in equity.\nCurrent tax\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income  \nfor the year. It is calculated using tax rates applicable at the reporting \ndate, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect  \nof previous years.\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax is recognised for all taxable temporary differences  \nand is calculated based on the carrying amounts of assets and \nliabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used  \nfor taxation purposes. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that \nare expected to be applied when the asset is realised or the liability \nis settled, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively \nenacted at the reporting date.\nDeferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is \nprobable that future taxable profits will be available against which \nthe assets can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each \nreporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer \nprobable that the related tax benefits will be realised.\nOffsetting tax balances\nTax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legal right \nto offset and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the \nasset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nTax consolidation\nFor details on the Company’s tax consolidated group refer  \nto note 23.\nKey estimates and judgments\nUncertain tax matters\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in Australia and foreign \njurisdictions and as a result, the calculation of the Group’s \ntax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgment in \nrespect of certain items. In addition, there are transactions \nand calculations relating to the ordinary course of business for \nwhich the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group \nrecognises liabilities for potential tax audit issues in deferred \ntax liabilities based on management’s assessment of whether \nadditional taxes may be payable and calculates the provision in \naccordance with the applicable accounting standards including \nIFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments. Where the \nfinal tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts \nthat were initially recorded, these differences impact the \ncurrent and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such \ndetermination is made."

For third party sourced goods, cost is net cost  \ninto store.\nTrade and other receivables\nTrade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value \nplus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to \ninitial measurement they are measured at amortised cost less any \nprovisions for expected impairment losses or actual impairment \nlosses. Credit losses and recoveries of items previously written  \noff are recognised in the profit or loss.\nWhere substantially all risks and rewards relating to a receivable  \nare transferred to a third party, the receivable is derecognised.\nTo manage cash inflows which are impacted by seasonality and \ndemand and supply variability, the Group has a nonrecourse \nreceivable purchasing agreement to sell certain receivables to an \nunrelated entity in exchange for cash. As at 30 September 2022, \nreceivables totalling $94.9m (2021: $124.2m) had been sold under \nthis arrangement. The receivables were derecognised upon sale as \nsubstantially all risks and rewards associated with the receivables \npassed to the purchaser.\nTrade and other payables\nTrade and other payables are stated at cost and represent liabilities \nfor goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of \nfinancial year, which are unpaid at the reporting date.\nTo manage the cash flow conversion cycle on some products \nprocured by the Group, and to ensure that suppliers receive payment \nin a time period that suits their business model,  \nthe Group offers some suppliers the opportunity to use supply  \nchain financing. At 30 September 2022, the balance of the supply \nchain finance program was $173.1m (2021: $207.9m). The Group \nevaluates supplier arrangements against a number of indicators \nto assess if the payable continues to have the characteristics of a \ntrade payable or should be classified as borrowings. These indicators \ninclude whether the payment terms exceed customary payment \nterms in the industry. At 30 September 2022, the Group has \nassessed that on balance the payables subject to supplier financing \narrangements did not meet all of the characteristics to be classified \nas borrowings and accordingly the balances remained in trade and \nother payables.\n0.0%\n2.5%\n5.0%\n7.5%\n10.0%\n12.5%\n15.0%\n17.5%\n20.0%\n22.5%\n25.0%\n27.5%\nFY18\nFY19\nFY20\nFY21\nFY22\nExplosives (DNA, DNAP)           Fertilisers         Group\n13 month rolling average trade working capital*/  \nAnnual net revenue"

The provision is for the total \nundistributed dividend amount, regardless of the extent to which \nthe dividend will be paid in cash.\n7. Capital management\nCapital is defined as the amount subscribed by shareholders \nto the Company’s ordinary shares and amounts advanced by \ndebt providers to any Group entity. The Group’s objectives when \nmanaging capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going \nconcern and invest in business growth, while providing returns to \nshareholders and benefits to other stakeholders.\nThe Group’s key strategies for maintenance of an optimal capital \nstructure include:\n\t»\nAiming to maintain an investment grade credit profile and the \nrequisite financial metrics.\n\t»\nSecuring access to diversified sources of debt funding with a \nspread of maturity dates and sufficient undrawn committed \nfacility capacity.\n\t»\nOptimising over the long term, to the extent practicable, \nthe Group’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), while \nmaintaining financial flexibility.\nIn order to optimise its capital structure, the Group may undertake \none or a combination of the following actions:\n\t»\nchange the amount of dividends paid to shareholders and/or \noffer a dividend reinvestment plan with or without a discount \nand/or with or without an underwriting facility  \nwhen appropriate;\n\t»\nreturn capital or issue new shares to shareholders;\n\t»\nvary discretionary capital expenditure;\n\t»\nraise new debt funding or repay existing debt balances; and\n\t»\ndraw down additional debt or sell non-core assets to  \nreduce debt.\nKey financial metrics\nThe Group uses a range of financial metrics to monitor the efficiency \nof its capital structure, including EBITDA interest cover and Net debt/ \nEBITDA before individually material items. Financial metric targets \nare maintained inside debt covenant restrictions. At 30 September \nthe Group’s position in relation to these metrics was:\nTarget range\n2022\n2021\nNet debt/EBITDA (times) (1)\nequal or less than 1.5\n0.5 \n1.1 \nInterest cover (times)\nequal or more than 6.0\n20.3 \n9.7\n(1)  Consistent with IPL debt covenants, net debt does not include trade working capital facilities.  \nThe Group’s capital management framework allows for a short term tolerance of 2.5 times for major \ngrowth opportunities. \n \nThese ratios are impacted by a number of factors, including the level \nof cash retained from operating cash flows generated by the Group \nafter paying all of its commitments (including dividends or other \nreturns of capital), movements in foreign exchange rates, changes \nto market interest rates and the fair value of hedges economically \nhedging the Group’s net debt.\nSelf-insurance\nThe Group also self-insures for certain insurance risks under the \nSingapore Insurance Act. Under this Act, authorised general insurer, \nColtivi Insurance Pte Limited (the Group’s self-insurance company), \nis required to maintain a minimum amount of capital. For the \nfinancial year ended 30 September 2022, Coltivi Insurance Pte \nLimited maintained capital in excess of the minimum requirements \nprescribed under this Act.\nIssued capital\nOrdinary shares\nOrdinary shares issued are classified as equity and are fully paid, have \nno par value and carry one vote per share and the right to dividends. \nIncremental costs directly attributable to the issue of  \nnew shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of  \nany related income tax benefit.\nIssued capital as at 30 September 2022 amounted to $3,806.2m \n(1,942,225,029 ordinary shares)."

Short term (12 months or less) and low value leases are \nrecognised in the profit or loss as a lease expense.\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated \ndepreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any \nremeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets \nincludes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs \nincurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement \ndate less any lease incentive received. Right-of-use assets are \ndepreciated on a straight line basis in the profit or loss over the lease \nterm.\nLease liabilities are recognised by the Group at the commencement \ndate of the lease and are measured at the present value of lease \npayments to be made over the lease term. Lease payments include \nfixed payments and variable lease payments that depend on an \nindex or rate.\n \nKey estimates and judgments\nExtension options - The Group considers whether an option  \nto extend a lease is reasonably certain on a lease-by-lease \nbasis, which considers the importance of the lease to the \nGroup’s operations and its economic incentive to extend the \nlease. The lease term is reassessed upon the occurrence of  \na significant event or change in circumstance. \nIncremental borrowing rate – To calculate the present  \nvalue of lease payments, the Group uses an incremental \nborrowing rate at the commencement date of the lease.  \nThe incremental borrowing rate reflects the duration and  \nthe financing characteristics of the lease. Where the interest \nrate implicit in the lease is not readily available, the Group \nuses its incremental borrowing rate applicable to a portfolio of \nleases with reasonably similar characteristics."

Additional \nimpairment of $209.9m in relation to the Cheyenne and Gibson \nIsland facilities was recognised as an Individually Material Item  \nin the prior year.\nKey accounting policies\nImpairment testing\nThe identification of impairment indicators involves management \njudgment. Where an indicator of impairment is identified, a \nformal impairment assessment is performed. The Group’s annual \nimpairment testing determines whether the recoverable amount \nof a CGU or group of CGUs, to which goodwill and/or indefinite life \nintangible assets are allocated, exceeds its carrying amount.\nA CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash \nflows largely independent of cash flows of other groups of assets. \nGoodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets are allocated to \nCGUs or groups of CGUs which are no larger than one of the Group’s \nreportable segments.\nDetermining the recoverable amount\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is determined as the higher of its \nfair value less cost of disposal and its value-in-use. Value-in-use  \nis a term that means an asset’s value based on the expected future \ncash flows arising from its continued use in its current condition, \ndiscounted to present value. For discounting purposes, a post-tax \nrate is used that reflects current market assessments of the risks \nspecific to the asset. The Group has prepared value-in-use models for \nthe purpose of impairment testing as at 30 September 2022, using \nfive year discounted cash flow models based on Board approved \nforecasts. Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated \nusing a terminal value growth rate.\nTransition of the world’s energy systems and sustainability forms part \nof our strategy and these have been considered in the market data \nutilised to assess growth rates for each CGU.\nImpairment losses\nAn impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount \nof an asset (or its CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount.  \nImpairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss.\nImpairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated \nagainst assets in the following order:\n\t»\nFirstly, against the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated  \nto the CGU.\n\t»\nSecondly, against the carrying amount of any remaining assets  \nin the CGU.\nAn impairment loss recognised in a prior period for an asset (or \nits CGU) other than goodwill may be reversed only if there has \nbeen a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable \namount of the asset (or its CGU) since the last impairment loss was \nrecognised. When this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset \n(or its CGU) is increased to its recoverable amount.\nSensitivity analyses\nIncluded in the table below is a sensitivity analysis of the recoverable amounts of the CGUs and, where applicable, the impairment  \ncharge considering reasonable change scenarios relating to key assumptions at 30 September 2022.\nEach of the sensitivities below assumes that a specific assumption moves in isolation, while all other assumptions are held constant.  \nA change in one assumption could be accompanied by a change in another assumption, which may increase or decrease the  \nnet impact.\nPost-tax \ndiscount \nrate\nTerminal \nvalue \ngrowth rate\nNatural  \ngas price\n+0.5%\n-1.0%\n+AU$1 per \ngigajoule\nDNAP\nAU$mill\nAU$mill\nAU$mill\nChange in \nrecoverable amount\n(199.7)\n(303.3)\n(69.1)\nImpairment charge\n–\n(33.8)\n–\nPost-tax \ndiscount \nrate\nAmmonia \nprice\nTerminal \nvalue growth \nrate\nNatural gas \nprice\n+0.5%\n-US$50  \nper tonne\n-1.0%\n+US$1  \nper mmbtu\nDNA\nUS$mill\nUS$mill\nUS$mill\nUS$mill\nChange in \nrecoverable amount\n(392.2)\n(389.5)\n(594.2)\n(270.5)\nImpairment charge\n–\n–\n–\n–\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: Capital investment\nFor the year ended 30 September 2022\nPost-tax  \ndiscount rate\nAUD:USD  \nexchange rate\nTerminal value \ngrowth rate\nDAP  \nPrice\nNatural gas  \nprice\nPost-tax  \ndiscount rate\nTerminal value  \ngrowth rate\n+0.5%\n+5c\n-1.0%\n-US$50  \nper tonne\n+AUD1 per \ngigajoule\n+0.5%\n-1.0%\nFertilisers APAC\nAU$mill\nAU$mill\nAU$mill\nAU$mill\nAU$mill\nTitanobel\nEUR €mill \nEUR €mill \nChange in \nrecoverable amount\n(123.2)\n(445.6)\n(182.5)\n(653.0)\n(58.8)\nChange in \nrecoverable amount\n(9.4)\n(14.3)\nImpairment charge\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\nImpairment charge\n–\n–"

IPL’s ownership interest in Australian Bio Fert Pty Ltd is 64% as at 30 September 2022 with \n36% representing the non-controlling equity interest. The purchase price and goodwill recognised at acquisition was immaterial.\nTitanobel\nOn 28 April 2022, the Group acquired 100% of the equity of Explinvest, the holding company of the Titanobel Group (Titanobel) for an upfront \npayment of €77m. This acquisition is highly complementary to Dyno Nobel’s existing operations and provides access to new markets where \nDyno Nobel can leverage its premium technology offering through substitution and growth strategies. Titanobel is a leading industrial \nexplosives manufacturer and drilling, blasting and technical services provider based in France.

Given the timing of the acquisition, further work  \nis required to determine the final fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, the finalisation of these fair values will be \ncompleted in FY23.

      "text": "FINANCIAL REPORT\n110\nIncitec Pivot Limited Annual Report 2022\nKey accounting policies\nProvisions are measured at management’s estimate of the \nexpenditure required to settle the obligation. This estimate is based \non a “present value” calculation, which involves the application of \na discount rate to the expected future cash flows associated with \nsettlement. The discount rate takes into account factors such as risks \nspecific to the liability and the time value of money.\nEmployee entitlements\nProvisions are made for liabilities to employees for annual leave, long \nservice leave and other employee entitlements. Where the payment \nto employees is expected to take place in 12 months  \ntime or later, a present value calculation is performed. In this \ninstance, the corporate bond rate is used to discount the liability  \nto its present value.\nRestructuring and rationalisation\nProvisions for restructuring or rationalisation are only recognised \nwhen a detailed plan has been approved and the restructuring or \nrationalisation has either commenced or been publicly announced.\nEnvironmental\nProvisions relating to the remediation of soil, groundwater, untreated \nwaste and other environmental contamination are made when \nthe Group has an obligation to carry out the clean-up operation as \na result of a past event. In addition, a provision will only be made \nwhere it is possible to reliably estimate the costs involved.\nAsset retirement\nIn certain circumstances, the Group has an obligation to dismantle \nand remove an asset and to restore the site on which it is  \nlocated. The present value of the estimated costs of this process  \nis recognised as part of the asset that is depreciated and also as  \na provision.\nAt each reporting date, the provision is remeasured in line with \nchanges in discount rates and the timing and amount of future \nestimated cash flows. Any changes in the provision are added to or \ndeducted from the related asset, other than changes associated with \nthe passage of time. This is recognised as a borrowing cost in the \nprofit or loss.\nLegal and other\nThere are a number of legal claims and other exposures, including \nclaims for damages arising from products and services supplied  \nby the Group, that arise from the ordinary course of business.  \nA provision is only made where it is probable that a payment  \nor restitution will be required and the costs involved can be  \nreliably estimated.\nFor example, in April 2022, a jury awarded damages of US$46.75m \n(comprising punitive damages US$30m and compensatory damages \nUS$16.75m) to a plaintiff in a personal injury legal case in the DNA \nbusiness in relation to a nitrogen oxide release at one of its plants in \n2015. In relation to this particular matter, the Company intends to \nvigorously pursue all available review and appeal rights.\nKey estimates and judgments\nProvisions are based on the Group’s estimate of the timing \nand value of outflows of resources required to settle or satisfy \ncommitments and liabilities known to the Group at the \nreporting date.\nContingencies\nThe following contingent liabilities are considered unlikely. However \nthe directors consider they should be disclosed:\n\t»\nUnder the terms of the ASIC Legislative Instrument, ASIC \nCorporations (Wholly-owned Companies) Instrument 2016/785, \nissued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission \ndated 17 December 2016, which relieved certain wholly-owned \nsubsidiaries from the requirement to prepare audited financial \nstatements, IPL and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries (identified \nin note 15) have entered into an approved deed for the cross \nguarantee of liabilities. No additional liabilities subject to the \nDeed of Cross Guarantee at 30 September 2022 are expected  \nto arise to IPL or the relevant subsidiaries.\n\t»\nThe Group is regularly subject to investigations and audit \nactivities by the revenue authorities of jurisdictions in which the \nGroup operates. The outcome of these investigations and audits \ndepends upon several factors which may result in further tax \npayments or refunds of tax payments already made by the Group \nover and above existing provisions. Refer to note 3 for further \ndetails.\n\t»\nContingent liabilities arise in the normal course of business \nand include a number of legal claims, environmental cleanup \nrequirements and bank guarantees.\nThe Directors are of the opinion that no additional provisions are \nrequired in respect of these matters, as it is either not probable  \nthat a future sacrifice of economic benefits will be required or  \nthe amount is not capable of reliable measurement.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: Risk management\nFor the year ended 30 September 2022\n17.

Financial risk management\nThe Group is exposed to financial risks including liquidity risk, market risk and credit risk. This note explains the Group’s financial risk exposures \nand its objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing these risks.\nThe Board of Directors (the Board) has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.\nThe Board established the Audit and Risk Management Committee (ARMC) which is responsible for, amongst other things, the monitoring of \nthe Group’s risk management plans. The ARMC is assisted in its oversight role by the Group’s Risk Management function. The Risk Management \nfunction performs reviews of the Group’s risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the ARMC. The ARMC \nreports regularly to the Board on its activities.\nThe Group’s financial risk management framework includes policies to identify, analyse and manage the Group’s financial risks.

Credit \nlimits are established and monitored for each customer, and these \nlimits represent the highest level of exposure that a customer can \nreach. Trade credit insurance is purchased when required.\nThe Group mitigates credit risk from financial instrument contracts \nby only entering into transactions with counterparties that have \nsound credit ratings and, where applicable, with whom the Group \nhas a signed netting agreement. Given their high credit ratings, \nthe Group does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its \nobligations.\nCredit risk exposure\nThe Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at 30 September is the \ncarrying amount, net of any provision for impairment, of the financial \nassets as detailed in the table below:\n2022 \n$mill\n2021 \n$mill\nTrade and other receivables\n785.3 \n517.0\nCash and cash equivalents\n763.5 \n651.8\nDerivative assets\n37.3 \n86.0\n1,586.1 \n1,254.8\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities that are subject to \nenforceable master netting arrangements and are intended to be \nsettled on a net basis are offset in the Statement of Financial Position. \nAt 30 September 2022, the amount netted in other financial assets \nand other financial liabilities is $79.8m (2021: nil).\nFair value\nFair value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities is calculated \nusing a variety of techniques depending on the type of financial \ninstrument as follows:\n\t»\nThe fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities traded  \nin active markets (such as equity securities and fixed interest rate \nbonds) is the quoted market price at the reporting date.\n\t»\nThe fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities not traded \nin active markets is calculated using discounted cash flows. Future \ncash flows are calculated based on observable forward interest \nrates and foreign exchange rates.\n\t»\nThe fair value of forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, \ncross currency interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and forward \ncontracts is calculated using discounted cash flows, reflecting \nthe credit risk of various counterparties. Future cash flows are \ncalculated based on the contract rate, observable forward interest \nrates and foreign exchange rates.\n\t»\nThe fair value of option contracts is calculated using the contract \nrates and observable market rates at the end of the reporting \nperiod, reflecting the credit risk of various counterparties.\nThe valuation technique is consistent with the Black-Scholes \nmethodology and utilises Monte Carlo simulations.\n\t»\nThe fair value of commodity swaps and commodity forward \ncontracts is calculated using their quoted market price, where \navailable. If a quoted market price is not available, then fair value \nis calculated using discounted cash flows. Future cash flows are \nestimated based on the difference between the contractual price \nand the current observable market price, reflecting the credit risk \nof various counterparties. These future cash flows  \nare then discounted to present value.\n\t»\nThe nominal value less expected credit losses of trade receivables \nand payables are assumed to approximate  \ntheir fair values due to their short term maturity.\nFair value hierarchy\nThe table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair  \nvalue by valuation method. The different levels have been  \ndefined as follows:\n\t»\nLevel 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets  \nfor identical assets or liabilities.\n\t»\nLevel 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within  \nLevel 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly \n(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n\t»\nLevel 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based  \non observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n2022\nLevel 1 \n$mill\nLevel 2 \n$mill\nLevel 3 \n$mill\nDerivative financial assets\n– \n37.3 \n– \nDerivative financial liabilities\n– \n(152.6)\n– \nInvestment in Equity Instrument\n– \n– \n–  \n2021\nLevel 1 \n$mill\nLevel 2 \n$mill\nLevel 3 \n$mill\nDerivative financial assets\n–\n86.0\n–\nDerivative financial liabilities\n–\n(93.5)\n–\nInvestment in Equity Instrument\n–\n–\n3.0\nFair value of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost\nCash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and trade \nand other payables are carried at amortised cost which equals their \nfair value.\nInterest bearing liabilities are carried at amortised cost and have  \na carrying value of $1,712.0m (2021: $1,668.8m) – refer to note 8.  \nThe fair value of the interest bearing financial liabilities at  \n30 September 2022 was $1,655.0m (2021: $1,763.5m) and was based \non the level 2 valuation methodology.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: Risk management\nFor the year ended 30 September 2022"

      "text": "FINANCIAL REPORT\n118\nIncitec Pivot Limited Annual Report 2022\nKey accounting policies\nForeign currency transactions and balances\nThe Group presents its accounts in Australian dollars. Foreign \ncurrency transactions are translated into Australian dollars using  \nthe exchange rates at the date the transaction occurs.\nMonetary assets (such as trade receivables) and liabilities (such as \ntrade creditors) denominated in foreign currencies are translated \ninto Australian dollars using the exchange rate at 30 September. \nNon-monetary items (for example, plant and machinery) that  \nare measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not  \nre-translated.\nForeign exchange gains and losses relating to transactions are \nrecognised in the profit or loss with the exception of gains and losses \narising from cash flow hedges and net investment hedges that are \nrecognised in other comprehensive income.\nForeign operations\nThe assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are \ntranslated at applicable exchange rates at 30 September. Income and \nexpense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the \nperiod.\nForeign exchange gains and losses arising on translation are \nrecognised in the foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR).  \nIf and when the Group disposes of the foreign operation, these gains \nand losses are transferred from the FCTR to the profit or loss.\nDerivatives and hedging\nThe Group uses contracts known as derivative financial instruments \nto hedge its financial risk exposures.\nOn entering into a hedging relationship, the Group formally \ndesignates and documents details of the hedge, risk management \nobjective and strategy for entering into the arrangement. The Group \napplies hedge accounting to hedging relationships that are expected \nto be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value, i.e. where the \ncash flows arising from the hedge instrument closely match the cash \nflows arising from the hedged item.\nHedge accounting is discontinued when:\n\t»\nThe hedging relationship no longer meets the risk  \nmanagement objective.\n\t»\nThe hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated  \nor exercised.\n\t»\nThe hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.\nDerivatives are measured at fair value. The accounting treatment \napplied to specific types of hedges is set out below.\nCash flow hedges\nChanges in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges are \nrecognised in equity, in the cash flow hedge reserve. To the  \nextent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are \nrecognised in the profit or loss.\nFair value gains or losses accumulated in the reserve are taken  \nto profit or loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss.  \nWhen the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount \nrecognised in the reserve is transferred to the carrying amount  \nof the asset when the asset is purchased.\nNet investment hedges\nHedges of a net investment in a foreign operation are accounted for \nin a similar way as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective \nportion of the hedge are recognised directly in equity (in the FCTR) \nwhile any gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are \nrecognised in the profit or loss.\nOn disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of gains \nor losses recognised in the FCTR are transferred to profit or loss.\nFair value hedges\nThe change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the \nchange in the hedged item are recognised in the profit or loss.\nHedge ineffectiveness\nThe Group aims to transact only highly effective hedge relationships, \nand in most cases the hedging instruments have a 1:1 hedge  \nratio with the hedged items. However, at times, some hedge \nineffectiveness can arise and is recognised in profit or loss in the \nperiod in which it occurs. Key sources of hedge ineffectiveness for \nthe Group are as follows:\n\t»\nMaturity dates of hedging instruments not matching the maturity \ndates of the hedged items.\n\t»\nCredit risk inherent within the hedging instrument not matching \nthe movement in the hedged item.\n\t»\nInterest rates of the Group’s financing facilities not matching the \ninterest rates of the hedging instrument.\n\t»\nForecast transactions not occurring.\nClassification of financial instruments\nFinancial instruments are classified into the following categories:\n\t»\nAmortised cost (cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing \nliabilities and trade and other receivables and payables).\n\t»\nFair value through other comprehensive income  \n(listed equity securities).\n\t»\nFair value through profit or loss (derivative financial instruments \nexcept those that are in a designated hedge relationship).\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: Risk management\nFor the year ended 30 September 2022"

The total dividend payment will be $330.2m. \nOn 15 November 2022, IPL also announced that it intends to \nundertake an on-market share buy back of up to $400m.  \nThe proposed share buy back will be conducted in the ordinary \ncourse of trading and the exact amount and timing of share \npurchases will be dependent on regulatory requirements and  \nmarket conditions. \nStrategic review of WALA and implications for \nstructural separation of the Explosives and \nFertilisers businesses \nOn 15 November 2022, IPL announced that it has received a number \nof unsolicited approaches in relation to a potential acquisition of its \nammonia manufacturing facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana, \nUSA (WALA). The Company will undertake a review of the strategic \noptions for WALA in the near-term. Under any scenario, IPL intends \nto maintain the strategic value of long-term supply of ammonia from \nWALA into the Dyno Nobel Americas business. An estimate of the \nfinancial impact cannot be made at this point.\nThe strategic review process will have implications for the timing of \nthe proposed structural separation of the Incitec Pivot Fertilisers and \nDyno Nobel businesses which was announced on 23 May 2022.  \nIt is currently anticipated that the previously communicated target \ncompletion date for the separation of early 2023 will likely be \nextended by 6-12 months, pending the completion of the strategic \nreview process for WALA.

Our responsibilities under those \nstandards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report section of our \nreport. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the \nCorporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional & Ethical Standards Board’s \nAPES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are \nrelevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia.

The Group \nhas prepared a value-in-use model to \ndetermine the recoverable amount of each \nCGU.  \nThe Group’s Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific \n(‘DNAP’) model is highly sensitive to \nchanges in terminal value assumptions, \nincluding natural gas prices, commodity \nprices, terminal value growth rate and \ndiscount rate. \nForecast assumptions used in assessing the \nrecoverable \namount \nincorporate \nmanagement’s estimates of the potential \nimpacts \nof \nclimate \nchange \nthrough \nsustainability projects and de-carbonisation \ninitiatives which are subject to judgement.  \nGiven the sensitivities of the terminal value \nassumptions in the DNAP model, we \nconsider this to be a Key Audit Matter. \n \nOur procedures included, but were not limited to: \n• Understanding the relevant controls and process that \nmanagement has undertaken to assess the recoverable \namount \n• In conjunction with our valuation specialists:   \no Evaluating the appropriateness of the model used by \nmanagement to calculate the value-in-use of the CGUs. \no Assessing and challenging the key inputs to the DNAP \nmodel and terminal value by:  \n§ Corroborating the key independent market based \nassumptions built into the terminal value to \nexternal analysts’ reports, published industry \ngrowth rates and industry reports, considering the \npotential impacts of climate change, where \napplicable; \n§ Corroborating \nthe \nkey \nnon-market \nbased \nassumptions, \nincluding \ncash \nflows \nfrom \nsustainability projects and other Board approved \nclimate \nand \nde-carbonisation \ninitiatives, \nby \ncomparing Board approved forecasts to historical \nperformance to test the accuracy of management’s \nforecasts; \n§ Agreeing \ncontracted \nvolumes \nand \npricing \nassumptions in the model to the Board approved \nforecasts; \n§ Comparing the discount rates applied to the \nterminal value with an independently developed \nrate; and \n§ Performing a range of sensitivity analysis on the key \nassumptions in the terminal value including \ndiscount rates, natural gas prices, commodity \nprices and foreign exchange rates used in the cash \nflow forecasts. \nWe have also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures \nincluded in the Notes 9, 11 and 12 to the financial statements. \nOther Information  \nThe directors are responsible for the other information.

Misstatements \ncan arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably \nbe expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report. \nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and \nmaintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:   \n• \nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or \nerror, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is \nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material \nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve \ncollusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  \n \n• \nObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that \nare appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the \neffectiveness of the Group’s internal control.  \n \n• \nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates \nand related disclosures made by the directors.  \n \n• \nConclude on the appropriateness of the director’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to \nthe related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. \nOur conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. \nHowever, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.  \n \n• \nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, \nand whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \nachieves fair presentation.  \n \n• \nObtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for \nthe direction, supervision and performance of the Group’s audit. We remain solely responsible for our \naudit opinion."
