      "text": "To our valued shareholders,  \n2022 was another positive year for HCA Healthcare. Our 182 \nhospitals and approximately 2,300 ambulatory sites of care cared \nfor more than 37 million patients. Our people, nearly 294,000 \ncolleagues and 45,000 physicians on our medical staff, fulfilled \nour core mission by continuing to show up and deliver high-\nquality healthcare services to our communities. \nThe impact of COVID-19 continued to significantly influence the \nhealthcare industry; however, HCA Healthcare performed well \nby balancing local needs while also developing more enterprise \ncapabilities to support our local networks. As leaders, our actions \nwere informed by lessons learned during the pandemic: the \nimportance of setting clear priorities; the power of teamwork \nand partnerships; the significance of timely decision-making \nand execution; and communicating timely and transparently to \nour stakeholders. \nThe aftermath of the pandemic created a number of industry-\nwide challenges. There has been a clear disruption in the \nlabor market; inflationary pressures have driven up costs; and \ncapacity constraints have affected the ability to meet patient \ndemand. To address these matters, our teams continued to \nincorporate financial resiliency measures while focusing on four \nkey areas: recruitment, retention, new care models, and capacity \nmanagement. These initiatives will carry us into 2023. \nFinancially, we ended the year in a solid position. Our revenues \nfor the year totaled $60.2 billion, a 2.5% increase from 2021. \nWe generated $8.5 billion in cash flows from operations, \nproviding us with the capacity to execute a balanced approach to \ncapital allocation. \n•  As you see later in this letter, we invested substantial \namounts of capital into our facilities. \n•  We repurchased $7 billion, or over 30 million shares, of \ncommon stock. \n•  We increased our quarterly dividend by 17% over 2021. \nAdditionally, we generated over $1.2 billion of pre-tax proceeds \nfrom divestitures. And, as a taxpaying healthcare provider, we \nincurred approximately $5.6 billion of federal, state, and local \ntaxes, including $2.3 billion of income, property, and sales and \nuse taxes. \nAbove all else, we are \ncommitted to the care and \nimprovement of human life. \nHCA Healthcare’s  \n182 hospitals are supported \nby approximately 2,300  \nambulatory sites of care in 20  \nstates and the U.K., including:  \n126 \nsurgery centers \n130 \nfreestanding \nemergency rooms \n1,616\nphysician practices \n270 \nurgent care clinics \n43 \nhome health and\n hospice agencies \n61 \nbehavioral health \nsites of care \nLearn more about our collective impact \nat HCAhealthcareImpact.com. \n*As of Dec. 31, 2022 \n1"

      "text": "Most importantly, we stayed true to our \nmission and values – caring for our patients, \npeople, and communities. \n•  We cared for over 2 million inpatient \nadmissions, almost 9 million emergency room \nvisits, over 1.5 million surgical procedures and \nover 200,000 deliveries. \n•  25% of our admissions and 48% of our \nemergency room visits were for the treatment \nof patients who were either uninsured or \ncovered under Medicaid. \n•  We provided uncompensated care at an \nestimated cost of $3.5 billion. \nWe believe HCA Healthcare is poised to meet \ntoday's challenges and take advantage of the \nopportunities before us. \nOn the workforce front, HCA Healthcare made \ninvestments in our people this past year. Overall, \nwe believe our workforce initiatives are starting \nto take hold. This past year, we increased \nour investment in recruitment to help hire \napproximately 105,000 colleagues. \nTo further bolster our nursing development \nprograms, HCA Healthcare opened seven more \nGalen College of Nursing schools. We expect \nto open more schools in 2023. HCA Healthcare \nhas more than 93,000 registered nurses holding \npositions from bedside caregivers to leadership \nroles in various healthcare settings and at every \nlevel throughout the organization. Bringing Galen \ninto the HCA Healthcare family was designed \nto combine two leading nursing organizations \nto increase access to nursing education \nand to provide nursing career development \nopportunities for HCA Healthcare colleagues. \nIn 2022, HCA Healthcare invested more than \n$135 million in our clinical education programs, \nincluding centers for clinical advancement. These \ninvestments enhance the learning environment \nfor our people so we can advance nursing care for \nour patients. Workforce development remains a \ntop priority. We anticipate more investments in \nthese areas in the future. \nAs part of our workforce development initiatives \nand to help with the country’s issue of physician \nshortages, HCA Healthcare has become a \nsignificant provider of medical education. We \nhave 320 Accreditation Council for Graduate \nMedical Education (ACGME) programs, more \nthan 5,300 residents and fellows, and 66 teaching \nhospitals across 16 states. \nIn addition to growing the pipeline of physicians \nand nurses, it's important that we continue \nto upgrade our facilities to meet the growing \ndemand for healthcare. In 2022, HCA Healthcare \ninvested $4.4 billion in our existing facilities. \nThat’s the most HCA Healthcare has ever \ninvested in our capital spending in a single year. \nThese investments provide us with expanded \ncapacity, advanced clinical technology, and better \nfacilities for our patients.  \nAs part of our capital spending, we continued \nto expand our outpatient network in key markets. \nFor example, in 2022, HCA Healthcare purchased \nMD Now Urgent Care, a network of 59 urgent \ncare centers in Florida, which was one of \nthe largest urgent care acquisitions in the \nhealthcare industry. \nAdding MD Now Urgent Care in Florida enhances \nour already strong capabilities in a rapidly \ngrowing state by providing convenient outpatient \ncare options for our patients. It also connects \nMD Now patients to a comprehensive statewide \nnetwork of care, including acute care and \nspecialty services, should they be needed. \n2"

We \nwere also recognized for the second consecutive \nyear on the 2022 LinkedIn Top Companies \nranking, an annual list that helps professionals \nidentify the top workplaces to grow their careers. \nAdditionally, we were named by Military Times as \none of the country's best employers based on the \ncompany's efforts to recruit, retain, and support \ncurrent and former service members, military \nspouses, and military caregivers. \nAs an organization, we have programs and \ninitiatives that underscore our strong sense of \npurpose to do what is right for our patients, \ncolleagues, and the communities we serve, and \nthese awards reflect that culture. As a result, \nand thanks to our clinical staff's hard work and \ndedication this past year, in the fall 2022, \nmore than 80% of our hospitals rated by The \nLeapfrog Group received an \"A\" or \"B\" Leapfrog \nSafety Score. \nOn the innovation front, HCA Healthcare’s \nCare Transformation and Innovation (CT&I) \ndepartment is working to deliver the healthcare \nof the future and support our care teams. For \nexample, this past year, we launched a pilot in \nthe Labor and Delivery (L&D) space – \"Staff \nScheduler.\" The Staff Scheduler system predicts \nstaffing needs based on a machine-learning \nalgorithm, measures the difficulty of procedures, \nand improves staffing according to proficiencies \nand preferences. Since the pilot launched, we \nhave saved time, improved staffing to meet our \npatients' needs, and increased nurse satisfaction. \nCT&I’s work to identify, build, and roll out new \ntechnology solutions and innovative processes \nshould create better outcomes and experiences \nfor our care teams and patients. We look forward \nto sharing more of their work. \nTo further enhance our technology, we decided \nto update our clinical systems. This updated \nclinical system is designed to provide \nHCA Healthcare clinicians with an intuitive, \nmobile user interface, personalized to our \nworkflows. In addition, we expect it will allow us \nto standardize our data sets more effectively and \nutilize cloud-based analytics to support better \nclinical decisions, improve efficiencies, and create \na safer environment for our patients.  \nAnd as we continue to innovate and integrate \ntechnology into patient care, we are partnering \nwith organizations that share our common goal. \nFor example, we recently partnered with \nMcKesson Corporation to form an oncology \nresearch joint venture combining McKesson's  \nU.S. Oncology Research (USOR) and  \nHCA Healthcare's Sarah Cannon Research \nInstitute (SCRI). Together, USOR and SCRI  \ncreate a fully integrated oncology research \norganization with goals to expand clinical \nresearch, accelerate drug development, and \nincrease availability and access to clinical trials for \ncommunity oncology providers and patients. In \naddition, this joint venture with McKesson, which \nunifies our oncology research experts, is intended \nto promote the development of individualized \ntherapies and provide more opportunities for \ncancer patients to receive new treatments. \n3"

Our human resources and \nsupply chain teams deployed on-site mini-marts, \nfuel stations, showers, and laundry services in \nFlorida to assist facilities, colleagues, and nearby \nhealth systems in need. In addition, the \nHCA Healthcare Hope Fund received 776 \napplications from colleagues, with more than \n$1.2 million being provided to colleagues \nimpacted by the hurricane. We are incredibly \nproud of how our Florida colleagues responded \nbefore, during, and in the wake of Hurricane Ian. \nFurthermore, HCA Healthcare and the \nHCA Healthcare Foundation showed up \nand supported several organizations in our \ncommunities throughout the year. For example, \nthe Foundation committed approximately $1.38 \nmillion over three years to the Girl Scouts of the \nUSA to provide mental wellness workshops to \ngirls in grades 4-12 nationwide, over $350,000 \nto Kentucky flood relief efforts, $600,000 \nto Volunteers of America over two years to \npromote mental wellbeing and resiliency for first \nresponders and front-line caregivers, $250,000 \nto the American Red Cross to support disaster \nrelief and preparedness nationwide, and more. \nThrough the HCA Healthcare Foundation’s \nHealthier Tomorrow Fund, we are also \naligning with strategic partners who share our \ngoal of creating a more diverse pipeline of \nhealthcare leaders. \nThe HCA Healthcare Foundation also committed \nto donating $1.35 million over the next three \nyears to Educate Texas, an initiative of the \nCommunities Foundation of Texas. This grant \naims to increase access to student programs \nthat enable healthcare careers, including \nhigh schools in Texas that offer Pathways in \nTechnology Early College High School (P-TECH) \nhealthcare career tracks. \nWe also continued our commitment to support \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities \n(HBCUs) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions \n(HSIs) in communities near our hospitals. As \npart of this commitment, we are investing $1.5 \nmillion to Florida International University's \nNicole Wertheim College of Nursing & Health \nSciences (NWCNHS) to address the national \nnursing shortage.

As of January 1, 2023, we have a new operating model that includes a chief operating \nofficer, an additional senior vice president-finance, and three operating groups with five domestic \ndivisions each. The new organizational design reflects a structure that is intended to align better with our \nstrategy, streamline areas that can improve long-term performance, and provide greater focus and better \ncoordination in supporting our business.

At December 31, \n2022, we operated 182 hospitals, comprised of 175 general, acute care hospitals; five psychiatric hospitals; and two \nrehabilitation hospitals. In addition, we operated 126 freestanding surgery centers and 21 freestanding endoscopy centers. \nOur facilities are located in 20 states and England. \nThe terms “Company,” “HCA,” “HCA Healthcare,” “we,” “our” or “us,” as used herein and unless otherwise stated \nor indicated by context, refer to HCA Healthcare, Inc. and its affiliates.

Most \nof our general, acute care hospitals provide medical and surgical services, including inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac \ncare, diagnostic services and emergency services. The general, acute care hospitals also provide outpatient services such \nas outpatient surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy, cardiology and physical therapy. Each hospital has an \norganized medical staff and a local board of trustees or governing board comprised of members of the local community. \nAt December 31, 2022, we operated five psychiatric hospitals with 593 licensed beds. Our psychiatric hospitals \nprovide therapeutic programs, including child, adolescent and adult psychiatric care and adolescent and adult alcohol and \ndrug abuse treatment and counseling. \nWe also operate outpatient health care facilities, which include freestanding ambulatory surgery centers (“ASCs”), \nfreestanding emergency care facilities, urgent care facilities, walk-in clinics, diagnostic and imaging centers, \ncomprehensive rehabilitation and physical therapy centers, radiation and oncology therapy centers, physician practices \nand various other facilities. These outpatient services are an integral component of our strategy to develop comprehensive \nhealth care networks in select communities. Most of our ASCs are operated through partnerships or limited liability \ncompanies, with majority ownership of each partnership or limited liability company typically held by a general partner \nor member that is an affiliate of HCA. \nCertain of our affiliates provide a variety of management services to our health care facilities, including patient \nsafety programs, ethics and compliance programs, national supply contracts, equipment purchasing and leasing contracts, \naccounting, financial and clinical systems, governmental reimbursement assistance, construction planning and \ncoordination, information technology systems and solutions, legal counsel, human resources services and internal audit \nservices. \nCOVID-19 \nWe believe the extent of COVID-19’s impact on our operating results and financial condition has been and could \ncontinue to be driven by many factors, most of which are beyond our control and ability to forecast. Because of these \nuncertainties, we cannot estimate how long or to what extent COVID-19 will impact our operations. \n4"

Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us \nor that we currently deem immaterial may also affect us. If any of these risks occur, our business, financial position, \nresults of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially, adversely affected. Our business is subject to the \nfollowing principal risks and uncertainties: \nRisks related to COVID-19 and other potential pandemics: \n•  \nCOVID-19 has affected, and may continue to affect, our operations. Further, COVID-19 could negatively \nimpact our business, financial condition, and cash flows, particularly if it causes public health conditions \nand/or economic conditions to deteriorate. \n•  \nWe are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the CARES Act (as defined below) and other stimulus and \nrelief legislation or the effect that such legislation and other governmental responses intended to assist \nproviders in responding to COVID-19 may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations \nor cash flows. \n•  \nThe emergence and effects related to a potential future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious \ndisease could adversely affect our operations. \nRisks related to our indebtedness: \n•  \nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, \nlimit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the \nextent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations. \n•  \nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may not be able to \nrefinance our indebtedness on favorable terms. If we are unable to do so, we may be forced to take other \nactions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. \n•  \nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. \nRisks related to human capital: \n•  \nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by competition for staffing, the shortage of experienced \nnurses and other health care professionals and labor union activity. \n•  \nWe may be unable to attract, hire and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce, including key \nmanagement. \n•  \nOur performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians. \nRisks related to technology, data privacy and cybersecurity: \n•  \nA cybersecurity incident or other form of data breach could result in the compromise of our facilities, \nconfidential data or critical data systems. A cybersecurity incident or other form of data breach could also \ngive rise to potential harm to patients; remediation and other expenses; and exposure to liability under \nHIPAA (as defined below), consumer protection laws, common law theories or other laws. Such incidents \ncould subject us to litigation and foreign, federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, \nand otherwise be disruptive to our business. \n•  \nOur operations could be impaired by a failure of our information systems. \n•  \nHealth care technology initiatives, particularly those related to sharing patient data and interoperability, may \nadversely affect our operations. \n•  \nWe may not be reimbursed for the cost of expensive, new technology. \nRisks related to governmental regulation and other legal matters: \n•  \nOur business and results of operations may be adversely affected by health care reform efforts. We are \nunable to predict whether, what, and when additional health reform measures will be adopted or \nimplemented, and the effects and ultimate impact of any such measures are uncertain and may adversely \naffect our business and results of operations. \n5"

Medicaid is a \nfederal-state program, administered by the states, that provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying low-income \nindividuals. All of our general, acute care hospitals located in the United States are eligible to participate in Medicare and \nMedicaid programs. Amounts received under Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than \nestablished hospital gross charges for the services provided. \nOur hospitals generally offer discounts from established charges to certain group purchasers of health care services, \nincluding private health insurers, employers, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), preferred provider \norganizations (“PPOs”) and other managed care plans, including health plans offered through the Exchanges. These \ndiscount programs generally limit our ability to increase revenues in response to increasing costs. See Item 1, “Business \n— Competition.” For services under Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans, patients are \ngenerally responsible for any exclusions, deductibles or coinsurance features of their coverage. The amounts of such \nexclusions, deductibles and coinsurance continue to increase. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically \nmore difficult than from government health care programs or other third-party payers. We provide discounts to uninsured \npatients who do not qualify for Medicaid or for financial relief under our charity care policy. We may attempt to provide \nassistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance \nor charity care under our charity care policy. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured \ndiscount is applied. \nMedicare \nIn addition to the reimbursement reductions and adjustments discussed below, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the \n“BCA”) requires automatic spending reductions to reduce the federal deficit, resulting in a uniform percentage reduction \nacross all Medicare programs of 2% per fiscal year. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) \nAct and related legislation temporarily suspended these reductions through March 31, 2022 and reduced the sequestration \nadjustment from 2% to 1% from April 1 through June 30, 2022. The full 2% reduction resumed on July 1, 2022. The BCA \nsequestration has been extended through the first six months of 2032. In addition, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 \n(“ARPA”) increased the federal budget deficit in a manner that triggers an additional sequestration mandated under the \nPay As You Go Act of 2010 (“PAYGO Act”). As a result, a further payment reduction of up to 4% was required to take \neffect in January 2022. However, Congress has delayed implementation of this payment reduction until 2025. We \nanticipate that the federal deficit will continue to place pressure on government health care programs, and it is possible \nthat future deficit reduction legislation will impose additional spending reductions. \nInpatient Acute Care \nUnder the Medicare program, we receive reimbursement under a prospective payment system (“PPS”) for general, \nacute care hospital inpatient services. Under the hospital inpatient PPS, fixed payment amounts per inpatient discharge \nare established based on the patient’s assigned Medicare severity diagnosis-related group (“MS-DRG”). MS-DRGs \nclassify treatments for illnesses according to the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to furnish care for \neach principal diagnosis. MS-DRG weights represent the average resources for a given MS-DRG relative to the average \n7"

      "text": "resources for all MS-DRGs. MS-DRG payments are adjusted for area wage differentials. Hospitals, other than those \ndefined as “new,” receive PPS reimbursement for inpatient capital costs based on MS-DRG weights multiplied by a \ngeographically adjusted federal rate. When the cost to treat certain patients falls well outside the normal distribution, \nproviders typically receive additional “outlier” payments. These payments are financed by offsetting reductions in the \ninpatient PPS rates. A high-cost outlier threshold is set annually at a level that targets estimated outlier payments equaling \n5.1% of total inpatient PPS payments for the fiscal year. \nMS-DRG rates are updated, and MS-DRG weights are recalibrated, using cost-relative weights each federal fiscal \nyear (which begins October 1). The index used to update the MS-DRG rates (the “market basket”) gives consideration to \nthe inflation experienced by hospitals and entities outside the health care industry in purchasing goods and services. Each \nfederal fiscal year, the annual market basket update is reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics (“BLS”) 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. A decrease in payment \nrates or an increase in rates that is below the increase in our costs may adversely affect our results of operations. \nFor federal fiscal year 2022, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) increased the MS-DRG rate \nby approximately 2.5%. This increase reflected a market basket update of 2.7%, reduced by a negative 0.7 percentage \npoint productivity adjustment and increased by 0.5 percentage points in accordance with the Medicare Access and CHIP \nReauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”). For federal fiscal year 2023, CMS increased the MS-DRG rate by \napproximately 4.3%. This increase reflects a market basket update of 4.1%, reduced by a negative 0.3 percentage point \nproductivity adjustment and increased by 0.5 percentage points as required by MACRA. Additional adjustments may \napply, depending on patient-specific or hospital-specific factors. For example, the two-midnight rule limits payments to \nhospitals when services to Medicare beneficiaries are payable as inpatient services. In addition, under the post-acute care \ntransfer policy, Medicare reimbursement rates may be reduced when an inpatient hospital discharges a patient in a \nspecified MS-DRG to certain post-acute care settings. \nCMS has implemented and is implementing a number of programs and requirements intended to transform \nMedicare from a passive payer to an active purchaser of quality goods and services. For example, hospitals that do not \nsuccessfully participate in the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program are subject to a 25% reduction of the market \nbasket update. Hospitals that do not demonstrate meaningful use of electronic health records (“EHRs”) are subject to a \n75% reduction of the market basket update. \nFurther, Medicare does not allow an inpatient hospital discharge to be assigned to a higher paying MS-DRG if \ncertain designated hospital acquired conditions (“HACs”) were not present on admission and the identified HAC is the \nonly condition resulting in the assignment of the higher paying MS-DRG. In this situation, the case is paid as though the \nsecondary diagnosis was not present. There are currently 14 categories of conditions on the list of HACs. In addition, the \n25% of hospitals with the worst risk-adjusted HAC scores in the designated performance period receive a 1% reduction \nin their inpatient PPS Medicare payments. CMS has also established three National Coverage Determinations that prohibit \nMedicare reimbursement for erroneous surgical procedures performed on an inpatient or outpatient basis. \nUnder the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (“HRRP”), payments to hospitals may also be reduced based \non readmission rates. Each federal fiscal year, inpatient payments are reduced if a hospital experiences “excess” \nreadmissions within the 30-day time period from the date of discharge for conditions designated by CMS. For federal \nfiscal year 2017 and subsequent years, CMS has designated six conditions or procedures, including heart attack, \npneumonia and total hip arthroplasty. Hospitals with what CMS defines as excess readmissions for these conditions or \nprocedures receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions or \nprocedures subject to the excess readmission standard. The amount by which payments are reduced is determined by \nassessing a hospital’s performance relative to hospitals with similar proportions of dual eligible patients, subject to a cap \nestablished by CMS. The reduction in payments to hospitals with excess readmissions can be up to 3% of a hospital’s \nbase payments. Each hospital’s performance is publicly reported by CMS. \nIn addition, under the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (“HVBP”) Program, CMS reduces the inpatient PPS \npayment amount for all discharges by 2.0%. The total amount collected from these reductions is pooled, and the entire \namount collected is redistributed as incentive payments to reward hospitals that meet certain quality performance \nstandards established by CMS. CMS scores each hospital based on achievement (relative to other hospitals) and \nimprovement ranges (relative to the hospital’s own past performance) for each applicable performance standard. Hospitals \nthat meet or exceed the quality performance standards receive greater reimbursement under the value-based purchasing \nprogram than they would have otherwise. Hospitals that do not achieve the necessary quality performance receive reduced \nMedicare inpatient hospital payments. Hospitals are scored on a number of individual measures that are categorized into \nfour domains: clinical outcomes; efficiency and cost reduction; safety; and person and community engagement. \n8"

      "text": "As a result of the national public health emergency (“PHE”) declared in response to COVID-19, CMS has paused \nor refined several measures across various hospital quality measurement and value-based purchasing programs. These \npolicies are intended to ensure that the programs neither reward nor penalize hospitals based on circumstances caused by \nthe PHE that the measures were not designed to accommodate. For example, CMS is modifying certain readmissions \nmeasures within the HRRP to exclude COVID-19 diagnosed patients. Under the HVBP Program in federal fiscal year \n2023, as a result of the measure suppression policy, hospitals will receive a net neutral payment adjustment for each \ndischarge that is equal to the 2% withheld under the program. In addition, facilities that experience extraordinary \ncircumstances beyond their control, that prevent satisfaction of program reporting requirements, may request an exception \nfrom CMS. \nOutpatient \nCMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients \nwho have no Part A coverage) on a PPS basis. Hospital outpatient services paid under PPS are classified into groups \ncalled ambulatory payment classifications (“APCs”). Services for each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the \nresources they require. A payment rate is established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, a hospital may \nbe paid for more than one APC for a patient visit. The APC payment rates are updated for each calendar year. Each \ncalendar year, the annual market basket update is further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year \nmoving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For calendar year 2022, CMS increased APC \npayment rates by 2.0%. This increase reflected a market basket increase of 2.7% with a negative 0.7 percentage point \nproductivity adjustment. For calendar year 2023, CMS increased payment rates under the outpatient PPS by an estimated \n3.8%. This increase reflects a market basket increase of 4.1% with a negative 0.3 percentage point productivity \nadjustment. CMS requires hospitals to submit quality data relating to outpatient care to avoid receiving a 2.0 percentage \npoint reduction in the annual payment update under the outpatient PPS. \nThe Medicare reimbursement we receive may also be affected by broad shifts in payment policy. For example, in \nJune 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated past payment cuts for hospitals participating in the 340B Drug Pricing \nProgram. Although our hospitals do not participate in the 340B program, the decision has implications for all hospitals \nreimbursed under the outpatient PPS and could affect our Medicare reimbursement for both past and future periods. The \n340B program allows participating hospitals to purchase certain outpatient drugs from manufacturers at discounted rates. \nThese hospitals are reimbursed for the discounted drugs under the same Medicare payment methodology and rates that \nare applied to non-340B hospitals. The past payment cuts, which CMS implemented in 2018, resulted in increased \npayments for non-340B hospitals, and it has not yet been determined whether the increased payments to non-340B \nhospitals may be recouped due to budget neutrality principles. Further, depending on future Medicare payment policies, \nnon-340B hospitals may receive decreased reimbursement going forward for outpatient drugs and services. For calendar \nyear 2023, CMS finalized the payment rate for drugs acquired through the 340B program in light of the Supreme Court \ndecision and, as a result of the payment rate change, is implementing a 3.09% reduction to payment rates for non-drug \nservices under the outpatient PPS for calendar year 2023 to achieve budget neutrality. In addition, CMS has, in recent \nyears, phased in an expanded site-neutral payment policy for clinic visit services provided at all off-campus provider-\nbased departments. Under the policy, clinic visit services provided at all off-campus provider-based departments are \ngenerally not covered as outpatient department services under the outpatient PPS, but rather are reimbursed at the \nMedicare Physician Fee Schedule (“Physician Fee Schedule”) rate, which is generally lower than the outpatient PPS rate. \nBefore the expanded policy, the Physician Fee Schedule equivalent rate did not apply to “excepted” provider-based \ndepartments. The Physician Fee Schedule equivalent rate for calendar year 2023 is substantially less than the outpatient \nPPS rate. \nRehabilitation \nCMS reimburses inpatient rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”) on a PPS basis. Under the IRF PPS, patients are \nclassified into case mix groups that reflect the relative resource intensity typically associated with the patient’s clinical \ncondition. The case mix groups are based upon impairment, age, functional motor and cognitive scores, and comorbidities \n(additional diseases or disorders from which the patient suffers). IRFs are paid a predetermined amount per discharge that \nreflects the patient’s case mix group that is adjusted for facility-specific factors, such as area wage levels, proportion of \nlow-income patients, and location in a rural area. Each federal fiscal year, the IRF rates are updated using a market basket \nindex, which is reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified \neconomy-wide productivity. For federal fiscal year 2022, CMS increased IRF payment rates by an estimated 1.9%, \nreflecting an IRF market basket update of 2.6% reduced by a negative 0.7 percentage point productivity adjustment. For \nfederal fiscal year 2023, CMS increased IRF payment rates by an estimated 3.9%, reflecting an IRF market basket update \nof 4.2% with a negative 0.3 percentage point productivity adjustment. In addition, CMS requires IRFs to report quality \nmeasures to avoid receiving a reduction of 2.0 percentage points to the market basket update. \n9"

      "text": "In order to qualify for classification as an IRF, at least 60% of a facility’s inpatients during the most recent 12-\nmonth CMS-defined review period must have required intensive rehabilitation services for one or more of 13 specified \nconditions. IRFs must also meet additional coverage criteria, including patient selection and care requirements relating to \npre-admission screenings, post-admission evaluations, ongoing coordination of care and involvement of rehabilitation \nphysicians. A facility that fails to meet the 60% threshold, or other criteria to be classified as an IRF, will be paid under \neither the acute care hospital inpatient or outpatient PPS, which generally provide for lower payment amounts. As of \nDecember 31, 2022, we had two rehabilitation hospitals and 66 hospital rehabilitation units. \nThe Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (“IMPACT Act”) requires the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), together with the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, to work \ntoward a unified payment system for post-acute care services provided by IRFs, home health agencies, skilled nursing \nfacilities, and long-term care hospitals. A unified post-acute care payment system would pay post-acute care providers \nunder a single framework according to a patient’s characteristics, rather than based on the post-acute care setting where \nthe patient receives treatment. As required under the statute, CMS issued a report presenting a prototype for a unified \npost-acute care payment model in July 2022. CMS noted in its report the need for additional analyses and acknowledged \nthat the universal implementation of a unified post-acute care payment system would require congressional action. The \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission is required to submit a report to Congress by June 2023. \nPsychiatric \nInpatient hospital services furnished in psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals \nand critical access hospitals are reimbursed on a PPS basis. The inpatient psychiatric facility (“IPF”) PPS is based upon \na per diem payment, with adjustments to account for certain patient and facility characteristics. The IPF PPS contains an \n“outlier” policy for extraordinarily costly cases and an adjustment to a facility’s base payment if it maintains a full-service \nemergency department. CMS has established the IPF PPS payment rate in a manner intended to be budget neutral. Each \nfederal fiscal year, IPF payment rates are updated using a market basket index, which is reduced by a productivity \nadjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For federal \nfiscal year 2022, CMS increased IPF payment rates by an estimated 2.0%, reflecting a 2.7% IPF market basket update \nreduced by a negative 0.7 percentage point productivity adjustment. For federal fiscal year 2023, CMS increased IPF \npayment rates by an estimated 3.8%, which reflects a 4.1% IPF market basket increase with a negative 0.3 percentage \npoint productivity adjustment. Together with other policy changes, total payments to IPFs are anticipated to increase by \n2.5% in federal fiscal year 2023. Inpatient psychiatric facilities are required to report quality measures to CMS to avoid \nreceiving a 2.0 percentage point reduction to the market basket update. As of December 31, 2022, we had five psychiatric \nhospitals and 45 hospital psychiatric units. \nAmbulatory Surgery Centers \nCMS reimburses ASCs using a predetermined fee schedule. Reimbursements for ASC overhead costs are limited \nto no more than the overhead costs paid to hospital outpatient departments under the Medicare hospital outpatient PPS \nfor the same procedure. If CMS determines that a procedure is commonly performed in a physician’s office, the ASC \nreimbursement for that procedure is limited to the reimbursement allowable under the Physician Fee Schedule, with \nlimited exceptions. All surgical procedures, other than those that pose a significant safety risk or generally require an \novernight stay, are payable as ASC procedures. From time to time, CMS expands the services that may be performed in \nASCs, which may result in more Medicare procedures that historically have been performed in hospitals being moved to \nASCs, reducing surgical volume in our hospitals. Also, more Medicare procedures that historically have been performed \nin ASCs may be moved to physicians’ offices. Some commercial third-party payers have adopted similar policies. \nHistorically, CMS updated reimbursement rates for ASCs based on changes to the consumer price index. However, \nfor calendar years through 2023, CMS updates to ASC reimbursement rates will be based on the hospital market basket \nindex, partly to promote site-neutrality between hospitals and ASCs. For each federal fiscal year, the ASC payment system \nupdate is reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified \neconomy-wide productivity. For calendar year 2022, CMS increased ASC payment rates by 2.0%, which reflected a \nmarket basket increase of 2.7% and a negative 0.7 percentage point productivity adjustment. For calendar year 2023, \nCMS increased ASC payment rates by 3.8%, which reflects a market basket increase of 4.1% and a negative 0.3 \npercentage point productivity adjustment. In addition, CMS has established a quality reporting program for ASCs under \nwhich ASCs that fail to report on specified quality measures receive a 2.0 percentage point reduction to the market basket \nupdate. \n10"

      "text": "Home Health \nCMS reimburses home health agencies under the Home Health PPS. Home health agencies are paid a national, \nstandardized 30-day period payment rate if a period of care meets a certain threshold of home health visits (periods of \ncare that do not meet the visit threshold are paid a per-visit payment rate for the discipline providing care). The daily \nhome health payment rate is adjusted for case-mix and area wage levels. An outlier adjustment may be paid for periods \nof care where costs exceed a specific threshold amount. Each calendar year, home health payment rates are updated using \na market basket index, which is reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of \nchanges in specified economy-wide productivity. For calendar year 2022, CMS increased home health payment rates by \n3.2%, based on a home health payment update percentage of 2.6%, which reflected a 3.1% market basket increase reduced \nby a 0.5 percentage point productivity adjustment, among other changes. For calendar year 2023, CMS increased home \nhealth payment rates by 0.7%, based on a home health payment update percentage of 4.0%, which reflects a 4.1% market \nbasket increase reduced by a 0.1 percentage point productivity adjustment, among other changes. Home health agencies \nthat do not submit required quality data are subject to a 2.0 percentage point reduction to the market basket update. In \naddition, home health agencies are required to submit a one-time Notice of Admission (“NOA”) for each patient that \nestablishes that the beneficiary is under a Medicare home health period of care. Failure to submit the NOA within five \ncalendar days from the start of care results in a reduction to the 30-day period payment amount for each day from the start \nof care date until the date the NOA is submitted. \nCMS began implementing a nationwide expansion of the Home Health Value-Based Purchasing (“HHVBP”) Model \nin January 2022. Under the model, home health agencies will receive increases or reductions to their Medicare fee-for-\nservice payments of up to 5%, based on performance against specific quality measures relative to the performance of \nother home health providers. Data collected in each performance year will impact Medicare payments two years later. \nCalendar year 2023 is the first performance year under the expanded HHVBP Model, which will affect payments in \ncalendar year 2025. \nPayment of claims for home health services may be impacted by the Review Choice Demonstration, a program \nintended to identify and prevent home health services fraud, reduce the number of Medicare appeals, and improve provider \ncompliance with Medicare program requirements. The program applies only to home health agencies in certain states, \nincluding North Carolina, Florida and Texas. Providers in these states may initially select from the following claims \nreview and approval processes: pre-claim review, post-payment review or a minimal post-payment review with a 25% \npayment reduction. Home health agencies that maintain high levels of compliance are eligible for additional, less \nburdensome options. \nAs noted above, the IMPACT Act requires HHS, in conjunction with the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, \nto propose a unified post-acute care payment model by 2023. The unified post-acute care payment system would include \nhome health agencies. \nHospice \nMedicare beneficiaries who have a terminal illness and a life expectancy of six months or less may elect to receive \nhospice benefits (palliative care) instead of standard coverage of treatment for the terminal illness and related conditions. \nHospice services are paid under the Hospice PPS, under which CMS sets a daily rate for each day a patient is enrolled in \nthe hospice benefit. The daily rate depends on the level of care provided to a patient (routine home care, continuous home \ncare, inpatient respite care, or general inpatient care). Daily rates are adjusted for factors such as area wage levels. Each \nfederal fiscal year, hospice payment rates are updated using a market basket index, which is reduced by a productivity \nadjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For federal \nfiscal year 2022, CMS increased hospice payment rates by 2.0%, which reflected a 2.7% market basket update and a \nnegative 0.7 percentage point productivity adjustment. For federal fiscal year 2023, CMS increased hospice payment rates \nby 3.8%, which reflects a 4.1% market basket update and a negative 0.3 percentage point productivity adjustment. \nHospices that fail to satisfy quality reporting requirements receive a 2.0 percentage point reduction to the market basket \nupdate. Beginning in 2024, the payment reduction for failure to report quality data will increase to 4.0 percentage points. \nOverall payments made by Medicare to each hospice are subject to an inpatient cap and an aggregate cap. The \ninpatient cap limits the number of days of inpatient care to no more than 20% of total patient care days. The aggregate \ncap limits the amount of Medicare reimbursement a hospice may receive, based on the number of Medicare patients \nserved. The aggregate cap is updated annually. In federal fiscal year 2023, the aggregate cap is $32,486.92. If a hospice’s \nMedicare payments exceed its inpatient or aggregate caps, it must repay Medicare for the excess amount. \n11"

      "text": "Physician Services \nPhysician services are reimbursed under the Physician Fee Schedule system, under which CMS has assigned a \nnational relative value unit (“RVU”) to most medical procedures and services that reflects the various resources required \nby a physician to provide the services, relative to all other services. Each RVU is calculated based on a combination of \nwork required in terms of time and intensity of effort for the service, practice expense (overhead) attributable to the service \nand malpractice insurance expense attributable to the service. These three elements are each modified by a geographic \nadjustment factor to account for local practice costs and are then aggregated. While RVUs for various services may change \nin a given year, any alterations are required by statute to be virtually budget neutral, such that total payments made under \nthe Physician Fee Schedule may not differ by more than $20 million from what payments would have been if adjustments \nwere not made. CMS annually reviews resource inputs for select services as part of the potentially misvalued code \ninitiative. To determine the payment rate for a particular service, the sum of the geographically adjusted RVUs is \nmultiplied by a conversion factor. For calendar year 2023, CMS reduced the conversion factor by approximately 4.48%. \nHowever, Congress approved a partial offset to this reduction, increasing payment amounts by 2.5%, which will result in \na payment reduction of approximately 2% for calendar year 2023. \nMedicare payments are adjusted based on participation in the Quality Payment Program (“QPP”), a payment \nmethodology intended to reward high-quality patient care. Physicians and certain other health care clinicians are required \nto participate in one of two QPP tracks. Under both tracks, performance data collected in each performance year will \naffect Medicare payments two years later. CMS expects to transition increasing financial risk to providers as the QPP \nevolves. The Advanced Alternative Payment Model (“Advanced APM”) track makes incentive payments available for \nparticipation in specific innovative payment models approved by CMS, which are paid two years after the relevant \nperformance period, if a provider has sufficient participation (based on percentage of payments or patients) in an \nAdvanced APM. Providers were able to earn a 5.0% Medicare incentive payment for performance year 2022 (to be paid \nin 2024), may earn a 3.5% incentive payment for performance year 2023 (to be paid in 2025), and may receive higher \nMedicare Physician Fee Schedule payment rate updates based on performance in 2025 and beyond. In addition, providers \nare exempt from the reporting requirements and payment adjustments imposed under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment \nSystem (“MIPS”). Alternatively, providers may participate in the MIPS track. Providers electing this option may receive \npayment incentives or be subject to payment reductions based on their performance with respect to clinical quality, \nresource use, clinical improvement activities, and meeting Promoting Interoperability standards related to the meaningful \nuse of EHRs. Performance data collected in 2023 will result in payment adjustments of up to 9% in 2025; positive \nadjustments are subject to a scaling factor to meet budget neutrality requirements. CMS makes available an exception that \npermits clinicians to request reweighting of any or all performance categories if they encounter an extreme and \nuncontrollable circumstance or public health emergency, such as COVID-19, that is outside of their control. \nOther \nCMS uses fee schedules to pay for physical, occupational and speech therapies, durable medical equipment, clinical \ndiagnostic laboratory services, nonimplantable orthotics and prosthetics and services provided by independent diagnostic \ntesting facilities. \nUnder the various PPS structures, the payment rates are adjusted for area differences in wage levels by a factor \n(“wage index”) reflecting the relative wage level in the geographic area compared to the national average wage level and \ntaking into account occupational mix. The redistributive impact of wage index changes is not anticipated to have a material \nfinancial impact for 2023. CMS recently finalized a permanent, budget-neutral cap on year-to-year wage index changes \nto smooth variations and decrease volatility. \nMedicare reimburses hospitals for a portion (65%) of deductible and coinsurance amounts that are uncollectable \nfrom Medicare beneficiaries. \nCMS has implemented contractor reform whereby CMS competitively bids the Medicare fiscal intermediary and \nMedicare carrier functions to Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”), which are geographically assigned across \n12 jurisdictions to service both Part A and Part B providers. Home health and hospice providers are serviced across four \nMAC jurisdictions. While providers with operations across multiple geographies had the option of having all hospitals \nuse one home office MAC, we chose, in most cases, to use the MACs assigned to the geographic areas in which our \nhospitals are located. CMS periodically re-solicits bids, and the MAC servicing a geographic area can change as a result \nof the bid competition. MAC transition periods can impact claims processing functions and the resulting cash flows. \nCMS contracts with third parties to promote the integrity of the Medicare program through reviews of quality \nconcerns and detections, and corrections of improper payments. Quality Improvement Organizations (“QIOs”), for \nexample, are groups of physicians and other health care quality experts that work on behalf of CMS to ensure that \nMedicare pays only for goods and services that are reasonable and necessary, and that are provided in the most appropriate \nsetting.

The \ncompensation for RACs is based on their review of claims submitted to Medicare for billing compliance, including correct \ncoding and medical necessity, and the amount of overpayments and underpayments they identify. CMS limits the number \nof claims that RACs may audit by limiting the number of records that RACs may request from hospitals based on each \nprovider’s claim denial rate for the previous year. CMS has implemented the RAC program on a permanent, nationwide \nbasis and expanded the RAC program to the Managed Medicare program and Medicare Part D. CMS has transitioned \nsome of its other integrity programs to a consolidated model by engaging Unified Program Integrity Contractors \n(“UPICs”) to perform audits, investigations and other integrity activities. \nWe have established policies and procedures to respond to requests from and payment denials by RACs and other \nMedicare contractors. Payment recoveries resulting from reviews and denials are appealable through administrative and \njudicial processes, and we pursue reversal of adverse determinations at appropriate appeal levels. We incur additional \ncosts related to responding to requests and denials, including costs associated with responding to requests for records and \npursuing the reversal of payment denials and losses associated with overpayments that are not reversed upon appeal. In \nrecent years, there have been significant delays in the Medicare appeals process. Depending upon changes to and the \ngrowth of the RAC program and other Medicare integrity programs and our success in appealing claims in future periods, \nour cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted. \nMedicare reimburses teaching hospitals for portions of the direct and indirect costs of graduate medical education \n(“GME”) through statutory formulas that are generally based on the number of medical residents and which take into \naccount patient volume or the number of hospital beds. Accrediting organizations review GME programs for compliance \nwith educational standards. Many of our hospitals operate GME or other residency programs to train physicians and other \nallied health professionals. \nManaged Medicare \nUnder the Managed Medicare program (also known as Medicare Part C, or Medicare Advantage), the federal \ngovernment contracts with private health insurers to provide members with Medicare Part A, Part B and Part D benefits. \nManaged Medicare plans can be structured as HMOs, PPOs or private fee-for-service plans. In addition to covering Part \nA and Part B benefits, the health insurers may choose to offer supplemental benefits and impose higher premiums and \nplan costs on beneficiaries. CMS makes fee payment adjustments based on service benchmarks and quality ratings and \npublishes star ratings to assist beneficiaries with plan selection. According to CMS, nearly half of all Medicare enrollees \nparticipate in managed Medicare plans. \nMedicaid \nMedicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government and the states and are administered by states under \napproved plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are made under a PPS or are based on negotiated payment levels \nwith individual hospitals. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than a hospital’s cost of services. The Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \n“Affordable Care Act”) requires states to expand Medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes \neffectively at or below 138% of the federal poverty level. However, states may opt out of the expansion without losing \nexisting federal Medicaid funding. A number of states, including Texas and Florida, have opted out of the Medicaid \nexpansion. Among these states, the maximum income level required for individuals and families to qualify for Medicaid \nvaries widely. \nMedicaid enrollment has increased as a result of COVID-19. Through COVID-19 relief legislation, Congress \nauthorized a temporary increase in federal funds for certain Medicaid expenditures. The enhanced funding is available to \nstates that maintain continuous Medicaid enrollment and meet certain other conditions. The continuous coverage \nrequirement will expire as of April 1, 2023, and the increase in federal funding will be phased out through calendar year \n2023. The resumption of redeterminations for Medicaid enrollees and end of the other conditions of funding may lead to \ncoverage disruptions and dis-enrollments of current Medicaid enrollees. \nBecause most states must operate with balanced budgets and because the Medicaid program is often a state’s largest \nprogram, many states have adopted or may consider adopting various strategies to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. \nOutside of the government response to COVID-19, budgetary pressures have, in recent years, resulted and likely will \ncontinue to result in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs in many states. Most \nstates in which we operate have adopted broad-based provider taxes to fund the non-federal share of Medicaid programs \nor fund indigent care within the state. Many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce \ncoverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance \nor expand the states’ Medicaid systems. Some states use, or have applied to use, waivers granted by CMS to implement \nMedicaid expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary \n13"

      "text": "from federal standards. For example, the Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program, which is \noperated under a Medicaid waiver, expands Medicaid managed care programs in the state, provides funding for \nuncompensated care and supports several delivery system reform initiatives. Although this Texas waiver has been \nextended through 2030, certain delivery system reform initiatives operate under different approval periods. For example, \na directed payment program for hospitals in Texas expires August 31, 2023. If Texas is unable to obtain future extensions \nof this program or similar programs, our revenues could be negatively impacted. In recent years, aspects of existing or \nproposed Medicaid waiver programs have been subject to legal challenge, resulting in uncertainty. Additionally, federal \npolicies that shape administration of the Medicaid programs at the state level are subject to change, including as a result \nof changes in the presidential administration. Where states had previously been permitted to condition Medicaid \nenrollment on work or other community engagement, the approvals of waivers permitting these conditions have been \nrescinded, and the federal government is also reexamining block grant funding structures. However, a federal court is \npermitting Georgia to impose work and community engagement requirements under a Medicaid demonstration program \nthat is expected to launch in mid-2023. \nMany state Medicaid programs incorporate value-based purchasing models and related payment and delivery \nsystem reform initiatives that incentivize improvements in quality of care and cost-effectiveness. For example, federal \nfunds under the Medicaid program may not be used to reimburse providers for treatment of certain provider-preventable \nconditions. Each state Medicaid program must deny payments to providers for the treatment of health care-acquired \nconditions designated by CMS as well as other provider-preventable conditions that may be designated by the state. \nCongress has expanded the federal government’s involvement in fighting fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicaid \nprogram through the Medicaid Integrity Program. CMS employs UPICs to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid \nclaims, identify overpayments and perform other program integrity activities. The UPICs collaborate with states and \ncoordinate provider investigations across the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, state Medicaid agencies are \nrequired to establish Medicaid RAC programs. These programs vary by state in design and operation. \nManaged Medicaid \nEnrollment in managed Medicaid plans has increased in recent years, as state governments seek to control the cost \nof Medicaid programs. Managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with one or more entities for patient \nenrollment, care management and claims adjudication. The states usually do not relinquish program responsibilities for \nfinancing, eligibility criteria and core benefit plan design. We generally contract directly with one or more of the \ndesignated entities, usually a managed care organization. The provisions of these programs are state-specific. Many states \ndirect managed care plans to pass through supplemental payments to designated providers, independent of services \nrendered, to ensure consistent funding of providers that serve large numbers of low-income patients. In an effort to more \nclosely tie funds to delivery and outcomes, CMS is limiting these “pass-through payments” that are paid by states under \nmanaged Medicaid plan contracts and will generally prohibit such payments by 2027. However, CMS permits new pass-\nthroughs of supplemental provider payments for up to a three-year period when states are transitioning Medicaid \npopulations or services from a fee-for-service system to a managed care system. \nAccountable Care Organizations and Bundled Payment Initiatives \nAn Accountable Care Organization (“ACO”) is a network of providers and suppliers that work together to invest in \ninfrastructure and redesign delivery processes to attempt to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. \nPromoting accountability and coordination of care, ACOs are intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality \nand operational efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS are eligible to share in \na portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. There are several types of ACO programs, including the \nMedicare Shared Savings Program. \nThe CMS Innovation Center is responsible for establishing demonstration projects and other initiatives in order to \nidentify, develop, test and encourage the adoption of new methods of delivering and paying for health care that create \nsavings under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, while improving quality of care. For example, providers participating \nin bundled payment initiatives agree to receive one payment for services provided to Medicare patients for certain medical \nconditions or episodes of care, accepting accountability for costs and quality of care. By rewarding providers for \nincreasing quality and reducing costs and penalizing providers if costs exceed a set amount, these models are intended to \nlead to higher quality, more coordinated care at a lower cost to the Medicare program. Hospitals may receive supplemental \nMedicare payments or owe repayments to CMS depending on whether overall CMS spending per episode exceeds or falls \nbelow a target specified by CMS and whether quality standards are met. The CMS Innovation Center has implemented \nbundled payment models, including the Bundled Payment Care Improvement Advanced (“BPCI Advanced”) program, \nwhich is voluntary and expected to run through December 2025. Participation in bundled payment programs is generally \n14"

      "text": "voluntary, but CMS currently requires providers in selected geographic areas to participate in a mandatory bundled \nprogram for specified orthopedic procedures and a model for end-stage renal disease treatment. In addition, a mandatory \nradiation oncology model was expected to begin on January 1, 2023, but CMS has indefinitely delayed its implementation. \nCMS has indicated that it will provide six months’ notice before starting the model. \nIn a strategic report issued in 2021 and updated in 2022, the CMS Innovation Center highlighted the need to \naccelerate the movement to value-based care and drive broader system transformation. By 2030, the CMS Innovation \nCenter aims to have all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries and most Medicaid beneficiaries in a care relationship with \naccountability for quality and total cost of care. CMS also indicated it will streamline its payment model portfolio and \nconsider how to ensure broad provider participation, including by implementing more mandatory models. In the 2022 \nupdated report, the CMS Innovation Center indicated that it plans to focus on increased care coordination between primary \ncare physicians and specialists. Moreover, several private third-party payers are increasingly employing alternative \npayment models, which may increasingly shift financial risk to providers. \nDisproportionate Share Hospital and Medicaid Supplemental Payments \nIn addition to making payments for services provided directly to beneficiaries, Medicare makes additional payments \nto hospitals that treat a disproportionately large number of low-income patients (Medicaid and Medicare patients eligible \nto receive Supplemental Security Income). Disproportionate Share Hospital (“DSH”) payment adjustments are \ndetermined annually based on certain statistical information required by HHS and are paid as a percentage addition to \nMS-DRG payments. Pending litigation challenging the payment formula for prior years and any future policies \nimplemented by CMS may affect how CMS calculates DSH payments and may increase or decrease our payments in the \nfuture. CMS has previously proposed making changes to the calculation of Section 1115 Demonstrations in the Medicaid \nfraction of the DSH formula in a manner that would effectively lower DSH payments for many hospitals, and has indicated \nthat the agency will return to the issue in future rulemaking. These changes could adversely impact our results of \noperations. CMS also distributes a payment to each DSH hospital that is allocated according to the hospital’s proportion \nof uncompensated care costs relative to the uncompensated care amount of other DSH hospitals. \nSome states make additional payments to providers through the Medicaid program that are separate from base \npayments and not specifically tied to an individual’s care. These supplemental payments may be in the form of Medicaid \nDSH payments, which are intended to offset hospital uncompensated care costs. The federal government distributes \nfederal Medicaid DSH funds to each state based on a statutory formula. The states then distribute the DSH funding among \nqualifying hospitals. States have broad discretion to define which hospitals qualify for Medicaid DSH payments and the \namount of such payments. The Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation provide for reductions to the Medicaid \nDSH hospital program, but Congress has delayed the implementation of these reductions until federal fiscal year 2024. \nUnder current law, Medicaid DSH payments will be reduced by $8 billion in each of federal fiscal years 2024 through \n2027. Supplemental payments may also be in the form of non-DSH payments, such as upper payment limit payments, \nwhich are intended to address the difference between Medicaid fee-for-service payments and Medicare reimbursement \nrates, or payments under other programs that vary by state under Section 1115 waivers. These supplemental \nreimbursement programs are designed with input from CMS. The programs are generally authorized for a specified period \nof time and require CMS’s approval to be extended. CMS is considering changes to both DSH and non-DSH types of \nprograms. \nTRICARE \nTRICARE is the Department of Defense’s health care program for members of the armed forces. For inpatient \nservices, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a DRG system modeled on the Medicare inpatient PPS. For outpatient \nservices, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a PPS that is similar to that utilized for services furnished to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. \nAnnual Cost Reports \nAll hospitals, home health agencies, hospice providers and other institutional providers participating in the \nMedicare, Medicaid and TRICARE programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or under a PPS, are required to \nmeet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require the submission of \nannual cost reports covering the revenues, costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each provider type \nto Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients. \nAnnual cost reports required under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to routine audits, which may \nresult in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. These \naudits often require several years to reach the final determination of amounts due to or from us under these programs. \nProviders also have rights of appeal, and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of cost reports. \n15"

      "text": "Managed Care and Other Discounted Plans \nMost of our hospitals offer discounts from established charges to certain large group purchasers of health care \nservices, including managed care plans and private health insurers. Admissions reimbursed by commercial managed care \nand other insurers were 30%, 31% and 29% of our total admissions for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and \n2020, respectively. Managed care contracts are typically negotiated for terms between one and three years. While we \ngenerally have received contracted annual increases to payment rates from managed care payers, there can be no assurance \nthat we will continue to receive increases in the future. Price transparency initiatives may impact our relationships with \npayers and ability to obtain or maintain favorable contract terms. For example, hospitals are required to publish a list of \ntheir standard charges for all items and services, including gross charges, discounted cash prices and payer-specific and \nde-identified negotiated charges, in a publicly accessible online file. Further, CMS requires health insurers to publish \nonline charges negotiated with providers for health care services. In addition, the No Surprises Act requires providers to \nsend to a patient’s health plan a good faith estimate of the expected charges for furnishing scheduled items or services, \nincluding billing and diagnostic codes, prior to the scheduled date of the items or services. The estimate must cover any \nitem or service that is reasonably expected to be provided in conjunction with the primary items or services, including \nthose that may be delivered by another provider. However, HHS is deferring enforcement of certain requirements of the \nNo Surprises Act related to the good faith estimates for insured patients until it issues additional regulations. It is not clear \nwhat impact, if any, these or future health reform efforts at the federal and state levels, consolidation within the third-\nparty payer industry and vertical integration among third-party payers and health care providers will have on our ability \nto negotiate reimbursement rates. \nUninsured and Self-Pay Patients \nSelf-pay revenues are derived from providing health care services to patients without health insurance coverage and \nfrom the patient responsibility portion of payments for our health care services that are not covered by an individual’s \nhealth plan. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than collection of amounts due from \ngovernment health care programs or private third-party payers. Any increases in uninsured individuals, changes to the \npayer mix or greater adoption of health plan structures that result in higher patient responsibility amounts could increase \namounts due from individuals. The No Surprises Act requires providers to provide uninsured and self-pay patients, in \nadvance of the scheduled date for the item or service or upon request of the individual, a good faith estimate of the \nexpected charges for furnishing scheduled items or services, including billing and diagnostic codes. The estimate must \ncover any item or service that is reasonably expected to be provided in conjunction with the scheduled item or service or \nthat is reasonably expected to be delivered by another provider. HHS is delaying enforcement with regard to good faith \nestimates that do not include expected charges for co-providers or co-facilities until the agency issues additional \nregulations. If the actual charges to the uninsured or self-pay patient are substantially higher than the estimate or the \nprovider furnishes an item or service that was not included in the good faith estimate, the patient can invoke a patient-\nprovider dispute resolution process to challenge the higher amount. \nA high percentage of our uninsured patients are initially admitted through our emergency rooms. For the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022, approximately 85% of our admissions of uninsured patients occurred through our emergency rooms. \nThe Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital that participates in the Medicare \nprogram to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s \nemergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize \nthat condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility that can handle the condition. The obligation \nto screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. In \naddition, health insurers are required to reimburse hospitals for emergency services provided to enrollees without prior \nauthorization and without regard to whether a participating provider contract is in place. \n16"

Such \nexemptions and support are not available to our facilities and may provide the tax-supported or not-for-profit entities an \nadvantage in funding capital expenditures.

In addition, the No Surprises Act imposes additional price transparency requirements, including the \nrequirement that providers send uninsured and self-pay patients (in advance of the scheduled date for the item or service \nor upon request) and health plans of insured patients a good faith estimate of the expected charges and diagnostic codes. \nUntil HHS issues additional regulations, the agency is deferring enforcement of certain requirements regarding providing \ngood faith estimates for insured patients and for good faith estimates sent to uninsured or self-pay patients that do not \ninclude expected charges for co-providers or co-facilities. \nOur strategies are designed to ensure our hospitals and other facilities are competitive. We believe our hospitals and \nother facilities compete within local communities on the basis of many factors, including the quality of care, ability to \nattract and retain quality physicians, skilled clinical personnel and other health care professionals, location, breadth of \nservices, technology offered and quality and condition of the facilities. We focus on operating outpatient services with \naccessibility and convenient service for patients and predictability and efficiency for physicians. \nTwo of the most significant factors that impact the competitive position of a hospital are the number and quality of \nphysicians affiliated with or employed by the hospital. Although physicians may at any time terminate their relationship \nwith a hospital we operate, our hospitals seek to retain physicians with varied specialties on the hospitals’ medical staffs \nand to attract other qualified physicians. We believe physicians refer patients to a hospital on the basis of the quality and \nscope of services it renders to patients and physicians, the quality of physicians on the medical staff, the location of the \nhospital and the quality of the hospital’s facilities, technology, equipment and employees. Accordingly, we strive to \nmaintain and provide quality facilities, technology, equipment, employees and services for physicians and patients. Our \nhospitals face competition from competitors that are implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing \nphysicians, acquiring physician practice groups and participating in ACOs or other clinical integration models. \nAnother major factor in the competitive position of our hospitals and other facilities is our ability to negotiate \nservice contracts with group purchasers of health care services. Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use \nof health care services and obtain discounts from providers’ established gross charges. Similarly, employers and \ntraditional health insurers continue to attempt to contain costs through negotiations with providers for managed care \nprograms and discounts from established gross charges. Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group \npurchasers of health care services on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of \nservices, quality of the medical staff and convenience. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to retain and \nrenew our contracts with third-party payers and enter into new contracts on favorable terms. Other health care providers \nmay impact our ability to enter into contracts with third-party payers or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and \nother favorable terms and conditions. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with \nmanaged care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with us. Price transparency \ninitiatives and increasing vertical integration efforts involving third-party payers and health care providers, among other \nfactors, may increase these challenges. Moreover, the trend toward consolidation among private third-party payers tends \nto increase payer bargaining power over fee structures. In addition, health reform efforts may lead to private third-party \npayers increasingly demanding reduced fees or being unwilling to negotiate reimbursement increases. Health plans \nincreasingly utilize narrow networks that restrict the number of participating providers or tiered networks that impose \nsignificantly higher cost sharing obligations on patients that obtain services from providers in a disfavored tier. The \nimportance of obtaining contracts with group purchasers of health care services varies from community to community, \ndepending on the market strength of such organizations. \n18"

      "text": "State certificate of need (“CON”) laws, which place limitations on a health care facility’s ability to expand services \nand facilities, make capital expenditures and otherwise make changes in operations, may also have the effect of restricting \ncompetition. We currently operate health care facilities in a number of states with CON laws or that require other types \nof approvals for the establishment or expansion of certain facility types or services. Before issuing a CON or other \napproval, these states consider the need for additional, changes in, or expanded health care facilities or services. Removal \nof these requirements could reduce barriers to entry and increase competition in our service areas. In those states that do \nnot require state approval or that set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state \nauthorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. Other federal and \nstate laws and regulations may also adversely impact our ability to expand, such as a regulation commonly known as the \n“36 Month Rule,” which restricts the assumption of Medicare billing privileges for certain home health agencies. In \naddition, changes in licensure or other laws or regulations and recognition of new provider types or payment models could \nimpact our competitive position. See Item 1, “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.” \nWe and the health care industry as a whole face the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care while \ndealing with rising costs and strong competition for patients. Changes in medical technology, existing and future \nlegislation, regulations and interpretations and contracting for provider services by third-party payers remain ongoing \nchallenges. \nAdmissions, average lengths of stay and reimbursement amounts continue to be negatively affected by third-party \npayer pre-admission authorization requirements, utilization review and pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative \nhealth care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Increased competition, admission constraints and third-party \npayer pressures are expected to continue. To meet these challenges, we intend to expand and update our facilities or \nacquire or construct new facilities where appropriate, enhance the provision of a comprehensive array of outpatient \nservices, offer market competitive pricing to group purchasers of health care services, upgrade facilities and equipment \nand offer new or expanded programs and services. \nRegulation and Other Factors \nLicensure, Certification and Accreditation \nHealth care facility construction and operation are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations relating \nto the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, maintenance of adequate \nrecords, fire prevention, rate-setting, building codes and environmental protection. Facilities are subject to periodic \ninspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for \nlicensing, certification, and accreditation. We believe our health care facilities are properly licensed under applicable state \nlaws. Each of our acute care hospitals located in the United States is eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms and is accredited by The Joint Commission. If any facility were to lose its Medicare or Medicaid certification, \nthe facility would be unable to receive reimbursement from federal health care programs. From time to time, we may \nacquire a facility that is not accredited but for which we will seek accreditation. If any facility were to lose accreditation, \nthe facility would be subject to state surveys, potentially be subject to increased scrutiny by CMS and likely lose payment \nfrom private third-party payers. \nThe Controlled Substances Act and Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) regulations require every person \nwho dispenses controlled substances to be registered with the DEA at each principal place of business or professional \npractice where the person dispenses controlled substances, subject to limited exceptions. Each hospital or clinic must hold \na DEA registration at each location and may be subject to similar state registration requirements. In addition, we are \nsubject to a variety of federal and state statutes and regulations that govern operational issues related to pharmaceuticals \nand controlled substances, such as those related to packaging, storing, and dispensing of pharmaceutical drugs, inventory \ncontrol and recordkeeping requirements for controlled substances, and other standards intended to prevent diversion of \ncontrolled substances. The DEA, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), HHS, and state boards of pharmacy have broad \nenforcement powers, may conduct audits and investigations and can impose substantial fines and other penalties, \nincluding revocation of registration. \nManagement believes our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and \nindependent review body regulations and standards. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are \nsubject to change, and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, \nequipment, personnel and services. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation also include notification \nor approval in the event of the transfer or change of ownership or certain other changes. Failure to provide required \nnotifications or obtain necessary approvals in these circumstances can result in the inability to complete an acquisition or \nchange of ownership, loss of licensure, lapses in reimbursement or other penalties. \n19"

      "text": "Certificates of Need \nIn some states where we operate hospitals and other health care providers, the construction or expansion of health \ncare facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities, the transfer or change of ownership, capital expenditures and the \naddition of new beds or services may be subject to review by and prior approval of, or notifications to, state regulatory \nagencies under a CON program. Such laws generally require the reviewing state agency to determine the public need for \nadditional or expanded health care facilities and services or other change. Failure to provide required notifications or \nobtain necessary state approvals can result in the inability to expand facilities, complete an acquisition or expenditure or \nchange ownership or other penalties. \nFederal Health Care Program Regulations \nParticipation in any federal health care program, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, is heavily \nregulated by statute and regulation. If a hospital or other provider fails to substantially comply with the numerous \nconditions of participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs or performs certain prohibited acts, the provider’s \nparticipation in the federal health care programs may be terminated, or civil and/or criminal penalties may be imposed. \nCivil monetary penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index. \nAnti-kickback Statute \nA section of the Social Security Act known as the “Anti-kickback Statute” prohibits providers and others from \ndirectly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals or \norders for services or items covered by a federal health care program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly and \nheld that there is a violation of the Anti-kickback Statute if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, \neven if there are other lawful purposes. Furthermore, knowledge of the law or the intent to violate the law is not required. \nViolations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be punished by criminal fines of up to $100,000 per violation, imprisonment, \nsubstantial civil monetary penalties per violation that are subject to annual adjustment based on updates to the consumer \nprice index and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in \nfederal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, submission of a claim for services or items \ngenerated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute may be subject to additional penalties under the federal False Claims \nAct (“FCA”) as a false or fraudulent claim. \nThe HHS Office of Inspector General (the “OIG”), among other regulatory agencies, is responsible for identifying \nand eliminating fraud, abuse and waste. The OIG carries out this mission through a nationwide program of audits, \ninvestigations and inspections. The OIG provides guidance to the industry through various methods, including advisory \nopinions and “Special Fraud Alerts.” These Special Fraud Alerts do not have the force of law, but identify features of \narrangements or transactions that the government believes may cause the arrangements or transactions to violate the Anti-\nkickback Statute or other federal health care laws. The OIG has identified several incentive arrangements that constitute \nsuspect practices, including: (a) payment of any incentive by a hospital each time a physician refers a patient to the \nhospital, (b) the use of free or significantly discounted office space or equipment in facilities usually located close to the \nhospital, (c) provision of free or significantly discounted billing, nursing or other staff services, (d) free training for a \nphysician’s office staff in areas such as management techniques and laboratory techniques, (e) guarantees which provide, \nif the physician’s income fails to reach a predetermined level, the hospital will pay any portion of the remainder, (f) low-\ninterest or interest-free loans, or loans which may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to the hospital, (g) payment of \nthe costs of a physician’s travel and expenses for conferences or payments to a physician for speaking engagements, (h) \ncoverage on the hospital’s group health insurance plans at an inappropriately low cost to the physician, (i) payment for \nservices (which may include consultations at the hospital) which require few, if any, substantive duties by the physician, \n(j) purchasing goods or services from physicians at prices in excess of their fair market value, (k) rental of space in \nphysician offices, at other than fair market value terms, by persons or entities to which physicians refer, and (l) physician-\nowned entities (frequently referred to as physician-owned distributorships or PODs) that derive revenue from selling, or \narranging for the sale of, implantable medical devices ordered by their physician-owners for use on procedures that \nphysician-owners perform on their own patients at hospitals or ASCs. The OIG has encouraged persons having \ninformation about hospitals who offer the above types of incentives to physicians to report such information to the OIG. \nThe OIG also issues “Special Advisory Bulletins” as a means of providing guidance to health care providers. These \nbulletins, along with the Special Fraud Alerts, have focused on certain arrangements that could be subject to heightened \nscrutiny by government enforcement authorities, including: (a) contractual joint venture arrangements and other joint \nventure arrangements between those in a position to refer business, such as physicians, and those providing items or \nservices for which Medicare or Medicaid pays, and (b) certain “gainsharing” arrangements, i.e., the practice of giving \nphysicians a share of any reduction in a hospital’s costs for patient care attributable in part to the physician’s efforts. \n20"

      "text": "In addition to issuing Special Fraud Alerts and Special Advisory Bulletins, the OIG issues compliance program \nguidance for certain types of health care providers. The OIG guidance identifies a number of risk areas under federal fraud \nand abuse statutes and regulations. These areas of risk include compensation arrangements with physicians, recruitment \narrangements with physicians and joint venture relationships with physicians. \nAs authorized by Congress, the OIG has published safe harbor regulations that outline categories of activities \ndeemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. Currently, there are statutory exceptions and safe \nharbors for various activities, including the following: certain investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, \npractitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties, \ndiscounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, \nmanaged care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in group practices, freestanding \nsurgery centers, ambulance replenishing, referral agreements for specialty services, care coordination arrangements, \narrangements for patient engagement and support, CMS-sponsored model arrangements, cybersecurity technology and \nrelated services, and value-based arrangements. \nThe fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or is identified in a Special Fraud \nAlert, Special Advisory Bulletin or other guidance does not necessarily render the conduct or business arrangement illegal \nunder the Anti-kickback Statute. However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by \ngovernment enforcement authorities. \nWe have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or influence the referral of \npatients to our hospitals, other health care facilities and employed physicians, including employment contracts, leases, \nmedical director agreements and professional service agreements. We also have similar relationships with physicians and \nfacilities to which patients are referred from our facilities and other providers. In addition, we provide financial incentives, \nincluding minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into the communities served by our hospitals. While we \nendeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and \nfinancial relationships with physicians and other referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do \nnot qualify for safe harbor protection. \nAlthough we believe our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients have been \nstructured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance regulatory authorities \nenforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements comply with the Anti-kickback Statute or other \napplicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us to liabilities under the Social Security Act and other laws, \nincluding criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other \nfederal health care programs. \nStark Law \nThe Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” The Stark Law prohibits \nphysicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family \nmembers have a financial relationship, if these entities provide certain “designated health services” reimbursable by \nMedicare or Medicaid unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits entities that provide designated health \nservices reimbursable by Medicare and Medicaid from billing the Medicare and Medicaid programs for any items or \nservices that result from a prohibited referral and requires the entities to refund amounts received for items or services \nprovided pursuant to the prohibited referral on a timely basis. “Designated health services” include inpatient and outpatient \nhospital services, clinical laboratory services, radiology and certain other imaging services, radiation therapy services and \nhome health services. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, substantial civil monetary penalties \nper claim submitted and exclusion from the federal health care programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result \nof a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and \nadditional penalties under the FCA. The statute also provides for a penalty for a circumvention scheme. These penalties \nare updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. \nThere are exceptions to the self-referral prohibition for many of the customary financial arrangements between \nphysicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases, recruitment agreements and personal service \narrangements. Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-kickback Statute with which compliance is voluntary, a financial \nrelationship must comply with every requirement of a Stark Law exception or the arrangement is in violation of the Stark \nLaw. Although there is an exception for a physician’s ownership interest in an entire hospital, the Affordable Care Act \nprohibits physician-owned hospitals established after December 31, 2010 from billing for Medicare or Medicaid patients \nreferred by their physician owners. As a result, the law effectively prevents the formation of new physician-owned \nhospitals that participate in Medicare or Medicaid. While the Affordable Care Act grandfathers existing physician-owned \nhospitals, it does not allow these hospitals to increase the percentage of physician ownership and significantly restricts \ntheir ability to expand services. \n21"

      "text": "Through a series of rulemakings, CMS has issued final regulations implementing the Stark Law. While these \nregulations were intended to clarify the requirements of the exceptions to the Stark Law, it is unclear how the government \nwill interpret many of these exceptions for enforcement purposes. Further, we do not always have the benefit of significant \nregulatory or judicial interpretation of the Stark Law and its implementing regulations. We attempt to structure our \nrelationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and \ncomplex, and are subject to continuing legal and regulatory change. We cannot assure that every relationship complies \nfully with the Stark Law. \nOther Fraud and Abuse Provisions \nCertain federal fraud and abuse laws apply to all health benefit programs and provide for criminal penalties. The \nSocial Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for making false claims and statements to Medicare and \nMedicaid. False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered or for misrepresenting actual \nservices rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement, billing for unnecessary goods and services and cost report \nfraud. Federal enforcement officials have the ability to exclude from Medicare and Medicaid any business entities and \nany investors, officers and managing employees associated with business entities that have committed health care fraud, \neven if the officer or managing employee had no knowledge of the fraud. Criminal and civil penalties may be imposed \nfor a number of other prohibited activities, including failure to return known overpayments, certain gainsharing \narrangements, billing Medicare amounts that are substantially in excess of a provider’s usual charges, offering \nremuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary’s selection of a health care provider, contracting with an \nindividual or entity known to be excluded from a federal health care program, making or accepting a payment to induce \na physician to reduce or limit services, and soliciting or receiving any remuneration in return for referring an individual \nfor an item or service payable by a federal health care program. Like the Anti-kickback Statute, these provisions are very \nbroad. Civil penalties may be imposed for the failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying \nthe overpayment or by the date a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later. To avoid liability, providers must, \namong other things, carefully and accurately code claims for reimbursement, promptly return overpayments and \naccurately prepare cost reports. \nSome of these provisions, including the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, require a lower burden of proof than \nother fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute. Substantial civil monetary penalties may be imposed \nunder the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law. These penalties will be updated annually based on changes to the consumer \nprice index. In some cases, violations of the Civil Monetary Penalty Law may result in penalties of up to three times the \nremuneration offered, paid, solicited or received. In addition, a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state \nhealth care programs. Federal and state governments increasingly use the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, especially \nwhere they believe they cannot meet the higher burden of proof requirements under the Anti-kickback Statute. Further, \nindividuals can receive up to $1,000 for providing information on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of \nat least $100 of Medicare funds under the Medicare Integrity Program. \nIn addition, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (“EKRA”) establishes criminal penalties for \npaying, receiving, soliciting or offering any remuneration in return for referring a patient to a laboratory, clinical treatment \nfacility or recovery home, or in exchange for an individual using the services of one of these entities. The EKRA \nprohibitions apply to services covered by government health care programs and by private health plans. There is limited \nguidance with respect to the application of EKRA. \nState Fraud and Abuse Laws \nMany states in which we operate also have laws intended to prevent fraud and abuse within the health care industry. \nSome of these laws are similar to the Anti-kickback Statute, prohibiting payments to physicians for patient referrals, and \nto the Stark Law, prohibiting certain self-referrals. These state laws often apply regardless of the source of payment for \ncare, and little precedent exists for their interpretation or enforcement. These statutes typically provide for criminal and \ncivil penalties, as well as loss of licensure. \nThe Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws \nWe are subject to state and federal laws that govern the submission of claims for reimbursement and prohibit the \nmaking of false claims or statements. One of the most prominent of these laws is the FCA, which may be enforced by the \nfederal government directly or by a qui tam plaintiff, or whistleblower, on the government’s behalf. The government may \nuse the FCA to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud in areas such as coding errors, billing for services \nnot provided and submitting false cost reports. In addition, the FCA covers payments made in connection with the \nExchanges created under the Affordable Care Act, if those payments include any federal funds. When a private party \nbrings a qui tam action under the FCA, the defendant is not made aware of the lawsuit until the government commences \nits own investigation or makes a determination whether it will intervene. If a defendant is determined by a court of law to \n22"

      "text": "be liable under the FCA, the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, \nplus substantial mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. These penalties are updated annually based on \nchanges to the consumer price index. \nThere are many potential bases for liability under the FCA. Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits \na false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The FCA defines the term “knowingly” broadly. Though \nsimple negligence will not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or \nfalsity constitutes a “knowing” submission under the FCA and, therefore, may create liability. Submission of claims for \nservices or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA. \nWhistleblowers and the federal government have taken the position, and some courts have held, that providers who \nallegedly have violated other statutes, such as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the FCA. False \nclaims under the FCA also include the knowing and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to the government \nin a timely manner following identification of an overpayment. An overpayment is deemed to be identified when a person \nhas, or should have through reasonable diligence, determined that an overpayment was received and quantified the \noverpayment. \nEvery entity that receives at least $5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written policies for all \nemployees, contractors or agents, providing detailed information about false claims, false statements and whistleblower \nprotections under certain federal laws, including the FCA, and similar state laws. In addition, federal law provides an \nincentive to states to enact false claims laws comparable to the FCA. A number of states in which we operate have adopted \ntheir own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions under which a private party may file a \ncivil lawsuit in state court. We have adopted and distributed policies pertaining to the FCA and relevant state laws. \nHIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy, Security and Interoperability Requirements \nThe Administrative Simplification Provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 \n(“HIPAA”) and implementing regulations require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards and code sets \nfor certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. In addition, HIPAA requires \neach provider to use a National Provider Identifier. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in \nthe health care industry. \nThe privacy and security regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA extensively regulate the use and disclosure \nof individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information,” and require covered entities, \nincluding health plans and most health care providers, to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to \nprotect the security of such information. Certain provisions of the security and privacy regulations apply to business \nassociates (entities that handle protected health information on behalf of covered entities), and business associates are \nsubject to direct liability for violation of these provisions. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to penalties as a \nresult of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. \nCovered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without \nunreasonable delay but not to exceed 60 days after discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Notification \nmust also be made to HHS and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to publish \non its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. All non-permitted \nuses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or \nbusiness associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. Various state laws \nand regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually \nidentifiable information. \nViolations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in criminal penalties and in substantial civil \npenalties per violation. These civil penalties are updated annually based on updates to the consumer price index. HHS \nenforces the regulations and performs compliance audits. In addition to enforcement by HHS, state attorneys general are \nauthorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy \nof state residents. HHS may resolve HIPAA violations through informal means, such as allowing a covered entity to \nimplement a corrective action plan, but HHS has the discretion to move directly to impose monetary penalties and is \nrequired to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. We enforce compliance in accordance with \nHIPAA privacy and security regulations. The Information Protection and Security Department monitors our compliance \nwith the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. The HIPAA privacy regulations and security regulations have and will \ncontinue to impose significant costs on our facilities in order to comply with these standards. \n23"

      "text": "There are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing \nprivacy and security concerns. Our facilities remain subject to federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive \nthan the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. For example, \nthe Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data \nbreaches. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), which was significantly amended by the \nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), the Colorado Privacy Act, the Utah Privacy Act and the Virginia Consumer \nData Protection Act each afford consumers expanded privacy protections. These provide for civil penalties for violations, \nand the CCPA and CPRA provide for a private right of action for data breaches. Additionally, several privacy bills have \nbeen proposed both at the federal and state level that may result in additional legal requirements that impact our business. \nThe potential effects of these laws are far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies \nand to incur substantial costs and expenses in order to comply. For example, residents in states with comprehensive \nprivacy laws have expanded rights to access and require deletion and portability of their personal information, opt out of \ncertain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. \nMany foreign data privacy regulations (including the UK Data Protection Legislation) are more stringent than those \nin the United States. In the case of non-compliance with these regulations, regulators may impose administrative fines \nwhich are based on a multi-factored approach. \nHealth care providers and industry participants are also subject to a growing number of requirements intended to \npromote the interoperability and exchange of patient health information. For example, health care providers and certain \nother entities are subject to information blocking restrictions pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act that prohibit practices \nthat are likely to interfere with the access, exchange or use of electronic health information, except as required by law or \nspecified by HHS as a reasonable and necessary activity. Violations may result in penalties or other disincentives. \nEMTALA \nAll of our hospitals in the United States are subject to EMTALA. This federal law requires any hospital participating \nin the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every individual who presents to \nthe hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to \neither stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. \nThe obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for \ntreatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer an \nindividual or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the individual’s ability to pay. \nPenalties for violations of EMTALA include exclusion from participation in the Medicare program and civil monetary \npenalties. These civil monetary penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index. In addition, \nan injured individual, the individual’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of a \nhospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital. \nThe government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which individuals do not actually present to a \nhospital’s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital’s campus, generally, or \nto a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, \nsubject to certain exceptions. At least one court has interpreted the law also to apply to a hospital that has been notified \nof a patient’s pending arrival in a non-hospital owned ambulance. In recent years, the government has undertaken \nenforcement actions in which it has broadly interpreted a hospital’s obligations with respect to screening and stabilizing \npatients who present with a psychiatric emergency. EMTALA does not generally apply to individuals admitted for \ninpatient services. The government has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively. \nHospitals may face conflicting interpretations of EMTALA’s requirements with respect to state laws that limit access to \nabortion or other reproductive health services. For example, HHS has provided guidance regarding EMTALA obligations \nspecific to patients who are pregnant or are experiencing pregnancy loss and the preemption of state law. This guidance \nis the subject of legal challenges, and a federal district court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of \nthe guidance in Texas and against members of certain professional groups involved in the litigation. \nCorporate Practice of Medicine/Fee Splitting \nSome of the states in which we operate have laws prohibiting corporations and other entities not owned by \nphysicians or other permitted health professionals from employing physicians or certain other health professionals, \npracticing medicine for a profit and making certain direct and indirect payments to, or entering into fee-splitting \narrangements with, health care providers designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the \nrecommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services. Possible sanctions for violation of these \nrestrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and \n24"

This media and public \nattention, changes in government personnel and other factors have led to increased scrutiny of the health care industry. \nExcept as may be disclosed in our SEC filings, we are not aware of any material investigations of the Company under \nfederal or state health care laws or regulations. It is possible that governmental entities could initiate investigations or \nlitigation in the future at facilities we operate and that such matters could result in significant penalties, as well as adverse \npublicity. It is also possible that our executives and managers could be included in governmental investigations or \nlitigation or named as defendants in private litigation. \nOur substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings result in heightened scrutiny of our operations. \nWe continue to monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program \nthat is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. \nHowever, because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigations or litigation \nmay result in interpretations that are inconsistent with our practices or industry practices. \nIn public statements surrounding current investigations, governmental authorities have taken positions on a number \nof issues, including some for which little official interpretation previously has been available, that appear to be inconsistent \nwith practices that have been common within the industry and that previously have not been challenged in this manner. \nIn some instances, government investigations that have in the past been conducted under the civil provisions of federal \nlaw may now be conducted as criminal investigations. \nBoth federal and state government agencies have increased their focus on and coordination of civil and criminal \nenforcement efforts in the health care area. Through the national Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program, the OIG \nand the DOJ coordinate federal, state and local law enforcement activities with respect to health care fraud against both \npublic and private health plans. The OIG and DOJ have, from time to time, established national enforcement initiatives \nthat target all hospital providers, focusing on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse. In addition, \ngovernmental agencies and their agents, such as MACs, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, may conduct audits of our \nhealth care operations. Private third-party payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal \naudits and monitoring. \nIn addition to national enforcement initiatives, federal and state investigations have addressed a wide variety of \nroutine health care operations such as: cost reporting and billing practices, including for Medicare outliers; financial \narrangements with referral sources; physician recruitment activities; physician joint ventures; and hospital charges and \ncollection practices for self-pay patients. We engage in many of these routine health care operations and other activities \nthat could be the subject of governmental investigations or inquiries. For example, we have significant Medicare and \nMedicaid billings, numerous financial arrangements with physicians who are referral sources to our hospitals, and joint \nventure arrangements involving physician investors. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and other facilities \nmay receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Any additional \ninvestigations of the Company, our executives or managers could result in significant liabilities or penalties to us, as well \nas adverse publicity. \nHealth Care Reform \nThe health care industry is subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences, along with various \nscientific and technological initiatives and innovations. In recent years, the U.S. health care industry has undergone \nsignificant changes at the federal and state levels, many of which have been aimed at reducing costs and government \nspending and increasing access to health insurance. The most prominent of these efforts, the Affordable Care Act, affects \nhow health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed. The Affordable Care Act increased health insurance \ncoverage through a combination of private sector health insurance requirements, public program expansion and other \nreforms. \nThere is uncertainty regarding the ongoing net effect of the Affordable Care Act, particularly as it has been, and \ncontinues to be, subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges. For example, effective January 1, \n2019, the penalty associated with the individual mandate to maintain health insurance was effectively eliminated. \nHowever, some states have imposed individual health insurance mandates, and other states have explored or offer public \nhealth insurance options. To increase access to health insurance during COVID-19, the ARPA enhanced subsidies for \nindividuals eligible to purchase coverage through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The Inflation Reduction Act, enacted \nin August 2022, extends these enhanced subsidies through 2025. In addition, in a final rule published in September 2021, \n25"

      "text": "HHS extended the annual open enrollment period for coverage through federal marketplaces and granted state exchanges \nflexibility to lengthen their open enrollment periods. These changes and initiatives may impact the number of individuals \nthat elect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased. \nThe expansion in public program coverage under the Affordable Care Act has been driven primarily by expanding \nthe categories of individuals eligible for Medicaid coverage and permitting individuals with relatively higher incomes to \nqualify. However, a number of states, including Texas and Florida, have opted out of the Medicaid expansion provisions. \nSome states use, or have applied to use, waivers granted by CMS to implement expansion, impose different eligibility or \nenrollment conditions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. The Medicaid landscape is \nconstantly evolving as the federal and state governments consider and test various models of delivery and payment system \nreform. \nIn addition, there is uncertainty regarding the potential impact of other reform efforts at the federal and state levels. \nFor example, some members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage, \nincluding proposals to expand coverage of federally-funded insurance programs as an alternative to private insurance or \nestablish a single-payer system (such reforms often referred to as “Medicare for All”). Other recent initiatives and \nproposals include those aimed at price transparency and out-of-network charges, which may impact prices and the \nrelationships between health care providers, insurers and patients. For example, the No Surprises Act imposes various \nrequirements on providers and health plans intended to prevent “surprise” medical bills, and several states have \nimplemented similar laws intended to protect consumers. The No Surprises Act prohibits providers from charging patients \nan amount beyond the in-network cost sharing amount for items and services rendered by out-of-network providers (i.e., \nprohibits balance billing), subject to limited exceptions. The No Surprises Act also impacts the payment received by an \nout-of-network provider from a health plan for items and services to which the prohibitions on balance billing apply. For \nitems and services for which balance billing is prohibited (even when no balance billing occurs), the No Surprises Act \nestablishes an independent dispute resolution (“IDR”) process for providers and payers to handle payment disputes that \ncannot be resolved through direct negotiations. Regulations implementing the IDR provisions of the No Surprises Act \nprovide that, when making a payment determination, the IDR must consider the qualifying payment amount, or QPA \n(which is generally the payer’s median contracted rate for the same or similar service in an area), and all additional \npermissible information submitted by each party. The IDR entity must select the offer that best represents the value of the \nitem or service under dispute. However, the final rule establishing the IDR process is currently the subject of legal \nchallenges. On February 6, 2023, a federal judge vacated parts of the rule, including provisions related to consideration \nof the QPA. The No Surprises Act also requires providers to send an insured patient’s health plan a good faith estimate \nof expected charges, including billing and diagnostic codes, prior to when the patient is scheduled to receive the item or \nservice. HHS is deferring enforcement of this requirement until it issues additional regulations. The No Surprises Act also \nrequires providers to provide a good faith estimate of expected charges to uninsured or self-pay individuals in connection \nwith scheduled items or services, in advance of the date of the scheduled item or service or upon request of the individual. \nHHS is delaying enforcement with regard to good faith estimates that do not include expected charges for co-providers \nor co-facilities until the agency issues additional regulations. If the actual charges to an uninsured or self-pay patient are \nsubstantially higher than the estimate or the provider furnishes an item or service that was not included in the good faith \nestimate, the patient may invoke a patient-provider dispute resolution process established by regulation to challenge the \nhigher amount. \nOther trends toward transparency and value-based purchasing may impact the competitive position and patient \nvolumes of providers. For example, the CMS Care Compare website makes available to the public certain data that \nhospitals, home health agencies, hospices, and other Medicare-certified providers submit in connection with Medicare \nreimbursement claims, including performance data on quality measures and patient satisfaction. Medicare reimbursement \nmay be adjusted based on quality and efficiency measures and/or compliance with quality reporting requirements. In \naddition, hospitals are required by federal regulation to publish online payer-specific negotiated charges and de-identified \nminimum and maximum charges. Some price transparency obligations apply only to payers. For example, CMS requires \nhealth insurers to publish online charges negotiated with providers for health care services. Starting January 1, 2023, \nhealth insurers must provide online price comparison tools to help individuals get personalized cost estimates for covered \nitems and services. Other industry participants, such as private payers and large employer groups and their affiliates, may \nalso introduce financial or delivery system reforms. For example, in recent years, there have been trends influenced by \nprivate and/or public payers toward enrollment in managed care programs, favoring outpatient care over inpatient care, \nand provider consolidation. These issues are further discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” \nGeneral Economic and Demographic Factors \nThe health care industry is impacted by changes in or uncertainty regarding the overall U.S. economy. COVID-19 \nhas adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, economic conditions in the United States. In addition, \noutside of COVID-19-related stimulus and relief measures, budget deficits at the federal level and within some state and \nlocal government entities have had a negative impact on spending for many health and human service programs, including \n26"

      "text": "Medicare, Medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant payer sources for our hospitals and other providers. \nWe anticipate that the federal deficit, the growing magnitude of Medicare and Medicaid expenditures and the aging of the \nU.S. population will continue to place pressure on government health care programs. Other risks we face during periods \nof economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines in the population covered under managed care \nagreements, increased patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and nonemergency health care procedures \n(including delaying surgical procedures), potential increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations, increased \nadoption of health plan structures that shift financial responsibility to patients and increased difficulties in collecting \npatient receivables for copayment and deductible amounts. \nCompliance Program \nWe maintain a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal \nguidelines and industry standards. The program is intended to monitor and raise awareness of various regulatory issues \namong employees and to emphasize the importance of complying with governmental laws and regulations. As part of the \nethics and compliance program, we provide annual ethics and compliance training to our employees and encourage all \nemployees to report any violations to their supervisor, an ethics and compliance officer or to the Company’s ethics line \navailable 24 hours a day by phone and internet portal. \nAntitrust Laws \nThe federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed \nto be anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, market allocation, bid-rigging, concerted refusal to deal, market \nmonopolization, price discrimination, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and other practices that have, or \nmay have, an adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, \nincluding criminal and civil penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is currently a priority of the Federal \nTrade Commission and the DOJ, including with respect to hospital and physician practice acquisitions. We believe we \nare in compliance with such federal and state laws, but courts or regulatory authorities may reach a determination in the \nfuture that could adversely affect our operations and growth strategy. \nEnvironmental Matters \nWe are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into \nthe environment. We do not believe that we will be required to expend any material amounts in order to comply with \nthese laws and regulations as presently in effect. Regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and energy inputs may \nincrease in coming years, which may increase our costs associated with compliance, disrupt and adversely affect our \noperations and could materially, adversely affect our financial performance. \nOur environmental strategy is designed to complement our mission of the care and improvement of human life, \nwhich extends to the environment. This strategy is centered on incorporating the following four pillars into our operations: \n• \nManaging energy and water responsibly, \n• \nEnhancing our climate resilience, \n• \nSourcing and consuming efficiently, and \n• \nManaging the environmental impact of our capital programs. \nWe are pursuing a plan to reduce our scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 in line with the Paris \nAgreement 1.5℃ emissions reduction goal. Our initiatives contemplate operational changes intended to reduce energy \nconsumption, including by accelerating related capital investments, new technology pilots, renewable energy contracting \nand investments, and medical gas initiatives. We have baselined our scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions for \n2021, and we are updating those calculations for 2022 activity to measure trends in our greenhouse gas emissions. We are \nexploring a process to measure scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in the future. \nIn 2022, we released our inaugural Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (“TCFD”) report to provide \nadditional insight into our commitment to improving our environmental impact and strengthening our climate resilience \nto support the communities we serve. The report follows TCFD guidance and outlines the ways we are integrating climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities into our governance structure, our risk management and strategy development processes, \nand how we establish and track climate-related metrics and targets. We plan to continue following established guidelines \nto assess and better understand the physical and transition risks from climate change that we believe most significantly \nimpact our operations. We have also integrated climate-related risk assessment into our established enterprise risk \nmanagement function. \n27"

In addition to the Executive \nDiversity Council, we have implemented DEI Councils comprised of diversity leaders and facility representatives and \nadded division-based DEI leaders to support local deployment of DEI strategies and programs across the enterprise. \nIn the beginning of 2020, we launched a DEI strategy based on internal and external research to support the \nadvancement of people of color and women into leadership roles. We have since established nine employee resource \ngroups to provide colleagues opportunities to convene around shared experiences, including groups for Black colleagues, \nwomen, young professionals, LGBTQ+, Hispanic/Latinx, and Asian colleagues, veterans, colleagues with disabilities, \nand a group focused on mental health and wellness – each with a senior leader serving as executive sponsor. In addition, \nthe Company launched a sponsorship program in 2022 for a cohort of Black colleagues to support leadership and \nadvancement, which has since expanded to include a broader focus on Black, Asian, and Hispanic leaders. \nThe Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines reinforce its commitment to diversity by requiring the initial \npool of candidates from which the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may recommend director nominees \nto include qualified female and racially/ethnically diverse candidates and the Nominating and Corporate Governance \nCommittee to request that any third-party search firm that it engages to identify such candidates to include qualified \nfemale and racially/ethnically diverse candidates in such initial pool. \nWe encourage you to review the “Diversity, Equity and Inclusion” section of our website, which includes our \nEEO-1 data, as well as our 2022 Impact Report (available at www.hcahealthcareimpact.com) for more detailed \n28"

At December 31, 2022, certain employees at 37 of our domestic hospitals are represented by \nvarious labor unions. No union elections occurred at any of our domestic facilities in 2022. While no elections are \nscheduled in 2023, it is possible that employees at additional hospitals may unionize in the future, or employees currently \nrepresented by labor unions may choose to reject that representation. We have not experienced work stoppages that have \nmaterially, adversely affected our business or results of operations. However, it is possible that a material work stoppage \nat one or more of our hospitals may occur in the future. \nPhysicians are an integral part of the success of our hospitals in delivering quality care to our patients. Our hospitals \nare staffed by licensed physicians, including both employed physicians and physicians who are not employees of our \nhospitals. Some physicians provide services in our hospitals under contracts, which generally describe a term of service, \nprovide and establish the duties and obligations of such physicians, require the maintenance of certain performance criteria \nand set compensation for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of \nour hospitals, but the hospital’s medical staff and the appropriate governing board of the hospital, in accordance with \nestablished credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals \noften also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at \nany time. \nOur facilities, like most health care facilities, have experienced rising labor costs and turnover. In some markets, \nnurse and medical support personnel availability and retention have become significant operating issues for health care \nproviders, including the Company. These challenges have been exacerbated by the effects that COVID-19 has had on \nhealth care personnel. Nurse and medical support shortages have resulted in a number of adverse impacts to our business, \nincluding capacity and growth constraints, reduced patient satisfaction, reduced physician satisfaction, impact on services \noffered and increased costs, among others. To address this challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to improve \nretention, recruiting, compensation programs and productivity. \nWe may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support \npersonnel and to utilize more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could continue to \nincrease at rates in excess of historical levels. We also depend on the available labor pool of employees in each of the \nmarkets in which we operate to fill other necessary positions. If there is additional union organizing activity or a significant \nportion of our employee base unionizes, our costs could increase. In addition, we operate in several states that have \nadopted mandatory nurse-staffing ratios, mandate staffing committees to develop staffing plans or require public reporting \nof nurse staffing levels. If these states reduce mandatory nurse to patient ratios or additional states in which we operate \nadopt mandatory nurse to patient ratios, such changes could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact \non revenues if we are required to limit patient admissions in order to meet the required ratios. \nThe inability to attract, retain and utilize sufficient, quality clinical and non-clinical personnel could impair our \ncapacity, ability to grow and our results of operations. \n30"

Risk Factors \nIf any of the events discussed in the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial position, results of \noperations, cash flows or prospects could be materially, adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not \npresently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect us. COVID-19 amplifies and exacerbates \nmany of the risks we face in our business operations, including those discussed below. Our business is subject to the \nfollowing material risks and uncertainties. \nRisks related to COVID-19 and other potential pandemics: \nCOVID-19 has affected, and may continue to affect, our operations. Further, COVID-19 could negatively impact our \nbusiness, financial condition, and cash flows, particularly if it causes public health conditions and/or economic \nconditions to deteriorate. \nAs a front-line provider of health care services, we have been and continue to be affected by the health and economic \neffects of COVID-19. Although vaccines and booster shots for the virus causing COVID-19 are widely available in the \nUnited States, COVID-19 has continued to result in a significant number of hospitalizations. COVID-19 continues to \nevolve, including as a result of mutations of the virus. Due to the concentration of our hospitals in Florida and Texas, we \nmay be particularly sensitive to increases in COVID-19 cases in those states, where COVID-19 could have a \ndisproportionate effect on our business. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact our business, results of \noperations, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be \naccurately predicted. We are unable to predict the severity or duration of impacts related to COVID-19, including direct \nor indirect impacts on macroeconomic conditions. \nWe continue to work with federal, state and local health authorities to respond to COVID-19 cases in the markets \nwe serve and continue to take and support measures to try to limit the spread of the virus and to mitigate the burden on \nthe health care system. We expect to continue to incur additional costs, which may be significant, as a result of operational \nchanges in response to COVID-19. Further, our response to COVID-19 has required and may continue to require a \nsubstantial investment of management’s time and resources across our enterprise, which may affect our ability to properly \nprioritize and successfully execute on the Company’s strategic initiatives. \nWe have implemented considerable safety measures within our hospitals and other facilities in response to COVID-\n19. Nonetheless, treatment of COVID-19 patients has associated risks, which may include the manner in which patients \nand our physicians and clinical staff perceive and respond to such risks. These risks may result in reduced operating \ncapacity, impaired employee morale and increased exposure to workforce disruptions. Furthermore, we have experienced \nand may continue to experience supply chain disruptions, including delays and price increases in equipment, \npharmaceuticals and medical supplies and supply shortages. Continued constraints on staffing and equipment, laboratory \nresources and pharmaceutical and medical supplies shortages may impact our ability to schedule, admit and treat patients. \nIn addition, we may be subject to claims from patients, employees and others exposed to COVID-19 at our facilities. Such \nactions may involve large demands, as well as substantial defense costs. Our insurance, a portion of which is provided \nthrough our insurance subsidiaries, may not cover all claims against us. \n33"

      "text": "Our operations and financial performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by actions taken by \ngovernmental authorities in response to COVID-19. Some of these measures, such as restrictions on elective procedures, \nreduced, and may in the future reduce, the volume of procedures performed at our facilities, as well as the volume of \nemergency room and physician office visits unrelated to COVID-19. Moreover, we believe that some individuals have \nelected to postpone medical care for an undetermined period of time as a result of COVID-19, impacting patient volumes \nin comparison to pre-pandemic levels. While patient volumes began rebounding in the second quarter of 2021 as the \neffects of COVID-19 moderated and pandemic-related restrictions and policies were eased, we experienced a resurgence \nin COVID-19 cases in the latter half of 2021 and early 2022, further impacting the return to pre-pandemic levels. We \ncannot provide assurances as to the continued recovery and stability of pre-pandemic patient volumes or the ultimate \nimpact on demand. Further, our patient volumes may be adversely impacted by the expanded use of telehealth services \nfrom other providers as a result of reduced regulatory barriers on the use and reimbursement of telehealth services and \nindividuals becoming more comfortable with receiving remote care. The Company may not be able to timely innovate its \nstrategies and technologies to meet changing consumer demands as a result of COVID-19. It is possible that COVID-19 \ncould continue to impact patient behavior in future periods. \nBeginning in 2020 and continuing through 2022, we experienced increased patient acuity as a result of COVID-19 \ncases at our hospitals, which led to increased reimbursements. However, the impacts of COVID-19, including patient \nacuity levels, in future periods may vary, and could exert unpredictable and potentially negative effects on clinical \nperformance metrics that impact reimbursement levels and could adversely affect our results of operations. \nDevelopments related to COVID-19, including broad economic factors related to COVID-19 and public health \nconditions, may have a material, adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \nThe ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business will depend on, among other factors, the duration and severity of any \nsevere or widespread outbreaks of COVID-19; the impact of COVID-19 on economic conditions; the volume of canceled \nor rescheduled procedures at our facilities; the volume of COVID-19 patients cared for across our health systems; the \navailability, acceptance of, and need for effective vaccines and medical treatments; the spread of potentially more \ncontagious and/or virulent forms of the virus; and the impact of government actions on the health care industry and broader \neconomy. COVID-19 continues to evolve, and we may not be able to predict or effectively respond to future \ndevelopments. \nThe foregoing and other continued disruptions to our business as a result of COVID-19 could heighten the risks in \ncertain of the other risk factors described in this annual report on Form 10-K, any of which could have a material, adverse \neffect on our results of operations and financial position. \nWe are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the CARES Act and other stimulus and relief legislation or the effect \nthat such legislation and other governmental responses intended to assist providers in responding to COVID-19 may \nhave on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. \nIn response to COVID-19, federal and state governments have passed legislation, promulgated regulations and \ntaken other administrative actions intended to assist health care providers in providing care to COVID-19 and other \npatients and to provide financial relief to health care providers. Together, the CARES Act, the Paycheck Protection \nProgram and Health Care Enhancement (“PPPHCE”) Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (“CAA”) and the \nARPA authorized over $186 billion in funding to be distributed to hospitals and other health care providers through the \nPublic Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (“PHSSEF”), also known as the Provider Relief Fund, and expanded \nthe Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program. Funds from the Provider Relief Fund are intended to reimburse \neligible providers and suppliers for health care-related expenses or lost revenues attributable to COVID-19 and are not \nrequired to be repaid, provided that recipients attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions. In addition, a portion \nof the available funding was distributed to reimburse health care providers that submitted claims requests for COVID-19-\nrelated treatment, testing and vaccine administration for uninsured patients at Medicare rates. Recipients of these claims \nreimbursements must attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions, including confirming that patients are \nuninsured, limitations on balance billings and not using funds to reimburse expenses or losses that other sources are \nobligated to reimburse. We received general and targeted distributions from the Provider Relief Fund in 2020, but during \nthe fourth quarter of 2020, we returned or repaid early approximately $6.1 billion of our share of the Provider Relief Fund \ndistributions and all Medicare accelerated payments. \nThe CARES Act and related legislation have also made other forms of financial assistance available to health care \nproviders. For example, CMS has increased payment under the hospital inpatient PPS by 20% for discharges of individuals \ndiagnosed with COVID-19 and provides an add-on payment for eligible inpatient cases that use certain new products to \ntreat COVID-19. \nThe CARES Act and related legislation temporarily suspended the Medicare sequestration payment adjustment, \nwhich would have otherwise reduced payments to Medicare providers by 2% as required by the BCA. The sequestration \n34"

      "text": "adjustment was phased back in with a 1% reduction beginning April 1, 2022, and returned to 2% on July 1, 2022. The \nBCA sequestration has been extended through the first six months of 2032. The APRA, in addition to providing funding \nfor health care providers, increased the federal budget deficit in a manner that triggers an additional statutorily mandated \nsequestration under the PAYGO Act. As a result, an additional Medicare payment reduction of up to 4% was required to \ntake effect in January 2022. However, Congress has delayed implementation of this payment reduction until 2025. \nBeyond financial assistance, federal and state governments have enacted legislation, established regulations and \nissued waivers intended to expand access to and payment for telehealth services, increase access to medical supplies and \nequipment, prioritize review of drug applications to help with shortages of emergency drugs, and ease various legal and \nregulatory burdens on health care providers. HHS and CMS have announced other flexibilities for health care providers \nin response to COVID-19, such as temporary modifications of certain value-based care programs, implementing special \nscoring and payment policies intended to mitigate negative effects of the PHE on providers participating in some of these \nprograms. It is unclear how these changes will affect our financial condition. \nCOVID-19 continues to evolve, and there is uncertainty regarding the ultimate impact to our business of \ngovernmental efforts to assist health care providers responding to and otherwise affected by COVID-19. As the United \nStates has experienced a moderation of infection and related hospitalization rates in comparison to earlier periods, federal \nand state governments have shifted to reducing or terminating certain temporary measures that were implemented earlier \nin the COVID-19 PHE. Many of the measures allowing for flexibility in delivery of care and various financial supports \nfor health care providers are available only until funds expire or for the duration of the PHE. The current PHE declared \nby HHS expires May 11, 2023. The presidential administration has indicated that the public health emergency will not be \nextended. Termination of the PHE may impact our operations and financial results. Further, there can be no assurance \nthat the terms and conditions of relief programs will not change or be interpreted in ways that affect our ability to comply \nwith such terms and conditions, including in cases where our partners have retained such assistance. We continue to assess \nthe potential impact of COVID-19 and government responses to COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, \nfinancial condition and cash flows. \nThe emergence and effects related to a potential future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease could \nadversely affect our operations. \nIf a pandemic, epidemic, outbreak of an infectious disease or other public health crisis were to occur in an area in \nwhich we operate, our operations could be adversely affected. Such a crisis could diminish the public trust in health care \nfacilities, especially hospitals that fail to accurately or timely diagnose, or are treating (or have treated) patients affected \nby infectious diseases. If any of our facilities were involved, or perceived as being involved, in treating patients from such \nan infectious disease, patients might cancel elective procedures or fail to seek needed care at our facilities, and our \nreputation may be negatively affected. Patient volumes may decline or volumes of uninsured and underinsured patients \nmay increase, depending on the economic circumstances surrounding the pandemic, epidemic or outbreak. Further, a \npandemic, epidemic or outbreak might adversely affect our operations by causing a temporary shutdown or diversion of \npatients, disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in the supply chain or causing staffing \nshortages in our facilities. We have disaster plans in place and operate pursuant to infectious disease protocols, but the \npotential emergence of a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak, as well as the public’s and the government’s response to the \npandemic, epidemic or outbreak, is difficult to predict and could adversely affect our operations. \nRisks related to our indebtedness: \nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our \nability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable \nrate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations. \nWe are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2022, our total indebtedness was $38.084 billion. As of December \n31, 2022, we had availability of $1.935 billion under our senior secured cash flow credit facility and $1.600 billion under \nour senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, after giving effect to letters of credit and borrowing base \nlimitations. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, some of which may be exacerbated by the \nimpact of COVID-19, including: \n•  \nincreasing our vulnerability to downturns or adverse changes in general economic, industry or competitive \nconditions and adverse changes in government regulations; \n•  \nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and \ninterest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund our operations, \ncapital expenditures and future business opportunities; \n35"

If new indebtedness \nis added to our current debt levels, interest rates and the related risks that we now face could intensify. \nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may not be able to refinance our \nindebtedness on favorable terms. If we are unable to do so, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our \nobligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. \nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition \nand operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions, including the impact \nof COVID-19, and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you we will \nmaintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and \ninterest on our indebtedness. \nIn addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is \ndependent on the generation of cash flows by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by \ndividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions \nto enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain \ncircumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. \nWe may find it necessary or prudent to refinance our outstanding indebtedness, the terms of which may not be \nfavorable to us. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, is directly affected by the then \ncurrent global economic and financial conditions which affect the availability of debt financing and the rates at which \nsuch financing is available. In addition, our ability to incur secured indebtedness depends in part on the value of our assets, \nwhich depends, in turn, on the strength of our cash flows and results of operations, and on economic and market conditions \nand other factors. \nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or we are unable to \nrefinance our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, \nseek additional capital or restructure our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not \npermit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to \nmeet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of \nmaterial assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those \ndispositions, or the proceeds from the dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. \nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. \nOur senior secured credit facilities and, to a lesser extent, the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain \nvarious covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and certain \nof our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things: \n•  \nincur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares; \n•  \npay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted \npayments; \n•  \nmake certain investments; \n•  \nsell or transfer assets; \n•  \ncreate liens; \n•  \nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and \n•  \nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates. \n36"

In addition, under the asset-based revolving credit facility, when \n(and for as long as) the combined availability under our asset-based revolving credit facility and the revolving facility \nunder our senior secured cash flow credit facility is less than a specified amount for a certain period of time or, if a \npayment or bankruptcy event of default has occurred and is continuing, funds deposited into any of our depository \naccounts will be transferred on a daily basis into a blocked account with the administrative agent and applied to prepay \nloans under the asset-based revolving credit facility and to collateralize letters of credit issued thereunder. \nUnder our senior secured credit facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our \nability to meet those financial ratios may be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance we will \ncontinue to meet those ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under both the cash flow credit \nfacility and the asset-based revolving credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under these senior secured \ncredit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit \nfacilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit, which would also \nresult in an event of default under a significant portion of our other outstanding indebtedness. If we were unable to repay \nthose amounts, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them \nto secure such indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets under our senior secured credit facilities. \nIf any of the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no \nassurance there will be sufficient assets to repay the senior secured credit facilities and our other indebtedness. \nRisks related to human capital: \nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by competition for staffing, the shortage of experienced nurses \nand other health care professionals and labor union activity. \nOur operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and medical support \npersonnel, such as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our physicians. We compete with other health care \nproviders in recruiting and retaining qualified management and personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of \nour hospitals and other facilities, including nurses and other nonphysician health care professionals. In some markets, the \navailability of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue to health care providers, \nincluding at certain of our facilities. The impact of labor shortages across the health care industry may result in other \nhealth care facilities, such as nursing homes, limiting admissions, which may constrain our ability to discharge patients \nto such facilities and further exacerbate the demand on our resources, supplies and staffing. \nCOVID-19 has exacerbated workforce competition, shortages and capacity restraints, including due to the impact \nof vaccine mandates on our workforce, and may continue to exacerbate workforce competition, shortages and capacity \nconstraints beyond the duration of COVID-19. We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit \nand retain nurses and other medical support personnel and to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a \nresult of shortages, competition and inflationary pressures, our labor costs could continue to increase and/or our capacity \ncould be negatively impacted. We also depend on the available labor pool of employees in each of the markets in which \nwe operate to fill other necessary positions. If there is continued competition for these employees or additional union \norganizing activity or a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, it is possible our labor costs could increase. \nWhen negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions, whether such agreements are renewals or first contracts, \nthere is the possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation process, and our continued operation during any \nstrikes could increase our labor costs. The unavailability of staff, or the inability of the Company to control labor costs, \ncould have a material, adverse effect on our capacity, growth prospects and results of operations. \nIn addition, federal and state laws and regulations may increase our costs of maintaining qualified nurses and other \nmedical support personnel. We operate in several states that have adopted mandatory nurse-staffing ratios, mandate \nstaffing committees to develop staffing plans, or require public reporting of nurse staffing levels. If these states reduce, \nor if additional states in which we operate adopt, mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or related measures, such changes could \nsignificantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit admissions in order to \nmeet the required ratios. If our labor costs continue to increase, we may not be able to offset these increased costs as a \nsignificant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed, prospective payments. \nWe may be unable to attract, hire and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce, including key management. \nThe talents and efforts of our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success. Our \nmanagement team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. In addition, institutional \nknowledge may be lost in any potential managerial transition. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly \nqualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the labor \nmarket.

Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate, and \nretain highly qualified and diverse employee talent, or failure to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for \nthe management team, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success. \nOur performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians. \nThe success of our hospitals depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of \nour hospitals, the admitting and utilization practices of those physicians, maintaining good relations with those physicians \nand controlling costs related to the employment of physicians. Although we employ some physicians, physicians are often \nnot employees of the hospitals at which they practice, and, in many of the markets we serve, physicians may have \nadmitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals. We continue to face increasing competition to recruit \nand retain quality physicians, as well as increasing cost to contract with hospital-based physicians. Such physicians may \nterminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. We anticipate facing increased challenges in this area as the \nphysician population reaches retirement age, especially if there is a shortage of physicians willing and able to provide \ncomparable services. If we are unable to recruit and retain quality physicians to affiliate with our hospitals or adequately \ncontract with hospital-based physicians, our admissions may decrease, our operating performance may decline, and our \ncapacity and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to provide adequate support \npersonnel or technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities that meet the needs of those physicians and their \npatients, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities, admissions may decrease and our operating \nperformance may decline. \nRisks related to technology, data privacy and cybersecurity: \nA cybersecurity incident or other form of data breach could result in the compromise of our facilities, confidential \ndata or critical data systems. A cybersecurity incident or other form of data breach could also give rise to potential \nharm to patients; remediation and other expenses; and exposure to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, \ncommon law theories or other laws. Such incidents could subject us to litigation and foreign, federal and state \ngovernmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business. \nWe, directly and through our vendors and other third parties, collect and store on our networks and devices and \nthird-party technology platforms sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information \nand personally identifiable information of our patients and employees. We have made significant investments in \ntechnology to adopt and meaningfully use EHR and in the use of medical devices that store sensitive data and are integral \nto the provision of patient care and to protect our systems, software, equipment, devices and data from cybersecurity risks. \nIn addition, medical devices manufactured by third parties that are used within our facilities are increasingly connected \nto the internet, hospital networks and other medical devices. The secure maintenance of this information and technology \nis critical to our business operations. We have implemented multiple layers of security measures to protect the \nconfidentiality, integrity and availability of this data and the systems and devices that store and transmit such data. We \nembed security measures into software and system development processes and utilize current security technologies, and \nour defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. We vet the security and integrity of \nthird-party technology platforms hosting infrastructure, applications, and data supporting our operations, and set \ncontractual terms holding them to our security standards. \nDespite these efforts, even the most advanced internal control environment is vulnerable to compromise. Threats \nfrom malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities and advanced new attacks against information systems and \ndevices against us or our vendors and other third parties create risk of cybersecurity incidents, including ransomware, \nmalware and phishing incidents. We have seen, and believe we will continue to see, widely spread vulnerabilities that \ncould affect our or other parties’ systems. Mitigation and remediation recommendations continue to evolve, and \naddressing this and other critical vulnerabilities is a priority for us. The volume and intensity of cyberattacks on hospitals, \nhealth systems and other health care entities continue to increase. We are regularly the target of attempted cybersecurity \nand other threats that could have a security impact, including those by third parties to access, misappropriate or manipulate \nour information or disrupt our operations, and we expect to continue to experience an increase in cybersecurity threats in \nthe future. While we are periodically exposed to such threats and expect them to continue, we have not experienced any \nmaterial losses or other material consequences relating to technology failure, cyberattacks or other information or security \nincidents, whether directed at us or third parties. Internal access management failures could result in the compromise or \nunauthorized exposure of confidential data. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent \nvulnerabilities or defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or \nused in a manner that could compromise information security. There can be no assurance that we or our vendors and other \nthird parties will not be subject to cybersecurity threats and incidents that bypass our or their security measures, impact \nthe integrity, availability or privacy of personal health information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our or \ntheir information systems, devices or business, including our ability to provide various health care services.

Our Audit and Compliance Committee includes the topic of cybersecurity \nrisk and information security as one of its standing agenda items, and is frequently updated on management’s ongoing \nactions to monitor, identify, assess and mitigate significant cybersecurity matters. Committee meetings regularly include \na report from our Chief Security Officer to provide an update on (i) activities within our internal cybersecurity defense \ncenter to monitor and respond to both internal and third-party cyber events, (ii) ongoing threats that are being monitored \nand (iii) the current threat level assessment for the Company. As cyber threats continue to evolve, along with their \nincreased volume and sophistication, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify \nor enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities or incidents. \nAlthough to date no cyberattack or other information or security breach, whether experienced by us or a third party, has \nresulted in material losses or other material consequences to us, there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures \nin place to monitor and mitigate the risks of cyber threats, including the remediation of critical information security and \nsoftware vulnerabilities, will be sufficient and/or timely and that we will not suffer material losses or consequences in the \nfuture. Additionally, while we have in place insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such \ninsurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. The occurrence of any of \nthese events could result in (i) harm to patients; (ii) business interruptions and delays; (iii) the loss, misappropriation, \ncorruption or unauthorized access of data; (iv) litigation and potential liability under privacy, security, breach notification \nand consumer protection laws, common law theories or other applicable laws; (v) reputational damage; and (vi) foreign, \nfederal and state governmental inquiries, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and \nresults of operations and harm our business reputation. \nOur operations could be impaired by a failure of our information systems. \nThe performance of our information systems is critical to our business operations. In addition to our shared services \ninitiatives, our information systems are essential to a number of critical areas of our operations, including: \n•  \naccounting and financial reporting; \n•  \nbilling and collecting accounts; \n•  \ncoding and compliance; \n•  \nadmissions, provision of care and care coordination; \n•  \nclinical systems and medical devices; \n•  \nmedical records and document storage; \n•  \ninventory management; \n•  \nnegotiating, pricing and administering managed care contracts and supply contracts; and \n•  \nmonitoring quality of care and collecting data on quality measures necessary for full Medicare payment \nupdates. \nInformation systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or \nnetwork failures, human acts such as inadvertent or intentional misuse by employees and cyberattacks, including \nransomware and data theft, and natural disasters. Moreover, we rely on various third-party technology platforms, which \nare increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope. Failure to adequately manage \nimplementations of new technology, updates or enhancements of such platforms or interfaces between platforms could \nplace us at a competitive disadvantage, disrupt our operations, and have a material, adverse impact on our business and \nresults of operations. \nWe have taken precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our information systems. \nNevertheless, we or our vendors and other third parties that we rely upon may experience system failures and disruptions. \nThe occurrence of any system failure could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data and cessations or \ninterruptions in the availability of systems, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position \nand results of operations and harm our business reputation. \n39"

      "text": "Health care technology initiatives, particularly those related to sharing patient data and interoperability, may \nadversely affect our operations. \nThe federal government is working to promote the adoption of health information technology and the promotion of \nnationwide health information exchange to improve health care. For example, HHS incentivizes the adoption and \nmeaningful use of certified EHR technology through its Promoting Interoperability Programs. Eligible hospitals and \neligible professionals, including our hospitals and employed professionals, are subject to reduced payments from \nMedicare if they fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology. As these technologies have become \nwidespread, the focus has shifted to increasing patient access to health care data and interoperability. The 21st Century \nCures Act and its implementing regulations promote information sharing by prohibiting information blocking by health \ncare providers and certain other entities. Information blocking is defined as engaging in activities likely to interfere with \nthe access, exchange or use of electronic health information, except as required by law or specified by HHS as a reasonable \nand necessary activity. Current and future initiatives related to health care technology, data sharing and interoperability \nmay require changes to our operations, impose new and complex compliance obligations and require investments in \ninfrastructure. We may be subject to financial penalties or other disincentives or experience reputational damage for \nfailure to comply. It is difficult to predict how these initiatives will affect our relationships with providers and vendors, \nparticipation in health care information exchanges or networks, the exchange of patient data and patient engagement. \nWe may not be reimbursed for the cost of expensive, new technology. \nAs health care technology continues to advance, the price of purchasing such new technology has significantly \nincreased for providers. Some payers have not adapted their payment systems to adequately cover the cost of these \ntechnologies for providers and patients. If payers do not adequately reimburse us for these new technologies, we may be \nunable to acquire such technologies or we may nevertheless determine to acquire or utilize these technologies in order to \ntreat our patients. In either case, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. \nRisks related to governmental regulation and other legal matters: \nOur business and results of operations may be adversely affected by health care reform efforts. We are unable to \npredict whether, what, and when additional health reform measures will be adopted or implemented, and the effects \nand ultimate impact of any such measures are uncertain and may adversely affect our business and results of \noperations. \nIn recent years, the U.S. health care industry has undergone significant changes at the federal and state levels, many \nof which have been aimed at reducing costs and government spending and increasing access to health insurance. The most \nprominent of these legislative reform efforts is the Affordable Care Act, which affects how health care services are \ncovered, delivered and reimbursed, and expanded health insurance coverage through a combination of public program \nexpansion and private sector health insurance reforms. The Affordable Care Act has been, and continues to be, subject to \nlegislative and regulatory changes and court challenges. For example, effective January 1, 2019, the penalty associated \nwith the individual mandate to maintain health insurance was effectively eliminated. However, some states have imposed \nindividual health insurance mandates, and other states have explored or offer public health insurance options. To increase \naccess to health insurance during COVID-19, the ARPA enhanced subsidies for individuals eligible to purchase coverage \nthrough Affordable Care Act marketplaces as part of the APRA. The Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in August 2022, \nextends these enhanced subsidies through 2025. These changes and initiatives may impact the number of individuals that \nelect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased. \nThere is uncertainty regarding whether, when and how the Affordable Care Act may be further changed, and how \nthe law will be interpreted and implemented. Changes by Congress or government agencies could eliminate or alter \nprovisions beneficial to us, while leaving in place provisions reducing our reimbursement or otherwise negatively \nimpacting our business. \nThere is also uncertainty regarding whether, when, and what other health reform initiatives will be adopted and the \nimpact of such efforts on providers and other health care industry participants. Some members of Congress have proposed \nmeasures that would expand government-sponsored coverage, including proposals to expand coverage of federally-\nfunded insurance programs as an alternative to private insurance or establish a single-payer system (such reforms often \nreferred to as “Medicare for All”). CMS administrators may grant states additional flexibility in the administration of state \nMedicaid programs and make changes to Medicaid payment models. Other recent health reform initiatives and proposals \nat the federal and state levels include those focused on price transparency and out-of-network charges, which may impact \nprices, our relationships with patients, payers or ancillary providers (such as anesthesiologists, radiologists and \npathologists) and our competitive position. For example, among other consumer protections, the No Surprises Act imposes \nvarious requirements on providers and health plans intended to prevent “surprise” medical bills. It also establishes an IDR \nprocess for providers and payers to handle payment disputes that cannot be resolved through direct negotiations. Trends \ntoward transparency and value-based pricing may impact our competitive position and patient volumes. For example, the \n40"

      "text": "CMS Care Compare website makes publicly available certain data on performance of hospitals and other Medicare-\ncertified providers on quality measures and patient satisfaction, and our patient volumes could decline if any of our \nfacilities achieve poor results. Further, Medicare reimbursement for hospitals is adjusted based on quality and efficiency \nmeasures. Other industry participants, such as private payers and large employer groups and their affiliates, may also \nintroduce financial or delivery system reforms. We are unable to predict the nature and success of such initiatives. Health \ncare reform initiatives, including changes to the Affordable Care Act, may have an adverse effect on our business, results \nof operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity. \nChanges in government health care programs may adversely affect our revenues. \nA significant portion of our patient volume is derived from government health care programs, principally Medicare \nand Medicaid. Specifically, we derived 43.6% of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2022. \nChanges in government health care programs, including as a result of health reform efforts, may reduce the reimbursement \nwe receive and could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, in some cases, private third-\nparty payers rely on all or portions of Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates. Changes to government \nhealth care programs that reduce payments under these programs may negatively impact payments from private third-\nparty payers. \nIn recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have resulted in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions in \nlevels of payments to health care providers for certain services under the Medicare program. For example, Congress \nestablished automatic spending reductions under the BCA, resulting in a 2% reduction in Medicare payments beginning \nin 2013. The CARES Act and related legislation temporarily suspended these reductions through March 31, 2022, and \nreduced the sequestration adjustment from 2% to 1% from April 1 through June 30, 2022. The full 2% reduction resumed \non July 1, 2022. The BCA sequestration has been extended through the first six months of 2032. In addition, as a result \nof the ARPA, an additional Medicare payment reduction of up to 4% was required to take effect in January 2022; however, \nCongress has delayed implementation of this reduction until 2025. These reductions are in addition to reductions mandated \nby the Affordable Care Act and other laws. It is difficult to predict whether, when or what other deficit reduction initiatives \nmay be proposed by Congress, but future legislation may include additional Medicare spending reductions. \nFrom time to time, CMS revises the reimbursement systems used to reimburse health care providers, including \nchanges to the inpatient hospital MS-DRG system and other payment systems, which may result in reduced Medicare \npayments. For example, under a site neutrality policy, clinic visit services provided by off-campus provider-based \ndepartments that were formerly paid under the outpatient PPS are now paid under the Physician Fee Schedule. Further, \ndue to changes to the 340B Drug Pricing Program in prior years and resulting litigation, hospitals that do not participate \nin the 340B program (including our hospitals) will receive decreased reimbursement going forward for outpatient drugs \nand services, and may be required to repay previously received payments. As another example, CMS has previously \nimplemented and proposed changes to DSH payment formulas, some of which are the subject of court challenges, and \nhas indicated that the agency will return to DSH payment formulas in future rulemaking. Future changes to these payment \npolicies may adversely impact our results of operations, and any potential legal challenges to changes may take years to \nresolve. Additionally, as required under the IMPACT Act, HHS and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission are \nworking toward a unified post-acute care payment model that would include home health agencies and IRFs. A unified \npost-acute care payment system would pay post-acute care providers under a single framework according to a patient’s \ncharacteristics, rather than based on the post-acute care setting where the patient receives treatment. In a July 2022 report, \nCMS acknowledged that universal implementation of such a system would require congressional approval. Under the \nIMPACT Act, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission must submit a report to Congress by June 2023. Payment \npolicies for different types of providers and for various items and services continue to evolve. Congress and/or CMS may \nimplement further changes to reimbursement for items or services that result in payment reductions for other items or \nservices or that otherwise affect our business and operations. \nBecause most states must operate with balanced budgets and the Medicaid program is often a state’s largest \nprogram, some states have enacted or may consider enacting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. \nFurther, many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid \nrecipients in managed care programs, and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states’ \nMedicaid systems. Periods of economic weakness may increase the budgetary pressures on many states, and these \nbudgetary pressures may result in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs and the \nChildren’s Health Insurance Program in many states. Some states that provide Medicaid supplemental payments are \nreviewing these programs or have filed waiver requests with CMS to replace these programs, and CMS has performed \nand continues to perform compliance reviews of some states’ programs and is considering changes to the requirements \nfor such programs, which could result in Medicaid supplemental payments being reduced or eliminated. Further, \nlegislation and administrative actions at the federal level may impact the funding for, or structure of, the Medicaid \nprogram, and may shape the administration of the Medicaid program at the state level. Federal Medicaid policies are \nsubject to change, including as a result of changes in the presidential administration. For example, where states had \n41"

However, a federal court is permitting Georgia to impose work \nand community engagement requirements under a Medicaid demonstration program that is expected to launch in mid-\n2023. The federal government is also reexamining block grant funding structures. \nCurrent or future health care reform and deficit reduction efforts, changes in laws or regulations regarding \ngovernment health care programs, other changes in the administration of government health care programs and changes \nby private third-party payers in response to health care reform and other changes to government health care programs \ncould have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. \nIf we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make \nsignificant changes to our operations. \nThe health care industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state \nand local government levels relating to, among other things: \n•  \nbilling and coding for services and properly handling overpayments; \n•  \nappropriateness and classification of level and setting of care provided, including proper classification of \ninpatient admissions, observation services and outpatient care; \n•  \ncertifications of patient eligibility for home health and hospice services; \n•  \nrelationships with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients; \n•  \nnecessity and adequacy of medical care; \n•  \nquality of medical equipment and services; \n•  \nqualifications of medical and support personnel; \n•  \nthe confidentiality, maintenance, interoperability, exchange, data breach, identity theft and security of \nhealth-related and personal information and medical records; \n•  \nscreening, stabilization and transfer of individuals who have emergency medical conditions; \n•  \nrestrictions on the provision of medical care, including reproductive care; \n•  \nlicensure, certification and enrollment with government programs; \n•  \nthe distribution, maintenance and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances; \n•  \ndebt collection, limits or prohibitions on balance billing and billing for out of network services; \n•  \ncommunications with patients and consumers; \n• \npreparing and filing of cost reports;  \n• \noperating policies and procedures;  \n•  \nactivities regarding competitors; \n•  \naddition of facilities and services; and \n•  \nenvironmental protection. \nAmong these laws are the federal Anti-kickback Statute, EKRA, the federal Stark Law, the FCA, the No Surprises \nAct and similar state laws. We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or \ninfluence the referral of patients to our hospitals, other health care facilities, laboratories and employed physicians or who \nare the recipients of referrals, and these laws govern those relationships. The OIG has enacted safe harbor regulations that \noutline practices deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. While we endeavor to comply with \nthe applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships with \nphysicians and other referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor \nprotection. Failure to qualify for a safe harbor does not mean the arrangement necessarily violates the Anti-kickback \nStatute but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. However, we cannot offer assurance that practices outside of \na safe harbor will not be found to violate the Anti-kickback Statute. Allegations of violations of the Anti-kickback Statute \n42"

We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but \nthe regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex and are subject to continuing legal and regulatory \nchange. Thus, we cannot provide assurance that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law. Unlike the Anti-\nkickback Statute, failure to meet an exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of the Stark Law, even if such \nviolation is technical in nature. \nAdditionally, if we violate the Anti-kickback Statute or Stark Law, or if we improperly bill for our services, we \nmay be found to violate the FCA, either under a suit brought by the government or by a private person under a qui tam, \nor “whistleblower,” suit. See Item 1, “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.” \nWe develop software programs utilizing machine learning/artificial intelligence for use within our network to \nimprove care. In some cases, software can be considered a medical device under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct (“FDCA”). Medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) under \nthe FDCA. In September 2022, FDA issued non-binding final guidance that describes the types of clinical decision support \nsoftware that FDA will regulate as a medical device, potentially including software programs that were not previously \ntreated as medical devices. Application of the new guidance may result in our current and/or future software programs \nproviding clinical decision support being subject to FDA regulation. If FDA determines that any of our software programs \nare medical devices under the FDCA, the distribution and/or use of those software programs may require premarket \napproval or clearance, and we may be required to cease distribution and/or use of such programs until we obtain any \nrequired premarket approval or clearance, which could adversely affect our operations. Failure to seek FDA approval or \nclearance or noncompliance with other applicable FDA requirements could adversely affect our business, financial \ncondition or results of operations. \nWe also operate health care facilities in the United Kingdom and have operations and commercial relationships \nwith companies in other foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, are subject to certain U.S. and foreign laws applicable to \nbusinesses generally, including anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act regulates U.S. \ncompanies in their dealings with foreign officials, prohibiting bribes and similar practices, and requires that they maintain \nrecords that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate internal accounting controls. In addition, the United \nKingdom Bribery Act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities that affect the United Kingdom. \nA variety of state, national, foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, \nprotection, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. For example, the CCPA, which affords \nconsumers expanded privacy protections such as the right to know what personal information is collected and how it is \nused, went into effect on January 1, 2020, and was recently significantly amended by the CPRA. California residents also \nhave the right to request that a business delete their personal information unless it is necessary for the business to maintain \nfor certain purposes, to direct a business to correct errors in their personal information, and to restrict the use and disclosure \nof sensitive information. They have the right to know if their personal information is being sold or shared and the right to \nopt out of the sale or disclosure. Beginning in 2023, under the CPRA’s amendments, as well as comprehensive privacy \nlegislation passed in other states, including Colorado, Utah and Virginia, residents of those states will have additional \nrights with respect to their personal information, such as a right to opt out of certain processing activities for sensitive \ndata and a right to a portable copy of their personal information. The CPRA creates a new regulator responsible for \nenforcement of the CPRA, and enforcement priorities of the regulatory bodies responsible for enforcing new state privacy \nlaws have yet to be determined or may change in the future. These new state privacy laws provide for civil penalties for \nviolations, and the CCPA and CPRA provide a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach \nlitigation. Failure to comply with these and any other comprehensive privacy laws passed at the state or federal level may \nresult in regulatory enforcement action and damage to our reputation. The potential effects of such legislation are far-\nreaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and \nexpenses to comply. Moreover, several privacy bills have been proposed both at the federal and state level that may result \nin additional legal requirements that impact our business. With the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union \n(“Brexit”), our United Kingdom operations are no longer subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection \nRegulation (“GDPR”) but are subject to the UK Data Protection Legislation, which has been amended in connection with \nBrexit to be functionally similar to the GDPR and which contains stricter privacy restrictions than laws and regulations \nin the United States and provides for significant fines in the event of violations. These administrative fines are based on \na multi-factored approach.

      "text": "with respect to our United Kingdom operations. We expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, regulatory \nguidance, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security proposed and enacted in \nvarious jurisdictions, which could impact our operations and cause us to incur substantial costs. \nWe send short message service, or SMS, text messages to patients. While we obtain consent from these individuals \nto send text messages, federal or state regulatory authorities or private litigants may claim that the notices and disclosures \nwe provide, form of consents we obtain or our SMS texting practices are not adequate or violate applicable law. In \naddition, we must ensure that our SMS texting practices comply with regulations and agency guidance under the \nTelephone Consumer Protection Act (the “TCPA”), a federal statute that protects consumers from unwanted telephone \ncalls, faxes and text messages. While we strive to adhere to strict policies and procedures that comply with the TCPA, the \nFederal Communications Commission, as the agency that implements and enforces the TCPA, may disagree with our \ninterpretation of the TCPA and subject us to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance. Determination by a \ncourt or regulatory agency that our SMS texting practices violate the TCPA could subject us to civil penalties and could \nrequire us to change some portions of our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge by patients or regulatory authorities \nof our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us. Moreover, \nif wireless carriers or their trade associations, which issue guidelines for texting programs, determine that we have violated \ntheir guidelines, our ability to engage in texting programs may be curtailed or revoked, which could impact our operations \nand cause us to incur costs related to implementing a workaround solution. \nWe engage in consumer debt collection for HCA-affiliated hospitals and certain non-affiliated hospitals. We also \nengage in credit reporting for certain non-affiliated hospitals. The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair \nCredit Reporting Act and the TCPA restrict the methods that companies may use to contact and seek payment from \nconsumer debtors regarding past due accounts and to report to consumer reporting agencies on the status of those accounts. \nMany states impose additional requirements on debt collection and credit reporting practices, and some of those \nrequirements may be more stringent than the federal requirements. \nFinally, we are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of \nmaterials into the environment. For example, our health care operations generate medical waste, such as pharmaceuticals, \nbiological materials and disposable medical instruments, that must be handled, stored, transported, treated and disposed \nof in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Environmental regulations also may \napply when we build new facilities or renovate existing facilities. If we are found not to be in compliance with such laws \nand regulations, we may be liable for significant investigation and clean-up costs or be subject to enforcement actions by \ngovernmental authorities or lawsuits by private plaintiffs. Moreover, any changes in the environmental regulatory \nframework (including legislative or regulatory efforts designed to address climate change) could have a material, adverse \neffect on our business. \nIf we fail to comply with these or other applicable laws and regulations, which are subject to change, we could be \nsubject to liabilities, including civil penalties, money damages, lapses in reimbursement, the loss of our licenses to operate \none or more facilities, exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal \nand state health care programs, civil lawsuits and criminal penalties. In addition, different interpretations or enforcement \nof, or amendments to, these and other laws and regulations in the future could subject our current or past practices to \nallegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, \nservices, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens \nimposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may increase our operational costs, result in interruptions or delays \nin the availability of systems and/or result in a patient volume decline. We may also face audits or investigations by one \nor more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. An adverse outcome \nunder any such investigation or audit, a determination that we have violated these or other laws or a public announcement \nthat we are being investigated for possible violations could result in liability, result in adverse publicity, and adversely \naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. \nState efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to operate and \nexpand our operations. \nSome states, particularly in the eastern part of the country, require health care providers to obtain prior approval, \noften known as a CON, for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities, to make certain capital \nexpenditures or to make changes in services or bed capacity. In giving approval, these states consider the need for \nadditional or expanded health care facilities or services. We currently operate health care facilities in a number of states \nwith CON laws or that require other types of approvals for the establishment or expansion of certain facility types or \nservices. The failure to obtain any required CON or other required approval could impair our ability to operate or expand \noperations. Any such failure could, in turn, adversely affect our ability to attract patients and physicians to our facilities \nand grow our revenues, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations. \n44"

However, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such \nresolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. \nWe have been and could become the subject of government investigations, claims and litigation. \nHealth care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various government agencies. Further, under the \nFCA, private parties have the right to bring qui tam, or “whistleblower,” suits against companies that submit false claims \nfor payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government.

CMS and state Medicaid agencies \ncontract with RACs and other contractors on a contingency fee basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and \ncorrect improper payments in the Medicare program, including managed Medicare plans, and the Medicaid programs. \nRAC denials are appealable; however, in recent years, there have been significant delays in the Medicare appeals process. \nHHS has taken steps to streamline the process and improve efficiency, and has significantly reduced a years-long backlog. \nNevertheless, we may experience delays in appealing RAC payment denials. Private third-party payers may conduct \nsimilar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring. Depending on the nature of the conduct \nfound in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the resolution of these audits \ncould have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. \nShould we be found out of compliance with applicable laws, regulations or programs, depending on the nature of \nthe findings, our business, our financial position and our results of operations could be negatively impacted. \nWe may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities, which are costly to defend and may require \nus to pay significant damages if not covered by insurance. \nWe are subject to litigation relating to our business practices, including claims and legal actions by patients and \nothers in the ordinary course of business alleging malpractice, product liability or other legal theories. Many of these \nactions seek large sums of money as damages and involve significant defense costs. We insure a portion of our \nprofessional liability risks through our insurance subsidiary. Management believes our reserves for self-insured retentions \nand insurance coverage are sufficient to cover insured claims arising out of the operation of our facilities, although some \nclaims may exceed the scope or amount of the coverage limits of our insurance policies. Our insurance subsidiary has \nentered into certain reinsurance contracts; however, the subsidiary remains liable to the extent that the reinsurers do not \nmeet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. If payments for claims exceed actuarially determined estimates, \nare not covered by insurance, or reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their obligations, our results of operations and financial \nposition could be adversely affected. \nRisks related to operations, strategy, demand and competition: \nOur hospitals and other facilities face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers. \nThe health care business is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals and other health care providers \nfor patients has intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals and health care facilities in the communities we \nserve provide services similar to those we offer. Trends toward transparency and value-based purchasing may have an \nimpact on our competitive position, ability to obtain and maintain favorable contract terms, and patient volumes in ways \nthat are difficult to predict. CMS publicizes on its Care Compare website performance data related to quality measures \nand data on patient satisfaction surveys that hospitals, home health agencies, hospices and various other types of Medicare-\ncertified facilities submit in connection with their Medicare reimbursement. The Care Compare website provides an \noverall rating that synthesizes various quality measures into a star rating for each hospital, home health agency and \n45"

If any of our hospitals or other provider types achieve poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors) \non quality measures or on patient satisfaction surveys, our competitive position could be negatively affected. Further, \nhospitals are required to publish online a list of their standard charges for all items and services, including discounted \ncash prices and payer-specific and de-identified negotiated charges, and must also publish a consumer-friendly list of \nstandard charges for certain “shoppable” services or, alternatively, maintain an online price estimator tool for the \nshoppable services. HHS also requires health insurers to publish online charges negotiated with providers for health care \nservices, and starting January 1, 2023, health insurers must provide online price comparison tools to help individuals get \npersonalized cost estimates for covered items and services. The No Surprises Act imposes additional price transparency \nrequirements, including requiring providers to send uninsured or self-pay patients (in advance of the date of the scheduled \nitem or service or upon request) and health plans (prior to the scheduled date of the item or service) of insured patients a \ngood faith estimate of the expected charges and diagnostic codes. HHS is deferring enforcement of certain requirements \nof the No Surprises Act applicable to providing estimates for insured individuals, and is also deferring enforcement with \nregard to good faith estimates sent to uninsured or self-pay patients that do not include expected charges for co-providers \nor co-facilities. It is not entirely clear how price transparency requirements will affect consumer behavior, our \nrelationships with payers, or our ability to set and negotiate prices, but our competitive position could be negatively \naffected if our standard charges are higher or are perceived to be higher than the charges of our competitors. \nThe number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments, urgent care centers and \ndiagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased. Many individuals are seeking \na broader range of services at outpatient facilities as a result of the growing availability of stand-alone outpatient health \ncare facilities, the increase in payer reimbursement policies that restrict inpatient coverage and the increase in the services \nthat can be provided on an outpatient basis, including high margin services. Consequently, most of our hospitals operate \nin a highly competitive environment, which may put pressure on our pricing, ability to contract with third-party payers \nand strategy for volume growth. Some of the facilities that compete with our hospitals are physician-owned or are owned \nby governmental agencies or not-for-profit corporations supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or tax \nrevenues and can finance capital expenditures and operations on a tax-exempt basis. Recent consolidations of not-for-\nprofit hospital entities may intensify this competitive pressure. There is also increasing consolidation in the third-party \npayer industry, including vertical integration efforts among third-party payers and health care providers, and increasing \nefforts by payers to influence or direct the patient’s choice of provider by the use of narrow networks or other strategies. \nHealth care industry participants are increasingly implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing \nphysicians, acquiring physician practice groups and participating in ACOs or other clinical integration models. Other \nindustry participants, such as large employer groups and their affiliates and large retail chains, may intensify competitive \npressure and affect the industry in ways that are difficult to predict. \nOur hospitals compete with specialty hospitals and with both our own and unaffiliated freestanding ASCs and other \noutpatient providers for market share in certain high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel. If ASCs \nand other outpatient providers are better able to compete in this environment than our hospitals, our hospitals may \nexperience a decline in patient volume, and we may experience a decrease in margin, even if those patients use our \nproviders. In states that do not require a CON or other type of approval for the purchase, construction or expansion of \nhealth care facilities or services, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. \nSome states that have historically imposed CON or similar prior approval requirements have removed or are considering \nremoving these requirements, which may reduce barriers to entry and increase competition in our service areas. Changes \nin licensure or other regulations and recognition of new provider types or payment models could also impact our \ncompetitive position. If our competitors are better able to attract patients, make capital expenditures and maintain modern \nand technologically upgraded facilities and equipment, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain favorable third-party \npayer contracts at their facilities than our hospitals and other providers, we may experience an overall decline in patient \nvolume. See Item 1, “Business — Competition.” \nAny increase in the volume of uninsured patients or deterioration in the collectability of uninsured and patient due \naccounts could adversely affect our results of operations. \nThe primary collection risks for our accounts receivable relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts \nfor which the primary third-party payer has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient \nresponsibility amounts (exclusions, deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. At December 31, 2022, estimated \nimplicit price concessions of $6.780 billion had been recorded to adjust our revenues and accounts receivable to the \nestimated amounts we expect to collect. The estimated cost of total uncompensated care was $3.491 billion for 2022, \n$3.350 billion for 2021 and $3.483 billion for 2020. \nAny increase in the volume of uninsured patients or deterioration in the collectability of uninsured accounts \nreceivable could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.

In addition, legislative and regulatory changes, such as the effective elimination of the financial \npenalty associated with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, may impact the number of individuals that elect to \nobtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased. We are unable to predict what, if \nany, and when such changes will be made in the future. \nWe provide uninsured discounts and charity care for individuals, including for those residing in states that choose \nnot to implement the Medicaid expansion or that modify the terms of the program, for undocumented aliens who are not \npermitted to enroll in an Exchange or government health care programs and for certain others who may not have insurance. \nSome patients may choose to enroll in lower cost Medicaid plans or other health insurance plans with lower \nreimbursement levels. We may also be adversely affected by the growth in patient responsibility accounts as a result of \nincreases in the adoption of health plan structures that shift greater payment responsibility for care to individuals through \ngreater exclusions and copayment and deductible amounts. Further, our ability to collect patient responsibility accounts \nmay be limited by statutory, regulatory and investigatory initiatives, including private lawsuits directed at hospital charges \nand collection practices for uninsured and underinsured patients. For example, the No Surprises Act requires providers to \nsend uninsured and self-pay patients a good faith estimate of expected charges for items and services. The estimate must \ncover items and services that are reasonably expected to be provided together with the primary item or services, including \nthose that may be provided by other providers. If the uninsured or self-pay patient receives a bill that is substantially \ngreater than the expected charges in the good faith estimate or the provider furnishes an item or service that was not \nincluded in the good faith estimate, they may initiate a patient-provider dispute resolution process established by \nregulation. \nIf our volume of patients with private health insurance coverage declines or we are unable to retain and negotiate \nfavorable contracts with private third-party payers, including managed care plans, our revenues may be adversely \naffected. \nBroad economic factors, including inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, increased \nunemployment and underemployment rates and reduced consumer spending and confidence, the continued shift of care \nto an outpatient setting and the aging population may impact our revenue mix. Private third-party payers, including HMOs, \nPPOs and other managed care plans, typically reimburse health care providers at a higher rate than Medicare, Medicaid \nor other government health care programs. Reimbursement rates are set forth by contract when our facilities are in-\nnetwork, and payers utilize plan structures to encourage or require the use of in-network providers. Revenues derived \nfrom private third-party payers (domestic only) accounted for 48.3%, 51.6% and 51.5% of our revenues for 2022, 2021 \nand 2020, respectively. As a result, our ability to maintain or increase patient volumes covered by private third-party \npayers and to maintain and obtain favorable contracts with private third-party payers significantly affects the revenues \nand operating results of our facilities. \nPrivate third-party payers, including managed care plans, continue to demand discounted fee structures, and the \nongoing trend toward consolidation among payers tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. Payers \nmay utilize plan structures such as narrow networks and tiered networks that limit beneficiary provider choices, impose \nsignificantly higher cost sharing obligations when care is obtained from providers in a disfavored tier or otherwise shift \ngreater financial responsibility for care to individuals. \nOther health care providers may impact our ability to enter into managed care contracts or negotiate increases in \nour reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate \nexclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care plans to contract with us. \nIn addition to increasing negotiating leverage of private third-party payers, alignment efforts between third-party payers \nand health care providers may result in other competitive advantages, such as greater access to performance and pricing \ndata. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to retain and renew our third-party payer contracts and enter \ninto new contracts on terms favorable to us, which may be impacted by price transparency initiatives. For example, the \nNo Surprises Act requires providers to send health plans of insured patients a good faith estimate of the expected charges \nand diagnostic codes prior to the scheduled date of the service or item. Further, hospitals are required to publish online \npayer-specific negotiated charges and de-identified minimum and maximum charges. In addition, starting January 1, 2023, \nhealth insurers must provide online price comparison tools to help individuals get personalized cost estimates for covered \nitems and services. Cost-reduction strategies by large employer groups and their affiliates, such as directly contracting \nwith a limited number of providers, may also limit our ability to negotiate favorable terms in our contracts and otherwise \nintensify competitive pressure. It is not clear what impact, if any, these and future health reform efforts will have on our \nability to negotiate reimbursement increases and participate in third-party payer networks on favorable terms. If we are \nunable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with third-party payers or experience reductions in payment increases \nor amounts received from third-party payers, our revenues may be reduced. \n47"

      "text": "Under early COVID-related legislation, states that maintain continuous Medicaid enrollment until the end of the \nmonth in which the PHE ends are eligible for a temporary increase in federal funds for state Medicaid expenditures. Under \nrecent legislation, the continuous coverage requirement was decoupled from the PHE timeline and will now expire as of \nApril 1, 2023, and the increase in federal funding will be phased out through calendar year 2023. The resumption of \nredeterminations for Medicaid enrollees may lead to coverage disruptions and dis-enrollments of current Medicaid \nenrollees. Furthermore, the number and identity of states that choose to expand or otherwise modify Medicaid programs \nand the terms of expansion and other program modifications continue to evolve. Some states have imposed individual \nhealth insurance mandates with financial penalties for noncompliance. Other states have explored or offer public health \ninsurance options. These variables, among others, make it difficult to predict the number of uninsured individuals. \nChanges to physician utilization practices and treatment methodologies, third-party payer controls designed to reduce \ninpatient services or surgical procedures and other factors outside our control that impact demand for medical services \nmay reduce our revenues. \nControls imposed by Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid and private third-party payers \ndesigned to reduce admissions, intensity of services, surgical volumes and lengths of stay, in some instances referred to \nas “utilization review,” have affected and are expected to increasingly affect our facilities. Utilization review entails the \nreview of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by third-party payers, and may involve prior authorization \nrequirements. The Medicare program also issues national or local coverage determinations that restrict the circumstances \nunder which Medicare pays for certain services. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue \nto be negatively affected by third-party payers’ preadmission authorization requirements, coverage restrictions, utilization \nreview and by pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. \nEfforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue. Additionally, trends in physician treatment \nprotocols and health plan design, such as health plans that shift increased costs and accountability for care to patients, \ncould reduce our surgical volumes and admissions in favor of lower intensity and lower cost treatment methodologies or \nresult in patients seeking care from other providers. \nVolume, admission and case-mix trends may be impacted by other factors beyond our control, such as changes in \nvolume of certain high acuity services, variations in the prevalence and severity of outbreaks of influenza and other \nillnesses, such as COVID-19, and medical conditions, seasonal and severe weather conditions, changes in treatment \nregimens and medical technology and other advances. Further, our operations may be impacted by expansion of in-home \nacute care models, and our inpatient volumes may decline if various inpatient hospital procedures become eligible for \nreimbursement by Medicare when performed in outpatient settings. These factors may reduce the demand for services we \noffer and decrease the reimbursement that we receive. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed, cost controls, \nchanges to physician utilization practices, treatment methodologies, reimbursement rates and fees and other factors \nbeyond our control could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. \nWe may encounter difficulty acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses, encounter challenges integrating \nthe operations of acquired hospitals and other health care businesses and/or become liable for unknown or contingent \nliabilities as a result of acquisitions. \nA component of our business strategy is acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses. We may encounter \ndifficulty acquiring new facilities or other businesses as a result of competition from other purchasers that may be willing \nto pay purchase prices that are higher than we believe are reasonable. Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is \ncurrently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission and the DOJ, including with respect to hospital and physician \npractice acquisitions. Some states require CONs in order to acquire a hospital or other facility, or to expand facilities or \nservices. In addition, the acquisition of health care facilities often involves licensure approvals or reviews and complex \nchange of ownership processes for Medicare and other payers. Further, many states have laws that restrict the conversion \nor sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities. These laws may require prior approval from the state attorney \ngeneral, advance notification of the attorney general or other regulators and community involvement. Attorneys general \nin states without specific requirements may exercise broad discretionary authority over transactions involving the sale of \nnot-for-profits under their general obligations to protect the use of charitable assets. These legislative and administrative \nefforts often focus on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the non-\nprofit seller and may include consideration of commitments for capital improvements and charity care by the purchaser. \nAlso, the increasingly challenging regulatory and enforcement environment may negatively impact our ability to acquire \nhealth care businesses if they are found to have material unresolved compliance issues, such as repayment obligations. \nResolving compliance issues as well as completion of oversight, review or approval processes could seriously delay or \neven prevent our ability to acquire hospitals or other businesses and increase our acquisition costs. \n48"

      "text": "We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate hospitals and other businesses that we acquire with our \nongoing operations, or we may experience delays implementing operating procedures and systems. Hospitals and other \nhealth care businesses that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to \ncomply with health care and other laws and regulations, medical and general professional liabilities, workers’ \ncompensation liabilities and tax liabilities. Although we typically exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition \ntransactions and seek indemnification from the sellers for these matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those \nobligations, experience liability in excess of any indemnification obtained or otherwise incur material liabilities for the \npre-acquisition conduct of acquired businesses. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs could harm our business \nand results of operations. \nOur facilities are heavily concentrated in Florida and Texas, which makes us sensitive to regulatory, economic, public \nhealth, environmental and competitive conditions and changes in those states. \nWe operated 182 hospitals at December 31, 2022, and 91 of those hospitals are located in Florida and Texas. Our \nFlorida and Texas facilities’ combined revenues represented 50% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022. This geographic concentration makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, public health, \nenvironmental and competitive conditions in those states. Any material change in the current payment programs or \nregulatory, economic, public health, environmental or competitive conditions in those states could have a disproportionate \neffect on our overall business results. \nIn addition, our hospitals and other facilities in Florida, Texas and other coastal states are located in hurricane-prone \nareas. In the past, hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the operations of our hospitals and other facilities in Florida, \nTexas and other coastal states and the patient populations in those states. Global climate change could also increase the \nintensity or frequency of hurricanes or other natural disasters. Our business activities could be harmed by a particularly \nactive hurricane season or even a single storm, and the property insurance we obtain may not be adequate to cover losses \nfrom future hurricanes or other natural disasters. \nOur business and operations are subject to risks related to climate change. \nGlobal climate change presents both immediate and long-term physical risks (such as potential increases in the \nintensity or frequency of hurricanes, extreme weather conditions or other natural disasters) and risks associated with the \ntransition to a low-carbon economy (such as regulatory or technology changes). These changes could result in, for \nexample, temporary declines in the number of patients seeking our services, closures of our hospitals and related facilities, \nand supply chain disruptions, as well as increased costs of products, commodities and energy (including utilities), and \ndisruptions in our information systems, which in turn could negatively impact our business and results of operations. In \naddition, certain of our operations and facilities are located in regions that may be disproportionately impacted by the \nphysical risks of climate change (resulting in potential increases in the intensity or frequency of hurricanes, extreme \nweather conditions or other natural disasters), and we face the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to our \nhospitals and related facilities and business interruptions caused by such events. We maintain property insurance coverage \nto address the impact of physical damage to our facilities and for business interruption losses. However, such insurance \ncoverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and we may experience a material, adverse effect on our results of \noperations that is not recoverable through our insurance policies. Additionally, if we experience a significant increase in \nclimate-related events that result in material losses we may be unable to obtain similar levels of property insurance \ncoverage in the future. In addition, changes in consumer preferences and additional legislation and regulatory \nrequirements, including those associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy, may increase costs associated with \ncompliance, the operation of our facilities and supplies. Regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and energy inputs \nmay also increase in coming years, which may adversely impact us through increased compliance costs for us and our \nsuppliers and vendors. Our response to climate change, our climate change strategies, policies, goals, commitments and \ndisclosure, and/or our ability to achieve our climate-related goals and commitments (which are subject to risks and \nuncertainties, many of which are outside of our control) could result in reputational harm as a result of negative public \nsentiment, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence. \nWe may be adversely affected if we are not able to achieve our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) goals \nor otherwise meet the expectations of our stakeholders with respect to ESG matters. \nWe strive to deliver shared value through our business, and our diverse stakeholders expect us to make significant \nprogress with respect to certain ESG-related matters.

Certain challenges we face in the \nachievement of our ESG objectives are also captured within our ESG reporting, which is not incorporated by reference \ninto and does not form any part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other filings with the SEC. Standards for \ntracking and reporting ESG matters continue to evolve. Our selection of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards, \nand the interpretation or application of those frameworks and standards, may change from time to time or differ from \nthose of others. This may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period or between \nus and other companies in the same industry. In addition, our processes and controls may not always comply with evolving \nstandards for identifying, measuring and reporting ESG metrics, including ESG-related disclosures that may be required \nof public companies by the SEC, and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to \nour current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future.

These value-\nbased purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality \nand efficiency of care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including Medicare currently require hospitals, \nASCs, home health agencies, hospices and other providers to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement \nupdates. In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events (also called “never \nevents”), and federal law prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical \nassistance provided to treat HACs. The 25% of hospitals with the worst risk-adjusted HAC scores in the designated \nperformance period receive a 1% reduction in their inpatient PPS Medicare payments the following year. \nHospitals with excess readmission rates for conditions designated by CMS receive a reduction in their inpatient \nPPS operating Medicare payments for all Medicare inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions \nsubject to the excess readmission standard. The reduction in payments to hospitals with excess readmissions can be up to \n3% of a hospital’s base payments. \nCMS has implemented a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services that reduces inpatient \nhospital payments for all discharges by 2% in each federal fiscal year. CMS pools the amount collected from these \nreductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by \nCMS. CMS scores each hospital based on achievement (relative to other hospitals) and improvement (relative to the \nhospital’s own past performance). Hospitals that meet or exceed the quality performance standards will receive greater \nreimbursement under the value-based purchasing program than they would have otherwise. In response to COVID-19, \nCMS has paused or refined several measures across various hospital quality measurement and value-based purchasing \nprograms. These policies are intended to ensure that these programs neither reward nor penalize hospitals based on \ncircumstances caused by the PHE that the measures were not designed to accommodate. \nIn January 2022, CMS began implementing a nationwide expansion of the HHVBP Model. Under the model, home \nhealth agencies will receive increases or reductions to their Medicare fee-for-service payments of up to 5%, based on \nperformance against specific quality measures relative to the performance of other home health providers. Calendar year \n2023 is the first performance year under the expanded HHVBP Model, and data collected in 2023 will impact payments \nin calendar year 2025. \nCMS has developed several alternative payment models that are intended to reduce costs and improve quality of \ncare for Medicare beneficiaries and has signaled its intent to have states apply similar strategies in the Medicaid context. \nExamples of alternative payment models include bundled payment models in which, depending on whether overall CMS \nspending per episode exceeds or falls below a target specified by CMS and whether quality standards are met, hospitals \nmay receive supplemental Medicare payments or owe repayments to CMS. Generally, participation in bundled payment \nprograms is voluntary, but CMS currently requires hospitals in selected markets to participate in a bundled payment \ninitiative for specified orthopedic procedures and in a model for end-stage renal disease treatment. In addition, a \nmandatory radiation oncology model was expected to begin January 1, 2023, but CMS has indefinitely delayed its \nimplementation. CMS has indicated that it is developing more voluntary and mandatory bundled payment models. \nParticipation in mandatory or voluntary demonstration projects, particularly demonstrations with the potential to affect \npayment, may negatively impact our results of operations. \n50"

      "text": "In a strategic report issued in 2021 and updated in 2022, the CMS Innovation Center highlighted the need to \naccelerate the movement to value-based care and drive broader system transformation. By 2030, the CMS Innovation \nCenter aims to have all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries and the vast majority of Medicaid beneficiaries in an \naccountable care relationship with providers who are responsible for quality and total medical costs. The CMS Innovation \nCenter signaled its intent to streamline its payment models and to increase provider participation through implementation \nof more mandatory models. \nThere are also several state-driven value-based care initiatives. For example, some states have aligned quality \nmetrics across payers through legislation or regulation. Some private third-party payers are also transitioning toward \nalternative payment models or implementing other value-based care strategies. For example, many large private third-\nparty payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several private third-party payers do not reimburse \nhospitals for certain preventable adverse events. Further, we have implemented a policy pursuant to which we do not bill \npatients or third-party payers for fees or expenses incurred due to certain preventable adverse events. \nWe expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome \nmeasures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. It is unclear whether \nthese and other alternative payment models will successfully coordinate care and reduce costs or whether they will \ndecrease aggregate reimbursement. We are unable to predict our future payments or whether we will be subject to payment \nreductions under these programs or how this trend will affect our results of operations. If we are unable to meet or exceed \nthe quality performance standards under any applicable value-based purchasing program, perform at a level below the \noutcomes demonstrated by our competitors, or otherwise fail to effectively provide or coordinate the efficient delivery of \nquality health care services, our reputation in the industry may be negatively impacted, we may receive reduced \nreimbursement amounts and we may owe repayments to payers, causing our revenues to decline. \nRisks related to macroeconomic conditions: \nOur overall business results may suffer during periods of general economic weakness. \nCOVID-19 has adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, economic conditions in the United \nStates. Outside of the governmental response to COVID-19, budget deficits at the federal level and within some state and \nlocal government entities have had a negative impact on spending, and may continue to negatively impact spending for \nhealth and human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant \nthird-party payer sources for our hospitals. We anticipate that the federal deficit, the growing magnitude of Medicare and \nMedicaid expenditures and the aging of the U.S. population will continue to place pressure on government health care \nprograms, and it is possible that future deficit reduction legislation will mandate additional Medicare spending reductions. \nOther risks we face during periods of economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines in the \npopulation covered under managed care agreements, increased patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and \nnonemergency health care procedures (including delaying surgical procedures), which may lead to poorer health and \nhigher acuity interventions, potential increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations, increased adoption of \nhealth plan structures that shift financial responsibility to patients and further difficulties in collecting patient receivables \nfor copayment and deductible receivables. Further, inflationary pressures may increase operating expenses faster than \nreflected in updates to the reimbursement systems of governmental and private payers. If general economic conditions, \nincluding inflation, deteriorate or remain volatile or uncertain for an extended period of time, our results of operations, \nliquidity and ability to repay our outstanding debt may be harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline. \nThese factors may affect the availability, terms or timing on which we may obtain any additional funding and our ability \nto access our cash. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, if \nat all. \nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in the market values of securities and interest rates. \nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. COVID-19 has increased volatility \nof the capital and credit markets and has adversely impacted economic conditions. The investment securities held by our \ninsurance subsidiaries were $473 million at December 31, 2022. These investments are carried at fair value, with changes \nin unrealized gains and losses related to factors other than credit loss allowances being recorded as adjustments to other \ncomprehensive income. At December 31, 2022, we had unrealized losses of $38 million on the insurance subsidiaries’ \ninvestment securities. \nWe are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investment securities of our insurance subsidiaries could \nbe impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts \nof cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty \nselling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have \n51"

We may be required to recognize credit-related impairments on long-term \ninvestments in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the \nsecurities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue specific factors. \nWe are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates that impact the amount of the interest expense \nwe incur with respect to our floating rate obligations as well as the value of certain investments. We periodically enter \ninto interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. These interest rate swap agreements \ninvolve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional \nprincipal amounts and maturity dates. \nRisks related to ownership of our common stock: \nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends. \nIn 2018, the Board of Directors initiated a cash dividend program under which the Company commenced a regular \nquarterly cash dividend. During 2022, the Board of Directors declared four quarterly dividends of $0.56 per share, or \n$2.24 per share in the aggregate, on our common stock. On January 26, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly \ndividend of $0.60 per share on our common stock payable on March 31, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of \nbusiness on March 17, 2023. \nThe declaration, amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our \nBoard of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective \nlaws and our agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. Our ability to pay dividends will \ndepend upon, among other factors, our cash flows from operations, our available capital and potential future capital \nrequirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, debt service requirements, share repurchases and investing \nin our existing markets as well as our results of operations, financial condition and other factors beyond our control that \nour Board of Directors may deem relevant. A reduction in or suspension or elimination of our dividend payments could \nhave a negative effect on our stock price. \nCertain of our investors may continue to have influence over us. \nOn November 17, 2006, HCA Inc. was acquired by a private investor group, including affiliates of HCA founder, \nDr. Thomas F.

In addition, pursuant to a shareholders agreement we entered into with \nHercules Holding II and the Frist-affiliated investors, certain representatives of these investors have the continued right \nto nominate certain of the members of our Board of Directors.

Because of these \nuncertainties, we cannot estimate how long or to what extent COVID-19 will impact our operations. \n2022 Operations Summary \nNet income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled $5.643 billion, or $19.15 per diluted share, for 2022, \ncompared to $6.956 billion, or $21.16 per diluted share, for 2021. The 2022 results include gains on sales of facilities of \n$1.301 billion, or $2.46 per diluted share, and losses on retirement of debt of $78 million, or $0.20 per diluted share. The \n2021 results include gains on sales of facilities of $1.620 billion, or $3.69 per diluted share, and losses on retirement of \ndebt of $12 million, or $0.03 per diluted share. Our provisions for income taxes for 2022 and 2021 include tax benefits of \n$77 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, and $119 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, respectively, related to employee \nequity award settlements. All “per diluted share” disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. \nShares used for diluted earnings per share were 294.666 million shares and 328.752 million shares for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 30.747 million and 37.812 million \nshares, respectively, of our common stock. \nRevenues increased to $60.233 billion for 2022 from $58.752 billion for 2021. Revenues increased 2.5% and 3.2%, \nrespectively, on a consolidated basis and on a same facility basis for 2022, compared to 2021. The consolidated revenues \nincrease can be attributed to the combined impact of a 0.4% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.1% \nincrease in equivalent admissions. The same facility revenues increase resulted from the net impact of a 3.3% increase in \nequivalent admissions and a 0.1% decline in revenue per equivalent admission. \nDuring 2022, consolidated admissions declined 0.7% and same facility admissions increased 0.5%, compared to \n2021. Inpatient surgical volumes were flat on a consolidated basis and increased 0.9% on a same facility basis during \n2022, compared to 2021. Outpatient surgical volumes increased 1.5% on a consolidated basis and increased 1.8% on a \nsame facility basis during 2022, compared to 2021. Emergency room visits increased 5.9% on a consolidated basis and \nincreased 7.6% on a same facility basis during 2022, compared to 2021. \nThe estimated cost of total uncompensated care increased $141 million for 2022, compared to 2021. Consolidated \nand same facility uninsured admissions declined 6.0% and 4.6%, respectively, and consolidated and same facility \nuninsured emergency room visits increased 4.4% and 6.6%, respectively, for 2022, compared to 2021. \nInterest expense totaled $1.741 billion for 2022, compared to $1.566 billion for 2021. The $175 million increase in \ninterest expense for 2022 was primarily due to an increase in the average debt balance, which was partially offset by a \ndecline in the average effective interest rate. \nCash flows from operating activities declined $437 million, from $8.959 billion for 2021 to $8.522 billion for 2022. \nThe decline in cash flows from operating activities was related primarily to a negative change in working capital items of \n$649 million, mainly from a decline in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a decline in net income of $687 \nmillion, excluding gains on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, offset by a decline in cash payments for \ninterest and income taxes of $847 million for 2022 compared to 2021. \n57"

We strive to be the health care system \nof choice in the communities we serve by developing comprehensive networks locally and supporting these networks \nwith enterprise expertise and economies of scale. Our strategy is organized around a framework that seeks to drive \nsustained growth by delivering operational excellence, attracting exceptional physicians and other health care \nprofessionals, developing comprehensive services, creating greater access, and coordinating higher quality care for \npatients. To achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda: \nGrow Our Presence in Existing Markets. We believe we are well positioned in a number of large and growing \nmarkets that will allow us the opportunity to generate long-term, attractive growth through the expansion of our presence \nin these markets. We plan to continue recruiting and strategically collaborating with the physician community and \ndeveloping comprehensive service lines such as cardiology, neurology, oncology, orthopedics and women’s services. \nAdditional components of our growth strategy include providing access and convenience through developing various \noutpatient facilities, including, but not limited to surgery centers, urgent care clinics, freestanding emergency care \nfacilities, imaging centers and home health and hospice services, as well as seeking to improve coordination of care and \npatient retention across our markets. \nAchieve Industry-Leading Performance in Clinical, Operational and Satisfaction Measures. Achieving high levels \nof patient safety, patient satisfaction and clinical quality are central goals of our business. To achieve these goals, we have \nimplemented a number of initiatives including infection reduction initiatives, hospitalist programs, advanced health \ninformation technology and evidence-based medicine programs. We routinely analyze operational practices from our \nbest-performing hospitals to identify ways to implement organization-wide performance improvements and reduce \nclinical variation. We believe these initiatives will continue to improve patient care, help us achieve cost efficiencies and \nfavorably position us in an environment where our constituents are increasingly focused on quality, efficacy and \nefficiency. \nRecruit and Retain Physicians and Other Health Care Professionals to Meet the Need for High Quality Health \nServices. We depend on the quality and dedication of the health care providers and other team members who serve at our \nfacilities. We believe a critical component of our growth strategy is our ability to successfully recruit and strategically \ncollaborate with physicians and other health care professionals to provide high quality care. We attract and retain \nphysicians and other health care professionals by providing high quality, convenient facilities with advanced technology, \nby expanding our specialty services and by building our outpatient operations. We believe our continued investment in \nthe employment, recruitment and retention of physicians and other health care professionals will improve the quality of \ncare at our facilities. \nContinue to Utilize Economies of Scale to Grow the Company. We believe there is significant opportunity to \ncontinue to grow our company by fully utilizing the scale and scope of our organization. We continue to invest in \ninitiatives such as care navigators, clinical data exchange and centralized patient transfer operations, which will enable us \nto improve coordination of care and patient retention across our markets. We believe our centrally managed business \nprocesses and ability to leverage cost-saving practices across our extensive network will enable us to continue to manage \ncosts effectively. We continue to invest in our Parallon subsidiary group to deploy key components of our support \ninfrastructure, including revenue cycle management, health care group purchasing, supply chain management and staffing \nfunctions. \nPursue a Disciplined Development Strategy. We continue to believe there are significant growth opportunities in \nour markets. We will continue to provide financial and operational resources to analyze and develop our in-market \nopportunities. To complement our in-market growth agenda and achieve cost savings and other benefits for the patients \nand communities we serve, we intend to focus on selectively developing and acquiring new hospitals, outpatient facilities \nand other health care service providers. \nOur strategy also emphasizes investments that advance our clinical systems and digital capabilities, transform care \nmodels with innovative care solutions, expand our workforce development programs and enhance our health care \nnetworks and partnerships. \n58"

      "text": "HCA HEALTHCARE, INC.  \nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  \nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates  \nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions \nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts \nof revenues and expenses. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are \nreasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates \nand related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known. Actual results may differ from these \nestimates. \nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in \nthe preparation of our consolidated financial statements. \nRevenues \nRevenues are recorded during the period the health care services are provided, based upon the estimated amounts \ndue from payers. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based upon the payment terms \nspecified in the related contractual agreements. Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are \ncomplex and subject to interpretation. The estimated reimbursement amounts are made on a payer-specific basis and are \nrecorded based on the best information available regarding management’s interpretation of the applicable laws, \nregulations and contract terms. Management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and \nincorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from \ncontract renegotiations and renewals. We have invested significant resources to refine and improve our billing systems \nand the information system data used to make contractual allowance estimates. We have developed standardized \ncalculation processes and related employee training programs to improve the utility of our patient accounting systems. \nPatients treated at hospitals for non-elective care, who have income at or below 400% of the federal poverty level, \nare eligible for charity care, and we limit the patient responsibility amounts for these patients to a percentage of their \nannual household income, computed on a sliding scale based upon their annual income and the applicable percentage of \nthe federal poverty level. Patients treated at hospitals for non-elective care, who have income above 400% of the federal \npoverty level, are eligible for certain other discounts which limit the patient responsibility amounts for these patients to a \npercentage of their annual household income, computed on a sliding scale based upon their annual income and the \napplicable percentage of the federal poverty level. We apply additional discounts to limit patient responsibility for certain \nemergency services. The federal poverty level is established by the federal government and is based on income and family \nsize. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in \nrevenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. We may attempt \nto provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for Medicaid, other federal or state \nassistance, or charity care. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied. \nImplicit price concessions relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. Estimated implicit price \nconcessions are recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the age of those accounts. Accounts are written off \nwhen all reasonable collection efforts have been performed. The estimates for implicit price concessions are based upon \nmanagement’s assessment of historical writeoffs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends \nin federal, state and private employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. Management relies on the \nresults of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and collections at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and \naccounts receivable (the “hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of information in estimating the collectability of our \naccounts receivable. We perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable \ncollection and writeoff data. We believe our quarterly updates to the estimated implicit price concession amounts at each \nof our hospital facilities provide reasonable estimates of our revenues and valuations of our accounts receivable. These \nroutine, quarterly changes in estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to the valuations of our accounts \nreceivable or period-to-period comparisons of our revenues. \n59"

Adverse \nchanges in the percentage of our patients having adequate health care coverage, increases in patient responsibility amounts \nunder certain health care coverages, general economic conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, \nor trends in federal, state, and private employer health care coverage could affect the collection of accounts receivable, \ncash flows and results of operations. \nProfessional Liability Claims \nWe, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in an environment with professional liability risks. Our \nfacilities are insured by our insurance subsidiary for losses up to $75 million per occurrence, subject, in most cases, to a \n$15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. The insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional \nliability risks generally above a retention level of either $25 million or $35 million per occurrence, depending on the \njurisdiction for the related claim. We purchase excess insurance on an occurrence reported basis for losses in excess of \namounts insured by our insurance subsidiary. Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $517 million, \n$453 million and $435 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During 2022, 2021 \nand 2020, we recorded reductions to the provision for professional liability risks of $55 million, $87 million and $112 \nmillion, respectively, due to the receipt of updated actuarial information. \nReserves for professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses \nincurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The estimated ultimate cost includes estimates of direct \nexpenses and fees paid to outside counsel and experts, but does not include the general overhead costs of our insurance \nsubsidiary or corporate office. Individual case reserves are established based upon the particular circumstances of each \nreported claim and represent our estimates of the future costs that will be paid on reported claims. Case reserves are \nreduced as claim payments are made and are adjusted upward or downward as our estimates regarding the amounts of \nfuture losses are revised. Once the case reserves for known claims are determined, information is stratified by loss layers \nand retentions, accident years, reported years, and geographic location of our hospitals. Several actuarial methods are \nemployed to utilize this data to produce estimates of ultimate losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims, \nincluding: paid and incurred extrapolation methods utilizing paid and incurred loss development to estimate ultimate \nlosses; frequency and severity methods utilizing paid and incurred claims development to estimate ultimate average \nfrequency (number of claims) and ultimate average severity (cost per claim); and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods which \nadd expected development to actual paid or incurred experience to estimate ultimate losses. These methods use our \ncompany-specific historical claims data and other information. Company-specific claim reporting and payment data \ncollected over an approximate 20-year period is used in our reserve estimation process. This company-specific data \nincludes information regarding our business, including historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and \ncurrent case loss reserves, actual and projected hospital statistical data, professional liability retentions for each policy \nyear, geographic information and other data. \n60"

      "text": "HCA HEALTHCARE, INC.  \nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  \nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (Continued) \nProfessional Liability Claims (continued) \nReserves and provisions for professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. The \nestimated reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance contracts, were $1.802 billion to $2.159 billion at \nDecember 31, 2022 and $1.752 billion to $2.098 billion at December 31, 2021. Our estimated reserves for professional \nliability claims may change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. We perform sensitivity analyses \nwhich model the volatility of key actuarial assumptions and monitor our reserves for adequacy relative to all our \nassumptions in the aggregate. Based on our analysis, we believe the estimated professional liability reserve ranges \nrepresent the reasonably likely outcomes for ultimate losses. We consider the number and severity of claims to be the \nmost significant assumptions in estimating reserves for professional liabilities. A 2.5% change in the expected frequency \ntrend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $29 million or reduce the reserve estimate by \n$28 million. A 2.5% change in the expected claim severity trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve \nestimate by $135 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $123 million. We believe adequate reserves have been recorded \nfor our professional liability claims; however, due to the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to resolve \nthe claims and the wide range of potential outcomes, our ultimate liability for professional liability claims could change \nby more than the estimated sensitivity amounts and could change materially from our current estimates. \nThe reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately 2,000 and 2,100 individual claims at December \n31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and estimates for unreported potential claims. The time period required to resolve these \nclaims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated. The average time period \nbetween the occurrence and final resolution for our professional liability claims is approximately five years, although the \nfacts and circumstances of each individual claim can result in an occurrence-to-resolution timeframe that varies from this \naverage. The estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly. \nReserves for professional liability risks were $2.043 billion and $2.022 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, \nrespectively. The current portion of these reserves, $515 million and $508 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, \nrespectively, is included in “other accrued expenses.” Obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance contracts \nare included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent reinsurers and excess insurance \ncarriers do not meet their obligations. Reserves for professional liability risks (net of $60 million and $55 million \nreceivable under reinsurance and excess insurance contracts at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively) were $1.983 \nbillion and $1.967 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The estimated total net reserves for professional \nliability risks at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are comprised of $793 million and $874 million, respectively, of case \nreserves for known claims and $1.190 billion and $1.093 billion, respectively, of reserves for incurred but not reported \nclaims. \nChanges in our professional liability reserves, net of reinsurance recoverable, for the years ended December 31, are \nsummarized in the following table (dollars in millions): \n2022 \n2021 \n2020 \nNet reserves for professional liability claims, January 1 \n$ \n1,967 \n$ 1,924 \n$ 1,781 \nProvision for current year claims \n538 \n530 \n519  \nFavorable development related to prior years’ claims \n(21) \n(77)\n(84) \nTotal provision \n517 \n453 \n435  \nPayments for current year claims\n4 \n5\n5  \nPayments for prior years’ claims\n493 \n379 \n287  \nTotal claim payments \n497 \n384 \n292  \nEffect of new retroactive reinsurance contracts\n(4) \n(26)\n— \nNet reserves for professional liability claims, December 31\n$ \n1,983 \n$ 1,967 \n$ 1,924 \n............ \n............................................ \n............ \n \n \n.................................................................... \n............................................ \n............................................. \n.......................................................... \n...................... \n \n ...... \n61"

      "text": "HCA HEALTHCARE, INC.  \nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  \nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (Continued) \nIncome Taxes \nWe calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets \nand liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences that arise from the recognition of items in different \nperiods for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed in \nour income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed in future periods. Interest and penalties payable to taxing \nauthorities are included as a component of our provision for income taxes. We have elected to treat taxes incurred on \nglobal intangible low-taxed income as a period expense. \nAlthough we believe we have properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws, \nfederal, state or foreign taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions upon audit. Significant judgment is required in \ndetermining and assessing the impact of uncertain tax positions. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from \nuncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our income tax returns. During each reporting period, we assess \nthe facts and circumstances related to uncertain tax positions. If the realization of unrecognized tax benefits is deemed \nprobable based upon new facts and circumstances, the estimated liability and the provision for income taxes are reduced \nin the current period. Final audit results may vary from our estimates. \nResults of Operations \nRevenue/Volume Trends \nOur revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by \nphysicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charge and negotiated payment rates for \nsuch services. Patient volumes and the related revenues were negatively impacted by COVID-19 beginning in the first \nhalf of 2020, and subsequent periods through the first half of 2022 have experienced fluctuations in COVID-19 volumes \nand revenues through the various surges, impacting comparisons for most of our patient volume and revenues operating \nstatistics. Gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are actually paid. Our facilities have entered into \nagreements with third-party payers, including government programs and managed care health plans, under which the \nfacilities are paid based upon the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or \ndiscounts from gross charges. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to \nqualify for charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do \nnot qualify for Medicaid or charity care. \nRevenues increased 2.5% to $60.233 billion for 2022 from $58.752 billion for 2021 and increased 14.0% for 2021 \nfrom $51.533 billion for 2020. The increase in revenues in 2022 can be attributed to the combined impact of a 0.4% \nincrease in revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.1% increase in equivalent admissions compared to the prior year. \nThe increase in revenues in 2021 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 6.8% increase in revenue per \nequivalent admission and a 6.8% increase in equivalent admissions compared to the prior year. \nSame facility revenues increased 3.2% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December \n31, 2021 and increased 14.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. \nThe 3.2% increase for 2022 can be attributed to the net impact of a 3.3% increase in equivalent admissions and a 0.1% \ndecline in revenue per equivalent admission. The 14.4% increase for 2021 can be primarily attributed to the combined \nimpact of a 6.3% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 7.6% increase in equivalent admissions. \nConsolidated admissions declined 0.7% during 2022 compared to 2021 and increased 4.0% during 2021 compared \nto 2020. Consolidated surgeries increased 1.0% during 2022 compared to 2021 and increased 8.9% during 2021 compared \nto 2020. Consolidated emergency room visits increased 5.9% during 2022 compared to 2021 and increased 13.8% during \n2021 compared to 2020. \nSame facility admissions increased 0.5% during 2022 compared to 2021 and increased 4.8% during 2021 compared \nto 2020. Same facility surgeries increased 1.5% during 2022 compared to 2021 and increased 9.0% during 2021 compared \nto 2020.

During 2022, 2021 and 2020, 58%, 56% and 56%, \nrespectively, of our admissions and 50%, 49% and 49%, respectively, of our revenues were generated by our Florida and \nTexas facilities. Uninsured admissions in Florida and Texas represented 74%, 72% and 72%, respectively, of our \nuninsured admissions each year during 2022, 2021 and 2020. \nWe receive a significant portion of our revenues from government health programs, principally Medicare and \nMedicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. Some state Medicaid programs use, \nor have applied to use, waivers granted by CMS to implement Medicaid expansion, impose different eligibility or \nenrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. We receive supplemental \npayments in several states. We are aware these supplemental payment programs are currently being reviewed by certain \nstate agencies and some states have made requests to CMS to replace their existing supplemental payment programs. It is \npossible these reviews and requests will result in the restructuring of such supplemental payment programs and could \nresult in the payment programs being reduced or eliminated. Because deliberations about these programs are ongoing, we \nare unable to estimate the financial impact the program structure modifications, if any, may have on our results of \noperations. \n63"

Emergency room visits increased 5.9% on a consolidated basis and increased 7.6% on a same facility \nbasis during 2022 compared to 2021. \nRevenues increased 2.5% to $60.233 billion for 2022 from $58.752 billion for 2021. The increase in revenues was \ndue to the combined impact of a 0.4% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.1% increase in equivalent \nadmissions compared to 2021. Same facility revenues increased 3.2% due primarily to the net impact of a 3.3% increase \nin equivalent admissions and a 0.1% decline in revenue per equivalent admission compared to 2021. \nSalaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 46.0% in 2022 and 45.6% in 2021. Salaries and benefits \nper equivalent admission increased 1.2% in 2022 compared to 2021. Same facility salaries and benefits per full time \nequivalent increased 3.3% for 2022 compared to 2021 as inflation has impacted our labor costs and as we continue to \nutilize certain contract, overtime and other premium rate labor costs to support our clinical staff and patients. We expect \ninflationary pressures will continue to impact our labor costs in the future. We intend to continue reducing our utilization \nof and rates paid for premium rate labor, but our ability to mitigate labor cost challenges may be affected by labor market \nconditions and other factors. Share-based compensation expense was $341 million in 2022 and $440 million in 2021. \nSupplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 15.6% in 2022 and 16.1% in 2021. Supply costs per equivalent \nadmission declined 3.2% in 2022 compared to 2021. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 2.4% for medical \ndevices, but declined 18.8% for pharmacy supplies and 1.6% for general medical and surgical items in 2022 compared to \n2021. The decline in pharmacy supplies is primarily related to higher utilization of certain COVID-19 therapies during \n2021. \nOther operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 18.5% in 2022 and 17.0% in 2021. Other operating \nexpenses are primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, \nutilities, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes. The 1.5% increase in other operating \nexpenses, as a percentage of revenues for 2022 compared to 2021, was primarily related to increased costs for \nsupplemental payment programs in certain states, as well as increased professional fees, utilities and insurance premiums. \nWe have seen inflation have a negative impact on certain of these expenses and expect inflationary pressures will continue \nto impact operating expenses in 2023. Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $517 million and \n$453 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. During 2022 and 2021, we recorded reductions of $55 million, or $0.14 \nper diluted share, and $87 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, respectively, to our provision for professional liability risks \nrelated to the receipt of updated actuarial information. \nEquity in earnings of affiliates was $45 million for 2022 and $113 million for 2021. The decline of $68 million is \nprimarily related to the sale of an equity investment during 2021. \n66"

Depreciation \nexpense was $2.941 billion for 2022 and $2.826 billion for 2021. The increase of $115 million in depreciation expense \nrelates primarily to capital expenditures at our existing facilities (same facility depreciation expense increased $134 \nmillion). \nInterest expense increased to $1.741 billion for 2022 from $1.566 billion for 2021. The $175 million increase in \ninterest expense was due to an increase in the average debt balance, which was partially offset by a decline in the average \neffective interest rate. Our average debt balance was $37.363 billion for 2022 compared to $32.109 billion for 2021. The \naverage effective interest rate for our long-term debt was 4.7% for 2022 and 4.9% for 2021. \nGains on sales of facilities were $1.301 billion and $1.620 billion for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The gains on \nsales of facilities for 2022 are primarily related to the sales of controlling interests in a subsidiary of our group purchasing \norganization and subsidiaries of our research entities. The gains on sales of facilities for 2021 are primarily related to the \nsales of five hospitals in Georgia and other health care entity investments. \nDuring 2022, we issued $6.000 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. We used a portion of the net \nproceeds to pay down our revolving credit facilities, and we redeemed all $1.250 billion outstanding aggregate principal \namount of our 4.75% senior notes due 2023 and all $1.250 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% \nsenior notes due 2023. The pretax loss on retirement of debt for these two redemptions was $78 million. During 2021, we \nissued $2.350 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. We also amended and restated our senior secured \nrevolving credit facility and our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, including increasing availability \nunder the asset-based revolving credit facility to $4.500 billion, extending the maturity date on both facilities to June 30, \n2026 and entering into a new $1.500 billion term loan A facility and a new $500 million term loan B facility (the “Credit \nAgreement Transactions”). We used the net proceeds from the senior notes issuance and the Credit Agreement \nTransactions to retire $3.657 billion of term loan facilities. The pretax loss on retirement of debt was $12 million. \nThe effective income tax rates were 23.6% and 23.3% for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate \ncomputations exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to consolidated partnerships. \nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased from $765 million for 2021 to $1.191 billion for 2022. \nThe increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related primarily to the gain on the sale of a controlling \ninterest in a subsidiary of our group purchasing organization and the partnership operations of two of our Texas markets. \nFor results of operations comparisons relating to years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, refer to our annual \nreport on Form 10-K, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nfor the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 18, \n2022. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nOur primary cash requirements are paying our operating expenses, servicing our debt, capital expenditures on our \nexisting properties, acquisitions of hospitals and health care entities, repurchases of our common stock, dividends to \nstockholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Our primary cash sources are cash flows from operating \nactivities, issuances of debt and equity securities and sales of hospitals and health care entities. \nCash provided by operating activities totaled $8.522 billion in 2022 compared to $8.959 billion in 2021 and $9.232 \nbillion in 2020. The $437 million decline in cash provided by operating activities for 2022, compared to 2021, was related \nprimarily to a negative change in working capital items of $649 million, mainly from a decline in accounts payable and \naccrued expenses, and a decline in net income of $687 million, excluding gains on sales of facilities and losses on \nretirement of debt, offset by a decline in cash payments for interest and income taxes of $847 million for 2022 compared \nto 2021. The $273 million decline in cash provided by operating activities for 2021, compared to 2020, was related to a \nnegative change in working capital items of $1.781 billion, primarily from an increase in accounts receivable, offset by \nthe increase in net income, excluding the non-cash impact of losses and gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement \nof debt and depreciation and amortization. Cash payments for interest and income taxes increased $1.075 billion for 2021 \ncompared to 2020. During 2020, we deferred $688 million of Social Security taxes as allowed for under the CARES Act. \nHalf of these taxes were paid in January 2022 and the remainder was paid in January 2023. Working capital totaled $3.741 \nbillion at December 31, 2022 and $3.960 billion at December 31, 2021. \n67"

Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures were $4.395 billion in 2022, $3.577 billion in 2021 and $2.835 \nbillion in 2020. In response to the risks COVID-19 presented to our business, we reduced certain planned projects and \ncapital expenditures during 2020. Planned capital expenditures are expected to approximate $4.3 billion in 2023. At \nDecember 31, 2022, there were projects under construction which had an estimated additional cost to complete and equip \nover the next five years of approximately $4.707 billion. We expect to finance capital expenditures with internally \ngenerated and borrowed funds. We expended $224 million, $1.105 billion and $568 million for acquisitions of hospitals \nand health care entities during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash flows from sales of hospitals and health care \nentities declined from $2.160 billion for 2021 (primarily related to the proceeds from our sales of five hospitals in Georgia \nand other health care entity investments) to $1.237 billion of net proceeds for 2022 (primarily related to proceeds from \nour sales of other health care entities). \nCash used in financing activities totaled $5.656 billion in 2022, $6.655 billion in 2021 and $4.677 billion in 2020. \nDuring 2022, we had a net increase of $3.287 billion in our indebtedness, paid dividends of $653 million and paid $7.000 \nbillion for repurchases of common stock. During 2021, we had a net increase of $3.255 billion in our indebtedness, paid \ndividends of $624 million and paid $8.215 billion for repurchases of common stock. During 2020, we made net payments \nof $3.217 billion related to our indebtedness, paid dividends of $153 million and paid $441 million for repurchases of our \ncommon stock. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $1.025 billion, $749 \nmillion and $626 million, respectively. The increase in distributions in 2022 is related to the sale of a controlling interest \nin a subsidiary of our group purchasing organization. \nWe, or our affiliates, may in the future repurchase portions of our debt or equity securities, subject to certain \nlimitations, from time to time in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with \napplicable SEC and other legal requirements. The timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend upon prevailing trading \nprices, general economic and market conditions, and other factors, including applicable securities laws. \nDuring February 2021, January 2022 and January 2023, our Board of Directors authorized $6 billion, $8 billion and \n$3 billion, respectively, for share repurchases of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The February 2021 \nauthorization was completed during 2022, and at December 31, 2022, there was $1.586 billion of share repurchase \nauthorization that remained available under the January 2022 authorization. Funds for the repurchase of debt or equity \nsecurities have, and are expected to, come primarily from cash generated from operations and borrowed funds. \nDuring 2022, our Board of Directors declared four quarterly dividends of $0.56 per share, or $2.24 per share in the \naggregate, on our common stock. On January 26, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.60 per \nshare on our common stock payable on March 31, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 17, \n2023. The timing and amount of future cash dividends will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital \nrequirements for strategic transactions, share repurchases and investing in our existing markets, the availability of \nfinancing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to \nour business model and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of \nstockholders and are in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements of the Company. \nIn addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of capital include amounts available under our senior \nsecured credit facilities ($3.535 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $4.445 billion as of January 31, 2023) and anticipated \naccess to public and private debt and equity markets. Effective in January 2023, availability under our senior secured \nrevolving credit facility was increased by $1.500 billion to total $3.500 billion. \nInvestments of our insurance subsidiaries, held to maintain statutory equity levels and to provide liquidity to pay \nclaims, totaled $473 million and $541 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The insurance subsidiary \nmaintained net reserves for professional liability risks of $147 million and $154 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, \nrespectively. Our facilities are insured by our insurance subsidiary for losses up to $75 million per occurrence; however, \nthis coverage is subject, in most cases, to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. Net reserves for the self-\ninsured professional liability risks retained were $1.836 billion and $1.813 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, \nrespectively. Claims payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, during the next 12 months are expected to approximate \n$503 million. We estimate that approximately $459 million of the expected net claim payments during the next 12 months \nwill relate to claims subject to the self-insured retention. \n68"

Our interest expense was $1.741 billion for 2022 and \n$1.566 billion for 2021. \nDuring 2022, we issued $6.000 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of (i) $1.000 billion \naggregate principal amount of 3 1/8% senior notes due 2027, (ii) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3 3/8% \nsenior notes due 2029, (iii) $2.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 3 5/8% senior notes due 2032, (iv) $500 million \naggregate principal amount of 4 3/8% senior notes due 2042 and (v) $2.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 4 5/8% \nsenior notes due 2052.

The senior secured credit \nfacilities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by substantially all existing and future, direct \nand indirect, 100% owned material domestic subsidiaries that are “Unrestricted Subsidiaries” under our Indenture dated \nDecember 16, 1993 (except for certain special purpose subsidiaries that only guarantee and pledge their assets under our \nsenior secured asset-based revolving credit facility). On May 25, 2022, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (“S&P”) \nannounced it had issued an investment grade rating with respect to the issuer credit rating of HCA Healthcare, Inc. and \nits subsidiaries. S&P’s announcement, in conjunction with previously disclosed events, constituted an “Investment Grade \nRating Event” or a “Ratings Event,” as applicable, under the terms of the indentures governing HCA Inc.’s outstanding \nsenior secured notes and, as a result, the conditions in the senior secured indentures to permit the permanent release of \nthe subsidiary guarantees and all collateral securing the senior secured notes were met. The subsidiary guarantees and \ncollateral securing our senior secured credit facilities are not affected. Following this release of the subsidiary guarantees \nand collateral securing the senior secured notes, the subsidiary guarantors deregistered with the SEC. As a result, \nsummarized financial information for HCA Healthcare, Inc., HCA Inc. and the subsidiary guarantors, and information \nabout the subsidiary guarantees and affiliates whose securities were pledged as collateral will no longer be presented. \nAll of the senior notes issued by HCA Inc. in 2014 or later continue to be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on \nan unsecured basis by HCA Healthcare, Inc. The combined assets, liabilities, and results of operations of HCA Healthcare, \nInc. and HCA Inc. are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial \nstatements of HCA Healthcare, Inc. As a result, summarized financial information of HCA Healthcare, Inc. and HCA Inc. \nis not required to be presented under Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X. \nMarket Risk \nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. Our insurance subsidiaries held \n$473 million of investment securities at December 31, 2022. These investments are carried at fair value, with changes in \nunrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2022, we \nhad unrealized losses of $38 million on the insurance subsidiaries’ investment securities. \nWe are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investments in debt and equity securities of our \ninsurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the insurance subsidiaries \nrequire significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short \nnotice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than \nwhat we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. We may be required to recognize credit-\nrelated impairments on our investment securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should \nthe fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors. \n69"

With respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, \napproximately $4.780 billion of long-term debt at December 31, 2022 was subject to variable rates of interest, while the \nremaining balance in long-term debt of $33.304 billion at December 31, 2022 was subject to fixed rates of interest. Both \nthe general level of interest rates and, for the senior secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable interest rates. \nOur variable debt is comprised primarily of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. The average \neffective interest rate for our long-term debt was 4.7% for 2022 and 4.9% for 2021. \nThe estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was $35.555 billion at December 31, 2022. The estimates of \nfair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt with the same \nmaturities.

In our opinion, HCA Healthcare, Inc.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s \ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB \nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and \nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform \nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained \nin all material respects. \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material \nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed \nrisk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit \nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the \nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with \ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies \nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the \ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded \nas necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, \nand that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management \nand directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of \nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial \nstatements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become \ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \ndeteriorate. \n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP \nNashville, Tennessee \nFebruary 17, 2023 \n72"

(the Company) as of December \n31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity (deficit) \nand cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively \nreferred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, \nin all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its \noperations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. \ngenerally accepted accounting principles. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \nStates) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria \nestablished in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion \nthereon. \nBasis for Opinion \nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an \nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the \nPCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities \nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, \nwhether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of \nthe financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such \nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. \nOur audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as \nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable \nbasis for our opinion. \nCritical Audit Matters \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements \nthat were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or \ndisclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex \njudgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial \nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate \nopinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \nF-2"

      "text": "Revenue Recognition \nDescription of the Matter  For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s revenues were $60.233 billion. As \ndiscussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues are based upon the\nestimated amounts the Company expects to be entitled to receive from patients and third-\nparty payers. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care and commercial\ninsurance plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual\nagreements. Management continually reviews the contractual allowances estimation process\nto consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in \nmanaged care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals.\nRevenues related to uninsured patients and uninsured copayment and deductible amounts for\npatients who have health care coverage may have discounts applied (uninsured discounts and\ncontractual discounts). The Company also records estimated implicit price concessions \n(based primarily on historical collection experience) related to uninsured accounts to record\nthese revenues and accounts receivable at the estimated amounts the Company expects to\ncollect. The primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including amounts\nowed from patients after insurance has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement.\nImplicit price concessions relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients and are \nbased upon management’s assessment of historical write-offs and expected net collections,\nbusiness and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer health care \ncoverage and other collection indicators. \nAuditing management’s estimates of contractual allowances and implicit price concessions \nwas complex and judgmental due to the significant data inputs and subjective assumptions \nutilized in determining related amounts. \nHow We Addressed the \nMatter in Our Audit \nWe tested internal controls that address the risks of material misstatement related to the\nmeasurement and valuation of revenues, including estimation of contractual allowances and \nimplicit price concessions. For example, we tested management’s internal controls over the\nkey data inputs to the contractual allowance and implicit price concession models, significant\nassumptions underlying management’s models, and management’s internal controls over \nretrospective reviews of historical reserve accuracy. \nTo test the estimated contractual allowances and implicit price concessions, we performed \naudit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies and evaluating the \nsignificant assumptions discussed above and testing the completeness and accuracy of the \nunderlying data used by the Company in its estimates. We compared the significant\nassumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends and considered \nchanges, if any, to the Company’s business and other relevant factors. We also assessed the\nhistorical accuracy of management’s estimates as a source of potential corroborative or\ncontrary evidence. \nProfessional Liability Claims \nDescription of the Matter \nAt December 31, 2022, the Company’s reserves for professional liability risks were $2.043\nbillion and the Company’s related provision for losses for the year ended December 31, 2022\nwas $517 million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, reserves \nfor professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate net cost of all reported and \nunreported losses incurred and unpaid through the consolidated balance sheet date.\nManagement estimates professional liability reserves and provisions for losses using\nindividual case-basis valuations and actuarial analyses. Trends in the average frequency \n(number of claims) and ultimate average severity (cost per claim) of claims are significant\nassumptions in estimating the reserves. \nAuditing management’s professional liability claims reserves was complex and judgmental \ndue to the significant estimations required in determining the reserves, particularly the \nactuarial methodology and assumptions related to the severity and frequency of claims. \nF-3"

For example, we \ntested internal controls over management’s review of the actuarial methodology and \nsignificant assumptions, and the completeness and accuracy of claims data supporting the \nrecorded reserves. \nTo test the Company’s determination of the estimated professional liability expense and \nreserves, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing the \ncompleteness and accuracy of underlying claims data used by the Company and its actuaries\nin its determination of reserves and reviewing the Company’s insurance contracts by policy \nyear to validate self-insured limits, deductibles and coverage limits. Additionally, with the\ninvolvement of our actuarial specialists, we performed audit procedures that included, among\nothers, assessing the actuarial valuation methodologies utilized by management and its \nactuaries, testing the significant assumptions including consideration of Company-specific\nclaim reporting and payment data, assessing the accuracy of management’s historical reserve\nestimates, and developing an independent range of reserves for comparison to the Company’s\nrecorded amounts. \n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1994. \nNashville, Tennessee \nFebruary 17, 2023 \nF-4"

      "text": "HCA HEALTHCARE, INC.  \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  \nNOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES \nReporting Entity \nHCA Healthcare, Inc. is a holding company whose affiliates own and operate hospitals and related health care \nentities. The term “affiliates” includes direct and indirect subsidiaries of HCA Healthcare, Inc. and partnerships and joint \nventures in which such subsidiaries are partners. At December 31, 2022 these affiliates owned and operated 182 hospitals, \n126 freestanding surgery centers, 21 freestanding endoscopy centers and provided extensive outpatient and ancillary \nservices. HCA Healthcare, Inc.’s facilities are located in 20 states and England. The terms “Company,” “HCA,” “we,” \n“our” or “us,” as used herein and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to HCA Healthcare, Inc. and its \naffiliates. The terms “facilities” or “hospitals” refer to entities owned and operated by affiliates of HCA and the term \n“employees” refers to employees of affiliates of HCA. \nBasis of Presentation \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires \nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements \nand accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. \nThe consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries and entities controlled by HCA. We generally define \n“control” as ownership of a majority of the voting interest of an entity. The consolidated financial statements include \nentities in which we absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual \nreturns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. The accounts of acquired \nentities are included in our consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to our acquisition of controlling \ninterests. Significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Investments in entities we do not control, but in \nwhich we have a substantial ownership interest and can exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity \nmethod. \nThe majority of our expenses are “cost of revenue” items. Costs that could be classified as general and \nadministrative include our corporate office costs, which were $378 million, $400 million and $416 million for the years \nended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \nCOVID-19 \nWe believe the extent of COVID-19’s impact on our operating results and financial condition has been and could \ncontinue to be driven by many factors, most of which are beyond our control and ability to forecast. Because of these \nuncertainties, we cannot estimate how long or to what extent COVID-19 will impact our operations. \nRevenues \nOur revenues generally relate to contracts with patients in which our performance obligations are to provide health \ncare services to the patients. Revenues are recorded during the period our obligations to provide health care services are \nsatisfied. Our performance obligations for inpatient services are generally satisfied over periods that average \napproximately five days, and revenues are recognized based on charges incurred in relation to total expected charges. Our \nperformance obligations for outpatient services are generally satisfied over a period of less than one day. The contractual \nrelationships with patients, in most cases, also involve a third-party payer (Medicare, Medicaid, managed care health \nplans and commercial insurance companies, including plans offered through the health insurance exchanges) and the \ntransaction prices for the services provided are dependent upon the terms provided by (Medicare and Medicaid) or \nnegotiated with (managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies) the third-party payers. The payment \narrangements with third-party payers for the services we provide to the related patients typically specify payments at \namounts less than our standard charges. Medicare generally pays for inpatient and outpatient services at prospectively \ndetermined rates based on clinical, diagnostic and other factors. Services provided to patients having Medicaid coverage \nare generally paid at prospectively determined rates per discharge, per identified service or per covered member. \nAgreements with commercial insurance carriers, managed care and preferred provider organizations generally provide \nfor payments based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates or discounted fee-for-service rates. \nManagement continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and \nregulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and \nrenewals. \n10"

      "text": "HCA HEALTHCARE, INC.  \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  \nNOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) \nRevenues (continued) \nOur revenues are based upon the estimated amounts we expect to be entitled to receive from patients and third-\nparty payers. Estimates of contractual adjustments under managed care and commercial insurance plans are based upon \nthe payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Revenues related to uninsured patients and uninsured \ncopayment and deductible amounts for patients who have health care coverage may have discounts applied (uninsured \ndiscounts and contractual discounts). We also record estimated implicit price concessions (based primarily on historical \ncollection experience) related to uninsured accounts to record these revenues at the estimated amounts we expect to \ncollect. Our revenues by primary third-party payer classification and other (including uninsured patients) for the years \nended December 31, are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions): \nYears Ended December 31, \n2022 \nRatio \n2021 \nRatio \n2020 \nRatio  \nMedicare\n $ 10,447 \n17.3% $ 10,447 \n17.8% $ 10,420 \n20.2%  \nManaged Medicare\n9,201 \n15.3 \n8,424 \n14.3 \n6,997 \n13.6  \nMedicaid\n2,636 \n4.4 \n2,290 \n3.9 \n1,965 \n3.8  \nManaged Medicaid\n3,998 \n6.6 \n3,124 \n5.3 \n2,621 \n5.1  \nManaged care and other insurers\n29,120 \n48.3 \n30,295 \n51.6 \n26,535 \n51.5  \nInternational (managed care and other insurers)\n1,317 \n2.2 \n1,336 \n2.3 \n1,120 \n2.2  \nOther\n3,514 \n5.9 \n2,836 \n4.8 \n1,875 \n3.6  \nRevenues\n $ 60,233 \n100.0% $ 58,752 \n100.0% $ 51,533 \n100.0%  \n..............................................................\n .............................................. \n.............................................................. \n .............................................. \n......................... \n .. \n.................................................................... \n .............................................................\nLaws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. \nEstimated reimbursement amounts are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost reports are prepared and filed and as final \nsettlements are determined (in relation to certain government programs, primarily Medicare, this is generally referred to \nas the “cost report” filing and settlement process). The adjustments to estimated Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement \nand disproportionate-share amounts, related primarily to cost reports filed during the respective year, resulted in net \nincreases to revenues of $56 million, $53 million and $70 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The adjustments \nto estimated reimbursement amounts related primarily to cost reports filed during previous years resulted in a net increase \nto revenues of $42 million in 2022, a net increase to revenues of $19 million in 2021 and a net reduction to revenues of \n$5 million in 2020. \nThe Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital participating in the Medicare \nprogram to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s \nemergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize \nthe condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to \nscreen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal \nand state laws and regulations require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care encourages, us to provide \nservices to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive. \nPatients treated at hospitals for non-elective care, who have income at or below 400% of the federal poverty level, \nare eligible for charity care, and we limit the patient responsibility amounts for these patients to a percentage of their \nannual household income, computed on a sliding scale based upon their annual income and the applicable percentage of \nthe federal poverty level. Patients treated at hospitals for non-elective care, who have income above 400% of the federal \npoverty level, are eligible for certain other discounts which limit the patient responsibility amounts for these patients to a \npercentage of their annual household income, computed on a sliding scale based upon their annual income and the \napplicable percentage of the federal poverty level. We apply additional discounts to limit patient responsibility for certain \nemergency services. The federal poverty level is established by the federal government and is based on income and family \nsize. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in \nrevenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. We may attempt \nto provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for Medicaid, other federal or state \nassistance, or charity care. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied. \nF-11"

      "text": "HCA HEALTHCARE, INC.  \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  \nNOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) \nRevenues (continued) \nThe collection of outstanding receivables from Medicare, Medicaid, managed care payers, other third-party payers \nand patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. The primary collection risks relate \nto uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts \ncovered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain \noutstanding. Implicit price concessions relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. Estimated implicit price \nconcessions are recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the age of those accounts. Accounts are written off \nwhen all reasonable collection efforts have been performed. \nThe estimates for implicit price concessions are based upon management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and \nexpected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer health care \ncoverage and other collection indicators. Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and \ncollections at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the “hindsight analysis”) as a \nprimary source of information in estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable. We perform the hindsight \nanalysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. We believe our \nquarterly updates to the estimated implicit price concession amounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable \nestimates of our revenues and valuations of our accounts receivable. These routine, quarterly changes in estimates have \nnot resulted in material adjustments to the valuations of our accounts receivable or period-to-period comparisons of our \nrevenues. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, estimated implicit price concessions of $6.780 billion and $6.784 billion, \nrespectively, had been recorded to adjust our revenues and accounts receivable to the estimated amounts we expect to \ncollect. \nTo quantify the total impact of the trends related to uninsured patient accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view \ntotal uncompensated care, which is comprised of charity care, uninsured discounts and implicit price concessions. A \nsummary of the estimated cost of total uncompensated care for the years ended December 31, follows (dollars in millions): \n2022 \n2021 \n2020 \nPatient care costs (salaries and benefits, supplies, other \noperating \nexpenses and depreciation and amortization) \n $ \n51,180 \n$ \n49,074 \n$ \n44,271 \nCost-to-charges ratio (patient care costs as percentage of gross \npatient charges)\n11.0% \n11.3% \n12.0% \nTotal uncompensated care \n $ \n31,734 \n$ \n29,642 \n$ \n29,029 \nMultiply by the cost-to-charges ratio\n11.0% \n11.3% \n12.0% \nEstimated cost of total uncompensated care\n $ \n3,491 \n$ \n3,350 \n$ \n3,483 \n............................\n.......................................................................... \n............................................................\n............................................ \n.................................\nThe total uncompensated care amounts include charity care of $13.615 billion, $13.644 billion and $13.763 billion \nfor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The estimated cost of charity care was $1.498 \nbillion, $1.542 billion and $1.652 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \nCash and Cash Equivalents \nCash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. \nOur insurance subsidiaries’ cash equivalent investments in excess of the amounts required to pay estimated professional \nliability claims during the next twelve months are not included in cash and cash equivalents as these funds are not available \nfor general corporate purposes. Carrying values of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-term \nnature of these instruments. \nOur cash management system provides for daily investment of available balances and the funding of outstanding \nchecks when presented for payment. Outstanding, but unpresented, checks totaling $656 million and $536 million at \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, have been included in “accounts payable” in the consolidated balance sheets. \nUpon presentation for payment, these checks are funded through available cash balances or our credit facility. \nF-12"

      "text": "HCA HEALTHCARE, INC.  \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  \nNOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) \nAccounts Receivable \nWe receive payments for services rendered from federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms), managed care health plans, commercial insurance companies, employers and patients. We recognize that \nrevenues and receivables from government agencies are significant to our operations, but do not believe there are \nsignificant credit risks associated with these government agencies. We do not believe there are any other significant \nconcentrations of revenues from any particular payer that would subject us to any significant credit risks in the collection \nof our accounts receivable. Days revenues in accounts receivable were 53 days, 49 days and 45 days at December 31, \n2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Changes in general economic conditions, patient accounting service center operations, \npayer mix, payer claim processing, or federal or state governmental health care coverage could affect our collection of \naccounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations. \nInventories \nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. \nProperty and Equipment \nDepreciation expense, computed using the straight-line method, was $2.941 billion in 2022, $2.826 billion in 2021 \nand $2.693 billion in 2020. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging generally \nfrom 10 to 40 years. Estimated useful lives of equipment vary generally from four to 10 years. \nWhen events, circumstances or operating results indicate the carrying values of certain property and equipment \nexpected to be held and used might be impaired, we prepare projections of the undiscounted future cash flows expected \nto result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the projections indicate the recorded amounts are not \nexpected to be recoverable, such amounts are reduced to estimated fair value. Fair value may be estimated based upon \ninternal evaluations that include quantitative analyses of revenues and cash flows, reviews of recent sales of similar assets \nand independent appraisals. \nProperty and equipment to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair value less costs \nto sell or close. The estimates of fair value are usually based upon recent sales of similar assets and market responses \nbased upon discussions with and offers received from potential buyers. \nInvestments of Insurance Subsidiaries \nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the investment securities held by our insurance subsidiaries were classified as \n“available-for-sale” as defined in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 320, Investments — Debt Securities \nand are recorded at fair value. The investment securities are held for the purpose of providing a funding source to pay \nliability claims covered by the insurance subsidiaries. We perform quarterly assessments of individual investment \nsecurities to determine whether declines in fair value are due to credit-related or noncredit-related factors. Our investment \nsecurities evaluation process involves subjective judgments, often involves estimating the outcome of future events, and \nrequires a significant level of professional judgment in determining whether a credit-related impairment has occurred. We \nevaluate, among other things, the financial position and near term prospects of the issuer, conditions in the issuer’s \nindustry, liquidity of the investment, changes in the amount or timing of expected future cash flows from the investment, \nand recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating agency, to determine if, and when, a decline in the fair value of an \ninvestment below amortized cost is considered to be a credit-related impairment. The extent to which the fair value of the \ninvestment is less than amortized cost and our ability and intent to retain the investment, to allow for any anticipated \nrecovery of the investment’s fair value, are important components of our investment securities evaluation process. \nF-13"

In addition to the annual impairment review, \nimpairment reviews are performed whenever circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. Impairment testing \nfor goodwill is done at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, and our \nimpairment testing is performed at the operating division level. We compare the fair value of the reporting unit assets to \nthe carrying amount, on at least an annual basis, to determine if there is potential impairment. If the fair value of the \nreporting unit assets is less than their carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair value is estimated based upon \ninternal evaluations of each reporting unit that include quantitative analyses of market multiples, revenues and cash flows \nand reviews of recent sales of similar facilities. No goodwill impairments were recognized during 2022, 2021 or 2020. \nDuring 2022, goodwill increased by $262 million related to acquisitions and declined by $105 million related to \nforeign currency translation and other adjustments. During 2021, goodwill increased by $1.002 billion related to \nacquisitions and declined by $75 million related to foreign currency translation and other adjustments. \nDuring 2022, identifiable intangible assets declined by $44 million due to amortization and other adjustments. \nDuring 2021, identifiable intangible assets increased by $60 million related to acquisitions and declined by $25 million \ndue to amortization and other adjustments. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over estimated \nlives ranging generally from three to 10 years. The gross carrying amounts of amortizable identifiable intangible assets at \nboth December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $274 million and accumulated amortization was $208 million and $175 million, \nrespectively. The gross carrying amounts of indefinite-lived identifiable intangible assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021 \nwere $293 million and $304 million, respectively. Indefinite-lived identifiable intangible assets are not amortized but are \nsubject to annual impairment tests, and impairment reviews are performed whenever circumstances indicate a possible \nimpairment may exist. \nDebt Issuance Costs and Discounts \nDebt issuance costs and discounts are amortized based upon the terms of the respective debt obligations. The gross \ncarrying amounts of debt issuance costs and discounts at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $496 million and $446 \nmillion, respectively, and accumulated amortization was $195 million and $198 million, respectively. Amortization of \ndebt issuance costs and discounts is included in interest expense and was $29 million, $27 million and $30 million for \n2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \nProfessional Liability Claims \nReserves for professional liability risks were $2.043 billion and $2.022 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, \nrespectively. The current portion of the reserves, $515 million and $508 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, \nrespectively, is included in “other accrued expenses” in the consolidated balance sheets. Provisions for losses related to \nprofessional liability risks were $517 million, $453 million and $435 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and \nare included in “other operating expenses” in our consolidated income statements. Provisions for losses related to \nprofessional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded \nreductions to the provision for professional liability risks of $55 million, $87 million and $112 million, respectively, due \nto the receipt of updated actuarial information. Loss and loss expense reserves represent the estimated ultimate net cost \nof all reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The reserves for \nunpaid losses and loss expenses are estimated using individual case-basis valuations and actuarial analyses. Those \nestimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency. The estimates are continually reviewed and \nadjustments are recorded as experience develops or new information becomes known. Adjustments to the estimated \nreserve amounts are included in current operating results. The reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately \n2,000 and 2,100 individual claims at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and estimates for unreported potential \nclaims. The time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim \nis settled or litigated. During 2022 and 2021, $497 million and $384 million, respectively, of net payments were made for \nprofessional and general liability claims. The estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly. \nAlthough considerable variability is inherent in professional liability reserve estimates, we believe the reserves for losses \nand loss expenses are adequate; however, there can be no assurance the ultimate liability will not exceed our estimates. \nF-14"

Subject, in most cases, to a \n$15 million per occurrence self-insured retention, our facilities are insured by our insurance subsidiary for losses up to \n$75 million per occurrence. The insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally \nabove a retention level of either $25 million or $35 million per occurrence, depending on the jurisdiction for the related \nclaim. We also maintain professional liability insurance with unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts \ninsured by our insurance subsidiary. \nThe obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance contracts are included in the reserves for professional \nliability risks, as we remain liable to the extent the reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations \nunder the reinsurance and excess insurance contracts. The amounts receivable under the reinsurance contracts were $48 \nmillion and $44 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, recorded in “other assets,” and $12 million and \n$11 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, recorded in “other current assets.” \nFinancial Instruments \nDerivative financial instruments have been employed to manage risks, including interest rate exposures, and have \nnot been used for trading or speculative purposes. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically \neither in earnings or in stockholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive income, depending on whether the \nderivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or a \ncash flow hedge. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are \nrecorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the hedged \nitems when they occur. The net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is recognized as interest expense. \nNoncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Entities \nThe consolidated financial statements include all assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of less than 100% owned \nentities that we control. Accordingly, we have recorded noncontrolling interests in the earnings and equity of such entities. \nNOTE 2 — SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION \nStock Incentive Plans \nOur stock incentive plans are designed to promote the long-term financial interests and growth of the Company by \nattracting and retaining management and other personnel, motivating them to achieve long range goals and aligning their \ninterests with those of our stockholders. Stock appreciation right (“SARs”) and restricted share unit (“RSUs”) grants vest \nsolely based upon continued employment over a specific period of time, and performance share unit (“PSUs”) grants vest \nbased upon both continued employment over a specific period of time and the achievement of predetermined financial \ntargets over a specific period of time. At December 31, 2022 there were 13.826 million shares available for future grants. \nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan \nOur employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) provides our participating employees an opportunity to obtain shares \nof our common stock at a discount (through payroll deductions over three-month periods). At December 31, 2022, 4.436 \nmillion shares of common stock were reserved for ESPP issuances. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized \n$16 million, $15 million and $13 million, respectively, of compensation expense related to the ESPP. \nF-15"

Awards under our stock incentive plans generally vest based on continued \nemployment (“Time SARs” and “RSUs”) or based upon continued employment and the achievement of certain financial \ntargets (“Performance SARs” and “PSUs”). PSUs have a three-year cumulative earnings per share target, and the number \nof PSUs earned can vary from zero (for actual performance of less than 90% of target) to two times the original PSU grant \n(for actual performance of 110% or more of target). Each grant is valued as a single award with an expected term equal \nto the average expected term of the component vesting tranches. The expected term of the share-based award is limited \nby the contractual term. We use historical exercise behavior data and other factors to estimate the expected term of the \nSARs. \nCompensation cost is recognized on the straight-line attribution method.

Expected and scheduled maturities may differ because the issuers of certain \nsecurities have the right to call, prepay or otherwise redeem such obligations prior to their scheduled maturity date. \nNOTE 7 — ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE \nAccounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”) emphasizes fair \nvalue is a market-based measurement, and fair value measurements should be determined based on the assumptions \nmarket participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities. ASC 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes \nbetween market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity \n(observable inputs classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about \nmarket participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). \nLevel 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs \nare inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or \nindirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs \nobservable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield \ncurves observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which \nare typically based on an entity’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the \ndetermination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level \nin the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input significant \nto the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value \nmeasurement in its entirety requires judgment. \nThe investments of our insurance subsidiaries are generally classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value \nhierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources \nwith reasonable levels of price transparency. \nThe following tables summarize our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December \n31, 2022 and 2021, aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall (dollars in \nmillions): \n2022 \nFair Value Measurements Using\nFair Value \n \nQuoted Prices in \nActive Markets for\nIdentical Assets \nand Liabilities \n(Level 1) \nSignificant \nOther \nObservable \nInputs \n(Level 2) \n \nSignificant \nUnobservable\nInputs \n(Level 3) \n \nAssets: \nInvestments of insurance subsidiaries: \nDebt securities............................................. $ \n377 $\n— \n \n$\n377 \n \n$\n— \n \nMoney market funds and other ................... \n96 \n96 \n—\n—\nInvestments of insurance subsidiaries......... \n473 \n96 \n377 \n—\nLess amounts classified as current assets ... \n(92) \n(92) \n—\n—\n$ \n381 $\n4 \n \n$\n377 \n \n$ \n— \nF-21"

We refer to the \nfacilities described under (ii) through (iv) above, collectively, as the “cash flow credit facility” and, together with the ABL \ncredit facility, the “senior secured credit facilities.” Finance leases and other secured debt totaled $953 million at \nDecember 31, 2022. Effective in January 2023, availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility was \nincreased by $1.500 billion to total $3.500 billion, the senior secured term loan B facility was fully retired and certain \nadministrative updates were made to our credit agreements. \nBorrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a base \nrate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (2) the prime rate of Bank of America \nor (b) a reference rate (LIBOR historically and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) beginning January 4, 2023) \nfor the relevant interest period, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under the \nsenior secured credit facilities may be reduced subject to attaining certain leverage ratios. \nThe senior secured credit facilities contain a number of covenants that restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our \n(and some or all of our subsidiaries’) ability to incur additional indebtedness, repay subordinated indebtedness, create \nliens on assets, sell assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, pay \ndividends and distributions, and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, we are required to satisfy and \nmaintain a maximum total leverage ratio covenant under the cash flow credit facility and, in certain situations under the \nABL credit facility, a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant. \nSenior Unsecured Notes \nSenior unsecured notes consist of (i) $31.791 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes with maturities \nranging from 2024 to 2052; (ii) an aggregate principal amount of $125 million medium-term notes maturing 2025; and \n(iii) an aggregate principal amount of $736 million debentures with maturities ranging from 2023 to 2095. \nGeneral Debt Information \nThe senior secured credit facilities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all existing and future, \ndirect and indirect, 100% owned material domestic subsidiaries that are “Unrestricted Subsidiaries” under our Indenture \n(the “1993 Indenture”) dated December 16, 1993 (except for certain special purpose subsidiaries that only guarantee and \npledge their assets under our ABL credit facility). \nAll obligations under the ABL credit facility, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to \npermitted liens and other exceptions, by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the receivables of the borrowers and \neach guarantor under such ABL credit facility (the “Receivables Collateral”). \nAll obligations under the cash flow credit facility and the guarantees of such obligations are secured, subject to \npermitted liens and other exceptions, by: \n•  \na first-priority lien on the capital stock owned by HCA Inc., or by any guarantor, in each of their respective \nfirst-tier subsidiaries; \n•  \na first-priority lien on substantially all present and future assets of HCA Inc. and of each guarantor other \nthan (i) “Principal Properties” (as defined in the 1993 Indenture), (ii) certain other real properties and (iii) \ndeposit accounts, other bank or securities accounts, cash, leaseholds, motor-vehicles and certain other \nexceptions; and \n•  \na second-priority lien on certain of the Receivables Collateral. \nMaturities of long-term debt in years 2024 through 2027 are $2.382 billion, $4.656 billion, $5.316 billion and \n$2.396 billion, respectively. \nF-23"

As a result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and regulatory \nproceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or asserted against us. We are also subject to claims and suits \narising in the ordinary course of business, including claims for personal injuries or wrongful restriction of, or interference \nwith, physicians’ staff privileges. In certain of these actions the claimants may seek punitive damages against us, which \nmay not be covered by insurance. We are also subject to claims by various taxing authorities for additional taxes and \nrelated interest and penalties. The resolution of any such lawsuits, claims or legal and regulatory proceedings could have \na material, adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. \nGovernment Investigations, Claims and Litigation \nHealth care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various governmental agencies. Under the federal \nFalse Claims Act (“FCA”), private parties have the right to bring qui tam, or “whistleblower,” suits against companies \nthat submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. Some states have \nadopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and \nfrom time to time, other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal \nand state agencies. Depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be \nconsidered systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position \nor liquidity. \nTexas operates a state Medicaid program pursuant to a waiver from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \nunder Section 1115 of the Social Security Act (“Program”). The Program includes uncompensated-care pools; payments \nfrom these pools are intended to defray the uncompensated costs of services provided by our and other hospitals to \nMedicaid eligible or uninsured individuals. Separately, we and other hospitals provide charity care services in several \ncommunities in the state. In 2018, the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for \nthe Southern District of Texas requested information about whether the Program, as operated in Harris County, complied \nwith the laws and regulations applicable to provider related donations, and the Company cooperated with that request. On \nMay 21, 2019, a qui tam lawsuit asserting violations of the FCA and the Texas Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act related to \nthe Program, as operated in Harris County, was unsealed by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. \nBoth the federal and state governments declined to intervene in the qui tam lawsuit. The Company believes that our \nparticipation is and has been consistent with the requirements of the Program and is vigorously defending against the \nlawsuit being pursued by the relator. We cannot predict what effect, if any, the qui tam lawsuit could have on the \nCompany. \nF-25"

During \nJanuary 2020 and January 2019, our Board of Directors authorized share repurchase programs for up to $4 billion ($2 \nbillion for each authorization) of our outstanding common stock. \nDuring 2022, we repurchased 30.747 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $227.67 per share \nthrough market purchases pursuant to the February 2021 authorization (which was completed during 2022) and the \nJanuary 2022 authorization. At December 31, 2022, we had $1.586 billion of repurchase authorization available under \nthe January 2022 authorization. During 2021, we repurchased 37.812 million shares of our common stock at an average \nprice of $217.25 per share through market purchases pursuant to each of the $2 billion share repurchase programs \nauthorized during January 2019 and January 2020 (which were completed during 2021) and the $6 billion share repurchase \nprogram authorized during February 2021. During 2020, we repurchased 3.287 million shares of our common stock at an \naverage price of $134.18 per share through market purchases pursuant to the $2 billion share repurchase program \nauthorized during January 2019. \nNOTE 12 — EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS \nWe maintain defined contribution benefit plans that are available to employees who meet certain minimum \nrequirements. The plans require that we match specified percentages of participant contributions up to certain maximum \nlevels (generally, 100% of the first 3% to 9%, depending upon years of vesting service, of compensation deferred by \nparticipants). Benefits expense under these plans totaled $606 million for 2022, $560 million for 2021 and $552 million \nfor 2020. Our matching contributions are funded during the year following the participant contributions. \nWe maintain the noncontributory, nonqualified Restoration Plan to provide retirement benefits for eligible \nemployees. Eligibility for the Restoration Plan is based upon earning eligible compensation in excess of a base amount \nand attaining 1,000 or more hours of service during the plan year. Company credits to participants’ hypothetical account \nbalances (the Restoration Plan is not funded) depend upon participants’ compensation, years of vesting service, \nhypothetical investment returns (gains or losses) and certain IRS limitations. Benefits expense under this plan was a $27 \nmillion credit for 2022, $38 million expense for 2021 and $35 million expense for 2020. Accrued benefits liabilities under \nthis plan totaled $210 million at December 31, 2022 and $258 million at December 31, 2021. \nWe maintain a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) for certain executives (the SERP is not funded). \nThe plan is designed to ensure that upon retirement the participant receives the value of a prescribed life annuity from the \ncombination of the SERP and our other benefit plans. Benefits expense under the plan was $22 million for 2022, $22 \nmillion for 2021 and $24 million for 2020. Accrued benefits liabilities under this plan totaled $137 million at December \n31, 2022 and $201 million at December 31, 2021. \nWe maintain defined benefit pension plans which resulted from certain hospital acquisitions in prior years. Benefits \nexpense under these plans was an $11 million credit for 2022, $4 million expense for 2021, and $8 million expense for \n2020. Accrued benefits under these plans totaled $9 million of assets at December 31, 2022 and $9 million of liabilities \nat December 31, 2021. \nF-26"

We operate in two \ngeographically organized groups: the National and American Groups. At December 31, 2022, the National Group included \n96 hospitals located in Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, northern Kentucky, Nevada, New Hampshire, \nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia, and the American Group included 79 hospitals located in Colorado, \nKansas, southern Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas. We also operate seven hospitals in England, and \nthese facilities are included in the Corporate and other group. \nAdjusted segment EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, losses and \ngains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, income taxes and net income attributable to noncontrolling \ninterests. We use adjusted segment EBITDA as an analytical indicator for purposes of allocating resources to geographic \nareas and assessing their performance. Adjusted segment EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator within the \nhealth care industry, and also serves as a measure of leverage capacity and debt service ability. Adjusted segment EBITDA \nshould not be considered as a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, and the \nitems excluded from adjusted segment EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial \nperformance. Because adjusted segment EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted \naccounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, adjusted segment EBITDA, as presented, may not \nbe comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The geographic distributions of our revenues, equity \nin earnings of affiliates, adjusted segment EBITDA, depreciation and amortization, assets and goodwill and other \nintangible assets are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions) and represent the operating segments at \nDecember 31, 2022: \nFor the Year Ended December 31, \n2022 \n2021 \n2020 \nRevenues: \nNational Group\n$ \n30,350 $ \n29,826 $ \n25,694\nAmerican Group\n26,865 \n26,152 \n23,593\nCorporate and other\n3,018 \n2,774 \n2,246\n$ \n60,233 $ \n58,752 $ \n51,533 \nEquity in earnings of affiliates: \nNational Group\n$ \n(4) $ \n(33) $ \n(28)\nAmerican Group\n(43)\n(53)\n(42)\nCorporate and other\n2 \n(27)\n16 \n$ \n(45) $ \n(113) $ \n(54)\nAdjusted segment EBITDA: \nNational Group\n$ \n6,379 $ \n7,200 $ \n5,532\nAmerican Group\n6,055 \n6,156 \n5,333\nCorporate and other\n(367)\n(712)\n(828)\n$ \n12,067 $ \n12,644 $ \n10,037\nDepreciation and amortization: \nNational Group\n$ \n1,464 $ \n1,359 $ \n1,216\nAmerican Group\n1,219 \n1,183 \n1,164\nCorporate and other\n286 \n311 \n341\n$ \n2,969 $ \n2,853 $ \n2,721\nFor the Year Ended December 31, \n2022 \n2021 \n2020 \nAdjusted segment EBITDA \n$ \n12,067 $ \n12,644 $ \n10,037  \nDepreciation and amortization\n2,969 \n2,853 \n2,721  \nInterest expense\n1,741 \n1,566 \n1,584  \nLosses (gains) on sales of facilities\n(1,301) \n(1,620)\n7  \nLosses on retirement of debt\n78 \n12 \n295  \nIncome before income taxes \n$ \n8,580 $ \n9,833 $ \n5,430  \nF-27"
