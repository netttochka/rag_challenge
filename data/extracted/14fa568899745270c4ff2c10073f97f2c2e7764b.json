      "text": "The past twelve months has been a challenging time \nglobally. We all breathed a collective sigh of relief as \nCOVID-19 subsided, only to be met with economic \nheadwinds in 2022. In this environment, management \nfocused on operations, leasing, completing and \nintegrating the recent development projects into the \nportfolio, while also focusing on improving the balance \nsheet, all of which resulted in historic high occupancy \nlevels, value creation from developments and greatly \nimproved debt metrics. Management’s focused approach \nto improving the balance sheet over the past twelve \nmonths positions Crombie favourably to meet current and \nfuture macro-economic challenges.\nOver the past few years Crombie has focused on \nexpanding its portfolio by adding residential and \nindustrial properties, further strengthening its asset base. \nCrombie’s asset quality continues to improve steadily \nthrough prudent and thoughtful curation, development, \nand entitlement processes. In 2022, Crombie also \nworked diligently to define and understand the impact \nof the portfolio on the environment, with management \ncommitting to set strategic sustainability and ESG metrics \nand work towards achieving those targets.\nManagement nurtures a culture at Crombie that enables \nthe organization to thrive, by focusing on people and \nstrengthening the guiding values on which that culture \nis built. In 2022, these values showed up in the everyday \nactions of employees, as they came together to support \ntheir communities and each other, and it has had a \nnoticeable impact on Crombie’s success. The impact of \nculture on strategic results is well-documented, and the \nstrength of Crombie’s culture resulted in Don Clow being \nnamed one of Canada’s Most Admired CEOs in 2022.\nOne of the most important functions of the Board is to \nensure that Crombie has a CEO in place to lead for the \nfuture growth of the business. With this in mind, the Board \nbegan an extensive review of senior management roles, \nMessage from\nthe Chair\nstructure and succession planning in 2021, engaging a \nleading talent advisory firm to assist in identifying and \nevaluating CEO succession candidates with extensive real \nestate experience. Mark Holly was identified, and when \nDon Clow retired, effective the end of February 2023, \nMark was named his successor.\nUnder Don’s leadership over the past 13.5 years, Crombie \nhas achieved outstanding results and significant growth. \nHe leaves the REIT in a far stronger position than when \nhe arrived. On behalf of the entire Board of Trustees, \nwe would like to thank Don for his many contributions \nto Crombie and we wish him well in his retirement. After \nthe extensive CEO succession process, the Board hired \nMark Holly as Crombie’s new President & CEO, and we are \nlooking forward to working together. Mark joins Crombie \nfrom Empire, and has a successful track record of over \n20 years of leadership in the real estate industry, including \nextensive experience in development, and his knowledge \nof both Crombie and Empire is a valuable asset. He values \ncommunication, collaboration, and relationships, and \naligns well with Crombie’s guiding values, paving the way \nto continue delivering on the successful strategy that has \nmade Crombie one of Canada’s top-performing REITs.\nThe role of the Board is to oversee Crombie’s long-\nterm strategy with white-glove governance, and we are \nfortunate to have an extraordinary group of dedicated \nTrustees committed to this work. In last year’s report, we \nwelcomed Michael Vels to our board. Later in 2022, we \nwelcomed two additions to the Board, Michael Waters, \nChief Executive Officer of the Minto Group, and \nHeidi Jamieson-Mills, Senior Vice President of Finance, \nReporting and Treasury at Empire. Michael brings over \n25 years of experience in real estate finance, investment \nand development, and financial advisory services, while \nEmpire-appointed Heidi contributes a wealth of financial \nknowledge and a deep understanding of Empire to the \nBoard. I look forward to working with and learning from \nboth Michael and Heidi and welcome their contributions.\n2\nCROMBIE REIT Annual Report 2022"

As CEO for 2022, Don reflects here on the year’s results, \nfollowed by an introduction from Mark. \nLetter from \nDon Clow, \nretired CEO\nGrowth-Focused: Crombie achieved solid growth in 2022, \nwhile also significantly improving our financial condition \nthrough a strengthened balance sheet, lowered debt \nlevels, ample liquidity, and increased unencumbered asset \npool. These accomplishments were achieved by delivering \nour strategy of outstanding operations, including record \noccupancy, responsible investment in grocery-anchored \nretail in partnership with Empire, and sustainable \ndevelopment, with an award-winning engaged workforce. \nOur team and culture were recognized as one of Atlantic \nCanada’s Top Employers for the seventh time. Crombie has \nremained focused on long-term sustainable growth despite \ncapital market volatility and ongoing macro-economic and \ngeopolitical pressures.\nDevelopment has been a key component of our long-term \nstrategy over the last several years. In the fourth quarter of \n2022, we reached substantial completion at our retail-related \nindustrial development, Voilà CFC 3, in Calgary. Always \nseeking ways to optimize the value of our development \npipeline while balancing capital allocation priorities, we are \nparticularly proud of the sale of our King George site in \nSurrey, British Columbia. This transaction was a great \nexample of the many opportunities available to Crombie \nand the underlying land value held in our portfolio. \nResilient: Crombie’s ability to be agile is underpinned by \nour intentionally curated portfolio. Our relationship with \nour strategic partner, Empire, continues to be an important \ndriver of our success, providing many attractive risk-adjusted \nopportunities and allowing for stable growth and value \ncreation for our Unitholders. Our tenants, primarily serving \nthe everyday needs of Canadians, have proven their \nresilience over the difficult last few years as well. In 2022, \nmultiple tenants moved into our top 20, of which 60% are \nnow investment grade, demonstrating the attractiveness of \nour portfolio and the quality of our cash flow. \nSustainable: Throughout 2022, we formalized our \nESG policies and strategy while continuing to advance \nseveral important initiatives. We updated our Sustainable \nDevelopment Policy, introduced portfolio-wide ESG risk \nassessments, set internal ESG targets to advance our \nimpact, gathered an inventory of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) \nemissions, and identified reduction pathways. We continue \nto uphold white-glove governance and all board \ncommittees have mandates that include ESG oversight. \nOn the social aspect of ESG, our Diversity, Equity, and \nInclusion Committee works on creating a more welcoming \nworkplace where people feel a strong sense of belonging, \nand we continue to encourage our teams to volunteer \nfor community organizations across Canada. In 2022, \nour employees dedicated over 6,000 hours to volunteer \norganizations of their choosing. We are truly committed \nto doing our part to build a Canada where everyone can \nthrive. Measuring and tracking our progress in how we \nimpact our environment and society takes time and energy \n– but it is absolutely worth it, and I’m proud of our team for \ntheir dedication to this work.\nNew Leadership: For 13.5 years, I’ve had the privilege of \nserving as Crombie’s President and CEO. I feel immense \npride in the organization from which I’m retiring. We’ve \nachieved incredible success with top-quartile total \nUnitholder return. We evolved from a regional landlord \ninto a national owner, operator, and developer of great \nproperties across Canada. Our strategic relationship \nwith Empire has become a more impactful driver of \ngrowth over the last five years and has empowered many \nmutually beneficial opportunities.

Beginning in late 2022, Crombie \nleveraged an ESG software platform, implemented in 2019, to conduct an inventory \nof GHG emissions for our portfolio of properties to better understand our scope 1, 2, \nand 3 emissions, and their impact on climate change. We have analyzed the resulting \ninventory of emissions and conducted scenario analysis of GHG emission reduction \nscopes and timelines. As scope 3 emissions, and specifically emissions from our tenant \ncontrolled spaces, make up the majority of our total emissions, Crombie is proactively \nworking with its strategic partner and largest tenant, Empire, and has started engaging \nwith our tenants to educate and support GHG emission reductions across our portfolio. \nAdditionally, we have started a review of our properties’ current resilience to physical \nclimate risks and, in 2023, will generate an action plan to strengthen the resilience of \nour properties with respect to future physical climate events.\nBOMA BEST: We continued to earn and upgrade BOMA BEST® green certifications \nfor our properties, initially focusing on our owned and managed sites in a phased \napproach that in 2022, targeted a group of open-air grocery-anchored centres in \nNova Scotia. \nAvalon Mall, in St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, achieved BOMA BEST® Gold \ncertification, and the 2022 BOMA NL Earth Award and Certificate of Excellence – \nRetail. Additionally, Avalon Mall won BOMA Canada’s 2022 Outstanding Building of \nthe Year, “TOBY”, award in the retail category. The TOBY award is the most prestigious \nand comprehensive program of its kind in the commercial real estate industry, in \nCanada. Judging for this award is based upon building standards, community impact, \ntenant relations, energy conservation, environmental and sustainability management, \nemergency preparedness and building personnel training.\nEnvironmental Partnerships: We continued to engage with our tenants, suppliers \nand other stakeholders on opportunities to reduce our collective environmental \nfootprint. Avalon Mall was recently named Champion for a Greener Future by the \nMulti-Materials Stewardship Board (“MMSB”) of Newfoundland, which is dedicated \nto promoting sustainable waste management through public education and waste \ndiversion programs. \nWe are exploring opportunities to gain alignment with our strategic partner, Empire, \nincorporating their data into our calculations and sharing best practices across \nour property portfolio.\nEnvironmental, Social & Governance (“ESG”) Priorities\nIn 2022, we continued to advance our environmental, social and governance priorities.\n21"

Committed occupancy in our \noffice portfolio is at 92.5%, an increase from 91.8% at December 31, 2021, \nprimarily due to new tenants.\nThrough our development strategy, Crombie continues to evolve from \ndefensive grocery-anchored retail to a balance of grocery-anchored \nretail and retail-related industrial, as well as large-scale mixed-use \nresidential properties, creating long-term value for local communities \nand Unitholders.

The \nincrease is primarily due to the acquisition of grocery-anchored assets, \ncontractual rent step-ups, and new leasing.

      "text": "OPERATING INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO UNITHOLDERS\nFor the three months ended:\nOperating income attributable to Unitholders increased by $8,988, or \n11.4%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher \ngain on disposal of investment properties of $19,822 in the fourth quarter \nof 2022 and lower finance costs from operations of $2,016 resulting \nprimarily from reduced mortgage interest expense due to mortgage \nrepayments and dispositions, and the redemption of Series D senior \nunsecured notes in the fourth quarter of 2022. The growth in operating \nincome was partially offset by a lower gain on distribution from equity-\naccounted investments of $15,525 compared to the fourth quarter of \n2021 resulting from cash distributions received from 1600 Davie Limited \nPartnership in excess of our investment in the joint venture.\nA decrease in net property income of $586 was primarily due to an \nincrease of $3,423 in recoverable property tax expense resulting \nprimarily from development, lease conversions, acquisitions, and higher \nassessments. Rental revenue decreased by $2,616 due to properties that \nwere disposed, recoverable operating expenses increased $965 as a \nresult of higher repair costs, lease termination income was reduced by \n$926, and tenant incentive amortization increased $691 primarily from \nnew leasing. The reduction in net property income is partially offset \nby increased property tax recoveries of $3,155, income of $2,013 from \nacquisitions, increased operating cost recoveries of $1,588, and $885 in \nsupplemental rent from modernization investments compared to the \nfourth quarter of 2021.\nFor the year ended: \nOperating income attributable to Unitholders increased by $12,399, or \n8.0%, on an annual basis primarily driven by higher gain on disposal \nof investment properties of $24,279 compared to 2021. Finance costs \nfrom operations decreased $9,774 due primarily to lower mortgage \ninterest expense resulting from mortgage repayments and dispositions. \nThe growth in operating income was offset in part by reduced gain \non distribution from equity-accounted investments of $12,592 resulting \nfrom cash distributions received from 1600 Davie Limited Partnership in \nexcess of our investment in the joint venture in the fourth quarter of 2021. \nAn additional $7,861 in impairments was recognized in 2022 compared \nto 2021. The impairments on three properties in the third quarter of \n2022 were the result of continuing high vacancy at one property, the \ndemolition of a vacant building, and a recent redevelopment that \nincluded a partial demolition.\nA decrease in net property income of $1,213 compared to 2021 is \nprimarily due to a decrease of $10,900 in rental revenue from properties \nthat were disposed, and increased recoverable property tax expense \nof $6,263 resulting primarily from development, lease conversions, \nacquisitions, and higher assessments. Recoverable operating expenses \nincreased $5,285 due to higher repair costs, lease termination income \ndecreased by $3,473, and tenant incentive amortization increased by \n$3,178 as a result of new leasing. This is partially offset by income of \n$7,831 from acquisitions, increased property tax recoveries of $6,281, \nincreased operating cost recoveries of $5,836, $2,273 in supplemental \nrent from modernization investments, increased parking revenue of \n$1,634, and $1,500 from renewals and new leasing.\nSAME-ASSET PROPERTY CASH NOI*\nManagement uses net property income on a cash basis (property cash NOI*) as a measure of performance as it reflects the cash generated by \nproperties period-over-period.

Additional increases in income are due to increased property \ntax recoveries of $3,155, $2,013 from acquisitions since January 1, 2022, \nincreased operating cost recoveries of $1,588, and $885 in supplemental \nrent from modernization investments compared to the same quarter \nin 2021. A decrease in general and administrative expenses of $1,304 is \ndue primarily to a $1,129 reduction in Unit-based compensation costs \nresulting from a decrease in Crombie’s Unit price from the same period \nin 2021. A reduction in loss from equity-accounted investments of $684, \nwith increased FFO adjustments for equity-accounted investments \nof $585, also contributed to the increase in FFO in the quarter. FFO \ngrowth is offset in part by an increase of $3,423 in recoverable property \ntax expense resulting primarily from development, lease conversions, \nacquisitions, and higher assessments. Rental revenue decreased by \n$2,616 due to dispositions and interest on floating rate debt increased \nby $1,521 due to higher interest rates and higher average loan balances \ncompared to the same period in 2021. Additionally, recoverable \noperating expenses increased $965 as a result of higher repair costs \nand lease termination income decreased by $926.\nFor the year ended:\nOn an annual basis, FFO increased $18,705 primarily driven by lower \nfinance costs from operations due to reduced mortgage interest \nexpense of $9,986 resulting from mortgage repayments and dispositions \nsince January 1, 2021 and higher capitalized interest of $1,671 as a result \nof development activity in the current year. Income increased $7,831 \nfrom acquisitions, $6,281 from increased property tax recoveries, $5,836 \nfrom increased operating cost recoveries, $2,273 from supplemental \nrent from modernization investments, $1,634 in parking revenue, and \n$1,500 from renewals and new leasing. A reduction in general and \nadministrative expenses of $5,937 resulted primarily from a decrease \nin Unit price and its impact on Unit-based compensation plans of \n$5,649. The improvement in FFO is offset in part by a decrease of \n$10,900 in rental revenue from dispositions, an increase of $6,263 in \nrecoverable property tax expense resulting primarily from development, \nlease conversions, acquisitions, and higher assessments.

      "text": "DEVELOPMENT\nProperty development is a strategic priority for Crombie to improve \nNAV*, cash flow growth and Unitholder value. With urban intensification \nan important reality across the country, Crombie is focused on \nevaluating and undertaking major developments at certain properties, \nwhere incremental costs to develop are greater than $50,000 and \nwhere development may include residential, commercial, and/or retail-\nrelated industrial (“Major Developments”). This discussion of Crombie’s \ndevelopment activities contains forward-looking information. Refer \nto the “Forward-looking Information” section of this MD&A starting on \npage 85 for additional information regarding such statements and the \nrelated risks and uncertainties.\nCrombie has the potential to unlock significant value within its current \npipeline of 27 major development properties over the next 15 years or \nlonger. Crombie benefits from having solid income (NOI, FFO* and \nAFFO*) generated by most of these properties while working through \nthe various approvals, entitlements, and advance preparations required \nbefore each major development can commence. \nCrombie has a strategic relationship with Empire. The majority of our \ndevelopment properties currently have Empire as an anchor tenant. \nOur strategic relationship enables us to unlock value and transition from \nexisting operating properties to construction/development of these sites \non mutually agreeable terms.\nOur major development plans include the development of mixed-use \nproperties with a focus on grocery-anchored retail and, wherever \npractical, primarily purpose-built residential rental accommodations \nthat provide revenue, diversification, and growth to Crombie. We view \nthis approach as the optimal way to drive both NAV* and AFFO* growth. \nFrom time to time, Crombie may enter into partnerships to complete \ndevelopments to share knowledge, risk, and expertise. In certain \ncases, residential condominium uses may also be considered, as will \ncertain other uses (e.g. retail-related industrial), to satisfy municipal \nrequirements and/or market opportunities.\nSUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED \nDEVELOPMENTS\nCrombie recognizes substantial completion when key project milestones \nare met and/or project spending has reached over 90% of total project \ncosts. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Crombie reached \nsubstantial completion on two of its major development projects. Bronte \nVillage, Crombie’s mixed-use development in partnership with Prince \nDevelopments, reached substantial completion in the first quarter \nended March 31, 2022. Commercial GLA of 54,000 is 83.5% leased as \nat December 31, 2022 and lease up continues for the 466,000 square \nfeet of residential area with 50.5% of all units available being leased \nas at year end. Project costs at Bronte totalled $278,000, $139,000 at \nCrombie’s share, with yields still expected to be in the 5.4%–6.0% range.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2022, Crombie achieved \nsubstantial completion at its retail-related industrial development, \nVoilà CFC 3, in Calgary, Alberta. Voilà CFC 3 is Crombie’s wholly owned \nstate-of-the-art Empire grocery fulfillment hub powered by Ocado’s \nindustry leading technology. The 304,000 square foot industrial building \nis fully leased as at December 31, 2022, with rent expected to commence \nin mid 2023.\nThese projects have reached substantial completion, thereby reducing \nthe construction risk remaining in the developments. The remaining risk \nat Bronte Village is primarily related to achieving successful lease-up \nstabilization of vacant units at market rents, and potential changes \nin prevailing market rents. Any failure to achieve successful lease-up \nstabilization at current prevailing market rents could negatively impact \nexpected yields for this development.\nCompleted GLA is based on applicable standards of area measurement \ndetermined through internal site plans and drawings, and using external \nmassing studies, where applicable. GLA in the above paragraphs is \ndiscussed at full project density.\nTotal estimated costs include the current carrying costs of development \nlands, where applicable, net of any reductions from dispositions. \nTotal estimated project costs include land costs on existing income-\nproducing properties upon transfer to the development, soft and hard \nconstruction costs, tenant inducements, external leasing costs, finance \ncosts, capitalized interest and other carrying costs, such as capitalized \nconstruction and development wages and property taxes. These costs \nare determined by using internal knowledge and external professional \nresources, where applicable.\nThe expected yield for each project is then derived by dividing the \nestimated annual NOI by the total estimated cost for the project. \nEstimated annual NOI is calculated using estimated first year stabilized \nannual rent for each tenant, assuming 100% occupancy. These estimates \nare established using market rents, Crombie’s market knowledge, \nand/or externally generated market studies.\nDEVELOPMENT PIPELINE\nCrombie has identified 27 major development projects as at \nDecember 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021 – 31). Management uses current \nproject assumptions to calculate the pipeline cost range, factoring in \na degree of uncertainty that comes with a diverse pipeline that spans \n15 years or longer. Uncertainty can come in the form of changing project \nscopes, moving certain properties in or out of the pipeline, variations in \nthe entitlement process, the potential of engaging joint venture partners, \ndispositions of pipeline properties, and a variety of external factors that \nmay affect project costing. Costs presented in Crombie’s pipeline are \nreflective of current construction cost estimates on a market-by-market \nbasis. Crombie monitors inflationary pressures impacting construction \ncosts and adjusts pipeline assumptions when necessary. Given that \nsome of these projects may not reach the full potential of the original \nscope, management discloses a low and high range to reasonably \nestimate the pipeline costs. As at December 31, 2022, total project \ncosts to develop the pipeline range from $5,000,000 to $6,800,000 \n(December 31, 2021 – $5,300,000 to $7,500,000). Year over year changes \nin the pipeline can be attributed to changing project scopes, changing \nproject costs, the ongoing refinement of development assumptions, \ncompletions and removals of properties from the pipeline, and evolving \nopportunities in our pipeline. Crombie may enter joint ventures or other \npartnership arrangements for these properties to share cost, revenue, \nrisk, and development expertise, depending upon the nature of each \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n51"

      "text": "CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nWe continue to reduce risk and build financial strength by strategically \nmanaging our capital structure and optimizing capital allocation to \ngenerate long-term value for our stakeholders. Our continued success \nis underpinned by a strong balance sheet and more than adequate \nliquidity, and an investment-grade credit rating profile providing the \ncompany with a solid financial foundation and great financial flexibility.\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK\nThe real estate industry is highly capital intensive. \nCrombie’s strategic capital management objectives consist of \nfour main priorities:\n1.\t to maintain multiple sources of both debt and equity financing; \n2.\t to reduce risk by prefunding capital commitments;\n3.\t to source capital with the lowest cost on a long-term basis and to \nmaintain overall indebtedness at reasonable levels, utilize staggered \ndebt maturities, minimize long-term exposure to excessive levels of \nfloating rate debt; and\n4.\t maintain conservative payout ratios.\nAt a minimum, Crombie’s capital structure is managed to ensure that \nit complies with the limitations pursuant to its Declaration of Trust, the \ncriteria contained in the Income Tax Act (Canada) in regard to the \ndefinition of a REIT, and existing debt covenants.\nCrombie’s Declaration of Trust sets out the investment guidelines for \nCrombie’s capital deployment. The Declaration of Trust outlines the \nminimum due diligence that must be completed prior to a project being \napproved by the Investment Committee and/or Board. Crombie’s Board \nensures continued compliance with the Declaration of Trust through \nthe review and approval of the annual operating and capital budgets, \nannual confirmation of Crombie’s strategic plan, and approval of \nindividual projects. The annual budget will detail the level of projected \ncapital spend for a given year and how the required capital will be \nfunded, as well as various key performance indicators and impacts on \ndebt covenants. The Board monitors performance quarterly, or on a \nmore frequent basis if needed. In addition, the Board and management \nregularly review unspent committed capital (i.e. unfunded capital \nrequirements of partially completed projects), with a lens towards \nCrombie’s available liquidity, leverage metrics, and sources of financing.\nCrombie expects to be able to satisfy all of its financing requirements \nthrough the use of some or all of the following: \n•\t cash on hand;\n•\t cash flow generated from operating the property portfolio;\n•\t cash distributions from our joint ventures;\n•\t bank credit facilities;\n•\t proceeds from partial or full disposition of select non-core investment \nproperties;\n•\t traditional construction financing;\n•\t CMHC insured mortgages on residential properties;\n•\t secured mortgages and term debt on unencumbered properties;\n•\t issuance of senior unsecured notes;\n•\t the issuance of new Units; and\n•\t the issuance of Units under its distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”).\nOur guiding principles for managing capital are as follows: \nGuiding Principles\nCurrent Status\nReduce total leverage over the medium/long-term\nD/GFV* is 41.8% at December 31, 2022 compared to 45.3% at December 31, 2021.\nMaintain minimum of $250 million liquidity\nIncreased liquidity to $583.0M, up $75.2M from 2021.\nImprove weighted average term to maturity\nDecrease to 4.7 years at December 31, 2022 versus 5.1 years at December 31, 2021.\nLower cost of capital through equity raises and/or innovative \nfunding solutions, such as capital recycling\nDuring 2022, Crombie raised $200M of equity at a record price of $17.45 per Unit, \nand completed dispositions for cash proceeds of $173.8M.\nMaintain balance sheet strength during current period of rising \ninterest rates\nReduce mortgage debt outstanding by $154M from December 31, 2021.\nIncrease unencumbered asset pool\nExpanded unencumbered asset pool by approximately 23% to $2.2B since \nDecember 31, 2021.\nINVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING\nCrombie’s ability to raise debt financing and the cost associated with that debt financing depends on its ability to access the public debt capital \nmarkets, which are reliant on assigned credit ratings, as well as the bank credit market. A credit rating generally indicates the rating agency’s \nassessment of the relative risk that the borrower will not fulfill its obligations in a timely manner with respect to both interest and principal \ncommitments. In 2013, Crombie successfully applied to DBRS for a credit rating in order to access the unsecured note markets. In the second quarter \nof 2022, Crombie received notice of an upgrade in its credit rating from “BBB (low)” with a “Negative” trend to “BBB (low)” with a “Stable” trend.1\n(1)\tThe credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold any of the securities referred to, and they may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the assigning rating agency. Ratings are \ndetermined by the rating agencies based on criteria established from time to time by them, and they do not comment on market price or suitability for a particular investor.

As at December 31, 2022, Crombie’s weighted \naverage capitalization rate used in the determination of the fair value \nof its investment properties was 5.94%, an increase of 29 basis points \nfrom December 31, 2021.

Also \ncontributing to the improvement in the ratio was an increase of $67,000 \nin total gross fair value of investment properties held in joint ventures, \nprimarily due to the substantial completion of Bronte Village in the first \nquarter of 2022.

This is offset in part by lower additions to tenant \nincentives ($7,432 compared to $9,833 in the fourth quarter of 2021) and \n$5,242 growth in increase in net assets attributable to Unitholders.\nFor the year ended: \nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities on an \nannual basis is primarily due to lower additions to tenant incentives \n($42,135 compared to $72,542 in 2021), growth in increase in net \nassets attributable to Unitholders and non-cash items of $4,413 and \n$4,674, respectively. This is partially offset by a decrease in the net \nchange in non-cash working capital items of $35,982.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the three months ended:\nThe decrease in cash used in financing activities is due primarily \nto mortgage repayments of $22,314 in the fourth quarter of 2022 \ncompared to $120,447 for the same period in 2021 and an increase \nin the amount drawn on floating rate credit facilities of $69,011 \ncompared to $3,021 in the fourth quarter of 2021. This is offset in \npart by the $150,000 redemption of Series D unsecured notes in \nthe fourth quarter of 2022.\nFor the year ended: \nThe decrease in cash used in financing activities on an annual basis is \nprimarily driven by the net amount drawn on floating rate credit facilities \nof $131,140 compared to net repayments of $33,132 in 2021. Additionally, \nthe Unit issuance was $194,741 net of costs in 2022 compared to the Unit \nissuance of $97,225 in 2021 and finance costs decreased by $9,392 from \nthe prior year primarily due to reduced mortgage interest expense. \nThis is offset in part by the $150,000 issue of Series J unsecured notes \nin 2021 and the $25,550 issuance of mortgages in 2021 compared to \n$7,000 in 2022.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the three months ended:\nThe increase in cash provided by investing activities results from \nincreased proceeds from disposition of $23,253 compared to the fourth \nquarter of 2021 and increase in collection of notes receivable from \nrelated parties of $10,516. This is partially offset by the reduction of \ndistributions from equity-accounted investments of $25,001 compared \nto the fourth quarter of 2021.\nFor the year ended: \nThe annual increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily \ndue to the increase in acquisitions of investment properties of $51,023 \nin 2022 compared to 2021, additions to investment properties $27,608 \nhigher than in 2021, and decreased distributions from equity-accounted \ninvestments of $19,677.

In the opinion of \nmanagement, any liability that would arise from such contingencies \nwould not have a significant adverse effect on these operating results.\nCrombie has agreed to indemnify its trustees and officers, and particular \nemployees, in accordance with Crombie’s policies. Crombie maintains \ninsurance policies that may provide coverage against certain claims.\nCrombie obtains standby letters of credit to support its obligations with \nrespect to construction work on its investment properties and satisfying \nmortgage financing requirements. As at December 31, 2022, Crombie \nhas a total of $2,883 (December 31, 2021 – $3,003) in outstanding \nletters of credit related to construction work being performed on \ninvestment properties.\nCrombie does not believe that any of these standby letters of credit are \nlikely to be drawn upon.\nAs at December 31, 2022, Crombie had signed construction contracts \ntotalling $187,111, of which $159,830 has been paid.

      "text": "RISK MANAGEMENT\nRISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK\nManagement of the REIT is vested in the Board of Trustees, subject \nto the provisions of applicable statutes and the Declaration of Trust. \nThe Board of Trustees of the REIT shall have explicit responsibility for \nthe stewardship of the REIT including the strategic planning process, \napproval of the strategic plan, the identification of principal risks and \nimplementation of systems to manage these risks, succession planning, \noperations, communications and reporting, and the integrity of the \nREIT’s internal control and management information systems. The \nBoard discharges certain of its responsibilities through delegation to \nits committees as more particularly set out in the committee mandates.\nRISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE BUSINESS \nOF CROMBIE\nIn the normal course of business, Crombie is exposed to a number \nof financial risks that can affect its operating performance. The more \nsignificant risks, and the action taken to manage them, are as follows \n(please see the “Risks” section of Crombie’s 2021 Annual Information \nForm available at www.sedar.com for additional information on risks \nrelated to Crombie):\nEnterprise Risk Management\nThe impact on markets of the global pandemic, recent inflation, \nand rising interest rates, and the resulting effect on the available \nincome of retail customers, may adversely impact our operations and \ndevelopment activities. Risks include, but are not limited to, increasing \nthe credit risk associated with our receivables, limiting our ability to \nquickly respond to changes in credit risk, and extending the time to \ncompletion and occupancy of our major developments. There is also \nincreased risk as to the extent of the impact of a possible economic \nrecession on leasing, occupancy, tenant inducements, land use \nintensification, market rents, and capital expenditures. The potential \nimpact of this moderate economic uncertainty on Crombie’s future \nfinancial results and valuation of assets is difficult to reliably measure.\nReal Property Ownership and Tenant Risks\nAll real property investments are subject to elements of risk. The value \nof real property and any improvements thereto depend on the credit \nand financial stability of tenants and upon the vacancy rates of the \nproperties. In addition, certain significant expenditures, including \nproperty taxes, ground rent, mortgage payments, insurance costs, and \nrelated charges must be made throughout the period of ownership of \nreal property regardless of whether a property is producing any income. \nCash available for distribution will be adversely affected if a significant \nnumber of tenants are unable to meet their obligations under their lease \nor if a significant amount of available space in the properties becomes \nvacant and cannot be leased on economically favourable lease terms.\nUpon the expiry of any lease, there can be no assurance that the lease \nwill be renewed, or the tenant replaced. The terms of any subsequent \nlease may be less favourable to Crombie than those of an existing lease. \nThe ability to rent unleased space in the properties in which Crombie \nhas an interest will be affected by many factors, including general \neconomic conditions, local real estate markets, changing demographics, \nsupply and demand for leased premises, competition from other \navailable premises, and various other factors. Management utilizes \nstaggered lease maturities so that Crombie is not required to lease \nunusually large amounts of space in any given year. In addition, the \ndiversification of our property portfolio by geographic location, tenant \nmix, and asset type also helps to mitigate this risk.\nAs technology and e-commerce continue to evolve and proliferate the \ndaily business activities of certain of our tenants and resulting shopping \noptions for their customers, tenants may need to alter the way they \ndo business to remain relevant and successful. This could include \nreducing store footprints, rationalizing the number of properties they \noperate from and/or investing in a larger e-commerce presence to \nremain competitive in light of continued technology and e-commerce \ninnovation. Any such changes could adversely affect tenant demand \nfor our properties.\nCompetition\nThe real estate business is competitive. Numerous other developers, \nmanagers, and owners of properties compete with Crombie in seeking \ntenants. Some of the properties located in the same markets as \nCrombie’s properties may be newer, better located, less levered, or \nhave stronger anchor tenants than Crombie’s properties. Some property \nowners with properties located in the same markets as Crombie’s \nproperties may be better capitalized and may be stronger financially \nand hence better able to withstand an economic downturn. Competitive \npressures in such markets could have a negative effect on Crombie’s \nability to lease space in its properties and on the rents charged or \nconcessions granted, which could have an adverse effect on Crombie’s \nfinancial condition and results of operation and decrease the amount \nof cash available for distribution. Competition for acquisitions of real \nproperties can be intense and some competitors may have the ability \nor inclination to acquire properties at a higher price or on terms less \nfavourable than those that Crombie may be prepared to accept. An \nincrease in the availability of investment funds, an increase in interest \nin real property investments or a decrease in interest rates may tend to \nincrease competition for real property investments thereby increasing \npurchase prices and reducing the yield on them. \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n66\nCROMBIE REIT Annual Report 2022"

      "text": "Development Risk\nCrombie owns a number of investment properties at varying stages \nof development as well as a significant pipeline of potential future \ndevelopment properties.\nDevelopment risk associated with development projects underway \ninclude construction delays and their impact on financing and related \ncosts as well as commitments from tenants for occupancy; cost overruns \nthat could impact the profitability and/or financial viability of a project; \nand the inability to meet revenue projections upon completion, which \ncould be impacted by unmet leasing assumptions on timing of tenant \noccupancy or rent per square foot. Management strives to mitigate \nthese risks by undertaking certain projects with partners (see “Joint \nArrangement Risk”); entering into fixed cost construction contracts with \nreputable contractors; entering into long-term financing at the most \nappropriate stage possible; and entering into long-term leases with \nreputable commercial tenants prior to construction wherever possible.\nDevelopment risks associated with potential future development \nproperties include all of the above as well as the risks associated \nwith the ability to develop the property at all. This may include waiting \nfor all current leases to expire or negotiating favourable terms with \ncurrent tenants which could include costs associated with lease \ninterruptions to permit development, and inability to receive various \nrequired municipal/provincial approvals for site plan, development, \nzoning, construction, etc.\nJoint Arrangement Risk\nCrombie has entered into joint arrangements or partnerships with \nother third party entities, including our mixed-use developments at \nDavie Street, Le Duke, Bronte Village, Opal Ridge, and Broadway \nand Commercial, where Crombie holds a 50% ownership. For more \ninformation on these developments, please see the “Development” \nsection of this MD&A. As a result of these joint arrangements, \nCrombie may not have the same level of control over the operation \nor development of such properties that it ordinarily has, which may \nimpact its ability to respond to conditions affecting such properties. \nRisks associated with these arrangements include risk of default by \na partner on financing obligations or non-performance of a partner’s \nobligations on a project, which may include development, construction, \nmanagement, or leasing. Crombie attempts to mitigate these risks by \nentering into arrangements with financially stable, reputable partners \nwith a proven track record and by negotiating contractual rights in the \nevent of a default.\nCapitalization Rate Risk\nCrombie values its investment properties using the capitalized net \noperating income method. Under this method, capitalization rates are \napplied to trailing stabilized net operating income (property revenue \nless property operating expenses). The key assumptions are the \ncapitalization rates for each specific property and stabilized net income. \nCrombie is responsible for the reasonableness of the assumptions and \nfor the accuracy of inputs that are used to determine our valuation \ndisclosures. Crombie receives biannual capitalization rate reports \n(June and December) from external knowledgeable property valuators. \nThe capitalization rate reports provide a range of rates for various \ngeographic regions and for various types and qualities of properties \nwithin each region. Management selects the rate for each property from \nthe range provided that management believes is most appropriate in \nits judgment. In addition to this, Crombie uses the market information \nobtained in external appraisals each quarter and makes relevant \nadjustments to our input assumptions. If these input assumptions are not \ncorrect, our valuation disclosures may not accurately describe the fair \nvalue of our properties.\nThere has been upward pressure on capitalization rates since the \nbeginning of the year, largely in response to the dramatic increase in \ninterest rates and bond yields, and the weakening Canadian economy. \nThis, along with the lower level of comparable transactions in the \nmarket, has resulted in less reliable data for valuators, which may result \nin increased subjectivity in their capitalization rates provided to Crombie.\nSignificant Relationship\nAs at December 31, 2022, Empire, through its wholly owned subsidiary \nECLD, holds a 41.5% indirect interest in Crombie. Crombie’s anchor \ntenants are concentrated in a relatively small number of retail operators. \nSpecifically, for the year ended December 31, 2022, 58.0% of the \nAMR and 53.0% of total property revenue generated from Crombie’s \nproperties is derived from anchor tenants that are owned and/or\noperated by Empire (including Sobeys and all other subsidiaries \nof Empire). Therefore, Crombie is reliant on the sustainable operation \nby Empire in these locations.\nPotential Conflicts of Interest\nThe trustees will, from time to time, in their individual capacities, deal \nwith parties with whom Crombie may be dealing, or may be seeking \ninvestments similar to those desired by Crombie. The interests of these \npersons could conflict with those of Crombie. The Declaration of Trust \nand Code of Conduct contain conflict of interest provisions requiring the \ntrustees to disclose their interests in certain contracts and transactions \nand to refrain from voting on those matters. In addition, certain \ndecisions regarding matters that may give rise to a conflict of interest \nmust be made by a majority of independent elected trustees only.\nConflicts may exist due to the fact that certain trustees, senior officers, \nand employees of Crombie are directors and/or senior officers of \nEmpire and/or its affiliates or will provide management or other services \nto Empire and its affiliates. Empire and its affiliates are engaged in a \nwide variety of real estate and other business activities. Crombie may \nbecome involved in transactions that conflict with the interests of the \nforegoing. The interests of these persons could conflict with those of \nCrombie. To mitigate these potential conflicts, Crombie and Empire have \nentered into a number of agreements to outline how potential conflicts \nof interest will be dealt with, including a Non-Competition Agreement, \nManagement Agreement, and Development Agreement. As well, \nthe Declaration of Trust contains a number of provisions to manage \npotential conflicts of interest including setting limits to the number of \nEmpire appointees to the Board, “conflict of interest” guidelines, as \nwell as outlining which matters require the approval of a majority of \nthe independent elected trustees, such as any property acquisitions or \ndispositions between Crombie and Empire or another related party.\nReliance on Key Personnel\nThe management of Crombie depends on the services of certain key \npersonnel. The loss of the services of any key personnel could have an \nadverse effect on Crombie and adversely impact Crombie’s financial \ncondition. Crombie does not have key person insurance on any of its \nkey employees.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n67"

      "text": "Retail and Geographic Concentration\nCrombie’s portfolio of properties is heavily weighted in retail properties. \nConsequently, changes in the retail environment and general consumer \nspending, including the growing trend in e-commerce, could adversely \nimpact Crombie’s financial condition.

The organizational impact could include \nreputational damage with tenants and suppliers, financial costs, or \na disruption to Crombie’s business. Cyber incidents are becoming \nmore frequent and more sophisticated. Crombie has implemented \nprocesses, technologies, procedures, and controls to help mitigate \nthese risks, and has made it a priority to better educate and train all \nCrombie team members on cyber security awareness. These measures, \nhowever, as well as Crombie’s enhanced awareness of risk of a cyber \nincident, do not guarantee that its financial results will not be negatively \nimpacted by the occurrence of any such event.\nEnvironmental Matters\nEnvironmental issues can cover a broad range of topics, including \nenergy usage, water conservation, pollution, waste management, or \nclimate change, among many others. Each of these topics comes with \ntheir own specific risks including increased energy costs, the price of \ncarbon, and pollution liability. To effectively manage environmental \nrisk, it is critical to operate the business in a sustainable manner. This \nincludes measuring, managing, and reporting on our sustainability \nperformance through the lens of ESG deliverables. In 2022, Crombie \ncompleted updates to its Sustainable Development Policy, including \na community engagement program that includes ESG specific issues, \nintroduced portfolio-wide ESG risk assessments, and finalized ESG \nspecific language in standard lease contracts. Crombie continues to \nimprove its energy, water, and waste data coverage, having set internal \ntargets in 2022, and is in the process of finalizing an inventory of its GHG \nemissions. In the second quarter of 2022, Crombie published its second \nannual Sustainability Report.\nCrombie is not aware of any material non-compliance with \nenvironmental laws at any of its properties and is not aware of \nany material pending or threatened investigations or actions by \nenvironmental regulatory authorities in connection with any of \nits properties. Crombie has implemented policies and procedures \nto assess, manage, and monitor environmental conditions at its \nproperties and developments to manage exposure to liability.\nClimate Change Risk\nCrombie has properties located in areas that are subject to natural \ndisasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, ice storms, \nfloods, earthquakes, and fires, and the frequency of these natural \ndisasters and severe weather conditions may increase due to climate \nchange. The occurrence of natural disasters, severe weather conditions, \nand the effects of climate change can delay new development or \nredevelopment projects, increase investment costs to repair or replace \ndamaged properties, increase operation costs, including the cost of \nenergy at our properties, increase costs for future property insurance, \nimpact the tenant demand for space, and cause substantial damages \nor losses to our properties which could exceed any applicable insurance \ncoverage. The incurrence of any of these losses, costs, or business \ninterruptions may adversely affect our financial condition, results \nof operations, and cash flows. In addition, changes in government \nlegislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased \ncapital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing \nproperties and could also require us to spend more on our development \nor redevelopment projects without a corresponding increase in \nrevenues, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results \nof operations, and cash flows. Crombie is currently evaluating the Task \nForce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures recommendations to \nhelp us identify, manage, and report on these risks and opportunities in \nalignment with industry best practices.\nReliance on Empire, Sobeys, and Other \nEmpire Affiliates\nCrombie’s ability to acquire new properties is dependent in part upon \nEmpire and Sobeys Developments Limited Partnership (“SDLP”) and the \nsuccessful operation of the right of first offer agreement as described in \nthe “Material Contracts” section of Crombie’s 2021 Annual Information \nForm. Also, a significant portion of Crombie’s rental income is received \nfrom tenants that are affiliates of Empire. In addition, Empire has \nobligations to indemnify Crombie in respect to the cost of environmental \nremediation of certain properties acquired by Crombie from Empire \nto a maximum permitted amount in relation to some properties and \nunlimited in relation to other properties. There is no certainty that \nEmpire and SDLP will be able to perform its obligations to Crombie in \nconnection with these agreements. Empire and specific subsidiaries \nhave not provided any security to guarantee these obligations. If Empire, \nSobeys, or such affiliates are unable or otherwise fail to fulfill their \nobligations to Crombie, such failure could adversely impact Crombie’s \nfinancial condition.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n68\nCROMBIE REIT Annual Report 2022"

      "text": "FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe following table outlines our financial risks, how we manage these risks, and whether there was a change in risk exposure compared to the prior year. \nCredit Risk\nRisk Description\nCredit risk arises from the possibility that tenants may experience financial difficulty and be unable to fulfill their lease \ncommitments. A provision for doubtful accounts and other adjustments to net property income are taken for all anticipated \ncollectability risks.\nRisk Management\nCrombie mitigates credit risk by geographical diversification, diversifying both its tenant mix and asset mix, and conducting \ncredit assessments for new and renewing tenants. The residential component of Crombie’s investment in joint ventures further \ndiversifies our portfolio.\nIn measuring tenant concentration, Crombie considers both the AMR and total property revenue of major tenants.\n•\t Crombie’s largest tenant, Empire (including Sobeys and all other subsidiaries of Empire), represents 58.0% of AMR. No other \ntenant accounts for more than 2.5% of Crombie’s AMR;\n•\t total property revenue includes base rent as well as operating and realty tax cost recovery income, and percentage \nrent. These amounts can vary by property type, specific tenant leases, and where tenants may directly incur and pay \noperating and realty tax costs. Crombie earned total property revenue of $222,264 for the year ended December 31, 2022 \n(December 31, 2021 – $209,684) from Sobeys and other subsidiaries of Empire; and\n•\t over the next five years, leases on no more than 6.3% of the gross leasable area of Crombie will expire in any one year.\nReceivables are substantially comprised of current balances due from tenants and past due receivables. The balance of \naccounts receivable past due is usually not significant. Historically low receivable balances increased significantly over the past \nfew years as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, but have since returned to their pre-pandemic collection rates. \nGenerally, rents are due the first of each month and other tenant billings are due 30 days after invoicing, and balances over \n30 days are considered past due.\nCrombie determines the expected credit loss in accordance with IFRS 9’s simplified approach for amounts receivable where \nits loss allowance is measured at initial recognition and throughout the life of the receivable. Trade receivables are written off \nwhen there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Crombie assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses \nassociated with its rent receivables. In determining the expected credit losses, Crombie takes into account, on a tenant-by-\ntenant basis, the payment history, future expectations, and knowledge gathered through discussions for rental concessions \nand ongoing discussions with tenants.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, Crombie recorded bad debt recovery of $(136) (December 31, 2021 – expense of $811).\nOur trade receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts balances at December 31, 2022 were $21,645 and $(2,328), \nrespectively (December 31, 2021 – $27,472 and $(3,031), respectively).\nCrombie manages its residual risk in its investment properties through an active capital expenditure program and actively \nleasing any vacant spaces. The residual risk throughout Crombie’s portfolio is not considered significant, although a prolonged \nstate of economic shutdown can impact Crombie’s ability to execute on its capital expenditure program and leasing activity.\nLiquidity Risk\nRisk Description\nLiquidity risk is the risk that Crombie may not have access to sufficient debt and equity capital to fund its growth program, \nrefinance debt obligations as they mature, or meet its ongoing obligations as they arise.\nRisk Management\nCash flow generated from operating the property portfolio represents the primary source of liquidity used to service the \ninterest on debt, fund general and administrative expenses, reinvest in the portfolio through capital expenditures, as well \nas fund tenant incentive costs and make distributions to Unitholders. Debt repayment requirements are primarily funded \nfrom refinancing Crombie’s maturing debt obligations. Property acquisition funding requirements are funded through a \ncombination of accessing the debt and equity capital markets and recycling capital from property dispositions.\nThere is a risk that the debt capital markets may not refinance maturing fixed rate and floating rate debt on terms and \nconditions acceptable to Crombie, or at any terms at all. Crombie seeks to mitigate this risk by staggering its debt maturity \ndates. There is also a risk that the equity capital markets may not be receptive to a REIT Unit offering issuance from Crombie \nwith financial terms acceptable to Crombie. Access to debt and equity capital markets may also be affected by national \nand international events, and economic conditions beyond Crombie’s control. Crombie mitigates its exposure to liquidity risk \nutilizing a disciplined approach to capital management.\nThere is a risk that credit ratings may change. No ratings agency has issued a credit rating with respect to the Units, and no \ncredit rating of the Units will be sought or obtained by Crombie. At December 31, 2022, Crombie has improved its credit rating \non outstanding senior unsecured notes to “BBB (low)” with a “Stable” trend from DBRS.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n69"

      "text": "Liquidity Risk\nRisk Management\n(continued)\nCredit ratings may not reflect all risks associated with an investment in Crombie’s securities. Any credit ratings applied to the notes \nare an assessment of Crombie’s ability to pay its obligations generally. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in the credit \nratings will generally affect the market value of the notes. The credit ratings, however, may not reflect the potential impact on the \nvalue of the notes of risks related to structure, market, or other factors discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in Crombie’s \n2021 Annual Information Form dated March 29, 2022. Crombie is under no obligation to maintain any specified level of credit \nrating with credit rating agencies, and there is no assurance that any credit rating assigned to the notes will remain in effect for \nany given period of time or that any rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the relevant rating agency. A lowering, \nwithdrawal, or failure to maintain any credit ratings applied to the notes may have an adverse effect on the market price or \nvalue and the liquidity of the notes. Credit ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell the notes or other securities \nof Crombie. Any future lowering of Crombie’s ratings is likely to make it more difficult or more expensive for Crombie to obtain \nadditional debt financing.\nAccess to the $400,000 revolving credit facility is limited by the amount utilized under the facility and the amount of any \noutstanding letters of credit, and it cannot exceed the borrowing base security provided by Crombie.\nRefer to the “Debt Maturities” section of this MD&A for a maturity analysis of our recognized financial liabilities and \npurchase obligations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nRisk Description\nInterest rate risk is the potential for financial loss arising from increases in interest rates.\nRisk Management\nCanadian prime interest rates have increased significantly from 2.45% at December 31, 2021 to 6.70% effective January 25, 2023. \nCrombie mitigates this risk of rising interest rates by utilizing staggered debt maturities and limiting the use of permanent \nfloating rate debt and, on occasion, utilizing interest rate swap agreements. The interest swap rates would be based on \nCanadian bond yields, plus a premium, called the swap spread, which reflects the risk of trading with a private counterparty \nas opposed to the Canadian government. Under interest rate swap arrangements, Crombie would agree to pay the \ncounterparty an amount if market interest rates decline, in return for the counterparty’s agreement to pay Crombie an amount \nif market interest rates increase. As a result, the combined effect of variable interest rates on certain debt arrangements \ncoupled with the payment obligations under interest rate swap agreements is to stabilize Crombie’s net interest expense, as \nincreased interest payments are partially offset by the right to receive payments under the interest rate swap agreements, \nwhile decreased interest payments are partially offset by the obligation to make payments under the interest rate swap \nagreements. In the event that interest rates change by more than was anticipated in the interest rate swap agreements, \npayment obligations under interest rate swap agreements could adversely impact Crombie’s financial condition and results \nof operations and decrease the amount of cash available for distribution. Crombie does not enter into these interest rate \nswaps on a speculative basis. Crombie is prohibited by its Declaration of Trust in purchasing, selling, or trading in interest rate \nfuture contracts other than for hedging purposes.\nAs at December 31, 2022:\n•\t Crombie’s weighted average term to maturity of its fixed rate mortgages is 4.6 years;\n•\t Crombie’s weighted average term to maturity of its unsecured notes is 5.1 years;\n•\t Crombie has a floating rate revolving credit facility available to a maximum of $400,000, subject to available borrowing \nbase, with no balance outstanding/drawn;\n•\t Crombie has an unsecured non-revolving credit facility available to a maximum of $200,000 with a balance of \n$150,000 outstanding;\n•\t Crombie has a floating rate bilateral credit facility available to a maximum of $130,000 with no balance outstanding;\n•\t Crombie has joint operation credit facilities available to a maximum of $10,687 at Crombie’s share with a balance of \n$10,264 outstanding;\n•\t Crombie has interest rate swap agreements in place on $106,435 of floating rate debt and an interest rate swap agreement \nin place held in equity-accounted investments on $52,000 of floating rate debt, at Crombie’s share; and\n•\t Crombie has floating rate credit facilities, included in debt held in equity-accounted investments, available to a maximum \nof $130,250 with a balance of $116,820 outstanding, at Crombie’s share.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n70\nCROMBIE REIT Annual Report 2022"

The ability of Crombie to make cash \ndistributions and the actual amount distributed are entirely dependent \non the operations and assets of Crombie and its subsidiaries, and are \nsubject to various factors including financial performance, obligations \nunder applicable credit facilities, the sustainability of income derived \nfrom anchor tenants, and capital expenditure requirements. Cash \navailable to Crombie to fund distributions may be limited from time to \ntime because of items such as principal repayments, tenant allowances, \nleasing commissions, capital expenditures, and redemptions of Units, \nif any. Crombie may be required to use part of its debt capacity or to \nreduce distributions in order to accommodate such items. The market \nvalue of the Units will deteriorate if Crombie is unable to maintain its \ndistribution in the future, and that deterioration may be significant. In \naddition, the composition of cash distributions for tax purposes may \nchange over time and may affect the after-tax return for investors.\nRESTRICTIONS ON REDEMPTIONS\nIt is anticipated that the redemption of Units will not be the primary \nmechanism for holders of Units to liquidate their investments. The \nentitlement of Unitholders to receive cash upon the redemption of their \nUnits is subject to the following limitations: (i) the total amount payable \nby Crombie in respect of such Units and all other Units tendered for \nredemption in the same calendar month must not exceed $50 (provided \nthat such limitation may be waived at the discretion of the trustees); \n(ii) at the time such Units are tendered for redemption, the outstanding \nUnits must be listed for trading on a stock exchange or traded or quoted \non another market which the trustees consider, in their sole discretion, \nprovides fair market value prices for the Units; and (iii) the trading of \nUnits is not suspended or halted on any stock exchange on which the \nUnits are listed (or, if not listed on a stock exchange, on any market on \nwhich the Units are quoted for trading) on the redemption date for more \nthan five trading days during the 10-day trading period commencing \nimmediately after the redemption date.\nPOTENTIAL VOLATILITY OF UNIT PRICES\nOne of the factors that may influence the market price of the Units is the \nannual yield on the Units. An increase in market interest rates may lead \npurchasers of Units to demand a higher annual yield, which accordingly \ncould adversely affect the market price of the Units. In addition, the \nmarket price of the Units may be affected by changes in general \nmarket conditions, fluctuations in the markets for equity securities, and \nnumerous other factors beyond the control of Crombie.\nTAX-RELATED RISK FACTORS\nCrombie intends to make distributions not less than the amount \nnecessary to eliminate Crombie’s liability for tax under Part I of the \nIncome Tax Act (Canada). Where the amount of net income and net \nrealized capital gains of Crombie in a taxation year exceeds the cash \ndistributions in the year, such excess net income and net realized capital \ngains will be distributed to Unitholders and such additional distributions \nmay be in the form of cash and/or additional Units. Unitholders will \ngenerally be required to include an amount equal to the fair market \nvalue of any additional Units in their taxable income, notwithstanding \nthat they do not directly receive a cash distribution.\nCertain properties have been acquired by Crombie on a tax deferred \nbasis, whereby the tax cost of these properties is less than their fair \nmarket value. Accordingly, if one or more of such properties is disposed \nof, the gain for tax purposes recognized by Crombie will be in excess of \nthat which it would have been if it had acquired the properties at a tax \ncost equal to their fair market values.\nPublicly traded income trusts, or specified investment flow-through \nentities (“SIFTs”), are subject to income taxation at corporate tax rates, \nsubject to an exemption for real estate investment trusts (“REITs”). The \nexemption for REITs was provided to “recognize the unique history \nand role of collective real estate investment vehicles,” which are well-\nestablished structures throughout the world. A trust that satisfies the \ncriteria of a REIT throughout its taxation year will not be subject to \nincome tax in respect of distributions to its Unitholders or be subject \nto the restrictions on its growth that would apply to SIFTs.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n71"

      "text": "While REITs were exempted from the SIFT taxation, a number of \ntechnical tests apply to determine which entities would qualify as a REIT. \nThese technical tests did not fully accommodate the business structures \nused by many Canadian REITs.\nCrombie and its advisors underwent an extensive review of Crombie’s \norganizational structure and operations to support Crombie’s assertion \nthat it meets the REIT technical tests contained in the Act through the \n2022 fiscal year. The relevant tests apply throughout the taxation year \nof Crombie and, as such, the actual status of Crombie for any particular \ntaxation year can only be ascertained at the end of the year.\nNotwithstanding that Crombie may meet the criteria for a REIT and thus \nbe exempt from the distribution tax, there can be no assurance that the \nDepartment of Finance (Canada) or other governmental authority will \nnot undertake initiatives which have an adverse impact on Crombie or \nits Unitholders.\nINDIRECT OWNERSHIP OF UNITS BY EMPIRE\nEmpire holds a 41.5% economic interest in Crombie through the \nownership of REIT and Class B LP Units. Pursuant to the Exchange \nAgreement, each Class B LP Unit will be exchangeable at the option \nof the holder for one Unit of Crombie and will be attached to a \nSpecial Voting Unit of Crombie, providing for voting rights in Crombie. \nFurthermore, pursuant to the Declaration of Trust, Empire is entitled to \nappoint a certain number of trustees based on the percentage of Units \nheld by it. Thus, Empire is in a position to exercise a certain influence \nwith respect to the affairs of Crombie. If Empire sells substantial amounts \nof its Class B LP Units or exchanges such Units for Units and sells these \nUnits in the public market, the market price of the Units could fall. The \nperception among the public that these sales will occur could also \nproduce such effect.\nOWNERSHIP OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES\nThere is no public market through which the notes may be sold. Crombie \ndoes not intend to list the notes on any securities exchange or include \nthe notes in any automated quotation system.\nTherefore, an active market for the notes may not develop or be \nmaintained, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity \nof the notes. In such case, the holders of the notes may not be able to \nsell their notes at a particular time or at a favourable price. If a public \ntrading market were to develop, future trading prices of the notes may \nbe volatile and will depend on many factors, including:\n•\t the number of holders of notes;\n•\t prevailing interest rates;\n•\t Crombie’s operating performance and financial condition;\n•\t Crombie’s credit rating;\n•\t the interest of securities dealers in making a market for them; and\n•\t the market for similar securities.\nEven if an active trading market for the notes does develop, there is no \nguarantee that it will continue. The notes may trade at a discount from \ntheir initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the \nmarket for similar notes, Crombie’s performance, and other factors.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n72\nCROMBIE REIT Annual Report 2022"

      "text": "USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS\nThe preparation of consolidated financial information requires \nmanagement to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that \naffect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets \nand liabilities, income, and expenses. Significant judgment, estimate, \nand assumption items include impairment, employee future benefits, \ninvestment properties, purchase price allocations, and fair value \nof financial instruments. These estimates are based on historical \nexperience and management’s best knowledge of current events and \nactions that Crombie may undertake in the future.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing \nbasis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in \nwhich the estimate is revised if the revisions affect only that period, or \nin the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both \ncurrent and future periods.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\nA number of assets and liabilities included in Crombie’s consolidated \nfinancial statements require measurement at, and/or disclosure of, fair \nvalue. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, Crombie uses \nmarket-observable data to the extent it is available. Where market-\nobservable data is not available, Crombie estimates the fair value \nbased on discounted future cash flows using discount rates that reflect \ncurrent market conditions for instruments with similar terms and risks. \nINVESTMENT PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS\nUpon acquisition, Crombie performs an assessment of the investment \nproperties being acquired to determine whether the acquisition is to \nbe accounted for as an asset acquisition or a business combination. A \ntransaction is considered to be a business combination if the acquired \nproperty meets the definition of a business under IFRS 3 – “Business \nCombinations”: being an integrated set of activities and assets that \nare capable of being managed for the purpose of providing a return \nto the Unitholders. Crombie performs an assessment of the fair value \nof the properties’ related tangible and intangible assets and liabilities \nand allocates the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities. \nCrombie assesses and considers fair value based on cash flow \nprojections that take into account relevant discount and capitalization \nrates and any other relevant sources of market information available. \nEstimates of future cash flow are based on factors that include historical \noperating results, if available, and anticipated trends, local markets and \nunderlying economic conditions.\nCrombie allocates the purchase price based on the following:\n•\t Land – The amount allocated to land is based on an appraisal \nestimate of its fair value.\n•\t Buildings – Buildings are recorded at the estimated fair value of the \nbuilding and its components and significant parts.\n•\t Intangible Assets – Intangible assets are recorded for tenant \nrelationships, based on estimated costs avoided should the respective \ntenants renew their leases at the end of the initial lease term, \nadjusted for the estimated probability of renewal.\n•\t Fair value of debt – Values ascribed to fair value of debt are \ndetermined based on the differential between contractual and \nmarket interest rates on long-term liabilities assumed at acquisition.\nINVESTMENT PROPERTIES\nInvestment properties are properties which are held to earn rental \nincome. Investment properties include land, buildings and intangible \nassets. Investment properties are carried at cost less accumulated \ndepreciation and are reviewed periodically for impairment.\nDepreciation of buildings is calculated using the straight-line method \nwith reference to each property’s cost, the estimated useful life of the \nbuilding (not exceeding 40 years) and its components, significant parts \nand residual value.\nRepairs and maintenance improvements are expensed as incurred or, \nin the case of major items that constitute a capital asset, are capitalized \nto the building and amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected \nuseful life of the improvement.\nINVESTMENT PROPERTY VALUATION\nExternal, independent valuation companies, having appropriate, \nrecognized professional qualifications and recent experience in the \nlocation and category of properties being valued, value substantially \nall of Crombie’s investment property portfolio on a rotating basis over \na maximum period of four years. On a periodic basis, Crombie obtains \nindependent appraisals such that approximately 85% of our properties, \nby value, will be externally appraised over a four-year period. The fair \nvalues, based on the measurement date, represent the price that would \nbe received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly \ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. \nInternal quarterly valuations are performed using internally generated \nvaluation models prepared by considering the aggregate trailing \nannual net property income recognized from leasing the property, that \nis stabilized for any major tenant movement. Biannual capitalization \nrates are obtained from an independent valuation company, which \nreflect the specific risks inherent in the net property income, to arrive \nat property valuations. (For further explanation of the determination of \ncapitalization rates, see the “Risk Management” section of this MD&A, \nunder “Capitalization Rate Risk” in the “Risk Factors Related to the \nBusiness of Crombie” section.) As at December 31, 2022, management’s \ndetermination of fair value was updated for current market assumptions, \nincluding net property income, market capitalization rates, and recent \nappraisals provided by independent appraisal professionals.\nCHANGE IN USEFUL LIFE OF INVESTMENT PROPERTIES\nThe estimated useful lives of significant investment properties are \nreviewed whenever events or circumstances indicate a change in useful \nlife. Estimated useful lives of significant investment properties are based \non management’s best estimate and the actual useful lives may be \ndifferent. Revisions to the estimated useful lives of investment properties \nconstitute a change in accounting estimate and are accounted for \nprospectively by amortizing the cumulative changes over the remaining \nestimated useful life of the related assets.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n78\nCROMBIE REIT Annual Report 2022"

      "text": "REVENUE RECOGNITION\nProperty revenue includes rents earned from tenants under lease \nagreements, percentage rent, realty tax and operating cost recoveries, \nand other incidental income. Certain leases have rental payments that \nchange over their term due to changes in rates. Crombie records the \nrental revenue from leases on a straight-line basis over the term of \nthe lease. Accordingly, an accrued rent receivable is recorded for the \ndifference between the straight-line rent recorded as property revenue \nand the rent that is contractually due from the tenants. In addition, \ntenant incentives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of \nexisting leases or the useful lives of the projects, as applicable, and the \namortization is shown as a reduction in property revenue. Percentage \nrents are recognized when tenants are obligated to pay such rent under \nthe terms of the related lease agreements. Realty tax and operating \ncost recoveries, and other incidental income, are recognized on an \naccrual basis.\nEXPECTED CREDIT LOSS\nCrombie assesses, on a tenant-by-tenant basis, losses expected with \nits rent receivables. In determining the provision for doubtful accounts, \nCrombie takes into account the payment history and future expectations \nof likely default events (tenants asking for rental concessions/abatements \nor stating they will not be making rental payments on the due date), \nbased on actual or expected insolvency filings or company voluntary \narrangements and likely deferrals of payments due, and potential \nabatements to be granted by the landlord through tenant negotiations.\nCritical Judgments\nJudgments made by management in the preparation of the \nconsolidated financial statements that have significant effect and \nestimates with a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying \namount of assets and liabilities are as follows:\nIMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED TANGIBLE AND DEFINITE \nLIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nLong-lived tangible and definite life intangible assets are reviewed \nfor impairment at each reporting period for events or changes in \ncircumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may \nnot be recoverable. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount \nof the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment \nloss (if any). The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less \ncosts to sell and value in use. Where the asset does not generate cash \nflows that are independent from other assets, Crombie estimates \nthe recoverable amount of the cash generating unit(s) to which the \nasset belongs. When the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash \ngenerating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the \ncarrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to the \nrecoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized as an expense \nimmediately in operating income.\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount \nof the asset (or cash generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate, \nbut is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined \nif no impairment loss had been recognized in prior periods. A reversal of \nimpairment loss is recognized immediately in operating income.\nDEFINED BENEFIT LIABILITY\nManagement estimates the defined benefit liability annually with the \nassistance of independent actuaries; however, the actual outcome \nmay vary due to estimation uncertainties. The estimate of Crombie’s \ndefined benefit liability is based on standard rates of inflation, medical \ncost trends, and mortality assumptions. It also takes into account \nCrombie’s specific anticipation of future salary increases. Discount \nfactors are determined each reporting period by reference to high \nquality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which \nthe benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating \nthe terms of the related pension liability. Estimation uncertainties \nexist particularly with regard to medical cost trends, which may vary \nsignificantly in future appraisals of Crombie’s defined benefit obligations.\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe fair value of marketable financial instruments is the estimated \namount for which an instrument could be exchanged, or a liability \nsettled, by Crombie and a knowledgeable, willing party in an arm’s \nlength transaction.\nThe fair value of other financial instruments is based upon discounted \nfuture cash flows using discount rates that reflect current market \nconditions for instruments with similar terms and risks.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nCrombie maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed \nto ensure that information required to be disclosed by Crombie in its \nannual filings, interim filings, or other reports filed or submitted by it \nunder securities legislation is recorded, processed, summarized, and \nreported within the time periods specified in the securities legislation. \nControls and procedures are designed to ensure that information \nrequired to be disclosed by Crombie is accumulated and communicated \nto Crombie’s management, including its President and Chief Executive \nOfficer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer and Secretary (“CFO”), as \nappropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. Our CEO \nand CFO have evaluated the design and effectiveness of our disclosure \ncontrols and procedures as at December 31, 2022. They have concluded \nthat our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nIn addition, our CEO and CFO have designed, or caused to be designed \nunder their supervision, internal controls over financial reporting \n(“ICFR”) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability \nof financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for \nexternal purposes as defined in National Instrument 52-109. The control \nframework management used to design and assess the effectiveness \nof ICFR is Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by The \nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission \n(“COSO”). Further, our CEO and CFO have evaluated, or caused to be \nevaluated under their supervision, the effectiveness of the design and \noperation of ICFR as at December 31, 2022, and have concluded that \nour current ICFR are effective based on that evaluation. There have \nbeen no material changes to Crombie’s internal controls during the year.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n79"

      "text": "Maintenance Capital Expenditures, Maintenance Tenant Incentives and Leasing Costs \n(“Maintenance Expenditures”)\nMaintenance expenditures represent costs incurred in sustaining and \nmaintaining existing space and exclude expenditures that are revenue-\nenhancing. Crombie considers revenue-enhancing expenditures to \nbe costs that expand the GLA of a property, increase the net property \nincome by a minimum threshold, or otherwise enhance the property’s \noverall value.\nCrombie’s policy is to charge AFFO* with a reserve amount for \nmaintenance expenditures based on a normalized rate per square \nfoot applied to the weighted average GLA, as these expenditures are \nnot generally incurred on a consistent basis during the year, or from \nyear to year. Crombie excludes newly constructed and developed \nproperties from its maintenance charge for the first year until a baseline \nof actual expenditures is obtained as little to no maintenance expense \nis incurred in the first year of operation. Crombie also discloses actual \nmaintenance expenditures for comparative purposes. The rate per \nsquare foot is a proxy for actual historical costs, anticipated future \ncosts, and any significant changes in the nature and age of the \nproperties in the portfolio as it evolves over time. For 2022, Crombie \nhas increased the normalized rate from $0.90 to $1.00 per square \nfoot of weighted average GLA, based on the actual spend for the \nprevious three years and for 2022. Additionally, Crombie combines \nmaintenance capital expenditures with maintenance tenant incentive \n(“TI”) and deferred leasing costs in arriving at the normalized per square \nfoot charge to AFFO*, based on the fact that in years where TI and \nleasing expenditures are reduced, spending on maintenance capital \nexpenditures may be accelerated and vice versa.\nMaintenance Expenditures – Actual\nYear ended\nThree months ended\nYear ended\nThree months ended\nDec. 31, \n2022\nDec. 31, \n2022\nSep. 30, \n2022\nJun. 30, \n2022\nMar. 31, \n2022\nDec. 31, \n2021\nDec. 31, \n2021\nSep. 30, \n2021\nJun. 30, \n2021\nMar. 31, \n2021\nTotal additions to investment \nproperties\n$  104,379 \n$\n 29,182 \n$\n 21,129 \n$\n 18,435 \n$\n 35,633 \n$\n 76,771 \n$\n 31,735 \n$\n 29,919 \n$\n 6,736 \n$\n 8,381 \nLess: revenue-enhancing \nexpenditures\n (95,032)\n (25,543)\n (19,726)\n (17,086)\n (32,677)\n (69,051)\n (29,005)\n (26,173)\n (6,641)\n (7,232)\nMaintenance capital \nexpenditures\n 9,347 \n 3,639 \n 1,403 \n 1,349 \n 2,956 \n 7,720 \n 2,730 \n 3,746 \n 95 \n 1,149 \nTotal additions to TI and \ndeferred leasing costs\n 43,408 \n 7,561 \n 6,521 \n 11,064 \n 18,262 \n 73,514 \n 10,058 \n 7,283 \n 26,122 \n 30,051 \nLess: revenue-enhancing \nexpenditures\n (32,721)\n (6,738)\n (3,634)\n (8,018)\n (14,331)\n (65,086)\n (6,778)\n (7,168)\n (23,875)\n (27,265)\nMaintenance TI and\ndeferred leasing costs\n 10,687 \n 823 \n 2,887 \n 3,046 \n 3,931 \n 8,428 \n 3,280 \n 115 \n 2,247 \n 2,786 \nTotal maintenance \nexpenditures – actual\n$\n 20,034 \n$\n 4,462 \n$\n 4,290 \n$\n 4,395 \n$\n 6,887 \n$\n 16,148 \n$\n 6,010 \n$\n 3,861 \n$\n 2,342 \n$\n 3,935 \nReserve amount charged \nagainst AFFO*\n$\n 18,526 \n$\n 4,620 \n$\n 4,662 \n$\n 4,659 \n$\n 4,585 \n$\n 16,043 \n$\n 4,006 \n$\n 4,023 \n$\n 4,024 \n$\n 3,990 \nObligations for expenditures for TIs occur when renewing existing tenant \nleases or for new tenants occupying a space.

The annual consolidated financial statements have \nbeen prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”). The \nannual consolidated financial statements and information in the MD&A include amounts based on best estimates and judgments by management \nof the expected effects of current events and transactions. In preparing this financial information, we make determinations about the relevancy of \ninformation to be included, and estimates and assumptions that affect the reported information. The MD&A also includes information regarding the \nimpact of current transactions and events, sources of liquidity and capital resources, operating trends, risks and uncertainties. Actual results in the \nfuture may vary materially from our present assessment of this information as future events and circumstances may not occur as expected.\nIn meeting our responsibility for the fair presentation of the annual consolidated financial statements and MD&A and for the accounting systems \nfrom which they are derived, management has established internal controls designed to ensure that our financial records are reliable for preparing \nconsolidated financial statements and other financial information, transactions are properly authorized and recorded, and assets are safeguarded \nagainst unauthorized use or disposition.\nAs at December 31, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated, or caused an evaluation under their direct supervision, \nthe design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting and, based on that assessment, determined that our internal controls over \nfinancial reporting were appropriately designed and operating effectively.\nThe Board of Trustees oversees management’s responsibility for financial reporting through an Audit Committee. This committee reviews Crombie’s \nannual consolidated financial statements and MD&A with both management and the independent auditor before such statements are approved \nby the Board of Trustees. The Audit Committee also recommends the appointment of independent external auditors to the Unitholders. The Audit \nCommittee meets regularly with senior management and the independent auditor to discuss internal controls, audit activities and financial reporting \nresults. The independent auditor has full and free access to, and meets regularly with, the Audit Committee to discuss their audits and related matters.\nDONALD E.

      "text": "INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT\nKEY AUDIT MATTERS\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, \nwere of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial \nstatements for the year ended December 31, 2022. These matters were \naddressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial \nstatements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do \nnot provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nKey audit matter\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\nFair value of investment properties\nRefer to note 2 – Summary of significant accounting policies and note 3 – \nInvestment properties to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe REIT’s total investment properties as at December 31, 2022 were \n$3.936 billion. The investment properties are carried at cost less \naccumulated depreciation, with their fair value disclosed at each \nreporting period. The REIT disclosed a total fair value of $5.050 billion \non December 31, 2022.\nIn determining the fair value of investment properties to be disclosed, \nmanagement used an internally generated capitalized net operating \nincome method (the method) by applying capitalization rates to trailing \nstabilized net operating income (NOI) of each investment property. \nTo determine the capitalization rate, management receives bi-annual \ncapitalization rate reports from external, knowledgeable property \nvaluators that provide a range of rates for various geographic regions \nand for various types and qualities of properties within each region. \nManagement selected the appropriate capitalization rate for each \nproperty from the range provided.\nThe method requires certain key assumptions and estimates, which include \nthe capitalization rates for each specific property and stabilized NOI. \nSignificant judgments were made by management in respect of these \nkey assumptions and estimates.\nWe considered this a key audit matter due to the significant judgments \nmade by management when determining the fair values of the investment \nproperties for disclosure purposes and the high degree of complexity in \nassessing audit evidence related to the key assumptions and estimates \nmade by management. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of \nprofessionals with specialized skill and knowledge in the field of real \nestate valuations.\nOur approach to addressing the matter included the following \nprocedures, among others:\n•\t For a sample of investment properties, tested how management \ndetermined the fair value, which included the following:\n\t- Evaluated the appropriateness of the method.\n\t- Tested the underlying data used in the method.\n\t- Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge in the field of \nreal estate valuations assisted us in assessing the capitalization \nrates by (i) comparing them to externally available market data \nand (ii) evaluating whether the allocation of capitalization rates \nto investment properties is reasonable based on location, current \nleases in place and the type of investment property.\n\t- Agreed NOI used in the method to accounting records and \nevaluated as applicable whether stabilization is reasonable \nconsidering (i) the current and past leasing activity of the \ninvestment properties; (ii) the comparability with external market \nand industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were \naligned with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n89"

The other \ninformation comprises the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, \nwhich we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report and the \ninformation, other than the consolidated financial statements and our \nauditor’s report thereon, included in the annual report, which is expected \nto be made available to us after that date.\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the \nother information and we do not and will not express an opinion or any \nform of assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, \nour responsibility is to read the other information identified above \nand, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially \ninconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge \nobtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information \nthat we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude \nthat there is a material misstatement of this other information, we \nare required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this \nregard. When we read the information, other than the consolidated \nfinancial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, included in the \nannual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement \ntherein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged \nwith governance.\nRESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE \nCHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of \nthe consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and for \nsuch internal control as management determines is necessary to enable \nthe preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from \nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management \nis responsible for assessing the Trust’s ability to continue as a going \nconcern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and \nusing the going concern basis of accounting unless management either \nintends to liquidate the Trust or to cease operations, or has no realistic \nalternative but to do so.\nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the \nTrust’s financial reporting process.\nAUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE \nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the \nconsolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material \nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s \nreport that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high \nlevel of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in \naccordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards will \nalways detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can \narise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or \nin the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the \neconomic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated \nfinancial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted \nauditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain \nprofessional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n•\t Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the \nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, \ndesign and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, \nand obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to \nprovide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material \nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting \nfrom error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional \nomissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n•\t Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit \nin order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the \ncircumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on \nthe effectiveness of the Trust’s internal control.\n•\t Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the \nreasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures \nmade by management.\n•\t Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the \ngoing concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit \nevidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related \nto events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the \nTrust’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that \na material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in \nour auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated \nfinancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify \nour opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence \nobtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future \nevents or conditions may cause the Trust to cease to continue as a \ngoing concern.\n90\nCROMBIE REIT Annual Report 2022"

The principal business of Crombie is investing in income-producing retail, retail-related industrial, \nmixed-use, and office properties in Canada. Crombie is registered in Canada and the address of its registered office is 610 East River Road, Suite 200, \nNew Glasgow, Nova Scotia, Canada, B2H 3S2. The consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 \ninclude the accounts of Crombie and all of its subsidiary entities. The Units of Crombie are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the \nsymbol “CRR.UN”. \nThe consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Trustees on February 22, 2023.\n2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n(a) Statement of compliance\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards as issued by the International \nAccounting Standards Board (“IFRS”). \n(b) Basis of presentation\nThese consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars (“CAD”); Crombie’s functional and reporting currency, rounded to the \nnearest thousand. The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis except for any financial assets and liabilities classified \nas fair value, with changes in fair value either recognized as an increase (decrease) in net assets attributable to Unitholders (“FVTPL” classification) \nor fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI” classification).\n(c) Presentation of financial statements\nWhen Crombie: (i) applies an accounting policy retrospectively; (ii) makes a retrospective restatement of items in its financial statements; \nor (iii) reclassifies items on the consolidated balance sheets, it will present additional consolidated balance sheets as at the beginning of the \nearliest comparative period.\n(d) Basis of consolidation\n(i) Subsidiaries\nCrombie’s financial statements consolidate those of Crombie and all of its subsidiary entities at December 31, 2022. Subsidiaries are all entities over \nwhich Crombie has control. All subsidiaries have a reporting date of December 31, 2022. \nAll intercompany transactions, balances, income, and expenses are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Where unrealized \nlosses on intercompany asset sales are reversed on consolidation, the underlying asset is also tested for impairment from an entity perspective.\nOperating income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are recognized from the \neffective date of acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, as applicable.\n(ii) Joint arrangements\nJoint arrangements are business arrangements whereby two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is based on the contractual sharing \nof control over the decisions related to the relevant activities. Joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending \non the contractual arrangements related to the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement.\nJoint operations\nA joint operation is an arrangement wherein the parties to the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities related to the \narrangement. For joint operations, Crombie recognizes its share of the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of the joint operation in the relevant \ncategories of Crombie’s financial statements.\n96\nCROMBIE REIT Annual Report 2022"

      "text": "NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJoint ventures\nA joint venture is an entity over which Crombie shares joint control with other parties and where the joint venture parties have rights to the net assets \nof the joint venture. Joint control exists where there is a contractual agreement for shared control and wherein decisions about the significant relevant \nactivities of the arrangement require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\nInvestment in joint ventures is accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at cost with subsequent \nadjustments for Crombie’s share of the results of operations and any change in net assets. Crombie’s joint venture entities have the same reporting period \nas Crombie and adjustments, if any, are made to bring the accounting policies of joint venture entities in line with the policies of Crombie.\n(e) Investment properties\nInvestment properties are properties which are held to earn rental income. Investment properties include land, buildings, and intangible assets. \nInvestment properties are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and are reviewed for impairment as described in Note 2(u).\nDepreciation of buildings is calculated using the straight-line method with reference to each property’s cost, the estimated useful life of the building \n(not exceeding 40 years) and its components, significant parts, and residual value.\nAmortization of intangible assets is calculated using the straight-line method over the term of the tenant lease.\nRepairs and maintenance items are expensed as incurred or, in the case of major items that constitute a capital asset, are capitalized to the building \nand amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the improvement.\nUpon acquisition, Crombie performs an assessment of investment properties being acquired to determine whether the acquisition is to be accounted \nfor as an asset acquisition or a business combination. A transaction is considered to be a business combination if the acquired property meets the \ndefinition of a business under IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”: being an integrated set of activities and assets that are capable of being managed for \nthe purpose of providing a return to the Unitholders.\nFor asset acquisitions, the total cost is allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities on the basis of their relative fair values on the acquisition date. \nAsset acquisitions do not give rise to goodwill. Fair value of such assets and liabilities is determined based on the following:\nLand – the amount allocated to land is based on an appraisal estimate of its fair value.\nBuildings – are recorded at the estimated fair value of the building and its components and significant parts.\nIntangible assets – are recorded for tenant relationships, based on estimated costs avoided should the respective tenants renew their leases at the \nend of the initial lease term, adjusted for the estimated probability of renewal.\nFair value of debt – values ascribed are determined based on the differential between contractual and market interest rates on long-term liabilities \nassumed at acquisition.\nFor business combinations, the acquisition method is used wherein the components of the business combination (assets acquired, liabilities assumed, \nconsideration transferred and any goodwill or bargain purchase) are recognized and measured. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the \nacquiree are measured at their fair value on the acquisition date.\nChange in useful life of investment properties\nThe estimated useful lives of significant investment properties are reviewed whenever events or circumstances indicate a change in useful life.  \nEstimated useful lives of significant investment properties are based on management’s best estimate and the actual useful lives may be different. \nRevisions to the estimated useful lives of investment properties constitute a change in accounting estimate and are accounted for prospectively by \namortizing the cumulative changes over the remaining estimated useful life of the related assets.\n(f) Cash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are defined as cash on hand, restricted cash, and cash in bank.\n(g) Assets held for sale and discontinued operations\nA non-current asset is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing \nuse. A property is classified as held for sale at the point in time when it is available for immediate sale, management has committed to a plan to sell \nthe property and is actively locating a purchaser for the property at a sales price that is reasonable in relation to the current estimated fair value of \nthe property, and the sale is expected to be completed within a one year period. Properties held for sale are carried at the lower of their carrying \nvalues and estimated fair value less costs to sell. In addition, assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated and amortized. A property that is \nsubsequently reclassified as held and in use is measured at the lower of its carrying value amount before it was classified as held for sale, adjusted for \nany depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had it been continuously classified as held and in use, and its estimated \nfair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.\nAssets that are classified as held for sale and that constitute a component of Crombie are presented as discontinued operations and their operating \nresults are presented separately in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). A component of Crombie includes a property type \nor geographic area of operations.\n97"

The present value of the defined benefit obligation and current \nservice cost is determined by discounting the estimated benefits using the projected unit credit method to determine the fair value of the plan assets \nand total actuarial gains and losses and the proportion thereof which will be recognized. Other factors considered for other benefit plans include \nassumptions regarding salary escalation, retirement ages and expected growth rate of health care costs. The fair value of any plan assets is based \non current market values. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is based on the discount rate determined by reference to the yield \nof high quality corporate bonds of similar currency, having terms of maturity which align closely with the period of maturity of the obligation. The \ndefined benefit plan and post-employment benefit plan are unfunded.\nThe impact of changes in plan provisions will be recognized in benefit costs on a straight-line basis over a period not exceeding the average period \nuntil the benefit becomes vested. To the extent that the benefits are already vested the past service cost will be recognized immediately.\nIn measuring its defined benefit liability, Crombie recognizes actuarial gains and losses directly to other comprehensive income (loss).\n(i) Unit based compensation plans\n(i) Deferred Unit Plan (“DU Plan”) \nCrombie provides a voluntary DU Plan whereby eligible trustees, officers, and employees (the “Participants”) may elect to receive all or a portion \nof their eligible compensation in deferred units (“DUs”). The Board (or its designated Committee) may determine that special compensation will \nbe provided in the form of DUs. Unless otherwise determined by the Board (or its designated Committee), DUs are fully vested at the time they are \nallocated, with the value of the award recorded as a liability and expensed as general and administrative expenses. DUs are not Crombie REIT Units \nand do not entitle a Participant to any Unitholder rights, including voting rights, distribution entitlements (other than those noted below) or rights on \nliquidation. During the time that a Participant has outstanding DUs, whenever cash distributions are paid on REIT Units, additional DUs will be credited \nto the Participant’s DU account, determined by multiplying the number of DUs in the Participant’s DU account on the REIT distribution record date \nby the distribution paid per REIT Unit, and dividing the result by the market value of a Unit as determined in accordance with the DU Plan. Additional \nDUs issued as a result of distributions vest on the same basis as noted above and the value of the additional DUs credited is expensed to general and \nadministrative expenses on allocation. A redemption will occur as the result of specific events such as the retirement of a Participant. Upon redemption, \na Participant will receive the net value of the vested DUs being redeemed, with the net value determined by multiplying the number of DUs redeemed \nby the REIT Unit’s market price on redemption date, less applicable withholding taxes. The Participant may elect to receive this net amount as a \ncash payment or instead receive Crombie REIT Units for redeemed DU’s after deducting applicable withholding taxes. For fair value measurement \npurposes, each DU is measured based on the market value of a REIT Unit with changes in fair value reflected as a decrease (increase) in fair value \nof financial instruments. \n(ii) Restricted Unit Plan (“RU Plan”)\nCrombie has a RU Plan for certain eligible executives and employees (“RU Participants”), whereby the RU Participants will receive all or a portion of \ntheir annual long-term incentive plan awards in restricted units (“RUs”). The RUs are accounted for under IAS 19 “Employee benefits” and the liability \nand expense are recognized over the service period which ends on the vesting date. The RUs are subject to vesting conditions including being actively \nemployed. The number of RUs which fully vest is determined by: (a) the dollar amount of the award divided by the market value of a REIT Unit on the \naward grant date, plus (b) deemed distributions on RUs during the vesting period at a rate equivalent to the number of REIT Units that would have \nbeen issued had the vested RUs been treated as a REIT Unit. The value of these additional RUs from deemed distributions are expensed to general \nand administrative expenses at the time of allocation. On the vesting date, each participant shall be entitled to receive a cash amount (net of any \napplicable withholding taxes) equal to the number of vested RUs held by the RU Participant multiplied by the market value on the vesting date, as \ndetermined by the market value of a REIT Unit. Alternatively, a RU Participant who is an eligible employee on the vesting date may elect to convert \ntheir vested RUs to DUs under Crombie’s DU Plan. No REIT Units or other securities of Crombie will be issued from treasury as settlement of any \nobligation under the RU Plan.\n(iii) Performance Unit Plan (“PU Plan”)\nCrombie has a PU Plan for certain eligible executives and employees (“PU Participants”), whereby the PU Participants may elect each year to \nparticipate in the PU Plan and receive all or a portion of their eligible remuneration in the form of an allocation of performance units (“PUs”). The \nPUs are accounted for under IAS 19 “Employee benefits” and the liability and expense are recognized over the service period which ends on the \nvesting date. The PUs are subject to vesting conditions including being actively employed. The number of PUs which vest for each participant shall be \ndetermined by: (a) multiplying the number of PUs granted under the award by an adjustment factor applicable to the performance level achieved, \nand (b) adding the number of PUs or fractions thereof that would be credited to such participant upon the payment of distributions by Crombie on the \nREIT Units, based on the number of additional REIT Units a participant would have received had the vested PUs been treated as REIT Units under a \ndistribution reinvestment plan during the PU term. Alternatively, a PU Participant who is an eligible employee on the vesting date may elect to convert \ntheir vested PUs to DUs under Crombie’s DU Plan. A PU is not considered to be a REIT Unit or entitle any participant to exercise voting rights or any \nother rights or entitlements associated with a REIT Unit. No REIT Units or other securities of Crombie will be issued from treasury as settlement of any \nobligation under the PU Plan.\n98\nCROMBIE REIT Annual Report 2022"

      "text": "NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(j) Distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”)\nCrombie has a DRIP which is described in Note 16.\n(k) Revenue recognition\n(i) Lease revenue\nRevenue earned from tenants under lease agreements includes base rent, realty tax recoveries, percentage rent, and other incidental income. Certain \nleases have rental payments that change over their term due to changes in rates. Crombie records the rental revenue from leases on a straight-line \nbasis over the term of the lease. Accordingly, an accrued rent receivable is recorded for the difference between the straight-line rent recorded as \nproperty revenue and the rent that is contractually due from the tenants. In addition, tenant incentives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the \nterm of existing leases and the amortization is shown as a reduction in property revenue. Percentage rents are recognized when tenants are obligated \nto pay such rent under the terms of the related lease agreements. Realty tax recoveries, and other incidental income, are recognized on an accrual \nbasis as they become due.\n(ii) Revenue from contracts with customers\nCrombie recognizes revenue in accordance with IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. Crombie recognizes revenue from customers that \nreflects the consideration to which it expects to be exchanged for. This involves identifying the contract with its customers, identifying the performance \nobligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and \nrecognizing revenue when the entity satisfies its performance obligations.\nWhere a contract contains elements of variable consideration, Crombie estimates the amount of variable consideration to which it will be entitled \nunder the contract. Variable consideration can arise from discounts, refunds, credits, and price concessions. This consideration is allocated to all \nperformance obligations in a contract based on their relative standalone selling prices.\n(l) Leases \nCrombie as lessor \nLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. \nAll other leases are classified as operating leases. \nCrombie has determined that most of its leases with its tenants are operating leases of which revenue is recorded in accordance with Crombie’s \nrevenue recognition policy. In some instances Crombie may classify a lease as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards \nof the underlying asset. For these leases a finance lease receivable is established and interest income is recognized over the term of the lease. \nCrombie as lessee\nCrombie leases include land, office, equipment, and vehicles. Crombie assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at the inception of \nthe contract. \nLeases are recognized as a right of use asset with a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by Crombie, \nexcept for short-term leases of 12 months or less or low value leases which are expensed in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income \n(loss) on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using \nthe interest rate implicit in the lease; or if not determinable, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate, specific to the term of the lease. Lease payments \ncan include fixed payments; variable payments based on an index or a rate known at the commencement date; and extension option payments \nor purchase options, if Crombie is reasonably certain to exercise. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective \ninterest rate method and remeasured (with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset) when there is a change in future lease \npayments in case of renegotiation, changes of an index or rate or in case of reassessment of options. \nAt inception of the lease, the right of use asset is measured at cost, comprising initial lease liability, initial direct costs, and any future restoration \nor refurbishment costs, less any incentives granted by the lessors. The right of use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life \nand the lease term of the underlying asset on a straight-line basis. The right of use asset is subject to testing for impairment if there is an indicator \nfor impairment. \nRight of use assets are included in investment property and other assets and the lease liabilities are presented separately. \n(m) Finance costs – operations \nFinance costs – operations primarily comprise interest on Crombie’s borrowings. Finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition, redevelopment, \nconstruction, or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized as a component of the cost of the asset to which it is related. All other finance costs – \noperations are expensed in the period in which they are incurred using the effective interest rate method.\n99"

      "text": "NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(n) Finance costs – distributions to Unitholders\nThe determination to declare and make payable distributions from Crombie is at the discretion of the Board of Trustees and, until declared payable \nby the trustees, Crombie has no contractual obligation to pay cash distributions to Unitholders.\n(o) Income taxes\nCrombie is taxed as a “mutual fund trust” for income tax purposes. It is the intention of Crombie, subject to approval of the trustees, to make \ndistributions not less than the amount necessary to ensure that Crombie will not be liable to pay income tax, except for the amounts incurred \nin its incorporated subsidiaries.\n(p) Hedges\nCrombie may use cash flow hedges to manage exposures to increases in variable interest rates. Cash flow hedges are recognized on the consolidated \nbalance sheets at fair value with the effective portion of the hedging relationship recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). Any ineffective \nportion of the cash flow hedge is recognized in operating income. Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are \nreclassified to operating income in the same periods in which the hedged item is recognized in operating income. Fair value hedges and the related \nhedged items are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in operating income. To the \nextent the fair value hedge is effective, the changes in the fair value of the hedge and the hedged item will offset each other.\nCrombie assesses on an ongoing basis whether any existing derivative financial instrument continues to be effective in offsetting changes in interest \nrates on the hedged items. Crombie currently hedges six variable mortgages, both joint credit facilities, and a variable mortgage in a joint venture. \n(q) Comprehensive income (loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) is the change in net assets attributable to Unitholders during a period from transactions and other events and \ncircumstances from non-Unitholder sources. Crombie reports a consolidated statement of comprehensive income, comprising changes in net assets \nattributable to Unitholders and other comprehensive income (loss) for the year. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), has been included \nin the consolidated statements of changes in net assets attributable to Unitholders.\n(r) Provisions\nProvisions are recognized when: Crombie has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; it is probable that Crombie will \nbe required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, \ntaking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the \npresent obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows, where the time value of money is material. When some or all of the \neconomic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually \ncertain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. Provisions reflect Crombie’s best estimate \nat the reporting date.\nEnvironmental liabilities are recognized when Crombie has an obligation relating to site closure or rehabilitation. The extent of the work required \nand the associated costs are dependent on the requirements of the relevant authorities and Crombie’s environmental policies. Provisions for the cost \nof each closure and rehabilitation program are recognized at the time of occurrence and when Crombie has a reliable estimate of the obligation. \nChanges in the provision are recognized in the period of the change.\n(s) Financial instruments\nCrombie classifies financial assets and liabilities according to their characteristics and management’s choices and intentions related thereto for the \npurpose of ongoing measurement. Classification choices for financial assets include: a) Amortized cost – recorded at amortized cost with gains and \nlosses recognized in increase (decrease) in net assets attributable to Unitholders in the period that the asset is derecognized or impaired; b) Fair value, \nwith two options; (i) FVTOCI – measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) for the current period \nuntil realized through disposal or impairment; and (ii) FVTPL – measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in increase (decrease) \nin net assets attributable to Unitholders for the period. Classification choices for financial liabilities include: a) Amortized cost – recorded at amortized \ncost with gains and losses recognized in increase (decrease) in net assets attributable to Unitholders in the period that the asset is derecognized or \nimpaired; and b) FVTPL – measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in increase (decrease) in net assets attributable to Unitholders \nfor the period. Subsequent measurement for these assets and liabilities is based on either fair value or amortized cost using the effective interest \nmethod, depending upon their classification.\n100\nCROMBIE REIT Annual Report 2022"

Financing costs incurred to establish \nrevolving credit facilities are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the facilities. In the event any debt is extinguished, the \nassociated unamortized financing costs are expensed immediately.\nFinancial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights to benefits from the financial asset expires. The difference between the asset’s carrying \nvalue and the consideration received or receivable is recognized as a charge to the statement of comprehensive income. On a continual basis, \nCrombie assesses whether any of its financial assets that are measured at amortized costs are impaired under an expected credit loss model. For \ntrade and long-term receivables, Crombie utilizes a provision matrix that uses aging categories as well as tenant specific history, and the current \neconomic environment to determine expected credit losses. Crombie’s financial assets are reported net of any expected credit loss on the consolidated \nbalance sheets. \nCrombie determines the expected credit loss in accordance with IFRS 9’s simplified approach for amounts receivable where its loss allowance is \nmeasured at initial recognition and throughout the life of the receivable. Trade and lease receivables are written off when there is no reasonable \nexpectation of recovery. \n(t) Fair value measurement\nThe fair value of financial instruments is the estimated amount that Crombie would receive to sell a financial asset or pay to transfer a financial liability \nin an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the \ntransaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal \nmarket, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by Crombie.\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, \nassuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\nCrombie uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, \nmaximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value of any interest rate swap is estimated \nby discounting net cash flows of the swaps using forward interest rates for swaps of the same remaining maturities.\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset \nin its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\nWhen determining the highest and best use of non-financial assets Crombie takes into account the following:\n•\t use of the asset that is physically possible – Crombie assesses the physical characteristics of the asset that market participants would take into \naccount when pricing the asset;\n•\t use that is legally permissible – Crombie assesses any legal restrictions on the use of the asset that market participants would take into account \nwhen pricing the asset; and\n•\t use that is financially feasible – Crombie assesses whether a use of the asset that is physically possible and legally permissible generates adequate \nincome or cash flows to produce an investment return that market participants would require from an investment in that asset put to that use.\n101"

      "text": "NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(u) Impairment of long-lived tangible and definite life intangible assets\nLong-lived tangible and definite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying \nvalue of the assets may not be recoverable. When such an indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine \nthe extent of impairment loss (if any). The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Where the asset does not \ngenerate cash flows that are independent from other assets, Crombie estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit(s) to which \nthe asset belongs. When the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying \namount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized as an expense immediately in \noperating income.\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating units) is increased to the revised estimate, \nbut is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognized in prior periods. A reversal of \nimpairment loss is recognized immediately in operating income.\n(v) Net assets attributable to Unitholders\n(i) Balance sheet presentation\nIn accordance with International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, puttable instruments are generally classified \nas financial liabilities. Crombie’s REIT Units and Class B LP Units with attached Special Voting Units (“SVU”) are both puttable instruments, meeting \nthe definition of financial liabilities in IAS 32. There are exception tests within IAS 32 which could result in classification as equity; however, Crombie’s \nunits do not meet the exception requirements. Therefore, Crombie has no instrument qualifying for equity classification on the consolidated balance \nsheets pursuant to IFRS. The classification of all units as financial liabilities with presentation as net assets attributable to Unitholders does not alter \nthe underlying economic interest of the Unitholders in the net assets and net operating results attributable to Unitholders.\n(ii) Balance sheet measurement\nREIT Units and Class B LP Units with attached SVUs are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at net asset value. Although puttable instruments \nclassified as financial liabilities are generally required to be remeasured to fair value at each reporting period, the alternative presentation as net \nassets attributable to Unitholders reflects that, in total, the interests of the Unitholders is limited to the net assets of Crombie.\n(iii) Statement of comprehensive income presentation\nAs a result of the classification of all units as financial liabilities, the statement of comprehensive income recognizes distributions to Unitholders as a \nfinance cost. In addition, terminology such as net income has been replaced by Increase (decrease) in net assets attributable to Unitholders to reflect \nthe absence of an equity component on the consolidated balance sheets. \n(iv) Presentation of per unit measures\nAs a result of the classification of all units as financial liabilities, Crombie has no equity instrument; therefore, in accordance with IAS 33 “Earnings per \nShare”, there is no denominator for purposes of calculation of per unit measures.\n(v) Allocation of comprehensive income (loss)\nThe components of comprehensive income (loss) are allocated between REIT Units and Class B LP Units as follows:\n•\t Operating income – based on the weighted average number of units outstanding during the reporting period.\n•\t Distributions to Unitholders – based on the actual distributions paid to each separate unit class.\n•\t Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) – increases are allocated based on the weighted average number of units outstanding during the \nreporting period, decreases in previously accumulated amounts are drawn down based on the average accumulation allocation rate.\n(w) Critical judgments in applying accounting policies\nThe following are the critical judgments that have been made in applying Crombie’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect \non the consolidated financial statements:\n(i) Investment properties\nCrombie’s accounting policies relating to investment properties are described in Note 2(e). In applying these policies, judgment is applied in \ndetermining whether certain costs are additions to the carrying amount of an investment property and whether properties acquired are considered \nto be asset acquisitions or business combinations. Crombie has determined that all properties acquired to date are asset acquisitions.\n(ii) Investment in joint ventures\nCrombie makes judgments in determining the appropriate accounting for investments in other entities. Such judgments include: determining the \nsignificant relevant activities and assessing the level of influence Crombie has over such activities through agreements and contractual arrangements.\n(iii) Classifications of Units as liabilities\nCrombie’s accounting policies relating to the classification of Units as liabilities are described in Note 2(v). The critical judgments inherent in this policy \nrelate to applying the criteria set out in IAS 32, “Financial Instruments: Presentation”, relating to the puttable instrument exception.\n102\nCROMBIE REIT Annual Report 2022"

Such judgments include: determining the \nsignificant relevant activities and assessing the level of control or influence Crombie has over such activities through agreements and contractual \narrangements; and determining whether Crombie’s rights and obligations are directly related to the assets and liabilities of the arrangement or to \nthe net assets of the joint arrangement.\n(x) Critical accounting estimates and assumptions\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts \nof assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported \namounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates and assumptions that are critical to the determination of the amounts \nreported in the consolidated financial statements relate to the following:\n(i) Fair value measurement\nA number of assets and liabilities included in Crombie’s consolidated financial statements require measurement at, and/or disclosure of, fair value. \nIn estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, Crombie uses market-observable data to the extent it is available. Where market-observable data \nis not available, Crombie estimates the fair value based on discounted future cash flows using discount rates that reflect current market conditions for \ninstruments with similar terms and risks. \n(ii) Investment properties\nInvestment properties are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Crombie estimates the residual value and useful lives of investment \nproperties and the significant components thereof to calculate depreciation and amortization.\n(iii) Investment property valuation\nExternal, independent valuation companies, having appropriate recognized professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and \ncategory of properties being valued, value substantially all of Crombie’s investment property portfolio on a rotating basis over a maximum period of \nfour years. The fair values, based on the measurement date, represent the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in \nan orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Internal quarterly valuations are performed using internally generated \nvaluation models prepared by considering the aggregate trailing annual net property income recognized from leasing the property, that is stabilized \nfor any major tenant movement. Biannual capitalization rates/yields are obtained from an independent valuation company, which reflects the specific \nrisks inherent in the net property income, to arrive at property valuations. As at December 31, 2022, management’s determination of fair value was \nupdated for current market assumptions, informed by property income, market capitalization rates, and recent appraisals provided by independent \nappraisal professionals. \n(iv) Defined benefit liability \nManagement estimates the defined benefit liability annually with the assistance of independent actuaries; however, the actual outcome may vary due \nto estimation uncertainties. The estimate of Crombie’s defined benefit liability is based on standard rates of inflation, medical cost trends, and mortality \nassumptions. It also takes into account Crombie’s specific anticipation of future salary increases. Discount factors are determined each reporting \nperiod by reference to high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to \nmaturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. Estimation uncertainties exist particularly with regard to medical cost trends, which \nmay vary significantly in future appraisals of Crombie’s defined benefit obligations.\n(v) Purchase price allocation\nInvestment properties are properties which are held to earn rental income. Investment properties include land, buildings, and intangible assets. Upon \nacquisition, management allocates the purchase price of the acquisition as described in Note 2(e). This allocation contains a number of estimates \nand underlying assumptions including, but not limited to, highest and best use and fair value of the properties, estimated cash flows, discount rates, \nlease-up rates, inflation rates, renewal rates, tenant incentive allowances, cost recoveries, and leasing costs and termination costs.\n(y) Future changes in accounting standards \nThe International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) has issued a number of standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date \nof these consolidated financial statements. Set out below are only those standards that may have a material impact on the consolidated financial \nstatements in future periods. Management is currently evaluating the impact of these future policies on the consolidated financial statements. \n(i) IAS 1 – Presentation of financial statements\nThe IASB has issued amendments to IAS 1, “Presentation of Financial Statements” (“IAS 1”). The amendments clarify how to classify debt and other \nliabilities as current or non-current. The amendments to IAS 1 apply to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. \n(ii) IFRS 16 – Leases\nThe IASB has issued amendments to IFRS 16 “Leases” (“IFRS 16”). The amendments clarify how a seller-leasee subsequently measures sale and \nlease‑back transactions. The amendments to IFRS 16 apply to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. \n103"

The fair value represents the estimated price that would be received to sell \nan asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe fair value included in this summary reflects the fair value of the properties as at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, based on each \nproperty’s current use as a revenue generating investment property. \nThe fair value of properties under development is assumed to equal cost until the property is substantially completed, and at that point in time, the \nproperty is moved to income producing and valued according to Crombie’s policies described below.\nThe valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value of investment properties are set out below:\n(i)\t\nThe capitalized net operating income method – Under this method, capitalization rates are applied to trailing stabilized net operating income \n(property revenue less property operating expenses). The key assumption are the capitalization rates for each specific property and stabilized \nnet income. Crombie receives biannual capitalization rate reports from external, knowledgeable property valuators. The capitalization \nrate reports provide a range of rates for various geographic regions and for various types and qualities of properties within each region. \nManagement selects the appropriate rate for each property from the range provided. Crombie employs this method to determine fair value.\n(ii)\t\nThe discounted cash flow method – Under this method, discount rates are applied to the forecasted cash flows reflecting the initial terms of the \nlease or leases for that specific property and assumptions as to renewal and new leasing activity. The key assumptions are the discount rate \napplied over the initial term of the lease, as well as lease renewals and new leasing activity. Crombie employs this method when the capitalized \nnet operating income method indicates a risk of impairment or when a property is, or will be, undergoing redevelopment.\n(iii)\t\nExternal appraisals – Crombie has external, independent appraisals performed on all significant properties on a rotational basis over \na maximum period of four years.\nOn a periodic bases, Crombie obtains independent appraisals such that approximately 85% of its properties, by value, will be externally appraised \nover a four year period. \nCrombie has utilized the following weighted average capitalization rate on its income properties. Related to the growth in properties under \ndevelopment, Crombie reports the weighted average capitalization rate excluding the value of properties under development with comparative rates \nadjusted to reflect this change. \nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021\nWeighted average capitalization rate\n5.94%\n5.65%\nCapitalization rate sensitivity\nCrombie has determined that a change in this applied capitalization rate at December 31, 2022 would result in an (increase) decrease in the fair value \nof the investment properties as follows:\nCapitalization rate change\nIncrease in Rate\nDecrease in Rate\n0.25%\n$\n(203,000)\n$\n222,000\n0.50%\n$\n(389,000)\n$\n466,000\n0.75%\n$\n(560,000)\n$\n735,000\n106\nCROMBIE REIT Annual Report 2022"

      "text": "NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n9) EMPLOYEE FUTURE BENEFITS\nCrombie has a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans providing pension and other retirement benefits to most of its employees.\nDefined contribution pension plans\nThe contributions required by the employee and the employer are specified. The employee’s pension depends on what level of retirement income \n(for example, annuity purchase) can be achieved with the combined total of employee and employer contributions and investment returns over the \nperiod of plan membership, and the annuity purchase rates at the time of the employee’s retirement.\nDefined benefit plans\nThe Senior Management Pension Plan provides pension benefits to members designated in writing by the Board of Trustees based on a formula \nrecognizing length of service and final average earnings. The annual pension payable at age 65 is equal to 2% of the final average base earnings \nmultiplied by years of credited service (to a maximum of 30 years), offset by the deemed retirement income provided under the defined contribution \npension plan and deferred profit sharing plan. For the purpose of calculating the deemed retirement income provided under the defined contribution \npension plan and deferred profit sharing plan, the assumptions stipulated in the Supplementary Executive Retirement Plan text are used, including \nan assumed annuity conversion discount rate of 7.0%. The final average earnings are 12 times the average of the 60 highest months of eligible \nearnings. Employee contributions, if required, pay for part of the cost of the benefit, and the employer contributions fund the balance. The employer \ncontributions are not specified or defined within the plan text; they are based on the result of actuarial valuations which determine the level of funding \nrequired to meet the total obligation as estimated at the time of the valuation. Crombie’s defined benefit plans are unfunded.\nOnce participants attain age 55 and 5 years of continuous service, they can retire. The total pension payable is reduced by 5/12% for each month \nby which the early retirement precedes age 60 (62 for a member who was designated as a member on or after June 25, 2009). The normal form \nof pension payment is a 60% joint and survivor pension. \nThe post-employment benefits program offered to Crombie employees and retirees in Canada is an open plan that provides life and medical benefits \nfor grandfathered employees and employees retired prior to May 1, 2011 as well as critical illness coverage for other employees. Full-time employees \nmust be over age 55 to be eligible for the post-employment benefits program. \nThe total defined benefit cost related to pension plans and post-employment benefit plans for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $602 \n(year ended December 31, 2021 – $480).\nThe plan typically exposes Crombie to actuarial risks such as: interest rate risk, mortality risk, and salary risk.\n(i)\t\nInterest rate risk – The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated using discount rates that reflect the average yield, as at the \nmeasurement date, on high quality corporate bonds of similar duration to the plans’ liabilities. A decrease in the market yield on high quality \ncorporate bonds will increase Crombie’s defined benefit liability. \n(ii)\t\nMortality risk – The present value of the defined benefit plan is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants \nboth during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability. \n(iii)\t\nSalary risk – The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the anticipated future salary of the plan \nparticipants. As such, an increase in the salary of plan participants over that anticipated will increase the plan’s liability. \nMost recent valuation date\nNext required valuation date\nSenior Management Pension Plan\nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2023\nPost-Employment Benefit Plans\nJanuary 1, 2022\nJanuary 1, 2025\nThe significant actuarial assumptions adopted in measuring the Company’s accrued benefit obligations and pension costs are as follows: \nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021\nSenior Management \nPension Plan\nPost-Employment \nBenefit Plans\nSenior Management \nPension Plan\nPost-Employment \nBenefit Plans\nDiscount rate – accrued benefit obligation\n5.10%\n5.10%\n2.90%\n2.90%\nRate of compensation increase\n3.00%\nN/A\n3.00%\nN/A\nFor measurement purposes, a 4.50% (2021 – 4.50%) annual rate increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed. \nThese assumptions were developed by management with the assistance of independent actuaries. Discount factors are determined close to year end \nby reference to market yields of high quality corporate bonds that have a maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligation. Other \nassumptions are based on current actuarial benchmarks and management’s historical experience. \nThe projected Unit credit method is used to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related current service cost for all \nactive members. \nCrombie uses December 31 as a measurement date for accounting purposes for its defined benefit pension plans.\n114\nCROMBIE REIT Annual Report 2022"

      "text": "NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n19) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n(a) Fair value of financial instruments\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount that Crombie would receive to sell a financial asset or pay to transfer a financial \nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nFair value determination is classified within a three-level hierarchy, based on observability of significant inputs, as follows:\n•\t Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\t Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n•\t Level 3 – unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nThere were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the period ended December 31, 2022. \nThe fair value of other financial instruments is based on discounted cash flows using discount rates that reflect current market conditions for \ninstruments with similar terms and risks. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of other financial instruments that have a fair value \ndifferent from their carrying value:\nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021\nFair Value\nCarrying Value\nFair Value\nCarrying Value\nFinancial assets\nAccounts receivable1\n$\n22,619\n$\n22,619\n$\n27,737\n$\n27,751\nFinancial liabilities\nInvestment property debt\n$\n1,035,216\n$\n1,078,816\n$\n1,177,814\n$\n1,103,019\nSenior unsecured notes\n877,058\n975,000\n1,157,820\n1,125,000\nTotal financial liabilities\n$\n1,912,274\n$\n2,053,816\n$\n2,335,634\n$\n2,228,019\n(1)\tAccounts receivable include amounts in other assets for the capital expenditure program, interest rate subsidy, and receivable from related parties. \nThe fair values of long-term receivables, investment property debt, and senior unsecured notes are Level 2.\nDue to their short-term nature, the carrying value of the following financial instruments approximates their fair value at the balance sheet date:\n•\t Cash and cash equivalents\n•\t Trade receivables\n•\t Trade and other payables.\n(b) Risk management\nIn the normal course of business, Crombie is exposed to a number of financial risks that can affect its operating performance. The significant risks, and \nthe actions taken to manage them, are as follows:\nCredit risk\nCredit risk arises from the possibility that tenants may experience financial difficulty and be unable to fulfill their lease commitments. A provision for \ndoubtful accounts and other NOI adjustments are taken for all anticipated collectability risks.\nCrombie mitigates credit risk by geographical diversification, diversifying both its tenant mix and asset mix, and conducting credit assessments for new \nand renewing tenants.\nIn measuring tenant concentration, Crombie considers both the annual minimum rent and total property revenue of major tenants:\n•\t Crombie’s largest tenant, Empire (including Sobeys and all other subsidiaries of Empire), represents 58.0% of annual minimum rent; no other tenant \naccounts for more than 2.5% of Crombie’s minimum rent.\n•\t Total property revenue includes operating and realty tax cost recovery income and percentage rent. These amounts can vary by property type, \nspecific tenant leases and where tenants may directly incur and pay operating and realty tax costs. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Empire \n(including Sobeys and all other subsidiaries of Empire) represents 53.0% of total property revenue. Excluding these tenants, no other tenant accounts \nfor more than 2.4% of Crombie’s total property revenue. \n•\t Over the next five years, leases on no more than 6.3% of the gross leasable area of Crombie will expire in any one year.\nReceivables are substantially comprised of current balances due from tenants and past due receivables. The balance of accounts receivable past due \nis usually not significant. Historically low receivable balances increased significantly over the past few years as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 \npandemic, but have since returned to their pre-pandemic collection rates. Generally, rents are due the first of each month and other tenant billings are \ndue 30 days after invoiced, and balances over 30 days are considered past due. The total provision for doubtful accounts is reviewed at each balance \nsheet date and current and long-term accounts receivable are reviewed on a regular basis. \n122\nCROMBIE REIT Annual Report 2022"

In determining the expected credit \nlosses, Crombie takes into account, on a tenant-by-tenant basis, the payment history, future expectations, and knowledge gathered through \ndiscussions for rental concessions and ongoing discussions with tenants. \nCrombie has entered into joint arrangements or partnerships with other third party entities. As at December 31, 2022, Crombie has $22,619 due from \nrelated parties (December 31, 2021 – $27,625). Risks associated with these arrangements include risk of default by a partner on financing obligations. \nCrombie attempts to mitigate these risks by entering into arrangements with financially stable, reputable partners with a proven track record and by \nnegotiating contractual rights in the event of a default.\nInterest rate risk \nInterest rate risk is the potential for financial loss arising from increasing interest rates. Canadian prime interest rates have increased significantly \nfrom 2.45% at December 31, 2021 to 6.45% effective December 8, 2022. Crombie mitigates this risk by utilizing staggered debt maturities and limiting \nthe use of permanent floating rate debt and, on occasion, utilizing interest rate swap agreements. Crombie does not enter into interest rate swaps \non a speculative basis. \nAs at December 31, 2022\n•\t Crombie’s weighted average term to maturity of its fixed rate mortgages is 4.6 years;\n•\t Crombie’s weighted average term to maturity of its unsecured notes is 5.1 years;\n•\t Crombie has an unsecured non-revolving credit facility available to a maximum of $200,000 with a balance of $150,000 outstanding;\n•\t Crombie has a floating rate revolving credit facility available to a maximum of $400,000 subject to available borrowing base, with no balance \noutstanding/drawn; \n•\t Crombie has an unsecured bilateral credit facility available to a maximum of $130,000 with no balance outstanding;\n•\t Crombie has joint operation credit facilities available to a maximum of $10,687 at Crombie’s share with a balance of $10,264 outstanding;\n•\t Crombie has interest rate swap agreements in place on $106,435 of floating rate debt and an interest rate swap agreement in place held \nin equity‑accounting investments on $52,000 of floating rate debt, at Crombie’s share; and\n•\t Crombie has floating rate credit facilities, included in debt held in equity-accounted investments, available to a maximum of $130,250 with \na balance of $116,820 outstanding, at Crombie’s share. \nA fluctuation in interest rates would have an impact on Crombie’s operating and other comprehensive income related to the use of floating rate debt. \nThe following tables look at the impacts of selected interest rate moves on operating and other comprehensive income:\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nImpact on operating income attributable to Unitholders \nof interest rate changes on the revolving credit facility \nIncrease in Rate\nDecrease in Rate\nImpact of a 0.5% interest rate change\n$\n(315)\n$\n315\nImpact of a 1.0% interest rate change\n$\n(631)\n$\n631\nImpact of a 1.5% interest rate change\n$\n(946)\n$\n946\nAs at December 31, 2022\nImpact on other comprehensive income of interest rate changes \non interest rate swap agreements at Crombie’s share\nIncrease in Rate\nDecrease in Rate\nImpact of a 0.5% interest rate change\n$\n2,200\n$\n(2,200)\nImpact of a 1.0% interest rate change\n$\n4,800\n$\n(4,800)\nImpact of a 1.5% interest rate change\n$\n7,000\n$\n(7,000)\n123"

      "text": "NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLiquidity risk\nThe real estate industry is highly capital intensive. Liquidity risk is the risk that Crombie may not have access to sufficient debt and equity capital to fund \nits growth program, refinance debt obligations as they mature, or meet its ongoing obligations as they arise. Cash flow generated from operating the \nproperty portfolio represents the primary source of liquidity used to service the interest on debt, fund general and administrative expenses, reinvest in \nthe portfolio through capital expenditures, as well as fund tenant incentive costs and make distributions to Unitholders. Debt repayment requirements are \nprimarily funded from refinancing Crombie’s maturing debt obligations. Property acquisition funding requirements are funded through a combination \nof accessing the debt and equity capital markets and recycling capital from property dispositions. \nThere is a risk that the debt capital markets may not refinance maturing fixed rate and floating rate debt on terms and conditions acceptable to \nCrombie or at any terms at all. Crombie seeks to mitigate this risk by staggering its debt maturity dates. There is also a risk that the equity capital \nmarkets may not be receptive to a REIT Unit offering issuance from Crombie with financial terms acceptable to Crombie. Access to the $400,000 \nrevolving credit facility is limited by the amount utilized under the facility and the amount of any outstanding letters of credit, and it cannot exceed \nthe borrowing base security provided by Crombie. As at December 31, 2022, $397,117 was available on this facility. \nThe estimated payments, including principal and interest, on financial liabilities to maturity date are as follows:\n Twelve months ending December 31,\nContractual \nCash Flows1\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\nThereafter\nFixed rate mortgages\n$\n1,055,488\n$\n280,079\n$\n293,334\n$\n61,255\n$\n39,248\n$\n131,684\n$\n249,888\nSenior unsecured notes\n1,144,759\n35,176\n35,176\n202,476\n224,220\n166,322\n481,389\nTrade and other payables\n119,194\n97,383\n4,425\n3,351\n2,469\n2,469\n9,097\nLease liabilities\n151,921\n3,028\n2,948\n2,907\n2,792\n2,526\n137,720\n2,471,362\n415,666\n335,883\n269,989\n268,729\n303,001\n878,094\nCredit facilities\n187,681\n9,715\n19,779\n158,187\n—\n—\n—\nTotal estimated payments\n$ 2,659,043\n$\n425,381\n$\n355,662\n$\n428,176\n$\n268,729\n$\n303,001\n$\n878,094\n(1)\tContractual cash flows include principal and interest and exclude extension options.\n20) CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nCrombie’s objective when managing capital on a long-term basis is to maintain overall indebtedness, at reasonable levels, utilize staggered debt \nmaturities, minimize long-term exposure to excessive levels of floating rate debt and maintain conservative payout ratios. \nCrombie’s capital structure consists of the following:\nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021\nFixed rate mortgages1\n$\n913,706\n$\n1,067,859\nCredit facilities \n160,264\n29,124\nSenior unsecured notes1\n972,003\n1,121,267\nCrombie REIT Unitholders\n1,097,070\n950,271\nSVU and Class B LP Unitholders2\n753,470\n647,221\nLease liabilities\n35,000\n35,352\n$\n3,931,513\n$\n3,851,094\n(1)\tNet of deferred financing charges. \n(2)\tCrombie REIT Special Voting Units (“SVU”) and Class B LP Units. \nAt a minimum, Crombie’s capital structure is managed to ensure that it complies with the limitations pursuant to Crombie’s Declaration of Trust, the \ncriteria contained in the Income Tax Act (Canada) in regard to the definition of a REIT and existing debt covenants. One of the restrictions pursuant \nto Crombie’s Declaration of Trust would include, among other items, a restriction that Crombie shall not incur total indebtedness of more than 60% \nof gross book value.\nFor the debt to gross book value calculation, Crombie does not include in total debt the financial liabilities to REIT Unitholders and to holders of \nClass B LP Units, as shown on the consolidated balance sheets as net assets attributable to Unitholders. Crombie’s debt to gross book value is defined \nas the total obligation for borrowed funds and lease liabilities, including the proportionate share of any borrowings held within joint ventures, divided \nby the gross book value of Crombie’s assets which includes its proportionate share of gross assets held within joint ventures. \n124\nCROMBIE REIT Annual Report 2022"
