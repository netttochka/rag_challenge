      "text": "Our energy for a sustainable life.\nIt takes a major effort to achieve major goals. In the current decade, \nour gross investment in green growth – in new wind and solar farms, \nbattery storage, flexible backup power plants and electrolysers for \nhydrogen production – will exceed €50 billion. Our objective here is to \nexpand generation capacity in our core business to more than 50 GW. \nAt the same time, we will be making a socially acceptable exit from \ncoal-fired generation by 2030.\nWhy are we doing all of this? Because we shoulder a unique  \nresponsibility for society. RWE’s purpose ‘Our energy for a sustainable \nlife’ expresses that this responsibility is what drives us and shapes  \nour actions.\nFor 125 years, we have worked tirelessly to harness the benefits of a \nsecure, affordable and increasingly climate-friendly electricity supply \nfor businesses and society as a whole. And we will carry on down this \nroad – with our sights firmly set on a clean and green energy economy. \nCome join us!\nRWE has been around for 125 years. And in that time, our society has \nchanged dramatically. But what hasn’t changed is our product:  \nelectricity. The only difference is how we now generate that electricity. \nWe produced our very first megawatt hour from hard coal. Later, lignite \nand nuclear fuel rods were our main energy sources. Today, they have \nbeen replaced with natural gas, wind, sun and water. Tomorrow, we will \nmake a full transition to zero-carbon energy sources. Because our \nobjective is to be carbon neutral. And we want to ­accomplish this \nby 2040. \nGreen energy is the lifeblood of a sustainable economy. And demand \nfor it is also rising outside of the energy sector. Be it in industry,  \ntransport or buildings, fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas must be \nreplaced by zero-carbon energy sources everywhere. And where it is \nnot possible to switch to green electricity directly, for example when \nproducing steel, hydrogen is a suitable alternative – that is hydrogen \nproduced using electricity from renewables. Which we believe presents \nus with significant opportunities. Our long-term goal is to supply both \ngreen electricity and green hydrogen, a second product with huge \npotential demand."

      "text": "Dear Shareholders,  \nLadies and Gentlemen\nOn 25 April 1898, Germany’s economy started a new, important chapter in its history: the \nestablishment of Rheinisch-Westfälische Elektrizitätswerk (Rhenish-Westphalian Electricity \nWorks) – or in short: ‘RWE’. The purpose of this young company was to supply its hometown \nof Essen with electricity. Today, 125 years later, our product is still the same as it was back \nthen. The only change is how we produce the electricity. We stopped building coal power \nplants a long time ago. Now, we invest billions every year in renewables such as wind energy\nand photovoltaics. Our global reach is also nothing like what it was in 1898. The Essen-\nbased electricity works have become a world-leading energy company that reliably supplies \nelectricity to millions of people, most notably in Europe and North America.\nOur company’s journey has taken in peaks and valleys. Time and again, the course of history \npresented us with challenges. Unfortunately, this is one of those times. A horrific war has \nbeen raging in Europe for over a year now, and there is no end in sight. By attacking Ukraine, \nRussia’s leadership has brought immense human suffering to the country. In addition to \nbeing a humanitarian catastrophe, this senseless war has plunged Europe into a serious \nenergy crisis. Politics, business and society have successfully weathered this crisis so far. \nDespite the discontinuation of gas deliveries from Russia, the energy supply system was \nkept up and running at all times, with our company making several contributions to this \ncause. For example, we organised imports of large quantities of liquefied natural gas (LNG) \nto Europe. On behalf of the German government, we chartered two special ships, docked at \nWilhelmshaven and Brunsbüttel, in order to regasify ocean shipments of LNG. Moreover, at \nthe government’s request, we brought several lignite-fired power plants back online and \ndeferred the decommissioning of two lignite units as well as of the Emsland nuclear power \nstation, in order to reduce the amount of gas used to generate electricity. Some of our \nemployees postponed their retirement, while others even came out of retirement to lend a \nhelping hand. We were able to rely on them during the crisis, in the same way that society \nwas able to rely on us.\nBut despite all the action taken to manage the crisis, we did not lose sight of our long-term \ngoal. In fact, we made good progress in rolling out our Growing Green strategy. Last year, we \ncompleted the large-scale North Sea wind farms Triton Knoll and Kaskasi as well as \nnumerous onshore wind farms in Europe and the USA. In all, we commissioned 2.4 GW of \nwind, solar and battery capacity with a further 6 GW of green generation capacity currently \nunder construction. Furthermore, we succeeded in getting our foot in the door to the \noffshore wind business in the United States and the Netherlands. The groundwork for this \nwas laid with successful bids at auctions for sites for new large-scale projects. \n1.1 Letter from the CEO\nDr. Markus Krebber, Chief Executive Officer of RWE AG\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n6\n1\nTo our investors\nLetter from the CEO"

      "text": "In addition, we acquired PV specialist firm Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses. This \ntransaction has made us the fourth-largest renewables company in the United States. We \ntherefore now hold leading positions in all our core regions  – in the EU, Great Britain, and \nthe US. We further underscored our growth ambitions by acquiring a British and a Polish \nsolar developer.\nRWE’s green transformation goes hand in hand with phasing out electricity generation from \ncoal. In October 2022, we reached an agreement with the federal government and the \nstate of North Rhine-Westphalia to take our last lignite unit offline at the end of March \n2030, eight years earlier than originally envisaged. This sent a clear signal: although we are \ncurrently using more coal to produce electricity to ensure security of supply, as a whole our \ncoal-fired operations will scale back significantly. We will not receive additional \ncompensation for this. But we now have planning certainty for our activities in the Rhenish \nlignite-mining region. Furthermore, we have laid the foundation to ensure our actions will \nnow be in alignment with the 1.5-degree goal of the Paris Climate Conference.\nOur performance last year was also positive in economic terms. At €6.3 billion, adjusted \nEBITDA was clearly higher than anticipated. We made gains over 2021 across all segments \nof our core business. Our new wind and solar farms, favourable conditions on the power \ngeneration market and a very strong trading performance were the basis for this \nachievement. The past year demonstrated that our growth in the renewables business is \npaying off. And we will keep it this way in 2023. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the current \nfiscal year to come in between €5.8 billion and €6.4 billion. This would put us roughly on a \npar with 2022. The acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses, which took effect on \n1 March 2023, will be a major contributing factor. In light of the good earnings prospects, \nwe aim to pay a dividend of €1.00 per share for fiscal 2023. This will also constitute the \nminimum dividend for the coming years.\nAlthough we are making good headway in economic terms, major challenges lie ahead of \nus. At the beginning of this decade, we launched an ambitious growth programme through \nwhich we want to make RWE and the energy economy more climate friendly overall. \nAlthough we are resolute in our commitment to deliver this programme, we still require \nsuitable energy policies. Until recently, crisis management was understandably our top \npriority. Setting a long-term course for the future had to be put on the back burner. This year, \nwe hope to see governments take decisive action, particularly in Germany. For one, the \nexpansion of the power grids needs to be massively accelerated. After all, what good is a \nwind farm in the North Sea if the electricity it generates never finds its way to industry in the \nsouth? We need investment incentives for new, hydrogen-capable gas-fired power plants to \nensure security of supply when wind and solar power fall short. But above all else, we need a \nreliable long-term market design. The energy transition is a once-in-a-century challenge \nthat calls for policymakers, companies and individuals to pull their weight in equal measure. \nWe have already done a lot to ensure it succeeds. With political tailwind, we could progress \neven faster in future.\nIn its 125-year history, RWE has shown that successful entrepreneurial action and taking \nresponsibility for societal issues are not mutually exclusive, but are in fact two sides of the \nsame coin. The enormous commitment shown by our employees when it came to securing \nenergy supply whilst also driving our growth is in keeping with RWE tradition. Their incredible \nresolve moved me deeply. On behalf of the Executive Board, I would like to extend my \nheartfelt thanks. I am also grateful to our shareholders for their continued support and for \njoining us on our journey as we travel towards a climate-neutral, sustainable energy supply. \nWe start our next chapter with hope, drive – and a dash of pride.\nSincerely yours,\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n7\n1\nTo our investors\nLetter from the CEO"

      "text": "1.3 Supervisory Board report\nThe first thing that comes to mind when I look back on 2022 is an event that took us all by \nsurprise and shook us to the core: Russia’s attack on Ukraine. Those who thought that war \nwas a relic of the past were mistaken. The war in Ukraine has lasted over a year now, and \nregrettably, there is no sign of a return to peace. But we mustn’t lose hope. This suffering \nmust come to an end. The courage with which Ukrainians are coping with this horrific \nsituation is admirable. We at RWE really feel for the victims of this absurd war. And many of \nus have underpinned this by providing hands-on support.\nWhen looking back on 2022, I am also reminded of the turmoil on European energy markets \ncaused by the war in Ukraine. The loss of commodity supplies from Russia jeopardised \nsecurity of electricity and gas supply in Germany in particular – a situation that remains to \nthis very day. However, efforts to manage the crisis have been very effective so far, thanks in \npart to RWE. Our company organised large deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and \nchartered two floating regasification units on behalf of the government, enabling LNG to be \nshipped directly to Germany. At the request of policymakers, to enable gas savings in \nelectricity generation, RWE brought lignite units back online and extended the lifetimes of \nthree further assets: two lignite blocks and the Emsland nuclear power station. Our \ncompany and employees are the epitome of reliability. We proved how seriously we take the \nresponsibility we have to society as a major energy utility.\nDespite all the immediate action we took to manage the crisis, we never lost sight of our \nmedium and long-term mission. This brings me to our Growing Green strategy, with which \nRWE wants to make itself and the energy economy as a whole more sustainable and \nclimate-friendly. Undeterred by the crisis, the company pressed on with its ambitions for \ngrowth. Through the acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses, we advanced to the \npremier league of solar power producers in the United States of America. In addition, we got \nour foot in the door to the US offshore wind business thanks to successful bids at site \nauctions. We had a similar success in the Netherlands as well. Not to mention the numerous \nwind and solar farms that RWE completed in 2022 in Europe and the USA. Another \nmilestone passed was the agreement reached with the federal government and the state of \nNorth Rhine-Westphalia to bring forward the lignite phaseout by eight years to 2030. This \nsent a clear signal: although more lignite is being used to produce electricity in the current \ncrisis than originally envisaged, less lignite will be utilised in total. My fellow Supervisory \nBoard members and I advised company management in making all these fundamental \ndecisions and endorsed their chosen path.\nDr. Werner Brandt, Chairman of the \nSupervisory Board of RWE AG\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\nSupervisory Board report\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n9"

      "text": "Supervisory Board activity in the past year. Now let’s take a closer look at the Supervisory \nBoard’s work in the year that just ended. As usual, we conscientiously fulfilled all of the duties \nimposed on us by German law and the Articles of Incorporation. We advised the Executive \nBoard on running the company and monitored its actions. We were involved in all \nfundamental decisions. Management informed us of all material developments both within \nand outside of the Group. In addition, I was regularly in touch with the Chief Executive Officer, \nallowing us to resolve urgent matters without delay.\nWhen in session, we frequently concerned ourselves in particular detail with the impact that \nRussia’s war against Ukraine has had on the economy, with a particular focus on the energy \nsector and RWE’s operations. Further focal topics were security of supply, our company’s \nearly exit from lignite, its liquidity position, the evolution of our growth strategy, and – closely \nrelated to this – the acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses.\nOur duties include the regular review and improvement of the quality of our work on the \nSupervisory Board. This involves performing regular self-assessments. Another such audit \ntook place in 2022. We concluded that our workflows were goal-oriented and effective. \nHowever, we also identified a need to hone our competency profile, which reflects the \nqualifications members of the Supervisory Board are required to hold. We came to the \nconclusion that considerations such as globality and sustainability should be emphasised \nmore. The necessary amendments were approved at the Supervisory Board meeting on  \n9 December. The quality of our work is also enhanced by the extensive basic and advanced \ntraining that we undertake on our own authority and with RWE’s support. In light of the \nincreasing frequency of cyber attacks on commercial enterprises, last year we focused on  \nIT security.\nOne of the Supervisory Board’s main tasks is to maintain dialogue with the company’s \nshareholders. As we’re of the opinion that this discourse should not be limited to the Annual \nGeneral Meeting, I have been regularly holding talks with investors and shareholder \nrepresentatives on behalf of the Supervisory Board for several years now. I kept with this \npractice in 2022 despite the restrictions imposed by COVID-19. Topics included the \nSupervisory Board’s composition, the staggered tenures, the remuneration system for the \nExecutive Board, RWE’s strategy, and the coal phaseout.\nMain points of debate of the Supervisory Board meetings. Last year, the Supervisory \nBoard convened for eight meetings, including five ordinary and three extraordinary sessions. \nThe Executive Board was present at all the meetings. However, some individual agenda \nitems were discussed when it was not in attendance. The shareholder and employee \nrepresentatives met separately before the Supervisory Board meetings, in order to consult \non matters in a smaller circle and establish joint positions where necessary. The Executive \nBoard was also present during these sessions where necessary. This brings me to the main \npoints of each meeting:\n•\t Our first meeting last year took place on 9 March. It centred on Russia’s war on Ukraine \nthat had just begun. The Executive Board informed us of its decision to discontinue \nbusiness with Russia owing to the war. Moreover, it presented the effects the conflict could \nhave on RWE. In addition, we discussed aid measures to help people affected by the war \nand the risks this posed for European energy supply. The Ukraine conflict and its fallout \nremained on our agenda for the whole year. In our March session, we discussed and \napproved the 2021 financial statements of RWE AG, the consolidated financial \nstatements, and the separate Non-financial Statement. For the first time, we endorsed the \nRemuneration Report, as it must now be prepared jointly by the Executive Board and the \nSupervisory Board pursuant to the law on the implementation of the Second EU \nShareholder Rights Directive. Moreover, we approved the Agenda for RWE’s Annual \nGeneral Meeting, which was held in virtual format on 28 April. Further topics included \ncyber security, the market power report from the German Cartel Office, the company’s \nsustainability strategy and the successful participation in auctions of offshore wind  \nsites in the New York Bight. In addition, we decided to enlist the services of \nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (PwC) for the audit of \nthe financial statements for fiscal 2022. This resolution was subject to the approval of \nRWE’s Annual General Meeting, which it received thereafter. \nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\nSupervisory Board report\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n10"

      "text": "•\t At our second ordinary session on 28 April 2022 we made preparations for the virtual \nAnnual General Meeting, which was held on the same day. Furthermore, we consulted on \nthe planned acquisition of the Magnum gas-fired power plant at the Eemshaven site in \nthe Netherlands. \n•\t The acquisition of the Magnum power station was also the main item on the agenda of \nour extraordinary meeting on 1 June 2022. We concerned ourselves with the transaction \nin detail once again, after which we approved it. \n•\t In our ordinary session on 14 June 2022, we discussed the German law on equal \nopportunities for women and men in executive positions. We set a new target female \nquota for the Executive Board of RWE AG of 33.3 %. This means that the three-member \ncorporate body must include at least one woman. This rule will remain in force until June \n2027. Also on the agenda were the consequences of the war in Ukraine for European \nenergy supply and the planned expansion of German LNG infrastructure. \n•\t The most important item on the agenda of our extraordinary meeting on 31 August 2022 \nwas the upheaval on Europe’s energy markets. We paid special attention to the extremely \nhigh commodity prices and their impact on RWE’s liquidity position. The Executive Board \nupdated us on market developments and the measures taken to safeguard liquidity. \n•\t In our extraordinary session on 20 September 2022, we again debated the developments \non the energy markets and the Group’s liquidity. Another major topic was the impending \nagreement with policymakers on bringing forward Germany’s lignite phaseout to 2030, \nwhich we unanimously endorsed. Our consultations also addressed the reform of the \nGerman Corporate Governance Code in 2022, which reinforced the focus on \nsustainability and social issues. Furthermore, we analysed the findings of the ­self-\nassessment of our work. Other items on the agenda included the regular review of the \nremuneration received by Dr. Michael Müller and Zvezdana Seeger, which had taken place \nin the summer. The Supervisory Board agreed with the remuneration amendment put \nforward by the Personnel Affairs Committee. In addition, we covered strategic issues and \nprogress made in rolling out current renewable energy projects. During the meeting, the \nExecutive Board informed us of its plan to acquire US-based power producer Con Edison \nClean Energy Businesses. \n•\t This transaction was a pivotal topic of an extraordinary session on 30 September 2022. \nFollowing an in-depth discussion, we passed all the resolutions necessary for the Executive \nBoard to reach a contractual arrangement to make the acquisition. \n•\t At an extraordinary meeting on 9 December 2022, we reviewed and approved the \nbusiness plan for fiscal 2023, the outlook on fiscal 2024 and 2025 as well as the risk \nreport. Moreover, we fulfilled our corporate governance reporting duties: we updated the \nSupervisory Board’s competency profile pursuant to the recommendations of the German \nCorporate Governance Code and documented the state of implementation of the \nrequirements defined in the competency profile within a qualification matrix, which was \ndisclosed in the Corporate Governance Statement. Together with the Executive Board, we \nadopted an updated statement of compliance in accordance with Section 161 of the \nGerman Stock Corporation Act and approved the parts of the Corporate Governance \nDeclaration relating to the Supervisory Board pursuant to Section 289a of the German \nCommercial Code. The documents are available at www.rwe.com/corporate-\ngovernance-declaration, respectively. Furthermore, we set the stage for the future \ncomposition of the Executive Board: we resolved to extend the contract of Michael Müller \nby five years with effect from 1 November 2023. In addition, we appointed Katja van \nDoren to the corporate body as of 1 August 2023 for an initial term of three years. She will \ntake office as Chief HR Officer and Labour Director as successor to Zvezdana Seeger, who \nwill leave the company for personal reasons. All of these resolutions were based on \nrecommendations from the Personnel Affairs Committee. Moreover, we concerned \nourselves with the company’s strategy and approved the Commercial Paper Programme \nin the USA. In addition, the Executive Board provided us with detailed information on the \nlatest developments in energy policy in both Germany and the Netherlands. Another issue \naddressed was the German law on the introduction of virtual annual general meetings \nthat had come into force on 22 July 2022.

      "text": "Work of the Supervisory Board committees. The Supervisory Board has six committees, \nthe members of which are listed on page 266 of the Annual Report. The committees are \ncharged with preparing topics discussed by the Supervisory Board in order to establish a \nbasis for the corporate body to pass resolutions. In certain cases, they themselves exercise \ndecision-making powers if they have been conferred on them by the Supervisory Board. \nMore detailed information can be found on Section 10 et seqq. of the Rules of Procedure for \nthe Supervisory Board, which are available at www.rwe.com/en/investor-relations/\ncorporate-governance/management-board-and-supervisory-board. The Supervisory \nBoard is informed of the work of the committees by their chairs at every ordinary meeting.  \nIn the year under review, a total of 17 committee meetings were held, on which I would like to \nreport in more detail.\n•\t Executive Committee. The Executive Committee held one ordinary meeting at which, as \nusual, it discussed the company’s planning for fiscal 2022 and the outlook on the two \nsubsequent years. In addition, there were two extraordinary sessions. At the first one, we \ndebated a request filed by a shareholder to add an item to the Agenda of the Annual \nGeneral Meeting, seeking to oblige the Executive Board to initiate the spin-off of RWE \nPower AG from its parent RWE AG. We did not endorse this proposal, as we believe it is not \nin the interests of RWE or its owners. The topic addressed at the second extraordinary \nmeeting was the issuance of a mandatory convertible bond to Qatar Holding LLC, a \nsubsidiary of the Qatar Investment Authority. Proceeds from the issuance were to be used \nto finance the acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses. \n•\t Audit Committee. The Audit Committee convened five times. It carefully reviewed the \nfinancial statements of RWE AG and the Group, the combined review of operations, the \nreport on the first half of the year, the quarterly statements, and the Non-financial \nStatement. It discussed the financial statements with the Executive Board before they \nwere published and received reports on the outcome of the audits and audit-like reviews \nfrom the independent auditors. Furthermore, the Audit Committee submitted a \nrecommendation to the Supervisory Board regarding the election of the independent \nauditors for fiscal 2022, prepared the grant of the audit award to the independent \nauditors including the fee agreement, set the priorities of the audit and also verified the \nindependence of the auditors along with the quality of the audit. The Committee also \nconcerned itself with the appointment of an external auditor for the 2022 Remuneration \nReport and the 2022 Non-financial Group Statement. One key item on last year’s agenda \nwas to appoint new independent auditors, which we were legally required to do by fiscal \n2024 at the latest. The Committee opted for an early tender procedure. Following a \ndiligent evaluation of the applications, it recommended enlisting the services of Deloitte \nGmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft. The Supervisory Board passed a corresponding \nresolution by circular in November. When in session, the Audit Committee also addressed \na number of additional topics: the impact of the war in Ukraine on RWE, liquidity \nmanagement, protection of IT systems from cyber attacks, the compliance management \nsystem as well as legal and tax matters. Further major items on the agenda were the \nplanning and results of the internal audit and RWE’s risk exposure. The Committee \nsubjected the accounting-related Internal Control System (ICS) to an appropriateness \nand effectiveness check. It reached the conclusion that the ICS did not have any material \nshortcomings. Related party transactions were also on the agenda. This entailed the \nCommittee verifying whether these transactions were performed in the ordinary course of \nbusiness and in line with practices generally accepted on the market, as required by the \nGerman law on the implementation of the Second EU Shareholders Directive. The \nindependent auditors attended four of the five Audit Committee meetings and also \nexchanged information with the Committee Chair between sessions. In-house experts \nwere occasionally involved in the consultations. \n•\t Personnel Affairs Committee. The Personnel Affairs Committee held four ordinary \nmeetings, at which it mainly concerned itself with Executive Board matters, in particular \nthe target female quota, remuneration matters, and long-term succession planning. It \nissued a recommendation to the Supervisory Board to extend the contract of Michael \nMüller and to appoint Katja van Doren to the Executive Board. As set out earlier, the \nSupervisory Board passed the recommended resolutions in its December session. \n•\t Nomination Committee. The Nomination Committee convened three ordinary and one \nextraordinary session. The main points of debate were long-term succession planning on \nthe Supervisory Board, its skills matrix, and documentation of individual competencies in \nthe qualification matrix. In addition, the Committee dealt with a change in personnel:  \nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\nSupervisory Board report\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n12"

      "text": "after Günther Schartz resigned from his office as of 30 September 2021, the Mayor of \nEssen, Thomas Kufen, was appointed to the corporate body by the Essen District Court as \nof 18 October 2021. The Supervisory Board submitted the restaffing matter to the \nAnnual General Meeting on 28 April 2022 for the passage of a corresponding resolution. \nPrior to this, the Committee had held a consultation during which it considered a second \ncandidate, who had been suggested by a shareholder. After carefully weighing its options, \nit recommended that the Supervisory Board endorse the election of Thomas Kufen. The \nAnnual General Meeting approved the motion with a 98 % majority vote. \n•\t Strategy and Sustainability Committee. The Strategy and Sustainability Committee held \none ordinary and two extraordinary meetings. Issues discussed included management’s \nplans to expand renewable energy and ramp up the hydrogen economy. The Committee \nalso extensively debated the sustainability strategy. Moreover, Committee members were \ninformed by the Executive Board of the action plan and long-term goals regarding the \nenvironment, social affairs and corporate governance. The Committee discussed the \nconsequences of the war in Ukraine in respect of security of supply and European climate \npolicy. It also discussed whether the change in the geopolitical situation required RWE to \nadjust its strategic orientation. \n•\t Mediation Committee. This committee did not convene in the 2022 reporting year. \nParent company and consolidated financial statements for 2022. PwC audited and \nissued an unqualified auditor’s opinion on the 2022 financial statements of RWE AG, which \nwere prepared by the Executive Board in compliance with the German Commercial Code, \nthe financial statements of the Group, which were prepared in compliance with IFRS \npursuant to Section 315e of the German Commercial Code, the combined review of \noperations for RWE AG and the Group, and the accounts. The opinion was signed by the \nauditors in charge, Markus Dittmann und Aissata Touré. In addition, PwC subjected the \nNon-financial Statement in the combined review of operations to a limited assurance audit \nand even went as far as to carry out reasonable assurance checks on individual indicators. It \nfound that the Executive Board had established an appropriate early risk detection system. \nPwC had been elected as the independent auditor by the 2022 Annual General Meeting. \nThereafter, the Supervisory Board had commissioned them to audit the aforementioned \nfinancial statements and reports. \nThe Executive Board commented on the documents supporting the parent company \nfinancial statements, the Annual Report and the audit reports at the Supervisory Board’s \nbalance-sheet meeting on 15 March 2023. The documents were made available to the \nmembers of the Supervisory Board in good time. During the session, certified public \naccountants reported on the material findings of the audit and were available to furnish \nsupplementary information. The Audit Committee had concerned itself in depth with the \nfinancial statements of RWE AG, the consolidated financial statements and the audit \nreports with the auditors present the day before. The Committee recommended that the \nSupervisory Board approve the financial statements and endorse the appropriation of \ndistributable profit proposed by the Executive Board.\nThe financial statements of RWE AG, the consolidated financial statements, the combined \nreview of operations, the Executive Board’s proposal regarding the appropriation of \ndistributable profit, and the Non-financial Statement were reviewed by the Supervisory \nBoard. The corporate body did not raise any objections as a result of this review. As \nrecommended by the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board endorsed the findings of the \naudits of the financial statements of RWE AG and the consolidated financial statements and \napproved both financial statements. The 2022 annual financial statements are therefore \nadopted. The Supervisory Board concurs with the Executive Board’s proposal regarding the \nappropriation of profits, which envisages paying a dividend of €0.90 per share.\nAttendance. The table on the next page contains an overview of Supervisory Board \nmember attendance at the meetings of this corporate body and its committees. As the \nMediation Committee did not convene in 2022, it has been omitted from this table. Here is \nan example of how to interpret the numbers: ‘7 / 8’ means that the individual attended seven \nout of eight sessions held during their membership of the corporate body. The figures show \nthat absence from a meeting was the exception. The attendance rate was 99.2 %. \nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\nSupervisory Board report\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n13"

What comes to mind, for example, are all the employees who \nhelped the victims of the war in Ukraine, who ensured that sufficient supplies of liquefied \nnatural gas made their way to Germany, and who drove our major investment projects \nundeterred. And of course this also reminds me of our employees in the Rhenish lignite \nmining region, many of whom had to change their plans for the future because of RWE’s \nearly exit from the lignite business. Others returned to our power plants from retirement in \norder to guarantee security of supply. They were and remain ready and willing to do so \nbecause they are committed to us and our goals. I would like to thank them and RWE’s entire \nworkforce on behalf of the Supervisory Board for their exceptional dedication in the past \nyear. I hope that they are respected by family, friends and their communities for their \naccomplishments for the benefit of society as a result of the work they do in our company. \nWerner Brandt\nChairman of the Supervisory Board\nEssen, 15 March 2023\nMeeting formats.

There were no changes \nin personnel on the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board in the fiscal year that just \nended. As mentioned earlier, Thomas Kufen, who had already been appointed to the \nSupervisory Board by court order, was elected to the corporate body by the 2022 Annual \nGeneral Meeting. Furthermore, we reached decisions on the Executive Board’s future \ncomposition, on which I have already commented. We extended the contract with our CFO \nMichael Müller by five years through to 31 October 2028.

      "text": "1.4 RWE on the capital market\n2022 was a disappointing year for equity investors. The war in Ukraine, inflation and \nrising interest rates weighed on market sentiment as the DAX buckled by 12 %. At times, \nGermany’s blue-chip index lost as much as a quarter of its value. RWE stock performed \nsignificantly better: taking the dividend payment into account, our share turned in a \nperformance of 19 %. Improved earnings prospects played an important part in this \nregard, to some extent due to more favourable market conditions in power generation. \nThe rapid progress we are making as we implement our growth strategy has also \nproven to be an important success factor. In addition, we are making good headway in \nfinancing this growth. In 2022 and early 2023, thanks to new placements, we increased \nour green bond volume by €3 billion to almost €5 billion. The funds are exclusively \nreserved for the expansion of our renewables portfolio.\nWar in Ukraine and interest rate turnaround dampen market sentiment. 2022 was a \nsobering year for stock markets around the world. Germany’s leading index, the DAX, lost \n12 % of its value, closing the year at 13,924 points. By the end of September, the German \nstock market barometer was down by as much as 25 %, before making up lost ground. The \nmain reason for the weak performance was Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The conflict \nplunged Germany and various other European states into a deep energy crisis. The sharp \ndecline in fuel imports from Russia caused elevated commodity prices to soar even further, \nfuelling fears about security of supply. Inflation, driven up by energy shortages, also weighed \non market sentiment. Central banks in the Eurozone, the UK and the USA had no other \nchoice than to abandon their loose monetary policy, which had been a key factor in buoying \nstock markets, resulting in multiple base rate rises.\nRWE share delivers 19 % return on investment. The RWE share was one of the best-\nperforming stocks in the DAX in 2022, achieving an annual closing price of €41.59 – a big \nimprovement on last year (€35.72). Including the dividend of €0.90 paid in May, the share \nturned in a performance of 19 %, thus also significantly outstripping the STOXX Europe 600 \nUtilities (– 8 %). Financial analysts confirm RWE’s good earnings prospects despite the \ndifficult environment. This is partly due to the success of our efforts to expand renewables \nand better realisable generation margins. Our improved earnings forecast for 2022, which \nwas published in the middle of the year, helped improve market sentiment further. There \nwere, however, factors which weighed on earnings: we had to deal with the curtailment of \ncoal and gas supplies from Russia, for example. The introduction of additional levies on \nelectricity revenues in the EU and the UK also triggered markdowns.\nTotal return of the RWE share and the DAX and STOXX Europe 600 Utilities indices\n% (average weekly figures)\n  RWE share\n  STOXX Europe 600 Utilities\n  DAX\b\nSource: Bloomberg.\n31 Dec 2021\n31 Mar 2022\n30 Jun 2022\n30 Sep 2022\n31 Dec 2022\n30\n20\n10\n0\n– 10\n– 20\n– 30\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\nRWE on the capital market\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n16"

In view of the Group’s \ncontinued good earnings, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of RWE AG will \npropose a dividend of €0.90 per share for fiscal 2022 to the Annual General Meeting on \n4 May 2023. The Executive Board envisages that the dividend payment for 2023 will likely \nbe higher at €1.00 per share. This is intended to be the new lower limit for coming fiscal \nyears.

This figure does \nnot include the mandatory convertible bond we issued to Qatar Holding LLC as it is an \nequity financing instrument. Our bond volume has increased by €4.25 billion compared to \nlate 2021. This is largely attributable to a number of new placements: on 24 May 2022, we \nissued two green bonds with a nominal volume of €1 billion each, one with a tenor of four \nyears and a coupon of 2.125 % and another with a tenor of eight years and a coupon of \n2.75 %.

      "text": "2.1  Strategy\nRWE has an ambitious growth strategy, the cornerstones of which we presented to the \npublic at the end of 2021. We have progressed faster than anticipated in implementing \nour strategy, despite the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis triggered by it. We had \nintended to almost double generation capacity in our green core business to 50 GW by \nbuilding new wind and solar farms, battery storage systems, gas-fired power plants \nand electrolysers. It is already becoming apparent that we will exceed our target. An \nadditional mainstay of our strategy is the accelerated exit from coal-fired generation – \nanother area where we have stepped up the pace. We have reached an agreement with \nthe German government and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia to stop producing \npower from lignite by as early as 2030 – eight years ahead of schedule. In so doing, we \nhave laid the foundations to ensure our operations are in alignment with the 1.5-degree \ngoal of the Paris Climate Conference.\nWho we are and what we do. RWE is a leading international energy company \nheadquartered in Essen, Germany, with a focus on electricity generation. Renewable  \nenergy sources such as wind and solar are an increasingly important part of our business. \nOur core activities also include gas and electricity storage, the hydrogen business, trading  \nof energy- related commodities and innovative energy solutions for industrial customers.  \nWe generated revenues of €38.4 billion in fiscal 2022. Our key markets are Germany, the \nUnited Kingdom, the Netherlands and the USA. In the field of renewables, we are also active \nin a whole host of other countries, for example in Poland, Spain, Italy, France, Greece, \nSweden, Denmark and Australia. We intend to further broaden the regional spread of our \nrenewables business.\nThe energy triumvirate – carbon neutrality, security and affordability. Most industrialised \ncountries where we do business have made their energy policies contingent on more \nambitious climate protection targets. They want to minimise greenhouse gas emissions \ncaused by the use of fossil fuels. Another objective is to ensure that energy supply is both \nreliable and affordable. This goal has become more of a focus for policymakers as a result \nof tensions on electricity and gas markets. Energy companies like RWE are faced with the \nfollowing tasks:\n•\t Decarbonising electricity generation. A core component of the energy transition is \nmoving away from electricity generation from fossil fuels and embracing renewables. \nCoal and natural gas are finite resources, which when combusted lead to the emission of \ngreenhouse gases. By contrast, wind, solar and hydro are not only energy sources that do \nnot generate CO2 emissions. They are also available in abundance, enabling renewables \nto provide the basis for a sustainable supply of electricity and heat. Another advantage is \nthat these renewable power sources allow EU member states and the UK to reduce their \ndependency on fuel imports. Greater autonomy in this regard shields countries against \nthe fallout from rising gas and coal prices on global markets and prevents axed imports \nfrom posing such a risk to security of supply.\n•\t Providing storage and environmentally friendly backup plants. As energy supply relies \nincreasingly on wind and solar farms, energy storage systems become ever more \nimportant for stabilising the power grids. Furthermore, we need more environmentally \nfriendly, flexible generation assets, which can reliably produce electricity when there is no \nwind and no sunshine. Modern gas-fired power stations that can be retrofitted to run on \ncarbon-neutral fuels will be well-positioned for this task. Hydrogen (H2) is one such fuel. \nDuring combustion, it does not emit greenhouse gases and producing H2 can also be \ncarbon-free e. g. if it is made by electrolysis using renewable energy (green hydrogen). \nMoreover, there is a need to secure long-term, diversified supplies of natural gas and \nclimate-friendly hydrogen.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\nStrategy\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n21"

      "text": "•\t Replacing fossil fuels with green power. Reducing emissions only in the electricity  \nsector is not enough to achieve climate neutrality. Action also needs to be taken in the \nmanufacturing, heat and transportation sectors. At present, oil, coal and gas cover more \nthan 70 % of European energy consumption. Switching to electricity produced with \ncarbon-neutral methods – e. g. by using heat pumps instead of oil and gas heating \nsystems – also enables emission reductions across sectors. Electrification is indispensable \nto achieving climate goals. This is why demand for electricity in our markets is expected to \nincrease significantly.\n•\t Establishing the hydrogen economy. The economy can only be completely decarbonised \nif solutions are also found for applications where direct electrification is not an option. \nExamples of this are the production of steel and fertilisers. In the near future, hydrogen \nproduced using climate-neutral methods would be a solution. As previously explained, \nhydrogen can contribute to lowering greenhouse gas emissions in other ways on top of \nusing it to generate electricity. \nWe’re driving the energy transition. RWE is well positioned to contribute to transforming \nthe energy sector and the broader economy in all of the areas discussed above. That is \nprecisely what we are doing, by investing billions of euros in wind power, photovoltaics, \nbattery storage and the hydrogen economy, phasing out coal-based generation, building \nenvironmentally friendly backup capacities and helping industrial customers to optimise \nenergy consumption. In addition, we are working with policymakers to ensure security of \nsupply. This task has become more important due to the war in Ukraine. For instance, we are \norganising imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Germany and helping to develop the \nnecessary LNG infrastructure. At the behest of the German government, we continue to \noperate two lignite units and our Emsland nuclear power station which had been scheduled \nto be decommissioned on 31 December 2022. We also temporarily put three lignite units \nwhich had been placed in reserve back online. However, the interim increase in coal-fired \npower generation does not change our long-term commitment to a fully decarbonised \nenergy value chain. \nAt the Paris Climate Conference in 2015, the international community committed to \nlimiting the increase in average global temperatures to well below two degrees Celsius \ncompared to pre-industrial levels, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius. RWE aims to be carbon \nneutral by 2040 at the latest, ten years earlier than the EU. Not only does this apply to our \nown greenhouse gas emissions, it also covers the upstream and downstream value chain.  \nAt the end of 2020, the independent Science Based Targets initiative confirmed that the \nemission reductions we have planned for this decade are in line with the Paris target of \n‘significantly less than 2 degrees Celsius’. However, we are now working towards decreasing \ncarbon emissions even further: in October 2022, we agreed with the German government \nand the state of North Rhine-Westphalia that we would phase out German lignite-fired \npower production by 2030, eight years ahead of the exit date established by law. In doing \nso, we will create the basis for complying with the 1.5-degree Celsius target.\nSustainability – at the heart of our corporate culture. Our mission statement ‘Our energy \nfor a sustainable life’ expresses our purpose as a company and reaffirms our commitment \nto sustainability as a guiding principle of our actions. Although cutting greenhouse gas \nemissions may be a priority for us, it is not our only focus. Sustainability is measured in a \nmyriad of ways. The expression is generally used within the context of environment, social \nand governance (ESG). Working together with internal and external experts, we defined the \nfields of action that are most significant for RWE and what we want to achieve in these \nareas. Further information on our ESG goals and the degree to which we have achieved \nthem can be found on pages 78 et seqq. of this report.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\nStrategy\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n22"

      "text": "Growing Green – our strategic roadmap to 2030. In November 2021, we informed the \npublic about the strategy and goals for our business activities during the current decade at \nour Capital Market Day. Profitable growth in our green core business forms the centrepiece \nof our strategy, which is called ‘Growing Green’. At the Capital Market Day, we announced \nour intention to invest approximately €50 billion in new wind farms, photovoltaic assets, \nbattery storage, gas-fired power plants and electrolysers in the 10-year period from 2021 \nto the end of 2030. After deducting cash flows from divestments, this capital expenditure \nshould total approximately €30 billion. We had thought that this would enable us to expand \nour green generation capacity (including battery storage systems and electrolysers) to  \n50 GW by 2030. This figure has been prorated, meaning that it reflects capacity based on \nour shareholding ratios. However, as the rollout of our growth strategy is coming along \nbetter than expected, we now expect investments to be higher. Our green capacity should \nsignificantly exceed 50 GW by 2030. This is in part attributable to the acquisition of US \nenergy company Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses which has made us one of the leading \nsolar power producers in the USA. This year, we will revise our strategy and update our \ngrowth targets. We want to present the results of this to the public at our next Capital Market \nDay, which has been scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2023.\nTurning to the individual components of our growth programme:\n•\t Offshore Wind. We are a world leader in offshore wind. At the end of 2022, we had a total \npro-rata capacity of 3.3 GW in this field. We intend to increase this figure to 8 GW by \n2030. We currently operate wind farms in the coastal waters of the United Kingdom, \nGermany, Belgium, Sweden and Denmark. Europe is our most important growth region, as \nexemplified by the British projects Sofia (1.4 GW) and Dogger Bank South (3 GW) as well \nas Thor (1 GW) located off the coast of Denmark. However, we are also looking to markets \noutside Europe: together with local partner companies, we are working on projects in the \nUSA, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and India. Last year, we secured areas for offshore wind \nfarms in the New York Bight and off the Californian and the Dutch coasts through \nauctions. But we are seizing more than just geographic opportunities, as we tap into new \ntechnological options as well. In order to realise the full potential of offshore wind, we will \nalso be expanding our generation portfolio in the future with the addition of floating wind \nturbines, which can be operated in deep waters. Together with our partners, we are \nexploring which types of floating foundation offer the best technical capabilities (see \npages 27 et seq.).\n•\t Onshore Wind / Solar. We also command a strong position in onshore wind. By the end of \n2022, our prorated generation capacity totalled 8 GW, and we aim to increase it to \n12 GW by 2030. In terms of solar, we are still in the starting phase: at the end of 2022 our \nPV portfolio had a capacity of 0.8 GW. Over the course of the current decade, we expect \nto add significantly more assets. Our original target was 8 GW. Through the acquisition of \nCon Edison Clean Energy Businesses, we will exceed this figure by a considerable margin. \nWe are concentrating our onshore wind and solar efforts on North America, Europe and \nAustralia, where we are looking to diversify geographically. Our main focus in terms of \ngrowth ventures is on countries and market segments harbouring potential for more than \none technology, e. g. for photovoltaics plus wind energy and / or battery storage.\n•\t Battery storage. The increased dependence on more variable energy sources such as \nwind and photovoltaics calls for more battery storage systems. RWE has been involved in \nthe development, construction and operation of large-scale batteries for many years now. \nDuring this decade, we are targeting an installed capacity of 3 GW, compared to 274 MW \n(pro rata) at the end of 2022. In June 2022, we commissioned a key battery project in \nHickory Park in the US state of Georgia, which consists of a 196 MW solar farm coupled to \na 40 MW battery storage system. This combination enables electricity feed-ins into the \nlocal grid to be optimised, thereby improving the solar plant’s yield. Future photovoltaic \nprojects will largely follow this approach. We are also building battery storage to provide \ngrid services. Two examples of this are the megabatteries with capacities of 72 MW and \n45 MW, which we installed at our German power plant sites in Werne and Lingen (see \npage 40).\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\nStrategy\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n23"

      "text": "•\t Flexible gas-fired power stations. The supply gap caused by the coal phaseout cannot \nbe plugged with battery storage solutions alone. We need to build flexible, low-carbon \nbackup capacities that can balance out the fluctuations in power generation from solar \nand wind. Gas-fired power plants play a key role in this regard. We see a need for \ninvestments in Germany, where we plan to build gas-fired power stations with a total \ncapacity of 3 GW. Potential sites include locations in North Rhine-Westphalia which have \nuntil now been utilised for coal-fired generation. That said, we will only make these \ninvestments if Germany provides the necessary incentives, which could include \ninvestment subsidies, for example. Furthermore, conditions must be in place for us to \noperate our gas-fired power stations using green hydrogen over the longer term. We are \nplanning the necessary retrofits throughout Europe for existing assets and have already \nfinalised the relevant concepts. In power plants that do not run on hydrogen, carbon \ndioxide could be separated from the flue gases and stored underground or used to \nproduce plastics or fuels.\n•\t Hydrogen. The hydrogen economy is a crucial part of the energy transition and a perfect \ncomplement to our business model. We want to be active along the entire value chain, \nfrom green electricity generation and hydrogen production through electrolysis to \nhydrogen trading and storage to the conclusion of individual supply agreements with \nmajor industrial customers. Our regional focus for these activities is on Germany, the \nNetherlands and the United Kingdom. In recent years, we have forged a range of \npartnerships with businesses and research institutes seeking to work closely with us to \ndevelop a comprehensive hydrogen infrastructure. Noteworthy projects include the \nGerman GET H2 and AquaVentus initiatives as well as Eemshydrogen in the Netherlands. \nMore information on our hydrogen strategy and our major projects can be found at  \nwww.rwe.com/hydrogen.\nEnergy trading and customer solutions. In addition to power generation, we are also \nfocused on energy trading as one of our core competencies. It is managed by the Group \ncompany RWE Supply & Trading, which acts as our interface to the energy markets. Around \n200 specialists trade electricity, fuel and emission rights around the clock. In addition, \nRWE Supply & Trading markets the electricity from our power stations and procures the fuel \nand emission allowances required to produce it. The objective here is to limit price risks. On \ntop of that, the company is in charge of the commercial optimisation of our power plant \ndispatch, with associated earnings going to our generation companies. Companies outside \nof the RWE Group can also benefit from the expertise of our trading subsidiary. They are \noffered a wide range of products and services, running the gamut from traditional energy \nsupply contracts and comprehensive energy management solutions to sophisticated risk \nmanagement concepts.\nAbove and beyond this, RWE Supply & Trading has established itself as an intermediary for \npipeline gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Thus, in addition to meeting the needs of our \nGroup companies, it also serves numerous industrial customers around the world. To this \nend, RWE Supply & Trading enters into long-term supply agreements with producers, \norganises gas transportation by booking pipelines, LNG tankers and regasification \nterminals as well as using storage facilities to time deliveries. In this regard, the greater the \nsize and diversification of the procurement and supply portfolios, the better the chances to \ncommercially optimise them. The gas business also opens up opportunities for hydrogen \nactivities. For example, we are planning to build a second terminal next to the LNG terminal \nplanned in Brunsbüttel – on which we report on page 41 – for importing green ammonia \nthat could be used to generate hydrogen. \nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\nStrategy\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n24"

      "text": "Socially acceptable phaseout of coal-fired generation. Our growth programme is flanked \nby an accelerated coal exit. In the United Kingdom and Germany, we already phased out \nhard-coal-fired power generation in 2019 and 2021, respectively. We are currently using \nhard coal in only our Dutch stations Amer 9 and Eemshaven, where biomass is co-fired. \nFrom 2025 and 2030, respectively, we will no longer be using hard coal in these plants. \nConversely, the phaseout of lignite, which is produced and used to generate electricity in  \nthe Rhenish region to the west of Cologne, is significantly more complex for RWE due to the \nsocial ramifications. We agreed with the German government and the state of North \nRhine-Westphalia that we would stop producing electricity from lignite in the Rhenish  \nmining region as soon as 2030 for climate reasons. In contrast, policymakers ordered \nlimited lifetime extensions for five of our lignite units, in order to ensure security of supply. \nThese measures are deviations from the present exit roadmap and require plans to be \nsubstantially adjusted. First and foremost, this affects our employees. We will do all we can to \navoid social hardship for our staff. As before, comprehensive compensatory measures will \nbe taken for the affected individuals, such as a statutory adjustment allowance.\nOur responsibility to the people in the Rhenish region does not end at the factory gates: \ndespite the coal phaseout, we want to play our part in ensuring that the region remains \nstructurally resilient and integrated within the energy sector, e. g. through the expansion of \nrenewable energy. We intend to build no less than 500 MW of wind and solar capacities in \nthe Rhenish region alone. Parts of the recultivated land are very well suited for these plans. \nThree RWE wind farms are already located there. We also want to continue using the power \nplant sites, for instance by operating new hydrogen-compatible gas-fired power stations. In \naddition, there are plans to build an innovation, technology and commercial park in and \naround Frimmersdorf and we are going to build a megabattery in Neurath. Furthermore, we \nare researching power-to-gas technology at the Niederaussem Innovation Centre. This is \nwhere, since 2013, we have used hydrogen and carbon dioxide made by electrolysis to \nproduce fuel and feedstock for the chemical industry for research purposes.\nNuclear power – our focus is on safe and efficient dismantling. Germany’s nuclear \nphaseout is a done deal. The German government may have delayed the decommissioning \nof the last three nuclear power stations from 31 December 2022 to 15 April 2023 to \nensure security of supply in the winter of 2022 / 2023, however, this does not equate to a \nchange in German energy policy. One of the three remaining German nuclear plants – the \nEmsland station near Lingen – is operated by RWE. We expect the unit to be finally \ndecommissioned in April 2023. After that, our nuclear activities will be exclusively focused \non the safe and efficient dismantling of decommissioned plants. Moreover, we are making \nefforts to ensure that the sites continue to be used for energy-related purposes. For \nexample, we built a gas-fired plant in Biblis, which will help stabilise power grid frequency \nfrom 2023, thus making a contribution to security of supply.\nRWE AG’s management system. Our management system is geared towards sustainable \ngrowth that creates value and is based on RWE’s strategic guidelines. To develop these \nguidelines, we analyse the market environment and competitiveness of our segment \nactivities, identify growth potential and weigh up the opportunities and risks involved. Which \nprojects are ultimately realised is at the discretion of the management of the Group \ncompany concerned. Larger investments are approved by the Executive Board of RWE AG.  \nIt also determines the allocation of capital, the long-term portfolio development and the \ntype of financing. \nTo operationally manage the Group’s activities, RWE AG deploys a groupwide planning  \nand controlling system, which allows for timely, detailed insights into the current and \nprospective development of the company’s assets, financial position and net earnings. \nBased on the targets set by the Executive Board and management’s expectations regarding \nthe development of the business, once a year we deliver our medium-term and long-term \nplans, in which we forecast the development of key financial indicators. The medium-term \nplan contains the budget figures for the following fiscal year and planned figures for the two \nyears thereafter. The Executive Board submits the plan to the Supervisory Board, which \nreviews and approves it. During each fiscal year, we produce internal forecasts based on the \nbudget.

In the event that the forecast figures deviate significantly from the budget figures \nduring a fiscal year, we analyse the underlying reasons and take countermeasures if \nnecessary. We also immediately notify the capital market if published forecasts need to be \nmodified.\nKey earnings indicators. Among other things, we use key earnings indicators such as \nEBITDA, EBIT and net income to manage our business; however, we adjust these indicators \nby removing special items. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation \nand amortisation. In order to improve its explanatory power in relation to the development \nof ordinary activities, we carry out adjustments: non-operating or aperiodic effects are \nremoved and presented in the non-operating result. This applies to capital gains or losses, \ntemporary effects from the fair valuation of derivatives, goodwill impairments and other \nrelevant special items. Subtracting operating depreciation and amortisation from adjusted \nEBITDA yields adjusted EBIT. Adjusted net income is another key operating indicator for us. \nWe calculate it by correcting net income to exclude the non-operating result. Instead of the \nactual tax rate, which reflects one-off effects, we apply the budgeted rates of 15 % (until \n2022) and 20 % (from 2023), which we have derived in consideration of the (expected) \ntaxable earnings in our core market and the tax rates applicable there.\nExpected minimum return on investments. We primarily use the internal rate of return (IRR) \nto evaluate the attractiveness of investment projects. We only undertake projects if – at the \ntime of the investment decision – the expected IRR stays within a defined minimum \nthreshold, which is determined using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The \nexpected minimum returns are calculated by taking the WACC plus project-specific risk \npremiums, which usually range from 100 to 300 basis points, depending on the technology \nor region.\nSafeguarding our financial strength and creditworthiness. The RWE Group’s financial \nposition is analysed using cash flows from operating activities, amongst other things. We \nalso attach special importance to the development of free cash flow, which is derived by \ndeducting capital expenditure from cash flows from operating activities and adding \nproceeds from divestments and asset disposals. Net cash / net debt is another indicator of \nRWE’s financial strength: it is calculated by deducting provisions for pensions and similar \nobligations for the dismantling of renewables assets and for nuclear waste management to \nRWE’s net financial position. Conversely, mining provisions, our 15 % stake in E.ON and \ncompensation for the German lignite exit we expect to receive from the German \ngovernment, are disregarded.\nIn managing our indebtedness, we orientate ourselves towards the leverage factor, i. e. the \nratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA in our core business. Given that we recorded negative \nnet debt, i. e. net cash, as of 31 December 2022, the leverage factor was below zero.  \nIn future, we expect net debt to trend upward, as we will partially finance our growth \ninvestments with debt capital. Over the medium term, however the leverage factor should \nnot exceed 3.0, as we wish to maintain our financial flexibility. For the period after 2025 we \nbelieve that an upper limit of 3.5 is acceptable, as the expansion of renewables will further \nenhance our financial stability.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\nStrategy\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n26"

      "text": "Solutions for a sustainable energy system. ­RWE is innovative in many ways. We are \nmotivated both by a desire to remain competitive in an ever-changing environment as well \nas a passion to be a driving force of this change. Our innovation projects are dedicated to \ndeveloping solutions that help us advance the utilisation of renewable energy, expand \nenergy storage and become involved in large-scale hydrogen production. We also want to \nplay a part in building a circular economy which puts carbon dioxide to the best ecological \nuse.\nOur 1,184 patents and patent applications, based on 233 inventions, are testimony to \nRWE’s capability for innovation, as are our range of activities in the field of research and \ndevelopment (R & D). Last year, we drove forward 188 R & D projects, with around 340 RWE \nemployees working full or part time on these endeavours. Such ventures often entail working \nwith other companies or research institutions, allowing us to benefit from their valuable \ninsights. This approach is also financially advantageous, as the costs are then shouldered by \nmany stakeholders. Last year, our R & D spending amounted to €20 million (previous year: \n€22 million). On the following pages, we present a small selection of our current innovation \nprojects. They illustrate the breadth and variety of the challenges we face in light of the \nenergy transition and demonstrate the creativity with which we are tackling them. \nGerman premiere for fully recyclable rotor blades. Wind energy is only truly renewable  \nif the wind turbines themselves are also renewable. Nowadays, they are already up to  \n90 % recyclable. The main sticking point to becoming fully recyclable are the rotor blades. \nThe significant dynamic forces they must withstand during operation make composite \nmaterials indispensable. However, these materials are difficult to dismantle and therefore \ncannot be recycled. This is due to the glass fibre–reinforced epoxy resin that becomes \ncompletely solid once hardened. We are the first company in Germany to introduce fully \nrecyclable rotor blades – namely at the new Kaskasi wind farm off the coast of Heligoland, \nwhich we completed in late 2022. Three of the wind farm’s 38 wind turbines, supplied by \nSiemens Gamesa, feature rotor blades made from a new type of resin that allows for the \ndifferent materials to be separated. Taking this approach largely preserves their properties, \nand allows for the individual materials to be reused once the rotor blade has reached the \nend of its life. We are now testing the new rotor blades under real-world conditions. If they \nprove effective, we also intend to use them in future wind farms.\nRevolutionising offshore wind with floating wind turbines. Most offshore wind farms have \none thing in common: they are located in shallow coastal waters with the turbines firmly \nanchored to the seabed. For a long time, areas with waters that exceeded 60 metres in \ndepth were off-limits to offshore wind farms due to the limitations of fixed-bottom \nfoundations. But the tide is turning – thanks to the development of floating turbines, which \nare mounted on buoyant platforms made of steel or concrete and secured to the seabed \nusing mooring systems. These units unlock the possibility of generating power in deeper, \nhitherto untapped waters. RWE has taken a leading role in developing this new market. We \nare currently involved in demonstration projects, researching the pros and cons of various \nfloating foundations. We reported on a number of these plans, e. g. the TetraSpar \nDemonstrator and DemoSATH projects, in last year’s Annual Report on page 30 et seq. Our \nTetraSpar Demonstrator, located off the coast of Norway, went online in 2021. We are \ncurrently assessing whether its behaviour under real-world conditions aligns with our \nassumptions from prior calculations and tests. \n2.2  Innovation\nAs an energy provider, we tend to be focused more on using rather than researching \nnew technologies. Nevertheless, we do still contribute to innovation in our industry – \nwhether it be by launching new projects, making funds available, creating the \nnecessary infrastructure or offering our experience as a technology-forward company. \nThis past year, we helped drive 188 research and development initiatives. \nApproximately 340 RWE employees made this happen, with many taking on these \nprojects in addition to their normal workload. They all want to do their bit to make our \nenergy supply more sustainable and – above all – climate friendly.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\nInnovation\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n27"

      "text": "Our DemoSATH project, which is being delivered in partnership with Saitec Offshore \nTechnologies, reached an important milestone in 2022: the catamaran-like floating \nplatform, which has been equipped with a 2 MW turbine, was launched into the water in the \nport of Bilbao, northern Spain. In a next step scheduled for this year, it will be attached to a \npreinstalled single-point mooring system in the Bay of Biscay. This will allow the floating \nturbine to adjust its position depending on the direction of the wind, ocean currents and \nwaves. The system has already been used to great success in oil and gas extraction. We will \nnow be using it – on a much greater scale – for offshore wind, allowing us to lay the \ngroundwork to scale up the technology even further.\nRWE sounds out potential for offshore photovoltaics. As we are already using wind \nturbines at sea, why can’t we operate offshore solar farms? Well, we believe we can! Our first \nfloating solar farm became operational in the middle of 2022. With 13,400 modules and a \ntotal capacity of 6.1 MW, it is located on a lake near our Amer power station in the \nNetherlands. Now we want to show that we can even generate solar power in more \nchallenging maritime conditions. We see significant potential, particularly for areas with high \nsolar irradiation, such as the Mediterranean Sea, as the technology offers a solution to the \ngrowing issue of land shortages. We also believe combining the technology with offshore \nwind farms will prove particularly beneficial as the surface of the sea can be used more \nefficiently for electricity generation. This will also unlock potential synergies in terms of plant \nconstruction and maintenance at sea. \nRWE has joined forces with leading technology partners through pilot projects aimed at \ndriving the commercialisation of offshore photovoltaics. We are participating in the EU-\nfunded research initiative EU-SCORES, which is testing a 3 MW offshore photovoltaic plant \nfrom the company Oceans of Energy, for example. It is located off the coast of Belgium and \nshould start producing electricity this year. We are also collaborating on a second project \nwith Dutch-Norwegian start-up SolarDuck: our partner will be commissioning a 0.5 MW pilot \nplant in the North Sea. Photovoltaics at sea call for wind- and wave-proof technology that \ncan withstand being exposed to seawater. These two pilot projects will give us valuable \npractical insights that could help us drive the commercialisation of offshore photovoltaics.\nHydrogen – an indispensable part of the energy transition. Hydrogen is an all-rounder \nwhen it comes to the energy transition. It can be produced climate-neutrally, for example \nusing electrolysis with electricity from renewable sources, and it can also be re-electrified if \nnecessary. This makes it an ideal storage medium for wind and solar power. It also acts as \nan excellent fossil fuel substitute for industrial processes that cannot be decarbonised such \nas steel or fertiliser manufacturing, for example. It is no wonder that developing the \nhydrogen economy is such a high political priority. And RWE has taken a leading role in this \nregard. Together with our partners, we are currently working on around 30 hydrogen \nprojects centred on Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. We report on our most important \nprojects at www.rwe.com/hydrogen.\nFirst steps towards large-scale hydrogen production. One of the first cross-sector \nhydrogen initiatives in Germany is GET H2. RWE, BASF, BP, Evonik, Nowega, OGE, \nThyssengas, Uniper and a host of other companies and scientific institutions are \nparticipating in the project. GET H2 spans the entire hydrogen value chain, from production \nand transport to usage. The long-term objective is to build a nationwide hydrogen \ninfrastructure in Germany. As part of the initiative, in 2020 we joined forces with partners in \nthe vicinity of our Lingen power station to launch the GET H2 Nukleus project. By 2026, \nthree electrolysers are set to be built on the site, each with a capacity of 100 MW. The aim is \nto use electrolysis technology on a larger scale to bring it to mass production and unlock \neconomies of scale. As a first step, we want to trial two electrolysis technologies under \nindustrial conditions. To make this possible, we have ordered a 10 MW pressurised alkaline \nelectrolyser from Sunfire and a 4 MW proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser from \nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\nInnovation\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n28"

      "text": "Linde. RWE will own and operate both systems. The combined pilot plant will generate  \nup to 290 kg of hydrogen per hour using green power as of mid 2023. The trial is currently \nscheduled to last three years and we will be investing approximately €30 million. The \ngovernment of Lower Saxony believes the initiative is so important, that it wants to help \nshoulder the costs.\nRWE and OGE launch large-scale hydrogen infrastructure project. During the year, we \nlaunched another initiative for driving the development of German hydrogen infrastructure \ntogether with gas grid operator OGE. The project is named H2ercules, and both partners \nhave clearly defined roles: RWE will provide the green hydrogen and OGE will deliver it to the \ncustomer. To ensure the latter, our partner will need to convert existing natural gas pipelines \nto carry hydrogen and also build new ones. The plan is to construct a network spanning \napproximately 1,500 kilometres that will connect electrolysers, storage facilities and import \nterminals in the north with industrial customers in the west and south of Germany. By the \nend of the decade, RWE plans to construct electrolysers with a total capacity of 1 GW along \nthe pipelines and import large volumes of hydrogen. We are also planning to connect no less \nthan 2 GW of hydrogen-capable gas-fired power stations to the network. RWE and OGE \nmade the infrastructure concept for H2ercules public in March 2022, with a view to \ncompleting the project as early as 2030. The fact that the initiative is something of a \nherculean task is also reflected in the required budget, which we have set at €3.5 billion. The \nconsumption centres located along the planned route will account for around two-thirds of \nGermany’s expected hydrogen demand. The first major companies, including Thyssenkrupp \nfor example, have expressed their interest in being connected to the network.\nEU-backed project in the Netherlands – RWE turns waste into hydrogen. The prospect of \na circular economy is becoming increasingly popular in Europe. A key element is recycling \nwaste – namely by turning it into raw materials for manufacturing purposes, for example. \nThis is where RWE’s Dutch project, FUREC (Fuse, Reuse, Recycle), comes in – which received \na €108 million grant from the EU Innovation Fund in early 2023. We want to turn waste into \nhydrogen that can then be used in the chemical industry or to generate power. First, we will  \nneed to develop a waste-to-hydrogen plant at the Chemelot industrial park in the Dutch \nprovince of Limburg. The plan is to process waste from the region, creating biomass pellets \nwhich are then turned into H2. The hydrogen is considered to be ‘green’ if it is made using \norganic materials, and is circular if it is recovered from plastic waste. FUREC is pioneering in \nthree areas: hydrogen production, CO2 reduction and waste management. The final \ndecision on the construction of the plant will be made in the coming year. If the project \nbecomes a reality, it could serve as a blueprint for similar projects at other RWE sites across \nEurope.\nUnderground carbon storage – an opportunity for our Pembroke gas-fired power plant. \nThe complete decarbonisation of industrial processes will most likely remain elusive in the \ncoming decades. So the question of whether Europe is able to meet its target of carbon \nneutrality by the middle of the century or not will essentially depend on how we deal with the \nCO2 that is unavoidably emitted during manufacturing processes. One option is to capture \nthe carbon dioxide and store it below ground, preventing it from entering the atmosphere,  \nin a process known as carbon capture and storage (CCS). Countries such as the UK, the \nNetherlands and Norway are either already using CCS technology or are planning its \napplication on an industrial scale. \nRWE has been exploring CCS technology for many years now and, to date, our R & D projects \nin this field have largely been focused on the Niederaussem Innovation Centre in the \nRhenish lignite-mining region. We now have another site, the Pembroke Net Zero Centre \n(PNZC), located next to the eponymous gas-fired power station in Wales. The site will be \ndedicated to a range of activities aiming to decarbonise the energy economy. In addition to \nCCS, we are also looking into the production and electrification of hydrogen and are even \nresearching floating offshore wind in the Celtic Sea. Most recently, the PNZC honed in on the \ntechnical options for separating carbon dioxide from flue gases and commissioned Fluor \nCorporation to produce a feasibility study. The results have been available since early 2023 \nand we will use them in deciding on possible retrofits to the Pembroke power plant or other \ngeneration assets.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\nInnovation\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n29"

      "text": "Carbon as a component of sustainable aviation fuel. CCS technology is used to store \ncaptured carbon dioxide in subterranean layers of rock on land or under the seabed. A \nclever alternative would be to give the CO2 a purpose, for example by combining it with \ngreen hydrogen to create chemical products (e. g. plastics) or synthetic fuels. This is known \nas carbon capture and usage (CCU). For more than ten years now, we have been developing \ntechniques that use CO2 in an ecologically meaningful way. In doing so, we collaborate with \nmanufacturing firms, universities and research institutes. \nOne of our current R & D projects is investigating the potential for deriving sustainable \naviation fuel from carbonaceous waste. In doing so, we are collaborating with BP Europa \nand the Jülich Research Centre. The first project milestone was compiling a study titled \n‘NRW-Revier-Power-to-BioJetFuel’, which focused on determining what regulatory \nframework would be necessary to operate a demonstration plant in the Rhenish region for \nderiving synthetic fuels from alternative carbon sources (e. g. sewage sludge or biomass). \nThe study also considered to what extent the resulting fuels could be further processed  \nand used for industrial applications in an existing refinery in North Rhine-Westphalia. The \nreport was finalised in May 2022 and the results are now being used to assess the feasibility \nof a concrete initiative. We are planning to take carbon dioxide from the flue gases of a \nsewage sludge incineration plant and convert it into kerosene by adding green hydrogen. \nThe hydrogen will be manufactured on site using electricity from a nearby wind farm. \nAlternatively, it could also be delivered by pipeline, in which case an offshore wind farm in the \nNorth Sea could act as a power source for the electrolysis. The proof of concept is likely to be \nfinished in the summer of 2023. If the results are promising, project development for the \nconstruction of a carbon capture demonstration plant could start as early as this year. \nHowever, this requires the necessary regulatory framework to be established which allows \nfor the application of sustainable fuels.\nHow we plan to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. According to the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it will not be possible to meet the  \nParis Agreement’s 1.5-degree warming target by simply emitting less CO2. In addition, \ncomprehensive measures must be applied to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. \nOne particularly promising project aimed at delivering these negative emissions is our \nDutch initiative, BECCUS@Amer & Eemshaven. The concept involves our Amer and \nEemshaven power stations, which are currently hard coal and biomass-fuelled, being \nconverted to run on 100 percent biomass. The fuel is deemed carbon-neutral as the gases \nemitted when burning the plants are reabsorbed as the vegetation grows back. The initiative \nhas to go one step further to achieve negative emissions. The plan is to capture the carbon \ndioxide emitted by the two plants. We could then either store it underground or use it to \nproduce chemical raw materials, which are entirely reliant on CO2. This would allow us to \nplay an integral part in helping the Netherlands to reach its climate targets. However, the \nlocal authorities will need to introduce a suitable regulatory framework offering economic \nincentives for projects such as BECCUS@Amer & Eemshaven. We remain optimistic that this \nframework can be established, allowing us to move forward with our plans.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\nInnovation\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n30"

      "text": "2.3  Business environment\nRussia’s war against Ukraine caused severe turbulence on European energy markets \nwith electricity and gas trading at extreme highs. In response, the EU and the UK \nintroduced new energy policies to become more independent of commodity imports \nfrom Russia. In doing so, the countries have moved to expedite the expansion of \nrenewables. Temporary special levies on energy producer’s revenues and relief \npackages for customers were also unveiled. Meanwhile, the US government introduced \nits Inflation Reduction Act, paving the way for a stable, attractive support framework \nfor investments in green tech.\nRegulatory environment \nEU Commission unveils REPowerEU package of measures. Since February 2022, \npolitical and economic developments on the energy markets have been dominated by \nthe war in Ukraine. Cancelled commodity deliveries from Russia have caused prices to \nsoar to record highs and led various European states to introduce measures to safeguard \nsecurity of supply. The EU also responded swiftly to the new political situation. In May, the \nEU Commission unveiled REPowerEU, a package of measures intended to establish a \nclimate-friendly European energy supply that is independent of Russia. At its core, the \npackage envisages an accelerated expansion of renewables, with an increased 45 % \nshare of primary energy consumption by 2030; the previous target had been set at 32 %. \nThe EU aims to boost wind power capacity to 510 GW and increase solar capacity to \nalmost 600 GW over the current decade. In addition, it is looking to drive the ramp-up of \nthe hydrogen economy, particularly in the transport and industrial sectors. By 2030, \nannual domestic green hydrogen production volumes in the EU should hit 10 million \nmetric tons – with imports to match. According to the Commission’s plans, Europe’s future \ngas supply will rely largely on imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from overseas. \nOnce the European heads of government had thrown their weight behind the package at \nthe end of May, the Commission began drafting the necessary legislation. The European \nParliament and the Council of Ministers have already reached a provisional agreement on \nfinancing: the EU recovery package introduced during the pandemic will be bolstered by  \nan additional €20 billion. The necessary funds will be raised through the sale of emission \nallowances from the Innovation Fund (€12 billion) and the frontloading of allowances  \n(€8 billion).\nEU wants to overhaul emissions trading. In December, the European Parliament and the \nCouncil of Ministers agreed on a reform of the European Emissions Trading System (ETS), \nwhich is due to become effective on 1 January 2024. According to the plans, the sectors \ncovered by the ETS will have to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 62 % by 2030 \ncompared to 2005. The previous target had been set at 43 %. The ambitious guideline is a \nresult of the EU’s 2021 decision to raise its climate targets. To drive decarbonisation, the EU \nwill cut the number of certificates in 2024 and 2026 by 90 million and 27 million, \nrespectively. The number of available CO2 certificates issued to the market will be reduced \nannually by 4.3 % (from 2024) and 4.4 % (from 2028). Currently, the reduction factor is \n2.2 %. In addition, each year 24 % of the surplus certificates in circulation will continue to be \nheld back until 2030 and transferred to a market stability reserve. Under previous \nlegislation, the rate was to be lowered to 12 % in 2024. The reform also provides for a \nseparate emissions trading system for the transport and construction sectors, which is \nexpected to be implemented by 2028 at the latest. \nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\nBusiness environment\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n31"

      "text": "Taxonomy criteria for gas and nuclear plants approved. In mid-2022, it was established \nthat gas-fired and nuclear power plants can be classified as sustainable subject to certain \ncriteria in accordance with the European Taxonomy Regulation. In February 2022, the  \nEU Commission signed a delegated act that established the necessary classification \nframework. The European Parliament and the Council of Ministers indirectly gave their \napproval by allowing their right to veto to expire on 11 July. The criteria, put forward by  \nthe Commission therefore entered into force on 1 January 2023. The regulations relating  \nto gas-fired power stations are relevant for RWE: these stations can be considered \nsustainable transition activities, provided they are approved by 2030. They must replace \nmore emission-intensive plants and be exclusively fired with environmentally friendly gases \nsuch as hydrogen from 2036 onwards. In addition, their CO2 emissions should not be too \nhigh. The delegated act specifies two upper limits, one of which must be complied with: \n270 g CO2 / kWh in direct greenhouse gas emissions or 550 kg CO2 / kW as the annual \naverage of direct emissions over 20 years.\nEU nations and the UK introduce extraordinary levies on electricity revenues. In light of \nthe extremely high energy prices, many European countries introduced measures to bring \nrelief for consumers and redirect producers’ excess earnings. Since then, power producers \nmust pay temporary levies on their revenues, with these levies taking effect above certain \nelectricity price thresholds. In September, the EU had specified a structural framework for \nthis purpose, stipulating that the measures be limited to generation technologies with low \nvariable costs and respectively high margins. These include e. g. run-of-river, lignite-fired \nand nuclear power stations as well as wind and solar farms. Gas-fired power plants should \nremain exempt. The EU recommended only taxing revenues above a price of €180 / MWh, \nbut also gave countries the option to set technology-specific price limits that deviate from \nthe benchmark. Off the back of Brussels’ cornerstones, many EU countries introduced \ntemporary levies on electricity producers’ revenues. The UK has since also enacted a similar \ntax. In the following section, we discuss the individual power revenue levies in our key \nmarkets Germany, the Netherlands and the UK.\nGermany enshrined the EU’s guideline into law in late 2022, providing for a 90 % redirection \nof electricity revenue above a technology-specific price level. The levy has been in force \nsince 1 December 2022 and is due to expire on 30 June 2023 – although it may be \nextended to 30 April 2024. The revenue cap results from the sum of two components: a \ntechnology-specific benchmark cost and a premium. The latter amounts to €30 / MWh, \nwhich rises for wind and solar power systems depending on the market price. The \nbenchmark costs can vary widely even for the same technology. For renewables, they are \nderived from the price guaranteed under the support framework of the Renewable Energy \nAct (EEG). Additionally, there is a floor of €100 / MWh for offshore wind farms. The \nbenchmark costs for renewables assets that do not receive support are also set at \n€100 / MWh. The figure for lignite-fired plants is €30 / MWh plus 1.236 times the price of \nCO2 emission rights. For our three most modern lignite units, this figure increases by \n€20 / MWh to account for the fact that we are decommissioning them ahead of schedule \n(see next page). The benchmark costs for nuclear energy assets are set at €40 / MWh \n(December 2022) and €90 / MWh (since 1 January 2023), respectively. The amount that is \nredirected is calculated on a monthly basis using the average prices achieved. Hedges for \nthe levy period are taken into account. Gas-fired power plants and hard coal-fired power \nstations remain exempt from these measures.\nThe Netherlands will also redirect 90 % of electricity revenue above a certain price threshold. \nAccording to current plans, the price limit will be set at €130 / MWh. Due to high fuel costs, \nbiomass plants are expected to be subject to a higher limit of €240 / MWh. Unlike in \nGermany, hard coal-fired power plants are also affected. The revenue cap for these assets \nis based on the total variable costs of an efficient power station plus a premium of \n€40 / MWh. As in Germany, the levy will be applied on a monthly basis between 1 December \n2022 to 30 June 2023 and take hedges into account.

      "text": "The UK has also introduced a special levy on electricity producers’ revenue. Since 1 January \n2023, revenue above £75 / MWh is taxed at 45 % – regardless of the technology. Realised \nprices are calculated based on an annual average that includes hedges. As in the EU, \ngas-fired power plants are exempt from the levy. The same goes for renewables, which are \nsupported via contracts for difference.\nGermany lays foundations for accelerated expansion of renewables. As soon as the \ncoalition between Germany’s Social Democrats, Greens and Free Democrats assumed \noffice at the end of 2021, they made the accelerated expansion of renewable energy a top \npriority. The government laid out its plans in the Easter Package on 6 April 2022, which \nproceeded to be enshrined in law three months later by way of various legislative \namendments. The changes stipulated that electricity production from renewables should hit \n80 % of gross electricity consumption by 2030. The previous target had been set at 65 %. \nThe total capacity of German offshore wind farms shall increase to 30 GW over the current \ndecade. A target of 70 GW is planned for 2045. The law also introduces new targets for \nonshore wind and photovoltaic capacities, which shall increase to 115 GW and 215 GW \nrespectively by 2030. By the middle of the decade, the federal government wants to achieve \nannual build-out rates for these two technologies of 10 GW and 22 GW, respectively. A new \nlegal principle that the construction and operation of renewables is a matter of significant \npublic interest which contributes to public security will help achieve this target. The \nregulation sets a new precedence for weighing up other protected interests, ensuring that \nexisting investment barriers are removed, and planning and approval processes are \naccelerated. Every state is obligated to dedicate an average of 2 % of its land for onshore \nwind. This target needs to be met by 2032. Nationwide, a total of 0.8 % of land is currently \nearmarked for wind energy. \nThe support framework for offshore wind has also been redesigned by introducing a \ntwo-track system. In addition to sites that have been pre-investigated by the Federal \nMaritime and Hydrographic Agency, wind power developers can now also bid for sites that \nhave not yet been investigated. The two tracks involve different auction criteria and \nprocedures. Pre-examined sites must satisfy qualitative criteria as well as financial bidding \nconsiderations. For sites that have not yet been investigated, all of the auction participants \nbid for support. If several zero-subsidy bids are submitted, in the next round the bidder with \nthe highest bid for the site is awarded the contract.\nThe law reform also brings relief for consumers: financial support for renewables will no \nlonger be accounted for with a levy included in the price of electricity but will instead be \nfinanced via the federal budget.\nCoal exit in the Rhenish region brought forward to 2030. In early October, we reached an \nagreement with the German government and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia to stop \ngenerating electricity using lignite in the Rhenish region in 2030. That is eight years earlier \nthan originally planned. We will receive no additional payments for doing so. The amount of \ncompensation set forth in the Coal Phaseout Act of 2020 totalling €2.6 billion will therefore \nremain unchanged. However, this figure still needs to be approved by the EU Commission. \nThe new exit plan for the Rhenish region was enshrined in law at the end of 2022. Compared \nto the former agreement, approximately 280 million metric tons of coal will remain buried in \nthe ground and will not be used for power generation. In doing so, we are making an \nimportant contribution to meeting both German and international climate protection \ntargets. At the 2015 Climate Change Conference in Paris, the global community committed \nto limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. \nOur actions to date were already consistent with this target, as officially confirmed by the \nindependent Science Based Targets initiative in late 2020. By expediting our phaseout of \nlignite-fired power generation, we are laying the foundations to operate in line with the  \nParis Climate Conference’s more ambitious target of limiting the temperature increase to \n1.5 degrees Celsius. Bringing forward the phaseout mainly affects our three most modern \nlignite-fired plants with a combined capacity of 3.1 GW, that were expected to remain \noperational until 2038. They are now due to be decommissioned on 31 March 2030. \nHowever, the German government can also request that the plants then be put on standby \nand not decommissioned until late 2033.\nIn conjunction with the agreement to expedite the phaseout of lignite, the German government \nand the state of North Rhine-Westphalia have also deferred the decommissioning of two \npower plant units, Neurath D (607 MW) and Neurath E (604 MW), originally scheduled for  \n31 December 2022. This is intended to reduce the amount of gas used in power generation \nduring the energy crisis. The two units will remain online until 31 March 2024. The government \nreserves the right to decide whether to again extend their lifetimes or to transfer the units to a \npower plant reserve.

Although we will need more staff in the short term to operate \nadditional lignite power stations during the present energy crisis, staff reductions will \naccelerate towards the end of the decade. As is already the case, a range of compensatory \nmeasures have been planned for those impacted, e. g. early retirement plans and a \nstatutory adjustment allowance. Younger employees will be offered additional training, \nallowing them to take on new roles within or outside the company.\nGerman government activates emergency gas plan. In March 2022, following the \ninvasion of Ukraine, one of the first measures taken by the German government was \nactivating the Emergency Plan for Gas, which is based on an EU regulation and has been \naround since 2019. The plan has three phases: the first was invoked on 30 March 2022, \nfollowed by the second on 23 June, which is still in force. Phase 1 (the Early Warning Level) is \nactivated when a significant drop in gas supply is possible, whereas phase 2 (Alert Level) is \ntriggered when gas supply is already disrupted. To enter the third phase (Emergency Level), \nwhich has not yet been activated, there has to be a significant drop in gas deliveries, which \nthe market is not able to withstand. The German government would then be authorised, at \nits discretion, to intervene and initiate gas rationing, if necessary.\nNew law establishes minimum fill levels for German gas storage facilities. At the end of \nApril 2022, the German Gas Storage Act entered into effect. It aims to ensure that \nenough gas is available for the winter months. The law sets minimum fill levels for German \ngas storage units: 65 % as of 1 August, 80 % as of 1 October, 90 % as of 1 November and \n40 % as of 1 February. In July, the Federal government issued a decree to raise the limits \nfor 1 October and 1 November to 85 % and 95 % respectively. Gas storage operators are \nresponsible for monitoring compliance with these requirements. If the lessees do not fill \nbooked capacities sufficiently, they are at risk of losing them. The capacities would then be \nhanded over to the entity responsible for their market zone, which ensures the right fill \nlevel. The law will expire in April 2025.\nFederal government passes LNG Acceleration Act. To diversify gas procurement and \ndrive independence of Russian natural gas, in May, Germany’s lower house passed the \nLNG Acceleration Act. By temporarily forgoing environmental impact assessments and \ncurtailing the public consultation process, the aim is to rapidly construct terminals for \nreceiving and regasifying LNG along with the necessary pipeline infrastructure. According \nto the law, actions against LNG projects no longer have a suspensive effect and the \nappeals process is limited to one instance. The operational permits for the terminals will \nexpire in 2043 at the latest. After that, the terminals are only to be used for climate-\nneutral gases such as green ammonia. \nFederal government puts coal and oil-fired plants back on the market to save gas.  \nIn July, the Substitute Power Stations Act entered into force in Germany. It provides for \nadditional coal and oil-fired power stations to be called upon to cut down on gas-fired \npower generation. The law expires at the end of March 2024. The gas replacement fleet \ncan be used on the wholesale market. It has a capacity of around 10 GW and includes \nessential hard coal-fired power stations (2.6 GW) which were due to be closed in 2022 \nand 2023 in line with the Coal Phaseout Act, as well as stations in the existing grid reserve \nwhich run on hard coal (4.3 GW) or oil (1.6 GW). The gas replacement fleet is rounded off \nby lignite-fired power plants (1.9 GW), which are currently on legally mandated security \nstandby. These include three RWE units, Niederaussem E and F as well as Neurath C, with  \na total capacity of 0.9 GW. These plants came back online in October. The necessary \nregulation was only introduced at short notice. It stipulates that the lignite units should \nstay online until 30 June 2023. If they are needed beyond that date, the government can \nextend their lifetimes. The new law also allows the government to introduce measures to \nlimit or cease gas-fired power generation in the event of emergencies, although this does \nnot apply to combined heat and power (CHP) plants. These interventions should last no \nlonger than six months.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\nBusiness environment\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n34"

      "text": "Germany extends lifetime of nuclear plants by three and a half months. To ensure \nsecurity of supply in the winter of 2022 / 2023, the government also extended the \noperational lifetimes of Germany’s three remaining active nuclear power stations. According \nto the 19th amendment to the Atomic Energy Act, which was approved by the upper and \nlower houses in November, plants may produce power until mid-April 2023. Originally, they \nwere due to be shut down at the end of 2022. The units Neckarwestheim 2 and Isar 2 as \nwell as RWE’s Emsland power station are affected. However, they do not need to be \nequipped with new fuel rods. We expect our Emsland power plant to generate around 2 TWh \nof electricity during this extension period.\nThe Netherlands suspends output limits for coal power stations. On 20 June 2022, the \nDutch government repealed a law limiting the use of hard coal for power generation. The \ndecision has yet to be formally approved by parliament. According to the law, annual \ncoal-fired CO2 emissions in the period between 2022 and 2024 were not to exceed 35 % of \nthe individual power plant’s theoretical coal-fired capacity. The operators were due to be \ncompensated accordingly. By repealing the law, the Dutch government is looking to rely on \nmore coal-fired power generation to cut down on natural gas usage. Negotiations \nconcerning the extent of compensation due to the operators for limiting power plant \ncapacity in the first half of 2022 are ongoing. \nUS government creates long-term support framework for green technologies. After \nprotracted factional negotiations, the Democratic Party in the USA passed their social \nspending and climate package. After both the Senate and the House of Representatives \nhad approved the package, President Joe Biden signed the bill into law in mid August. The \nInflation Reduction Act extends the support scheme for renewables by another ten years, \nand accordingly new plants will receive production tax credits or investment tax credits. \nMoving forward, hydrogen and battery projects will join wind power and solar systems in \nbeing eligible for support. An additional tax benefit is applied if a certain portion of the \nrequired raw materials and plant components are sourced nationally – a move that should \nstrengthen the US economy. \nNew customs requirements for importing solar modules to the USA. In June 2022, the \nUnited States introduced new sanctions on products from the Chinese region of Xinjiang. \nThis is due to the suspicion that members of the Uyghur ethnic group are being used as \nforced labour to manufacture products and mine raw materials in Xinjiang. Imports are \ntherefore subject to extensive checks upon arrival in the USA. Importers must provide \ndocumentation to prove their goods are not from Xinjiang. The region is a leading provider \nof minerals for solar cells. The photovoltaic industry has therefore been particularly affected \nby the documentation requirements. Due to the time-consuming reviews of solar module \ndeliveries, there have been considerable project delays including for RWE. In 2021 there \nwere similar delays when the USA sanctioned individual Chinese companies.\nNo US tariffs on southeast Asian solar panels for the time being. After a protracted \ninvestigation, the US Department of Commerce announced in December that numerous \nsolar module manufacturers are dodging tariffs on panels made in China. According to the \nauthorities, the companies had components which were largely produced in China \nassembled in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand or Vietnam with the aim of then exporting them \nfrom there to the USA. In future, manufacturers will need to prove that their products do not \ncontain certain Chinese components in order to avoid tariffs. The findings of the \ninvestigation are irrelevant to solar panels that have already been delivered. US President \nJoe Biden had taken an executive action to prevent duties from being imposed on solar \nmodules from the aforementioned southeast Asian countries until mid-2024. The aim of \nthis action was to reassure the market. The probe conducted by the US Department of \nCommerce had caused major uncertainty in the US solar industry and triggered a sudden \nhalt to imports of southeast Asian modules. As a result, there were additional delays for  \nRWE projects.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\nBusiness environment\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n35"

      "text": "Market environment\nWar in Ukraine dampens economic recovery in RWE’s core markets. According to current \ndata, global economic output was up by around 3 % in 2022 versus the previous year. In \nGermany, growth was reported to be around 2 %, whereas in the UK and in the Netherlands \nit was about 4 %. The start of the year saw the effects of the pandemic subside as pent-up \ndemand propelled the economy. Due to the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, however, the \neconomy soon slipped back into crisis mode. More than anything else, the limited supply of \ncommodities and the associated extreme price hikes dampened recovery. Inflationary \ntrends and supply chain bottlenecks that were already evident in 2021 intensified. In the \nUSA, recovery also slowed, with GDP rising around 2 % in the past year.\nGerman power consumption significantly lower than the previous year. Surveys carried \nout by the German Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW) indicate that \nGerman electricity consumption last year was down 3 % on 2021. The main reason for this \nwas the range of energy saving measures taken in response to soaring electricity prices. The \nmild weather also played a part. For these same reasons, consumption also declined in the \nUK (– 5 %) and the Netherlands (– 4 %). In the USA however, power consumption rose by as \nmuch as 3 %.\nWind conditions better than in 2021. Utilisation and profitability of renewables assets are \nlargely weather-dependent. This is why wind speeds are extremely important. In the year \nunder review, our production sites in Europe reported lower velocities than the long-term \naverage, while those in North America measured similar if not higher speeds. In comparison \nto 2021, wind conditions have improved at the majority of our locations. The utilisation of \nrun-of-river power stations depends on precipitation and melt water volumes. In Germany, \nwhere most of the RWE Group’s hydropower plants are located, these volumes were below \nthe long-term average and also fell short of the previous year’s figure.\nAverage RWE wind farm utilisation \nOnshore\nOffshore\n%\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\nGermany\n19\n17\n37\n35\nUnited Kingdom\n27\n27\n39\n35\nNetherlands\n28\n30\n–\n–\nPoland\n28\n27\n–\n–\nSpain\n22\n24\n–\n–\nItaly\n22\n24\n–\n–\nSweden\n30\n29\n45\n47\nUSA\n33\n32\n–\n–\nPrices for natural gas, hard coal and emission allowances hit unprecedented levels.  \nThe utilisation and earnings of our conventional power plants are heavily dependent on  \nhow electricity prices and the price of the fuel needed for electricity production (gas, coal \netc.) and emission allowances perform. Natural gas became significantly more expensive \nfrom mid-2021 onwards. Spot prices at the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) – the main \ntrading hub in Continental Europe – averaged €124 / MWh in 2022, which clearly surpassed \nthe previous year’s price (€47 / MWh). This is largely attributable to the general halt in gas \nimports via pipelines from Russia to Central Europe due to the war in Ukraine, with the \naffected countries being forced to procure significantly more expensive LNG elsewhere. \nThere was also a massive price hike on the gas futures markets due to the general \nuncertainty regarding the future supply situation in Europe. TTF forward contracts for 2023 \naveraged €114 / MWh last year. In comparison, in 2021, the 2022 TTF forward traded at \n€33 / MWh.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\nBusiness environment\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n36"

      "text": "Surge in fuel and emission allowance prices impacts cost of electricity. Due to soaring \nfuel prices, quotations on European wholesale electricity markets reached record highs. \nBase-load electricity was traded at €237 / MWh on average in 2022 on the German spot \nmarket. The benchmark figure for the year prior was €97 / MWh. In the UK and the \nNetherlands, spot prices rose from £118 to £206 / MWh and from €103 to €243 / MWh, \nrespectively. Electricity forward trading painted the following picture: the German 2023 \nbase-load forward cost €298 / MWh on average. By way of comparison, companies paid \n€89 / MWh for the 2022 forward the year prior. One-year forward prices surged from £92  \nto £265 / MWh in the UK and from €89 to €263 / MWh in the Netherlands.\nThe North American electricity market is subdivided into different regions, which are \nmanaged by independent transmission system operators. Our most important market \nregion is currently Texas, where most of our wind farms in the USA are located and where the \npower grid is operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Here, the average \nelectricity spot price averaged US$66 / MWh, compared to US$179 / MWh the year before. \nHowever, the figure for 2021 was skewed due to Winter Storm Uri, which triggered extreme \nprice spikes for a week in February. Disregarding this one week, the 2021 average price was \nUS$34 / MWh. The ERCOT futures market developed as follows: the one-year-forward \nbecame more expensive, rising from US$37 / MWh to US$57 / MWh. The higher gas prices  \nin the USA were largely attributable to the increase in LNG exports to Europe.\nImproved margins on electricity sales. In order to mitigate risks associated with earnings, \nwe sell most of our power generation forward and hedge the prices for the necessary fuel \nand emission allowances using forward transactions with a lead time of up to four years.  \nThe margins realised in 2022 were thus greatly defined by the conditions of the forward \ncontracts, which were concluded in previous years. We achieved better margins with these \nadvance sales for most of our power stations than we did in 2021. At times, margins \nrealised for short-notice spot trading were significantly up on the previous year’s level. In \naddition, volatility on the energy markets allowed us to achieve significantly higher earnings \nfrom the short-term optimisation of our power plant dispatch. \nPrices for hard coal used in power plants (steam coal) also rose notably in the year under \nreview. Deliveries to the ARA ports (ARA = Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Antwerp) including freight \nand insurance were settled for an average of US$290 / metric ton in 2022, compared to \nUS$122 / metric ton the previous year. As with gas trading, post-pandemic economic \nrecovery and the war in Ukraine were the main price drivers. The embargo on Russian coal \nimports fuelled European demand for supplies from overseas even further. In some EU \ncountries, such as Germany, prices were also pushed higher due to the fact that more coal \nwas used to generate electricity in response to the high gas prices and the reduced \navailability of French nuclear power plants. Energy markets are pricing in continued strain \nfor the foreseeable future, with forward trading prices for hard coal also increasing \nsubstantially. In the year under review, the 2023 forward (API 2 Index) was quoted at an \naverage of US$222 / metric ton. This is US$127 more than was paid for the 2022 forward \nin 2021.\nAn increasingly important price factor for fossil fuel-fired power plants is the procurement of \nCO2 emission allowances. A European Union Allowance (EUA), entitling the holder to emit \none metric ton of carbon dioxide, was traded at an average of €84 in 2022 – compared to \n€54 the year prior. This figure is based on contracts for delivery that mature in December of \nthe following year. The rising prices can largely be traced back to the EU’s decision to raise \nits emissions target for 2030, leading to a further reduction in the number of available \nemission allowances. As explained on page 31, the necessary reform to the Emissions \nTrading System was approved in late 2022 and will become effective in early 2024. Many \nmarket participants anticipated this and began stockpiling EUAs some time ago. \nFurthermore, the increased use of coal-fired power plants led to more emissions and a \ncorrespondingly higher demand for CO2 certificates.\nAfter leaving the EU, the United Kingdom introduced its own CO2 emissions trading system. \nUK Allowances (UKAs) have been traded on the secondary market since the first auction in \nMay 2021. In 2022 prices averaged £83.

      "text": "2.4  Major events\nThe energy industry has been affected by the impacts of the war in Ukraine since early \n2022. Despite the challenging environment, we have managed to hit a number of \nmilestones in our growth strategy. The acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy \nBusinesses, in particular, signified a huge step forward, making us one of the leading \nsolar power producers in the United States. We also secured our first maritime sites for \noffshore wind farms there in two auctions. We also had important breakthroughs in \nEurope. Triton Knoll and Kaskasi, two large-scale offshore wind farms, went online and \nwe reinforced our flexible generation portfolio with the acquisition of Dutch gas-fired \npower plant, Magnum. In this chapter, we present the main events that took place in \n2022 and the beginning of 2023, focusing on those which are not outlined elsewhere  \nin the review of operations.\nSignificant financial pressure from halt of coal imports from Russia. ­Russia’s invasion of \nUkraine was one of the defining moments of last year. Although RWE does not have any \nbusiness activities in Russia or Ukraine, our company is among those directly affected by the \neconomic impact of the conflict. When the war broke out at the end of February 2022, we \nhad contracts for deliveries of Russian hard coal totalling 12 million metric tons through to \n2025. The agreed prices were far below the market average observed since 2021. \nSanctions introduced by the UK and the EU caused imports to grind to a halt. We had to \ncompensate for lost volumes by making purchases from third parties at much less \nfavourable conditions to meet existing supply obligations. This resulted in a financial loss of \n€748 million for RWE. \nWhen the war broke out, our contractual gas procurement volumes from Russian producers \ntotalled 15 TWh through to the end of 2023. Here too, we limited our financial risk exposure \nby procuring alternative gas supplies to cover the entirety of the contracted volumes. It is \nnot yet possible to quantify the extent of the shortfall in deliveries.\nRWE purchases Con Edison’s renewable energy business. With the acquisition of Con \nEdison Clean Energy Businesses, we are accelerating our growth in renewables. The \ntransaction was agreed in October 2022 and became effective on 1 March 2023, once all \nregulatory approvals had been received. The acquired company had been part of US group \nCon Edison and is a leading operator and developer of renewable energy plants in the \nUnited States. The company boasts 3.1 GW of power generation capacity, around 90 % of \nwhich is from solar systems. The portfolio is complemented by a development pipeline of \nmore than 7 GW. With the addition of the Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses portfolio, \nRWE has now become the fourth-largest renewables player in the USA and the second-\nlargest in the field of photovoltaics. The purchase price was based on a valuation of  \nUS$6.8 billion. \nWe will partially finance the acquisition with equity: on 10 October, we issued a mandatory \nconvertible bond with a nominal value of €2,428 million to Qatar Holding LLC, a subsidiary \nof the Qatar Investment Authority. The 67.6 million new RWE shares resulting from the \nconversion of the bond in March 2023 represent 9.1 % of the increased capital stock.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\nMajor events\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n38"

      "text": "RWE wins rights to lease sites for two offshore wind farms in the USA. In the past \nfinancial year, we laid the foundation for our first offshore wind power projects in the USA  \nby successfully participating in two offshore lease auctions. The first auction took place in \nFebruary, when RWE secured an area in the New York Bight for US$1.1 billion together with \nNational Grid Ventures. The site is suitable for around 3 GW of generation capacity. Our \nsuccessful bid gave us the right to develop the site and participate in upcoming offtake \nauctions. If the project progresses as planned, we will be commissioning a wind farm by the \nend of this decade. \nAt the second auction, which took place in December, we purchased the right to use a  \nsite off the coast of northern California for US$158 million. The area is located near \nHumboldt Bay and could one day be home to as much as 1.6 GW of offshore capacity. The \nwater here is 700 metres deep, meaning the turbines will need to be erected on floating \nfoundations. As explained on page 27 et seq., RWE has been involved in various \ndemonstration projects dedicated to this new technology. The insights we have gained will \nnow help us choose the best foundation structure. The floating wind farm off the coast of \nCalifornia could go online in the mid 2030s, provided the necessary approvals are granted \nwithin the required timeframe.\nSuccess at Dutch offshore wind auction. We also proved successful in a tender process for \nan offshore wind site in the Netherlands. In November 2022, we won the contract for the \nHollandse Kust West VII site, where we plan to build a wind farm with a capacity in excess of \n760 MW. All turbines are expected to be online by early 2028. We will not receive state \nsupport for the undertaking. The project has been designed to allow the wind farm to be \ncombined with e-boilers, battery storage systems and / or electrolysers for producing \nhydrogen. This will allow us to tailor power generation to demand, and thus contribute to  \ngrid stability.\nWind energy joint venture launched with Northland Power. In January 2022, RWE and \nNorthland Power agreed to deliver three wind power projects together to the north of the \nisland of Juist in Germany, creating more than 1.3 GW of generation capacity. A joint \nventure, in which RWE holds a 51 % stake and our Canadian partner owns a 49 % share, will \nbe responsible for carrying out the project. In August, the companies agreed to collaborate \non the delivery of another wind farm, which will also be built north of Juist and have a \ncapacity of 225 MW. RWE was previously developing this project independently. Northland \nPower now holds a 49 % share. Two of the four joint venture projects have already been \nsuccessful at auctions. The auctions for the remaining two initiatives will take place in 2023.\nLarge-scale wind farms completed in Europe and the USA. Last year, we successfully \ncompleted a series of wind power projects, thereby increasing our pro-rata capacity from \nthis technology from 9.4 GW to 11.2 GW. We commissioned the following wind farms: \n•\t In March 2022, El Algodon Alto in Texas entered commercial operation. Altogether, the \nwind farm’s 91 turbines have a capacity of 200 MW. We invested approximately  \n€280 million in the wind farm. \n•\t One month later, we completed our Triton Knoll offshore wind farm. It is located off the \neastern coast of England and has 90 turbines with a total capacity of 857 MW, making it \none of the largest wind farms in the world. RWE holds a majority stake of 59 % in Triton \nKnoll and is also responsible for its operation. The other shares are held by the Japanese \nenergy utilities J-Power (25 %) and Kansai Electric Power (16 %). The investment volume \namounted to £2.4 billion. This figure includes expenses for the grid connection, which we \nwill sell to an independent third party to comply with regulatory requirements.\n•\t In June, the Swedish onshore wind farm Nysäter was inaugurated. The 114 turbines  \nboast a combined capacity of 474 MW. Swiss infrastructure investment firm Energy \nInfrastructure Partners is the majority shareholder with a stake of 80 % and RWE holds a \n20 % stake. In total, €575 million was invested in the wind farm.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\nMajor events\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n39"

The investment volume \namounted to €225 million.\n•\t By December, all 38 turbines of our Kaskasi wind farm in the German North Sea had been \nput online. Together, they have a combined capacity of 342 MW. Kaskasi is located  \n35 kilometres to the north of Heligoland. We are the sole owners of the wind farm and \nhave invested approximately €780 million in the project. As explained on page 27,  \nthree turbines were fitted with recyclable rotor blades from Siemens Gamesa, which \nfeature a new resin that allows the different materials to be separated after use. This is \nthe first time that these environmentally friendly rotor blades are being used in Germany.\nHickory Park in the USA starts producing solar power. In the last fiscal year, we upped our \nsolar capacities by 318 MW to 804 MW. At 196 MW, our new photovoltaic ground-mounted \nsystem, Hickory Park, in Mitchell County in the state of Georgia made a significant \ncontribution in this regard. Its approximately 650,000 modules have been operating \ncommercially since June 2022. The facility is enhanced with a 40 MW 2-hour battery \nstorage system. This enables optimal timing of feed-ins to the local grid, which increases the \nsolar farm’s yield. We have spent around €250 million on Hickory Park and have concluded \na 30-year power purchase agreement with energy provider Georgia Power.  \nRWE acquires solar developers in Poland and the UK. By acquiring two major solar \ndevelopers, we laid the cornerstone for rapid expansion of photovoltaics in both Poland and \nthe United Kingdom. First, we acquired Poland-based Alpha Solar, adding an approximately \n3 GW solar project pipeline to our portfolio. The price totalled an equivalent of €123 million. \nThe projects are located throughout Poland and are in various stages of development. In \naddition, we can welcome a team of around 60 that will help drive our ambitious expansion \nplans in Poland.\nThis was followed in early March 2023 by the acquisition of JBM Solar, a UK developer of \nsolar and battery storage projects. The company owns a mature 6.1 GW development \npipeline, with solar and battery storage accounting for 3.8 GW and 2.3 GW, respectively. The \ntransaction puts us among the top three PV developers in the United Kingdom. We also \ngained a 30-strong team of experts. Most of JBM Solar’s projects are being implemented in \ncentral and southern England. The first assets from the pipeline are scheduled to be \ncommissioned by the end of 2024. We expect to build an average of some 450 MW per \nyear thereafter.\nLarge-scale battery storage systems completed in Werne and Lingen. After only 14 months \nof construction, we were able to commission two megabattery storage facilities at our \npower plant sites in Werne and Lingen. The assets are being used to secure security of \nsupply and have capacities of 72 MW (Werne) and 45 MW (Lingen), and storage volumes of \n79 MWh and 49 MWh, respectively. We have invested around €50 million in the project.\nGreen light for the construction of megabatteries in Hamm and Neurath. In November \n2022, we decided that our power plant sites in Hamm and Neurath should also host two \nlarge-scale battery storage facilities. The batteries will have a capacity of 140 MW (Hamm) \nand 80 MW (Neurath), and storage volumes of 151 MWh and 84 MWh, respectively. We are \nlooking to start construction in 2023 and begin commercial operation in 2024. We have \nearmarked €140 million for the project.\nRWE acquires Dutch gas-fired power station, Magnum. In June 2022, we agreed to \nacquire the Magnum gas-fired power plant in the Netherlands from Vattenfall. The \ntransaction became effective on 31 January 2023 following the EU Commission’s approval \nunder competition law. Magnum is one of the most state-of-the-art power stations in the \nNetherlands. The facility has been in operation since 2013, and has a net capacity of \n1.4 GW. The preliminary purchase price is €443 million. The transaction also includes a \nneighbouring 5.6 MW solar farm. Magnum is located a stone’s throw away from our \nEemshaven power station, which is fired using hard coal and biomass. We expect to leverage \nconsiderable synergies from the joint use of local infrastructure. Our new gas-fired power \nstation can be operated with 30 % hydrogen following basic technical conversions.

At two British capacity market \nauctions held in February 2022 and 2023, all participating RWE power stations secured a \ncapacity payment. The first call for bids related to the period from 1 October 2025 to \n30 September 2026. RWE plants with a secured capacity of 6,647 MW submitted \nqualifying bids – these assets are almost exclusively gas-fired and include two small \nnew-build projects. The capacity payment was set at £30.59 / kW (plus inflation adjustment) \nand will be paid for the plants being online and contributing to the electricity supply during \nthe above period. The second auction pertained to the period from 1 October 2026 to \n30 September 2027. This time, RWE assets with a secured capacity of 6,638 MW were \nsuccessful. We will receive a payment of £63 / kW (plus inflation adjustment) for their \navailability.\nGersteinwerk wins tender for German capacity reserve. Our F and G combined cycle gas \nunits at the Gersteinwerk site in Werne (Westphalia) qualified for inclusion in the German \ncapacity reserve once again. This resulted from a tender process held by the Federal \nNetwork Agency in February 2022. The stations will keep a total capacity of 710 MW in \nreserve in the period from 1 October 2022 to 30 September 2024, which can be used to \nsafeguard grid stability whenever necessary. In return, we will receive an annual payment of \n€62.94 / kW. The two units had also been successful at the previous capacity auction. Given \nthat they are standby stations, they stopped participating in the wholesale electricity market \non 1 October 2020 and have since only been ramped up when ordered to do so by the \ntransmission system operator. \nKfW, Gasunie and RWE to build LNG terminal in Brunsbüttel. In March 2022, RWE  \nsigned a memorandum of understanding with the German state-owned development bank \nKfW and the Dutch gas network operator Gasunie to build a terminal for importing liquefied \nnatural gas (LNG) to Germany. The facility will be built to the north-west of Hamburg in \nBrunsbüttel and process gas imports of up to 10 billion cubic metres (after regasification) \nannually as of 2026. We have already contractually secured usage rights for part of the \ncapacities. We are planning to build another terminal at the same location to import \nclimate-neutral ammonia. \nOn behalf of the government RWE charters two floating LNG terminals. Acting as an \nagent of the German government, in spring 2022 we chartered two special ships equipped \nto regasify LNG. These Floating Storage and Regasification Units (FSRUs) will provide a \nquick interim solution for landing LNG in Germany. The first ship arrived in Wilhelmshaven in \nDecember 2022 and the second arrived in Brunsbüttel in January 2023. The two FSRUs \ncan deliver more than 10 billion cubic metres of natural gas annually. Uniper (Wilhelmshaven) \nand RWE (Brunsbüttel) are providing the onshore infrastructure. Together with EnBW, the \ntwo companies are also organising the LNG deliveries for the FSRUs. In February 2023,  \nthe first LNG delivery, supplied by Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), arrived in \nBrunsbüttel. In September 2022, we signed a memorandum of understanding with ADNOC \nfor the company to export LNG to Germany over several years.\nRWE secures LNG imports from the USA. To further expand our LNG procurement \nportfolio, in December, we signed a 15-year supply contract with US energy company \nSempra Infrastructure for the delivery of 2.25 million metric tons of LNG (approx. 3 billion \ncubic metres) annually. The liquefied gas will be shipped from Port Arthur in Texas, where the \nrequisite LNG terminal is still being planned. All the necessary approvals have now been \nreceived, meaning the facility should be operational by 2027. We will be free to market the \nliquefied gas, thereby aiding the diversification of European gas supply sources. The \ncontractually secured liquid gas volumes will be sufficient to harness the full potential of our \nreserved regasification capacities at the planned LNG terminal in Brunsbüttel.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\nMajor events\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n41"

      "text": "RWE and Equinor agree strategic partnership. In January 2023, RWE and Equinor \nentered into a strategic partnership to drive the ramp-up of the hydrogen economy and the \nexpansion of renewables. The two companies are working towards harnessing Norwegian \nhydrogen to decarbonise the German energy industry within the context of a number of \nmajor projects. The plan is for Equinor to create up to 2 GW of capacity for producing ‘blue’ \nhydrogen in its domestic market of Norway by 2030. Blue hydrogen is produced using \nmethane, and the resulting carbon dioxide is stored underground. The hydrogen would be \ntransported via a North Sea pipeline to Germany, where it could be used to produce power. \nOver the current decade, RWE and Equinor are therefore looking to build hydrogen-capable \ngas-fired power stations totalling 3 GW. In addition, the partners are considering building \noffshore wind farms and electrolysers near the North Sea pipeline, so green hydrogen, which \nis expected to slowly replace blue hydrogen, can be fed into the grid. The partnership with \nEquinor also includes wind power projects in Norway and Germany that are exclusively \nfocused on power generation. One basic requirement for the realisation of these major \nprojects is the completion of the hydrogen pipeline between Norway and Germany. In \naddition, Germany’s hydrogen infrastructure will have to be sufficiently developed.\nEnd of the line for Neurath A lignite-fired unit and briquetting in Frechen. On 1 April \n2022, Unit A of the Neurath lignite-fired power station stopped generating electricity. With a \nnet capacity of 294 MW, the facility began operating in 1972. It was decommissioned in \naccordance with Germany’s statutory coal phaseout timeline, which also spelled the end of \nthe road for our Frechen lignite briquette production facility at the end of 2022.

Renewable energy, gas-fired power plants, energy \nstorage, our hydrogen business and energy trading are distributed among the first four \nsegments. These activities play a key role in the energy transition and therefore make \nup our core business. The fifth segment covers power generation from coal and nuclear \nenergy, which will increasingly lose importance due to legally mandated phaseout \nroadmaps.\n \nGroup structure with five segments. This report is based on a Group structure comprising \nfive segments, the first four of which represent our core business. The responsibility for the \neconomic development of each segment lies with the individual RWE AG subsidiaries. This \npast year, we restructured our renewables activities. RWE Renewables will no longer be \nsolely responsible for these operations. Instead, they have been distributed across three \norganisational units (see below). This change will not affect our reporting structure. The \nsegments continue to be divided as follows:\n1.\tOffshore Wind: We present our business relating to offshore wind here. It is now overseen \nby RWE Offshore Wind.\n2.\tOnshore Wind / Solar: This is the segment in which we pool our onshore wind and solar \nbusiness as well as parts of our battery storage activities. Depending on the continent, it \nis managed by RWE Renewables (Europe / Australia) or RWE Renewables Americas, the \nlatter having been renamed RWE Clean Energy following the acquisition of Con Edison \nClean Energy Businesses on 1 March 2023.\n3.\tHydro / Biomass / Gas: Generation from our run-of-river, pumped storage, biomass \nand gas power stations is pooled here. The segment also includes the Dutch Amer 9 \nand Eemshaven power plants, which run on biomass and hard coal, as well as individual \nbattery storage systems. The project management and engineering consulting company \nRWE Technology International and our 37.9 % stake in Austrian energy utility KELAG are \nalso allocated to this segment. The activities are overseen by RWE Generation, which is \nalso responsible for designing and implementing our hydrogen strategy.\n4.\tSupply & Trading: Proprietary trading of energy commodities is at the core of this \nsegment. It is overseen by RWE Supply & Trading. The company also acts as an \nintermediary for pipeline and liquefied natural gas, supplies key accounts with energy, \nand undertakes a number of additional trading-related activities. Our German and Czech \ngas storage facilities also form part of this segment along with our LNG infrastructure \ndevelopment activities.\n5.\tCoal / Nuclear: This is where we report on the activities which are not part of our core \nbusiness. First and foremost, these consist of our German electricity generation from \nlignite and nuclear fuel as well as our lignite production in the Rhenish mining region to \nthe west of Cologne. This segment also covers our investments in Dutch nuclear power \nplant operator EPZ (30 %) and Germany-based URANIT (50 %), which holds a 33 % stake \nin uranium enrichment specialist Urenco. Most of the aforementioned activities and \ninvestments are overseen by RWE Power.\nGroup companies with cross-segment tasks, such as the Group holding company RWE AG, \nare stated as part of the core business under the ‘other, consolidation’ line item. This also \napplies to our stakes of 25.1 % in German transmission system operator Amprion and 15 % \nin E.ON. However, we recognise dividends from E.ON in the financial result.

Last \nyear, RWE generated 156,794 GWh of electricity, 2 % less than in 2021. The decline was \nlargely because Gundremmingen Unit C was taken offline with effect from 31 December \n2021 as part of Germany’s nuclear phaseout. This essentially halved the share of nuclear \nenergy in power generation. Utilisation of our gas-fired power stations in the UK was  \nabove the prior-year level despite high fuel costs. Conversely, in both Germany and the \nNetherlands it was lower, in part as a result of gas shortages due to the war in Ukraine. An \noutage at Dutch unit Claus C from 3 January to 19 April due to steam turbine damage also \ncame to bear. In addition, our gas-fired plant in Denizli, Türkiye was utilised less than in \n2021, inter alia due to shortages in gas deliveries from network operator BOTAS.  \nA substantial gain was posted by renewables. The commissioning of new generation \ncapacity and slightly improved wind conditions made a major contribution. Our German \nlignite-fired power plants also generated more electricity than in the previous year as they \nwere utilised more due to the gas supply crisis. In addition, we put the Niederaussem E / F \nand Neurath C units back online in October 2022 in compliance with the German Substitute \nPower Station Act (see page 34). However, we also suffered volume shortfalls caused by \npower station closures: in line with the German lignite phaseout roadmap, Neurath B \n(294 MW), Niederaussem C (295 MW) and Weisweiler E (321 MW) were decommissioned at \nthe end of December 2021.

      "text": "Higher installed capacity thanks to new wind and solar farms. As of 31 December 2022, \nwe had an installed power generation capacity of 39.3 GW. This figure does not consider \nCon Edison Clean Energy Businesses, as the acquisition of this company only closed on \n1 March 2023. Our generation capacity rose by 2.3 GW compared to 2021. The basis for \nthis was the successful implementation of our growth strategy in the renewable energy \nbusiness. Last year, we completed the Triton Knoll (857 MW) and Kaskasi (342 MW) North \nSea wind farms, the El Algodon Alto (200 MW) and Blackjack Creek (240 MW) onshore wind \nfarms in Texas as well as the Hickory Park ground-mounted PV array (196 MW) in the  \nUS state of Georgia (see pages 39 et seq.).

      "text": "65.3 million metric tons of lignite produced. We procure most of the fuel we need to \ngenerate electricity on international trading markets. By contrast, lignite is sourced from \nproprietary opencast mines. In our Rhenish mining area west of Cologne, we produced  \n65.3 million metric tons of lignite last year. This was 2.7 million metric tons more than in \n2021, owing to the increased power generation of our lignite power plants in response to \nthe gas supply crisis. We used the lion’s share, or 56.6 million metric tons, of the mined lignite \nto generate electricity. The remainder was dedicated to manufacturing refined products \n(e. g. lignite powder, hearth furnace coke and briquettes) and, to a limited extent, to \ngenerating process steam and district heat.\nElectricity and gas sales down on previous year. In fiscal 2022, we sold 193,930 GWh of \nelectricity and 39,479 GWh of gas. Most of these volumes are attributable to the company \nRWE Supply & Trading, which markets the electricity generated by our power stations \nexternally and is in charge of the key account business: the company is assigned to the \nSupply & Trading segment. We sold 4 % less of our main product, electricity, than in 2021, in \npart owing to the slight decline in generation volumes. In addition, some companies we \nsupply reduced energy consumption due to high prices. This was also the main reason why \nour gas sales were 14 % down on the year-earlier level.\nRevenue reflects substantial increase in energy prices. Our external revenue amounted to \n€38,366 million as opposed to €24,571 million in the preceding year. These figures do not \ninclude natural gas tax or electricity tax. Despite marginally lower generation volumes, \nelectricity revenue jumped by 51 % to €31,027 million. Gas revenue was more than twice as \nhigh as in 2021, totalling €4,633 million. Both of these developments can be traced back to \nprice effects.\nOne key performance indicator that is of particular interest to ESG investors is the portion of \nour revenue accounted for by coal-fired generation and other coal products. In the fiscal \nyear that just ended, this share was 17 % (previous year: 22 %). \n1   \u0007Some prior-year figures restated.\n1   \u0007Some prior-year figures restated.\nExternal revenue1\n€ million\n2022\n2021\n+ / – \nOffshore Wind\n1,401\n727\n674\nOnshore Wind / Solar\n2,232\n2,330\n– 98\nHydro / Biomass / Gas\n1,830\n1,315\n515\nSupply & Trading\n31,959\n19,296\n12,663\nOther\n–\n4\n– 4\nCore business\n37,422\n23,672\n13,750\nCoal / Nuclear\n944\n899\n45\nRWE Group (excl. natural gas tax / electricity tax)\n38,366\n24,571\n13,795\nNatural gas tax / electricity tax\n203\n235\n– 32\nRWE Group \n38,569\n24,806\n13,763\nExternal revenue by product1\n€ million\n2022\n2021\n+ / – \nElectricity revenue\n31,027\n20,521\n10,506\nof which: \nOffshore Wind\n1,377\n727\n650\nOnshore Wind / Solar\n2,165\n2,113\n52\nHydro / Biomass / Gas\n1,323\n877\n446\nSupply & Trading\n25,958\n16,540\n9,418\nCore business\n30,823\n20,257\n10,566\nCoal / Nuclear\n204\n264\n– 60\nGas revenue\n4,633\n2,142\n2,491\nOther revenue\n2,706\n1,908\n798\nRWE Group (excl. natural gas tax / electricity tax)\n38,366\n24,571\n13,795\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\nBusiness performance\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n50"

      "text": "At €6.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA clearly exceeds expectations. Our adjusted earnings \nbefore interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (adjusted EBITDA) amounted to \n€6,310 million. This is more than we had forecast. The outlook which was drawn up in \nFebruary 2022 and published on pages 67 et seq. of the 2021 Annual Report envisaged  \na range of €3.6 billion to €4.0 billion. We raised this forecast in July 2022 to between  \n€5.0 billion and €5.5 billion. This new range was, again, exceeded. The fact that we have \nperformed better than expected is primarily due to the very good trading performance, \nfavourable conditions on the electricity generation market and strong income from the \nshort-term optimisation of power plant dispatch. Adjusted EBITDA posted by our core \nbusiness amounted to €5,559 million. Our forecast in February envisaged this figure being \nbetween €2.9 billion and €3.3 billion. In the Coal / Nuclear segment, which does not form \npart of our core business, we recorded €751 million. We had forecast €650 million to  \n€750 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA at the Group level improved by 73 % over the previous year. Besides the \naforementioned factors, the substantial hit taken by the Onshore Wind / Solar segment in \n2021 came to bear: an ice storm in Texas in February 2021 resulted in unscheduled \noutages, forcing us to fulfil existing electricity supply commitments through expensive \npurchases on the market. More information on this can be found on page 43 of the  \n2021 Annual Report.\nThe following developments were observed in the segments: \n•\t Offshore Wind: At €1,412 million, adjusted EBITDA was within the forecast range of \n€1,350 million to €1,600 million. It recorded a 27 % gain compared to 2021 \n(€1,110 million), in particular driven by new generation capacity being commissioned. \nWind levels were below average at our offshore sites, but higher than in the prior year. \nAnother contributing factor was that we took a majority stake in the Rampion wind farm  \nin the UK as of 1 April 2021, which has been fully consolidated since then. \n•\t Onshore Wind / Solar: In this segment, adjusted EBITDA totalled €827 million. On the \nback of improved margins, we were slightly above the range of €650 million to  \n€800 million which we had forecast in February 2022. Compared to the previous year’s \nfigure, which was exceptionally low (€258 million) due to the ice storm in Texas, adjusted \nEBITDA more than tripled. In addition to the non-recurrence of this charge, the \ncommissioning of new generation assets, more favourable wind conditions and margin \nimprovements contributed to the positive development. A counteracting effect was felt \nfrom the fact that the year-earlier result contained book gains on the sale of majority \ninterests in the Stella, Cranell, as well as East and West Raymond wind farms in Texas. \n•\t Hydro / Biomass / Gas: Here, we registered adjusted EBITDA of €2,369 million, clearly \nexceeding the projected range of €700 million to €900 million. Due to the volatility of the \nmarket, we realised unusually high gains from the short-term optimisation of our power \nplant dispatch in the year under review. Generation margins also exceeded expectations. \nThe aforementioned factors were the main reason why adjusted EBITDA more than tripled \ncompared to 2021 (€731 million). Earnings shortfalls stemmed from the outage at the \nDutch Claus C gas-fired power plant caused by steam turbine damage. Moreover, we \nreceived lower payments from the British capacity market.  \nAdjusted EBITDA\n€ million\n2022\n2021\n + / – \nOffshore Wind\n1,412\n1,110\n302\nOnshore Wind / Solar\n827\n258\n569\nHydro / Biomass / Gas\n2,369\n731\n1,638\nSupply & Trading\n1,161\n769\n392\nOther, consolidation\n– 210\n– 107\n– 103\nCore business\n5,559\n2,761\n2,798\nCoal / Nuclear\n751\n889\n– 138\nRWE Group\n6,310\n3,650\n2,660\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\nBusiness performance\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n51"

      "text": "•\t Supply & Trading: RWE Supply & Trading posted another very good performance in \ninternational energy trading. Adjusted EBITDA recorded by this segment totalled \n€1,161 million, easily surpassing the forecast range of €150 million to €350 million.  \nThis figure also clearly exceeded the year-earlier figure (€769 million). We also achieved \nunexpectedly strong income in the gas business. Charges resulted from an impairment of \n€748 million recognised for contracts relating to hard coal purchases from Russia (see \npage 38). We had considered this effect in the non-operating result in our reporting during \nthe year. Now we recognise it in adjusted EBITDA. \n•\t Coal / Nuclear: At €751 million, adjusted EBITDA was at the upper end of our forecast, \nwhich was attributable to unexpectedly good power plant utilisation. In spite of this, we \nclosed the year down on the previous one (€889 million). This was largely due to the power \nstation closures in line with Germany’s coal and nuclear phaseouts (see page 44 of the \n2021 Annual Report). The decommissioning of the Gundremmingen C nuclear power \nplant as of 31 December 2021 weighed particularly heavily on earnings. Cost savings \nand the short-term optimisation of our power plant dispatch had a positive impact.\nAdjusted EBIT more than twice as high as a year earlier. The RWE Group’s adjusted EBIT \nadvanced by €2,383 million to €4,568 million, clearly exceeding the range of €2.0 billion to \n€2.4 billion projected in February 2022. This increase was driven by the same factors \nbenefiting adjusted EBITDA. The difference between these two key figures is that operating \ndepreciation and amortisation, which totalled €1,742 million as opposed to €1,465 million \nin the previous year, is included in adjusted EBIT, but not in adjusted EBITDA. \nAdjusted EBIT\n€ million\n2022\n2021\n+ / –\nOffshore Wind\n836\n636\n200\nOnshore Wind / Solar\n370\n– 145\n515\nHydro / Biomass / Gas\n2,005\n418\n1,587\nSupply & Trading\n1,111\n721\n390\nOther, consolidation\n– 210\n– 106\n– 104\nCore business\n4,112\n1,524\n2,588\nCoal / Nuclear\n456\n661\n– 205\nRWE Group\n4,568\n2,185\n2,383\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\nBusiness performance\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n52"

      "text": "The non-operating result, in which we recognise certain items which are not related  \nto operations or the period being reviewed, came to – €3,411 million (previous year:  \n– €437 million). Material effects were recorded with regard to the following items: \n•\t Effects on income from the valuation of derivatives totalled – €4,195 million (previous \nyear: – €503 million). Such impacts are only temporary and are primarily due to the fact \nthat, pursuant to IFRS, financial instruments used to hedge price risks are accounted for \nat fair value at the corresponding balance-sheet date, whereas the hedged underlying \ntransactions are only recognised as a profit or loss when they are realised. \n•\t In the ‘other’ line item, we reported a result of – €485 million (previous year: \n– €168 million). We took charges of €1,157 million and €239 million from additions to \nmining and restructuring provisions caused by the accelerated lignite phaseout. \nMoreover, inflation-driven cost increases led to accruals to mining and nuclear provisions. \nA positive effect was felt from the write-backs we performed on lignite power plants and \nopencast mines (€962 million) and on power stations in the Hydro / Biomass / Gas \nsegment (€952 million) reflecting the more favourable earnings prospects in the \ngeneration business.\n•\t Adjustments to the financial result totalled €1,269 million (previous year: €213 million). \nThis high figure is due to the increase in the real discount rates used to calculate our \nnuclear and mining provisions. This coincides with the associated almost complete \nrecognition in profit or loss of the reduction in the net present value of the obligations.\nIncome before tax amounted to €715 million (previous year: €1,522 million). In the year \nbeing reviewed, we recorded a tax gain of €2,277 million. This was due to write-backs on \ndeferred tax assets for which valuation allowances had previously been made. The \nallowances were made because no profits are foreseeable in Germany or the Netherlands, \nwith which we could have offset the deferred tax assets. Earnings prospects in these \ncountries have since improved again.\nAt €275 million, non-controlling interests in income were much higher than in the preceding \nyear (€111 million), above all due to a rise in income from offshore wind farms in which third \nparties hold minority interests. This mainly related to Rampion (400 MW), Humber Gateway \n(219 MW) and Triton Knoll (857 MW) in the United Kingdom. In addition, we have been fully \nconsolidating Rampion since 1 April 2021 and thus stated the share in income attributable \nto the co-owners that hold a 49.9 % stake for the full reporting period in 2022. \nThe RWE Group’s net income amounted to €2,717 million (previous year: €721 million). This \ncorresponds to earnings per share of €3.93 (previous year: €1.07) which was calculated \nbased on 691.2 million shares.

      "text": "Marked increase in capital expenditure on renewable energy. In the past fiscal year, our \ncapital spending totalled €4,484 million (previous year: €3,769 million). The funds were \nmostly used for our Offshore Wind (42 %) and Onshore Wind / Solar (41 %) segments. \nAt €3,303 million (previous year: €3,689 million), capital expenditure on property, plant and \nequipment and intangible assets was significant. Due to delays resulting from supply chain \ndisruptions, however, it was lower than planned. The single-largest expenditure item was the \nconstruction of the Kaskasi offshore wind farm (342 MW) near Heligoland, Germany, all \nturbines of which have been online since the end of 2022. Substantial funds were also \ndedicated to the Sofia wind farm (1,400 MW) in the UK North Sea, which is scheduled for \ncompletion in 2026. Further major investment recipients were wind and solar projects in the \nUSA as well as the construction of the gas-fired power plant in Biblis, which will contribute to \nstabilising the German power grid from 2023 onwards. \nWe spent €1,181 million on financial assets (previous year: €80 million). Of this sum, \n€743 million was used to make a capital contribution to our US joint venture with National \nGrid Ventures. The funds were used to pay a one-off lease fee for a site in the New York Bight \nwhere we intend to build offshore wind assets.

This means \nthat these funds were spent on activities classified as sustainable according to the EU \nTaxonomy Regulation. This percentage is based on total investments of €4,231 million.

      "text": "2.7  Financial position and net worth\nOur financial position and net worth is fundamentally solid. Despite once again \ninvesting billions in the expansion of renewables in 2022, our net debt remained below \nzero. As of the balance-sheet date, RWE posted net cash in the amount of €1.6 billion. \nWe cover most of our financing needs with earnings from our operating activities. In \naddition, we have a wide range of tools to procure debt capital. This past year, we \nmanaged to increase our debt financing headroom by upping our credit line volume \nand adding a second Commercial Paper Programme. The Group is thus much better \npositioned to provide for greater short-term liquidity coverage in the event of \nturbulence on the energy markets.\nHow we procure funds. Our ambitious growth strategy means that we require significant \nfinancial resources to be available long term. However at times, we will also require \nsubstantial liquidity at short notice, for example as collateral for commodity futures. \nRWE’s most important source of financing are our cash flows from operating activities. Debt \ncapital procurement is also an integral component and we have a range of tools at our \ndisposal to this end:\n•\t Our Debt Issuance Programme (DIP) gives us latitude in raising debt capital for the long \nterm. It allows us to issue senior bonds with a total face value of up to €10 billion. The \nmandatory convertible bond issued to Qatar Holding LLC and our two hybrid bonds are \nnot part of the programme. In late 2022 and early 2023, we issued bonds in the amount \nof €4.25 billion within the framework of our DIP. By the end of February 2023, we had \nused €6.1 billion of the programme’s headroom. We plan to bolster our DIP to ensure \nlong-term access to the necessary debt capital to fund our growth investments. \n•\t For short-term refinancing, we have two Commercial Paper Programmes, a European \nprogramme (ECP) and – since late 2022 – an American one (USCP). The ECP allows us to \nraise funds equivalent to up to €5 billion on the European money market. We largely \nexhausted this funding volume during the past fiscal year. The volume of commercial \npaper outstanding fluctuated between €2.4 billion and €3.8 billion in 2022. The USCP \nallows us to issue commercial paper to American investors with a total value of up to \nUS$3 billion. We have been utilising this programme since February 2023.\n•\t To secure our liquidity, we also have access to three syndicated credit lines totalling \n€8 billion, which are extended by a consortium of 27 international banks. We secured the \nfirst credit line in the amount of €3 billion back in April 2019. It is due to expire in April \n2026. The second has a volume of €2 billion and replaced a credit line which expired in \nApril 2022; it will also remain at our disposal until April 2026. In light of increased volatility \nin energy prices and the related rise in liquidity requirements to hedge forward contracts, \nwe secured a third credit line in March 2022, which increases our financing headroom by \nanother €3 billion. It was initially going to expire after a year, however, we exercised the \noption to extend it for six months and reserve the right to do so for a second time. At our \nrequest, the conditions of all three credit lines are linked to sustainability criteria. Among \nother things, the conditions depend on the development of the following three indicators: \nthe share of renewables in RWE’s generation portfolio, the CO2 intensity of our plants and \nthe percentage of our capex that is classified as sustainable in accordance with the EU \ntaxonomy regulation. We have set goals for all three of these criteria. If we do not achieve \nthem, we would have to pay higher interest and commitment fees. Half of the additional \nexpenses would be directed to non-profit organisations.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review  \n­of ­operations\nFinancial position and net worth\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n57"

      "text": "Operating cash flow significantly below the previous year at €2.4 billion. Cash flows \nfrom operating activities, the RWE Group’s most important source of finance, amounted to \n€2,406 million in 2022. Despite significantly improving our operating income, we fell far \nshort of the previous year’s high level (€7,274 million). This was largely due to the fact that \nwe paid more variation margins for commodity derivatives than we received, following a \nhigh positive net figure in 2021. These margins are sureties for exchange-traded futures \ncontracts pledged during the term of the contracts. We recognise the resulting change in \nliquidity in operating cash flow, which was also burdened by the fact that we purchased and \nstored gas at extremely high market prices. The cash outflow was associated with an \nincrease in working capital. Another reason for the decline in cash flow was that last year’s \nfigure contained a one-off payment of €880 million, which the government issued as \ncompensation for the German nuclear phaseout.\nInvesting activities led to a cash outflow of €9,892 million (previous year: €7,738 million). \nWe made significant investments in securities in the year under review. Added to this was \ncapital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and financial assets, which came to \n€4,484 million (see page 56). \nOur financing activities brought in a cash inflow of €8,615 million (previous year: \n€1,457 million). The significant increase is, inter alia, attributable to substantially boosted \nproceeds on the issuance of bonds. Taking the mandatory convertible bond issued to  \nQatar Holding LLC into account, the issuance volume in 2022 amounted to €5.7 billion.  \nOn balance, we also reported revenue generated from initial margins and collaterals.  \nUnlike variation margins, these sureties are reported in cash flows from financing activities. \nIn 2021, they had been associated with significant cash outflows. The redemption of \ncommercial paper and short-term bank loans in the fiscal year led to cash outflows. \nDividend payments to RWE shareholders and minority shareholders totalled €913 million, \ncompared to €730 million in the previous year.\nOn balance, the aforementioned cash flows from operating, investing and financing \nactivities increased our cash and cash equivalents by €1,163 million.\nCash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditure, plus proceeds from \ndivestments and asset disposals, results in free cash flow.

The same holds true for the assets which we attribute to them.  \nAt present, this includes our 15 % stake in E.ON and our claim for state compensation for the German lignite \nphaseout in the amount of €2.6 billion.\n€1,630 million in net cash. On the balance-sheet date, the net cash (+) / net debt (–) item \nwas once again positive. At €1,630 million it was in fact higher than last year (€360 million). \nThis rise was largely attributable to the issuance of a mandatory convertible bond to  \nQatar Holding LLC, which caused equity to rise in accordance with IFRS, despite the fact \nthat it had not yet been converted into RWE shares at the balance-sheet date. In addition, \nprovisions declined, particularly for pensions and similar obligations. This was due to the fact \nthat the discount rates we use to calculate the present value of obligations increased as a \nresult of market developments. The interest rates used to calculate pension provisions \namounted to 4.2 % for Germany and 4.9 % for the UK, compared to 1.1 % and 1.8 % last \nyear. A market-induced decrease in the plan assets we use to cover major portions of our \npension obligations triggered an increase in provisions. Conversely, negative free cash flow \nand the dividend payments to RWE shareholders weighed on net financial assets.\nLeverage factor below zero. One of our key management parameters is the ratio of net \ndebt to the adjusted EBITDA of the core business, also referred to as the leverage factor.  \nWe set the upper limit for the leverage factor at 3.0 in order to secure our financial flexibility. \nOn the balance-sheet date, this indicator was below zero. However, it should increase in the \nmedium term, above all due to growth investments in our green core business, which we will \nalso finance using debt capital.\nSignificantly reduced off-balance-sheet obligations from fuel purchases. Net debt does \nnot include our off-balance-sheet obligations, which largely stem from long-term purchase \nagreements for commodities. As of the balance-sheet date, our payment obligations from \nmaterial fuel procurement contracts amounted to €4.5 billion (previous year: €22.3 billion). \nIn relation to electricity procurement, they amounted to €7.2 billion (previous year: \n€7.1 billion). The figures are based on assumptions regarding the prospective development \nof commodity prices. Our contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant \nand equipment remained largely constant at €5.7 billion versus last year.

In this regard, the regulations pursuant to German commercial \nlaw are different than the IFRS rules for the consolidated financial statements. When the \nbond is converted in March 2023, equity will grow by €2.4 billion.\nFinancial position. RWE AG has a solid economic position with high levels of cash and  \ncash equivalents and a number of financing tools at its disposal that it can use flexibly. \nAccordingly, our long-term credit ratings from Moody’s (Baa2) and Fitch (BBB+) are \nclassified as ‘investment grade’. Last year, both these rating agencies reaffirmed their \npositive assessments. You can find detailed information on RWE’s financial situation on \npages 57 et seqq. \nEarnings position. RWE AG’s earnings position improved compared to 2021. The main \nitems on the income statement developed as follows:\n•\t Income from financial assets rose by €824 million to €1,202 million. The main \ncontributing factor here was the write-back recognised in relation to the stake in RWE \nPower, due to more favourable earnings prospects in the generation business. Financial \nburdens from profit- and loss-pooling agreements with subsidiaries also came to bear, \nhowever. For example, RWE AG absorbed a considerable loss from RWE Power, which had \nto significantly adjust its mining provisions upwards due to the decision to expedite the \nlignite phaseout to 2030 and inflationary cost rises. Only last year, RWE Power had \ntransferred a profit. Our subsidiary RWE Nuclear also closed the financial year at a loss, \ndespite posting a positive result in 2021 due to the compensation paid for the nuclear \nphaseout. By contrast, RWE Generation’s profit transfer increased substantially. This was \ndue to write-backs recognised in relation to stakes in Dutch and British generation \ncompanies.\n•\t Net interest decreased by €1,121 million to – €803 million. This was in part due to a \ndecline in capital gains from the management of plan assets used to cover our pension \nobligations.\n•\t The ‘other income and expenses’ line item improved by €686 million to €818 million. In \nthe year under review – as in 2021 – we recognised write-backs for financial accounts \nreceivable from a Dutch subsidiary. This reversed impairments in previous years.\n•\t The presented earnings figures and tax income of €118 million (previous year: \n€280 million) led to a net profit of €1,335 million. Compared to 2021, we were therefore \nable to achieve an increase of €227 million.\n•\t The distributable profit of €670 million corresponds to the proposed dividend payment of \n€0.90 per share to our shareholders. The new shares resulting from the conversion of the \nmandatory convertible bond issued to Qatar Holding LLC on 10 October 2022 are taken \ninto account here.\nOutlook for 2023. RWE AG’s earnings largely depend on the business performance of its \nsubsidiaries. Our current assessment for 2023 makes us confident that net profit will \nprovide the necessary headroom for the intended dividend of €1.00 per share.

As things stand, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA of €5.8 billion to €6.4 billion.  \nFor our core business, we expect a figure between €4.8 billion and €5.4 billion. The \nacquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses on 1 March 2023 and the \ncommissioning of new generation capacities will have a positive impact on earnings. \nWe also expect the utilisation of our wind farms to improve due to better weather \nconditions. Conversely, our energy trading income and earnings from the short-term \noptimisation of our power plant dispatch are likely to fall well below the high levels seen \nin 2022. Moreover, the revenue cap may lead to tangible earnings shortfalls.\nGloomy economic prospects in RWE’s core markets. The war in Ukraine and high inflation \nwill continue to weigh heavily on the global economy in 2023. The German Council of \nEconomic Experts expects global growth to be around 2 % (source: Annual Report \n2022 / 2023). For the eurozone, it puts this figure at 0.3 %. The outlook for Germany is even \nmore subdued: the Council expects the gross domestic product of the largest economy in \nthe currency union to drop by 0.2 %. High energy prices are expected to play a part in limiting \ngrowth. According to estimates from the Council, the Netherlands should scrape by with a \nmoderate increase of 0.6 %, whereas economic output in our most important non-EU \nmarket, the UK, is likely to stagnate. For the USA, the experts project growth of 0.4 %.\nDecreased power consumption on the cards. Our projections for power consumption \nduring the current year are based on the above economic outlook.

In light of these factors, electricity \ndemand in Germany, the Netherlands, the UK and the USA should be 1 % to 4 % lower than \nin 2022. \nAdjusted EBITDA in 2023: range of €5.8 billion to €6.4 billion expected. We are confident \nthat we will be able to pick up where we left off last year in terms of our earnings position. \nThe Group’s adjusted EBITDA in 2023 is expected to range between €5,800 million to \n€6,400 million (previous year: €6,310 million). For our core business, we forecast a figure \nbetween €4,800 million and €5,400 million (previous year: €5,559 million). The acquisition \nof Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses on 1 March 2023 and the commissioning of new \nwind and solar farms will have a positive impact on earnings. We also assume wind \nconditions will return to normal levels, which would be associated with better utilisation of \nour wind farms versus 2022. Conversely, income from the short-term optimisation of our \npower plant dispatch and from energy trading will likely fail to meet the high level achieved \nlast year. Furthermore, we expect the European revenue cap to weigh heavily on earnings. \nOutside our core business in our Coal / Nuclear segment, adjusted EBITDA will likely improve \ndue to better margins.\n2.9  Outlook\nForecast\n€ million\n2022 actual\nOutlook for 2023\nAdjusted EBITDA\n6,310\n5,800 – 6,400\nof which:\nCore business\n5,559\n4,800 – 5,400\nof which:\nOffshore Wind\n1,412\n1,400 – 1,800\nOnshore Wind / Solar\n827\n1,100 – 1,500\nHydro / Biomass / Gas\n2,369\n1,750 – 2,150\nSupply & Trading\n1,161\n300 – 600\nCoal / Nuclear\n751\n800 – 1,200\nAdjusted EBIT\n4,568\n3,600 – 4,200\nAdjusted net income\n3,232\n2,200 – 2,700\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review  \n­of ­operations\nOutlook\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n63"

We expect adjusted net income to be between €2,200 million to \n€2,700 million (previous year: €3,232 million). \nOur outlook broken down by segment is as follows:\n•\t Offshore Wind: Adjusted EBITDA in this business is expected to total between \n€1,400 million and €1,800 million (previous year: €1,412 million). The first full year of \noperation of our Triton Knoll and Kaskasi wind farms will have a positive impact on \nearnings. We also expect both better asset utilisation due to improved weather conditions \nas well as higher realised electricity prices. This is juxtaposed by national electricity \nrevenue caps and rising costs for the development of growth projects.\n•\t Onshore Wind / Solar: Adjusted EBITDA in this segment is forecast at €1,100 million to \n€1,500 million. This would see us closing 2023 significantly above the previous year \n(€827 million), mainly driven by the additional earnings from Con Edison Clean Energy \nBusinesses which has been fully consolidated since 1 March 2023. New-build facilities will \nalso help boost EBITDA. In a similar vein to our Offshore Wind segment, we expect \nimproved weather conditions and higher realised electricity prices, but also counteractive \neffects from national revenue caps and rising expenditure for project development.\n•\t Hydro / Biomass / Gas: Here, adjusted EBITDA will most likely not match last year’s high \nlevel (€2,369 million). We project a figure in the €1,750 million to €2,150 million range. \nRealised electricity prices and income from the short-term optimisation of our power \nplant dispatch is expected to be lower than the high levels seen in 2022. We expect that \nthe commissioning of our grid stabilisation plant in Biblis and the addition of Magnum, the \nDutch gas-fired power plant we acquired on 1 February 2023, will have a positive impact.\n•\t Supply & Trading: Assuming business develops normally, adjusted EBITDA in this segment \nshould range between €300 million and €600 million. In this case, it would fall clearly \nbelow the exceptional level registered in 2022 (€1,161 million). \n•\t Coal / Nuclear: Here, adjusted EBITDA will likely rise to between €800 million and \n€1,200 million (previous year: €751 million), despite the shutdown of our Emsland nuclear \nplant planned for April 2023. Higher margins from lignite-based power generation will be \nthe deciding factor here.\nCapital expenditure on property, plant and equipment markedly up on last year. \nIn comparison to 2022 (€3,303 million), we plan on substantially increasing our property, \nplant and equipment and intangible asset investments. We will focus our other investments \non wind and solar power projects as well as batteries in the USA and Europe. Considerable \nfunds will be allocated to building the Sofia offshore wind farm in the British North Sea. In \naddition to property, plant and equipment investments, we will be investing significant sums \nin financial assets, not least due to the acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses.\nLeverage factor to stay below upper limit of 3.0. As explained on page 59, we reported \nnegative net debt as at 31 December 2022. The ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA for \nour core business (leverage factor) was therefore below zero. However, it will probably rise in \nthe long run as we plan to partially finance our growth investments by raising debt capital. \nThe completion of our acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses, in particular, will \nhave a debt-increasing effect. At the same time, we remain confident that at the end of the \ncurrent year the leverage factor will stay well below 3.0, which is the upper limit we set for it.\nDividend for fiscal 2023.

They also take sustainability \nmatters into consideration. To ensure our financial reporting is accurate and reliable, we use \nan accounting-related internal control system (see pages 73 et seq.) and also rely on a \ncompliance management system (CMS), designed to ensure compliance with the \nregulations and standards applicable to RWE (see page 74).\nInternal Audit regularly verifies the quality and functionality of our controlling and risk \nmanagement system. Such assessments were also carried out in 2022 and gave no cause \nto doubt the appropriateness and effectiveness of our controlling and risk management \nsystem. The Executive Board of RWE AG confirmed the Group’s risk bearing capacity by way \nof a resolution dated 23 November 2022.\nDistribution of risk management tasks. Responsibility for risk and opportunity \nmanagement within the Group lies with the parent company RWE AG. Its Executive Board \nmonitors and manages the Group’s overall risk. In addition, it determines the general risk \nappetite of RWE and defines upper limits for single risk positions. At the level below the \nExecutive Board, the Controlling & Risk Management Department has the task of applying \nand constantly refining the risk management system. It derives detailed limits for the \nindividual business fields and operating units from the risk caps set by the Executive Board. \nIts tasks also include checking that the risks have been identified in full and are plausible \nbefore aggregating them. In so doing, it receives support from the Risk Management \nCommittee, which is composed of the heads of the following five RWE AG departments:  \n(1) Controlling & Risk Management (Chair), (2) Finance & Credit Risk, (3) Accounting,  \n(4) Legal, Compliance & Insurance, and (5) Strategy & Sustainability.

      "text": "In this section, we provide commentary on the main risks and opportunities we have \nidentified for 2023 and the following two years. We will also explain what measures have \nbeen taken to counter the threat of negative developments.\n•\t Market risks. In most of the countries in which we are active, the energy sector is \ncharacterised by the free formation of prices. This presents both opportunities and risks. \nPrices quoted on our key European electricity forward markets reached new heights in \n2022 and are still inflated. The situation is likely to remain tense for some time, \nparticularly due to the continued absence of Russian fuel imports. We have therefore \nupped our planning estimates related to future electricity quotations. The risk of suffering \na setback should prices drop has thus become greater. We therefore classify our market \nrisks as ‘high’.  \nShould power prices decline, we may be forced to recognise impairments on plants and \nmines. In fiscal 2022, €1.9 billion in write-backs were applied to these activities, due to \nimproved market conditions. If price developments are unfavourable, we will revise the \nbook value downward. \nWe assess the price risks to which we are exposed on the procurement and supply \nmarkets taking account of current forward prices and expected volatility. For our power \nplants and parts of our renewable energy portfolio, we limit the earnings risks by selling a \nsignificant portion of the electricity forward. We secure the prices of fuel and CO2 emission \nallowances needed to produce power when we sell the electricity. This makes it easier for \nus to plan future margins. \nHowever, by selling electricity forward, we run the risk of having to make expensive \npurchases on the market to fulfil supply commitments in the event of production outages \nor missing fuel deliveries. In addition, as seen with the recent price hikes, collateralising \nforward contracts can lead to significant temporary cash outflows. We address this risk \nwhen deciding how much power to sell forward.  \nRWE Supply & Trading plays a central role when it comes to managing commodity price \nrisks. It functions as the Group’s interface to the global wholesale markets for electricity \nand energy commodities. RWE Supply & Trading markets large portions of our electricity \noutput on behalf of our power generation companies and purchases the necessary fuel \nand CO2 certificates. In compliance with risk thresholds, the company also takes \ncommodity positions to achieve a profit.\nOur risk management system for energy trading is aligned with the best practice \nstandards as applied to the trading businesses of banks. As part of this, we only conclude \ntransactions if the associated risks are within approved limits. There are guidelines \ngoverning the treatment of commodity price risks and associated credit risks. Our \ncommodity positions are constantly monitored. Risks associated with trades conducted \nby RWE Supply & Trading for its own account are monitored daily. \nThe Value at Risk (VaR) is of central importance for risk measurement in trading. It \nspecifies the maximum loss from a risk position not exceeded with a given probability  \nover a certain planning horizon. In the Group we generally base our VaR figures on a \nconfidence interval of 95 % – with a holding period of one day. This means that, with a \nprobability of 95 %, the daily loss will not exceed the VaR. The VaR for the price risks of \ncommodity positions in the trading business must adhere to a €60 million ceiling. In the \nyear under review, we periodically raised this limit to €80 million. The actual daily figures \nwere usually significantly lower. They averaged at €36 million. \nIn addition, limits derived from the aforementioned VaR thresholds have been set for each \nindividual trading desk. Furthermore, we develop extreme scenarios and factor them into \nstress tests, determine their consequences for earnings and take countermeasures if we \ndeem the risks to be too high.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n68\n2\nCombined review ­ \nof ­operations\nDevelopment of risks  \nand opportunities"

      "text": "The management of our gas portfolio and LNG business is pooled in a dedicated \norganisational unit at RWE Supply & Trading. These activities are also subject to a daily \ncap, which is set at €40 million. We also temporarily raised this upper limit to €65 million. \nThe actual average VaR for the year under review was €38 million.\nWe also use financial instruments to hedge our commodity positions. In the consolidated \nfinancial statements, these instruments are, inter alia, presented through the statement \nof on-balance-sheet hedges. The same applies to financial instruments serving the \npurpose of limiting interest rate and currency risks. More detailed information on this  \ncan be found on pages 136 and 187 et seqq. in the Notes.\n•\t Regulatory and political risks. Most countries in which we are active have set their sights \non ambitious climate protection goals. Having designed our business model around the \nenergy transition, our company is now able to leverage a range of opportunities for \ngrowth. We want to swiftly cut our CO2 emissions whilst contributing to security of supply. \nThis strategy offers more assurance that regulatory interventions to improve climate \nprotection will not have a disruptive impact on our business.  \nDespite the growing proportion of carbon-free or low-carbon technologies in our \ngeneration business, it continues to be affected by substantial regulatory and political \nrisks. In the past year in particular, there were massive state interventions in the energy \nsector. One example of this is the electricity revenue cap in the EU and the UK, which we \nreport on in more detail on page 32. In light of the high energy and commodity prices \nresulting from the Ukraine crisis, governments imposed temporary limits on revenues \nachieved by electricity producers exceeding a certain price level. In the short term, we  \nsee the risk of the revenue caps being lowered or prolonged, while in the long term, we see \nthe risk of a fundamental change in the electricity market’s design leaning towards an \nenergy industry with more state regulation in which revenue is set, e. g. by revenue caps or \ncontracts for difference. Proponents of such measures are increasing in number in the \npolitical sphere. If these measures were implemented, they could significantly reduce \nearnings in the entire generation business. \nSupport programmes for renewables and hydrogen projects are also difficult to forecast. \nAmendments could make investments less attractive, causing us to abandon them, and \nthere is also the risk that subsidies might retrospectively be cut. We do, however, also see \nthe possibility of European governments creating a more favourable framework for \ninvestments in green technologies, in a similar vein to the Inflation Reduction Act in the \nUSA. In the dialogue we maintain with policymakers, we point out that companies looking \nto invest in building climate-friendly energy infrastructure need attractive and reliable \nframework conditions. Discretionary interventions to the detriment of investors could \ncontribute to governments missing their emissions reduction targets.  \nState-imposed restrictions on cross-border trade could also significantly hinder plans to \nbuild a green energy infrastructure. We see an elevated risk of this being the case in the \nUSA. As explained on page 35, solar module imports from Asia are now subject to \nstringent checks, causing considerable delays for solar projects. If the USA continues  \nto impede the procurement of solar panels, then it is possible that our photovoltaic \nexpansion initiatives could fall behind schedule. \nBy contrast, the risk exposure of our lignite business has declined somewhat. Germany’s \ngoverning parties had declared in their coalition agreement at the end of 2021 that \nGermany should ideally stop producing electricity from coal as early as 2030, eight years \nbefore the exit date established in the German Coal Phaseout Act. We had feared \nsignificant financial losses due to this plan. As explained on pages 33 et seq., in October \n2022 we were able to reach an agreement with policymakers on the future of our  \nlignite business in the Rhenish region. It was decided that RWE would prematurely shut \ndown its last plants by 2030, but would operate more units in the interim than originally \nlegislatively envisaged, to avoid supply shortages. The negotiated conditions are \nacceptable to us. Furthermore, we now have a reliable basis for planning. Although the exit \ndate has been brought forward, the compensation that we are legally entitled to for the \nlignite phaseout will remain at €2.6 billion. The European Commission is yet to grant \nantitrust approval, but we remain confident that Brussels will give the green light.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n69\n2\nCombined review ­ \nof ­operations\nDevelopment of risks  \nand opportunities"

      "text": "In energy trading, there is risk of stricter regulatory requirements that limit the scope for \ntransactions or give rise to additional costs. The recently high commodity prices and the \nassociated rise in regulatory action have given weight to this risk.  \nDismantling decommissioned power stations is also associated with regulatory risks, \nparticularly in relation to nuclear energy. There is a risk here that stricter legal or \nregulatory requirements will lead to unexpectedly high expenditure. However, we also see \nthe potential to make better progress than expected and to achieve cost savings. \nEven in the present regulatory environment, we are exposed to risks associated with, for \ninstance, approvals for constructing and operating production facilities. This particularly \naffects our opencast mines, power stations and wind farms. The danger here is that \napprovals are granted late or not at all and that granted approvals are withdrawn \ntemporarily or for good. Furthermore, delays in the transfer of land that has been \nassigned to us for lignite mining are also possible.\n•\t Legal risks. Individual RWE Group companies are involved in litigation and arbitration \nproceedings due to their operations or M & A transactions. Out-of-court claims have been \nfiled against some of them. Furthermore, Group companies are directly involved in various \nprocedures with public authorities or are at least affected by their outcomes. To the extent \nnecessary, we have accrued provisions for possible losses resulting from pending \nproceedings before ordinary courts and arbitration courts.  \nRisks may also result from exemptions and warranties that we granted in connection with \nthe sale of assets. Exemptions ensure that the seller covers the risks that are identified \nwithin the scope of due diligence, the probability of occurrence of which is, however, \nuncertain. In contrast, warranties cover risks that are unknown at the time of sale. These \nhedging instruments are standard practice in sales of companies and equity holdings.  \nWe currently have low exposure to legal risks. This assessment did not change compared \nto the previous year.\n•\t Operational risks. ­RWE operates technologically complex, interconnected generation \nassets. Despite all the precautions taken, damage and outages cannot be entirely \nexcluded. If generation capacity is subject to unplanned downtime, this can result in \nsignificant earnings losses given the current elevated prices. Conversely, there is also \npotential for additional earnings, if plant availability is better than expected. To mitigate \nrisks, we ensure that our power supply commitments are not too high, as we may be \nforced to buy electricity at a high cost to meet these obligations in the event of production \noutages. Furthermore, we also regularly maintain our facilities and take out insurance \npolicies if economically viable. \nUtilisation of our wind and solar farms primarily depends on weather conditions. Longer \nperiods of low wind, cloud coverage or darkness coinciding with high energy prices can \ncause generation volumes and revenue in individual years to remain significantly below \nestimates. We minimise the impact of weather conditions on Group earnings by dispersing \nour green assets geographically. This helps us to at least partially compensate for less \nfavourable meteorological conditions at one location with more favourable weather at \nanother.\nWhen production facilities are built and modernised, delays and cost increases can occur, \nfor example due to logistical bottlenecks or inadequate services provided by suppliers. In \nrecent years, the coronavirus pandemic and international trade conflicts have proven  \nto be risk factors. Project delays can trigger additional spending and even have a negative \nimpact on the level of support received in relation to renewables assets. With the help of \ncircumspect planning and diligent project management, we do everything within our \npower to deliver projects within the expected time frames. \nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n70\n2\nCombined review  \n­of ­operations\nDevelopment of risks  \nand opportunities"

      "text": "Operational risks due to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be a factor, albeit to a \nsignificantly lesser extent. A new wave of infections would be associated with potential \ndelays in deliveries from suppliers. It is also conceivable that the reliable operation of our \nplants may be jeopardised if a large number of employees goes on sick leave. Thanks to \ncomprehensive preventive measures and forward-looking emergency plans, we were \nable to keep all major operational processes up and running during the peaks of the \npandemic. We are confident of being able to accomplish this in the future if necessary. \nRWE has ambitious growth targets and has increased its investment budgets significantly. \nWe take care to ensure that our new-build projects and acquisitions satisfy our return \nrequirements. It is difficult to project the actual income our projects will generate. If events \nunfold unfavourably, new-build initiatives could retrospectively turn out to be unprofitable \nand prices paid for acquisitions could prove to have been too high. We prepare our \ninvestment decisions by conducting extensive analyses to try and map the financial and \nstrategic effects as realistically as possible before taking investment decisions.

Interest rates, foreign exchange rates, securities prices and rates of \ninflation are subject to fluctuations, which can be difficult to predict and can have a major \nimpact on our net worth and earnings.  \nChanges in interest rates give rise to risks and opportunities in several respects. Market \ninterest rates, for example, can impact our provisions, as they are the point of reference \nfor the discount rates used for determining the net present values of obligations. This \nmeans that, all other things being equal, provisions decrease when market interest rates \nrise and increase when market interest rates fall. On pages 174 et seqq. of the Notes, we \npresent the effects of changes in interest rates on the net present values of our pension \nobligations and on nuclear and mining provisions. \nFinancing costs rise and fall in line with interest rates. We measure the possible impact \nusing the Cash Flow at Risk (CFaR), applying a confidence level of 95 % and a holding \nperiod of one year. The average CFaR at RWE AG in 2022 was €61 million.  \nRises in market interest rates can lead to reductions in the prices of the securities we hold \nand vice versa. This primarily relates to fixed-interest bonds. We measure the risk of such \nprice fluctuations using a sensitivity analysis. As of the balance-sheet date, an increase in \nmarket interest rates of 100 basis points would have lowered the value of the bonds on \nour books by €36 million. \nWe are also exposed to price risks in relation to our 15 % stake in E.ON, which had a fair \nvalue of €3.7 billion at the end of 2022.  \nSecurity price fluctuations not only have an impact on RWE’s financial assets but also on \npension funds. In the case of unfavourable capital market developments, we might have \nto significantly increase our pension provisions in order to compensate for our fund assets \npotentially losing value.  \nWe control risks and opportunities from changes in the price of securities with a \nprofessional fund management system. Range of action, responsibilities and controls are \nset out in internal guidelines which the Group companies are obliged to adhere to when \nconcluding financial transactions. All financial transactions are recorded using special \nsoftware and are monitored by RWE AG. \nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n71\n2\nCombined review ­ \nof ­operations\nDevelopment of risks  \nand opportunities"

      "text": "Foreign exchange risks are overseen centrally by RWE AG. We aggregate foreign currency \npayments made and received across all Group companies to net financial positions for \neach currency and hedge the latter almost in full using currency derivatives. \nPricing changes can also give rise to risks. High inflation and rapidly rising wages can \ntrigger an unplanned increase in operational costs. Where applicable, we then have to up \nour provisions for future obligations. We are particularly exposed to rises in sectors from \nwhich we source products and services for nuclear waste disposal and recultivating \nopencast mine areas. \nCash collateral pledged for forward transactions also harbours a risk. The amount of the \npayments depends on the extent to which the contractually agreed prices deviate from \nmarket quotations as of the respective cut-off date. Substantial differences may weigh \nheavily on our liquidity. The wholesale price hikes on commodity markets in 2021 and \nparticularly 2022, forced us to periodically pledge unusually high collateral for forward \nsales. Thanks to our robust financial position and use of financing instruments at our \ndisposal, we were always able to provide the required funds. Another positive was that we \nalso received significant collateral due to the rising commodity prices, in particular for \nforward transactions for fuel and CO2 emission allowances. \nThe conditions at which we finance our debt capital are in part dependent on the credit \nratings we receive from independent rating agencies. Moody’s and Fitch classify our \ncreditworthiness in the investment grade category. If our rating deteriorates, we may incur \nadditional costs if we have to raise debt capital. This would probably also increase the \nliquidity requirement when pledging collateral for forward transactions. However, we \nbelieve that such a scenario is unlikely. Just last year, Moody’s and Fitch confirmed our \ncredit score. They appreciate our solid financial position and RWE’s transformation into  \na leading renewable energy company. \nThe assessment of our creditworthiness by rating agencies, banks and capital investors \ndepends in part on the level of our net debt. We have set ourselves a net debt cap for this \npurpose, which amounts to three times the adjusted EBITDA of our core business. We are \noptimistic that we will be able to adhere to this limit, but we cannot rule out the possibility \nthat we may temporarily exceed it, for example if significant collateral is needed for \ncommodity forward contracts.  \nDespite the significant increase in volatility on commodity markets, we continue to classify \nour financial risks as ‘medium’.\n•\t Creditworthiness of business partners. Our business relations with key accounts, \nsuppliers, trading partners and financial institutions expose us to credit risks. Therefore,  \nwe track the creditworthiness of our partners closely and assess their credit standing based \non internal and external ratings, both before and during the business relationship. We \ndetermine credit limits prior to concluding transactions above a certain size and all trading \ntransactions. These are adjusted if necessary, for instance in the event of a change in the \nbusiness partner’s creditworthiness. At times, we request cash collateral or bank \nguarantees. \nIn the trading and financing business, credit risks and the utilisation of the limits are \nmeasured daily. We agree on collateral when concluding most over-the-counter trading \ntransactions. Furthermore, we enter into framework agreements, e. g. those of the \nEuropean Federation of Energy Traders. For financial derivatives, we make use of the \nGerman Master Agreement for forward financial transactions or the Master Agreement \nof the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. \nThe significant price spikes on commodity markets have increased the danger of \ntransaction partners being unable to meet their obligations. Tangible financial losses from \ncontracts that are particularly valuable to us could be the consequence. We are \nmonitoring the default risks closely and are assessing counterbalancing measures.  \nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n72\n2\nCombined review ­ \nof ­operations\nDevelopment of risks  \nand opportunities"

Here, we record the potential effects of damage to our reputation, \ncompliance infringements and criminal acts. We continue to classify other risks as ‘low’.\nRWE’s risks and opportunities – general assessment by management. RWE is presented \nwith a number of risks and opportunities that can have a material impact on our economic \nsituation. Our company’s risk exposure has not changed fundamentally compared to our \nassessment of March 2022. There are currently no foreseeable developments that would \nundermine the viability of RWE AG or the RWE Group.\nRecently, our core markets witnessed significant political interventions that weighed on  \nthe investment climate. One example is the introduction of revenue caps on electricity \nproduction in Europe. It cannot be ruled out that the revenue cap may be lowered and / or \nprolonged. It is conceivable that this may be the start of more extensive price regulation in \nthe electricity sector. We believe that this currently represents a significant risk. However, \nthere were also positive developments. In the USA, the government introduced the Inflation \nReduction Act, creating a reliable framework for green technology investments. The \nagreement we reached with the German government and the state of North Rhine-\nWestphalia to bring the lignite phaseout forward to 2030 also gives us more stability. \nFurthermore, we expect this to go hand in hand with stronger political support for creating \nclimate-friendly replacement assets.\nMarket developments also present risks and opportunities, as exemplified in the past year. \nDue to the extreme price spikes on the electricity wholesale market, we were temporarily \nrequired to pledge significant collateral for forward contracts. Thanks to our solid financial \nplanning, we were always able to raise the necessary funds. Our economic outlook has \nimproved with the rising electricity prices. However, we are also exposed to more significant \nearnings shortfalls, should prices drop again. Nevertheless, we remain confident that the \nmarket environment will remain favourable for RWE, allowing the company to continue \nachieving attractive returns by investing in climate-friendly generation assets.\nThanks to the measures for safeguarding our financial and earning power over the long \nterm and our comprehensive controlling and risk management system, we are confident \nthat we can manage our current risks. At the same time, we are establishing the \nprerequisites for ensuring this remains the case in the future.\nAccounting-related internal control system – statements in accordance with Sec. 289, \nPara. 4, and Sec. 315, Para. 4 of the German Commercial Code. Our financial reporting is \nexposed to the risk of misrepresentations that could have a significant influence on the \ndecisions made by their addressees. This may cause capital investors to invest in a company \nbased on incorrect assumptions. Capital market law regulations and RWE’s Code of \nConduct require that we inform the public of our business performance and important \ncompany-specific events completely, objectively, accurately, clearly and in a timely manner. \nWe use a series of tools to meet this ambition. Examples of this are our IFRS accounting \nregulation and the high minimum standards to which we subject the IT systems used to \nrecord and process accounting-related data. Furthermore, we use an accounting-related \nInternal Control System (ICS) for quality assurance purposes. The ICS aims to prevent \npotential errors and misrepresentations that result from non-compliance with accounting \nstandards. \nThe Accounting Department of RWE AG is responsible for designing the ICS and reviewing \nits effectiveness. In doing so, it applies groupwide rules. In addition, it receives assistance \nfrom the ICS Committee, the objective of which is to ensure that the ICS is applied \nthroughout the Group following uniform principles and meeting high ambitions in terms  \nof correctness and transparency. The Committee consists of representatives from the \nAccounting, Controlling & Risk Management and Internal Audit & Security Departments, \nalong with officers from the human resources, procurement, trading, finance, taxes and  \nIT functions, which are closely related to accounting.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n73\n2\nCombined review ­ \nof ­operations\nDevelopment of risks  \nand opportunities"

First, we examine whether the \nrisk situation is presented appropriately and whether suitable controls are in place for the \nidentified risks. Then, we test the effectiveness of the controls. ICS reviews that pertain to \naccounting-related processes, for example, to the preparation of financial statements or  \nto consolidation, are conducted by employees from the Accounting Department. When it \ncomes to processes handled by service centres on our behalf, for example invoice \nprocessing, an auditor certifies the appropriateness and effectiveness of the controls. The \nrepresentatives of the finance, human resources, procurement, trading and IT functions \ndocument whether the agreed ICS quality standards are adhered to by their respective \nareas.

Such provisions \nare in place e. g. in respect of our €8 billion in syndicated credit lines, and essentially mean \nthat in the event of a change of control or majority at RWE AG, drawings are suspended until \nfurther notice. The lenders shall enter into negotiations with us on a continuation of the \nrespective credit line. The time limit for doing this is 30 days from the notification of the \nchange of control. On expiry of the time limit, lenders who are not satisfied with the outcome \nof the negotiations may revoke their loan commitment or cancel the loan if it has already \nbeen paid out, requesting immediate repayment. \nThe RWE bonds that we placed publicly in 2021 and 2022 are also subject to change-of-\ncontrol clauses. In the event that a change of control is announced or implemented, \ninvestors may request that their bonds be redeemed by a certain deadline, if RWE’s long-\nterm credit rating falls below investment grade due to the change of control or if the rating \nagencies stop issuing us a credit rating. A similar rule applies to the senior bond that \nmatures in 2037, a small portion of which remained on our books as it could not be fully \ntransferred to innogy in 2016.\nIn the event of a change of control, we can redeem our two subordinated hybrid bonds  \nwith volumes of €282 million and US$317 million within the determined change-of-control \nperiod.

Our operations focus on \nproducing electricity, increasingly from the wind and sun. Our core activities also include \nelectricity and gas storage, the hydrogen business, trading in energy commodities and \noffering innovative energy solutions to industrial customers. Power generation from coal \nand nuclear fuel as well as lignite mining in the Rhenish region west of Cologne no longer \nform part of our core business.\nOur main markets are Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the USA, \nalthough we also conduct our renewable energy activities in a number of other countries \nsuch as Poland, Spain, Italy, France, Greece, Sweden, Denmark and Australia. This is a \nbusiness in which we intend to increase our geographic footprint. More detailed information \non our business model can be found in chapter 2.1 Strategy.\nIdentifying risks and seizing opportunities.

Sustainability is a driving force of our strategy. \nOur purpose ‘Our energy for a sustainable life’ expresses the road we want to travel. As we \ncontinue to expand renewable energy, we strengthen our position as an industrial group \nevolving to create a sustainable business model. In 2021, we announced our plan to invest \nsome €50 billion in new wind and solar farms, battery storage systems, gas-fired power \nstations and electrolysers through to 2030. After subtracting cash flows from divestments, \ncapital expenditure should total approximately €30 billion. We expected this to put us in a \nposition to expand our green generation capacity (including battery storage systems and \nelectrolysers) to 50 GW by 2030. This figure is prorated, meaning that it reflects capacity \nbased on our stakes. Renewables accounted for 13.3 GW, or 32 %, of our total capacity at \nthe end of 2022. As we made better progress than expected in rolling out our growth \nstrategy, we now anticipate that capital expenditure will be higher and that our green \ncapacity may well clearly exceed 50 GW. A central role is played by the acquisition of \nUS-based energy utility Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses, which made us one of the \nleading solar power producers in the United States of America. Our growth offensive is \nflanked by a rapid and socially acceptable exit from the coal business. More detailed \ninformation on our business model can be found in chapter 2.1 Strategy.\nWe want to be a trailblazer in transforming an industrial business model from a conventional \nto a sustainable one. The nine major topics of our sustainability strategy underpin our \nambition to grow worldwide while adhering to environmental, social and ethical corporate \nprinciples and aspirations. These topics remained in focus in the year under review, after we \ndetermined them as part of a broad-based strategy process in 2021. Our sustainability \nstrategy was developed in partnership with our colleagues and co-workers while taking \nexternal assessments, for example by industry representatives, investors and \nrepresentatives of civil society into consideration before being adopted by the Executive \nBoard of RWE AG. The Executive Board discussed the sustainability strategy with the \nSupervisory Board, which fully endorses the strategic positioning adopted by the Executive \nBoard.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n79\n2\nCombined review  \n­of ­operations\nNon-financial  \nGroup statement"

The nine topics cover the full environmental, social and \ngovernance spectrum. In the year under review, we summarised them in three categories:\n•\t \u0007We Grow – We grow in our green business and create lasting value by investing in the \ntechnologies of a sustainable future. This group primarily consists of sustainable \ninvestments and innovation.\n•\t We Act – We preserve nature for future generations based on scientific facts and \nmethods. This group covers climate change, biodiversity and recultivation as well as the \ncircular economy.\n•\t We Care – We honour the interests of our stakeholders and act responsibly wherever we \noperate. Our focus in this area lies primarily on social and societal responsibility, diversity, \ncompliance as well as occupational health and safety.\nGroupwide organisation for sustainability processes. Our company’s strategic \norientation is determined by the Executive Board of RWE AG, which is responsible for \nestablishing and achieving the Group’s objectives. The Supervisory Board is directly involved \nin the corporate and sustainability strategy as well as in decisions of fundamental \nimportance to the company and is kept abreast of developments by the Executive Board, \nfor example via the Strategy and Sustainability Committee. A breakdown of accountabilities \nby Executive Board member can be found in the schedule of responsibilities. Each Executive \nBoard member runs their area under their own responsibility. We take an integrated \napproach to spurring sustainability, which is why we distribute responsibility for our main \ntopics. The Strategy & Sustainability Department is assigned to the office of the CEO and is \nin charge of developing the Group’s sustainability strategy, reporting and implementing \ninitiatives of strategic relevance. It assists the Executive Board with its expertise on the \nclimate, biodiversity, circular economy and further strategic matters. This is done by working \nclosely with the relevant functions and Group companies, which can develop their own \nstrategies and in some cases have appointed their own sustainability officers. The \nStrategy & Sustainability Department provides the Executive Board with quarterly updates \non progress made on the variety of sustainability activities within the Group. The Legal, \nCompliance & Insurance Department is also overseen by the CEO. Personnel matters are \nwithin the scope of accountability of the Chief HR Officer. This includes the Employee \nRelations and People Management & Talent Attraction Departments. She is also responsible \nfor groupwide coordination and assessment of occupational health and safety. The degree \nto which sustainability targets are achieved determines both the short-term and long-term \nremuneration of the members of the Executive Board of RWE AG. More detailed information \ncan be found in the Remuneration Report, which we publish separately. This document can \nbe viewed and downloaded at www.rwe.com/remuneration.\nRWE’s Executive Board and employees are guided by our corporate values. They form part \nof our culture and demonstrate how we want to be perceived by customers, partners and \nsociety: passionate, trustworthy and capable. Moreover, our Code of Conduct establishes \ngroupwide behavioural rules and obliges our employees to demonstrate responsibility, \nhonesty, loyalty and respect to both people and the environment. The values and principles \nare set out in further documents and policies on specific topics.\nTopics covered by the report are embedded in our strategy. We observed legal \nrequirements and the results of our materiality test when identifying topics for the Non-\nfinancial Statement. Selected topics are based on an analysis conducted in 2021 and an \nupdate which was carried out in 2022, evaluating the effects the topics have on us as a \ncompany as well as the impact we have on the sustainability issues. A list of potential topics \nbased on dialogues conducted with stakeholders was compiled while considering relevant \nsustainability rankings and standards. The survey on the assessment of the topics was \nconducted in 2021 via an online questionnaire for external stakeholders. They included \nbusiness partners, investors, political officials as well as community groups and \nassociations. Assessment and evaluation were handled by the Strategy & Sustainability \nDepartment of RWE AG with assistance from decision makers within the company. The \n2022 update again made use of an online questionnaire which was sent to a random \nselection of employees across the Group. For the purposes of this report, the topics \nidentified in 2021 and largely confirmed in 2022 were assigned to the five aspects set out \nin the German Commercial Code.

Our conventional and \ngreen energy assets mean that we have an impact on the climate, nature and \nenvironment. In the following sections, we report on our major strategic topics: climate \nchange, innovation, biodiversity and the circular economy. We also comment on our \nenvironmental management system as well as how we record environmental events, as \nthese topics represent components of the variable remuneration of the Executive \nBoard.\nClear pledge to protect the climate. We are committed to the goals of the Paris Climate \nAgreement, which seek to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius above \npre-industrial levels. Decarbonisation of the electricity sector is a major factor. The latest \nreports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal that urgent action \nis needed in order to avert the most damaging consequences of global warming. We emit \ngreenhouse gases above all from our conventional power stations. At the same time, \nhowever, our capital expenditure on renewable energy is enabling us to switch to climate-\nfriendly electricity production. Our business activities also result in our triggering emissions \noutside of our own operations, which are referred to as Scope 3 emissions. These stem, e. g. \nfrom the production of goods and services which we purchase as well as retail sales of gas \nand lignite products, which are then fired to generate electricity.\nWe want to be carbon neutral in all three scopes of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol by \n2040. To this end, we are reducing our direct and indirect emissions. Our strategy is also \noriented to hitting this target. By rapidly expanding renewable energy, we are making our \ncontribution to decarbonising the electricity system. We will retrofit or close existing \nfossil-fuelled and conventional generation assets. Our plans envisage making a full exit \nfrom lignite-fired power production by 2030. We develop deployment schedules for our \nexisting gas-fired power stations that enable them to generate electricity in a climate-\nfriendly manner. Research in conversion to hydrogen plays a major role in this context, as \ndoes carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology in some countries. We are converting \nour Dutch power plants, which run on hard coal and biomass, to constantly increase the \nshare of biomass firing, so that we can stop generating electricity from hard coal by 2030 \nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n81\n2\nCombined review  \n­of ­operations\nNon-financial  \nGroup statement"

      "text": "in the Netherlands. Our milestones in 2025 and 2030 provide important guiderails on our \nroad to carbon neutrality. By 2025, we want to scale back our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse \ngas emissions per unit of electricity generated by 27 %. With regard to upstream and \ndownstream emissions (Scope 3), we are aiming for a reduction of 15 % relative to the \nreference year, 2019. Our climate goals for 2030 have been confirmed by the Science \nBased Targets initiative: a 50 % drop in Scope 1 and 2 emissions per unit of electricity \ngenerated and a 30 % decline in Scope 3 emissions. Executive Board members’ long-term \nremuneration contains a key figure which is the average carbon intensity of our power \nplant fleet expressed in metric tons of carbon dioxide per megawatt of installed capacity \nfor every full-load hour. This key figure enables measurement of carbon dioxide emissions \nindependent of load fluctuations caused by the weather and the market. More detailed \ninformation can be found in the Remuneration Report, which is published separately.\nLast year, our power stations emitted 83 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, 2.1 million \nmore than in the preceding year. This was due to higher capacity utilisation of our lignite-\nfired power plants caused by gas shortages. As a result of the increased emissions, our \ndirect Scope 1 emissions also rose, advancing to 89.6 million metric tons of CO2e. \nConversely, our indirect Scope 2 and 3 emissions remained essentially unchanged in 2022. \nThe rise in Category 1 Scope 3 emissions is in part a result of a change in calculation \nmethodology. Furthermore, this also reflects a higher purchasing volume. Carbon intensity, \ni. e. Scope 1 and 2 emissions per unit of electricity generated, grew to 0.57 owing to the \nrise in power plant emissions.

These relate to exceptional \ncircumstances, e. g. mandatory extended lifetimes of the Emsland nuclear power station and of our lignite-fired power \nplants.\nIn early October 2022, we agreed with the German government and the state of North \nRhine-Westphalia to stop producing electricity from lignite in the Rhenish mining region by \n2030 with a view to putting our company on an ambitious climate path. Bringing forward our \nlignite phaseout by eight years compared to the previous legal requirement will reduce coal \nmining and firing by about 280 million metric tons. This will significantly reduce our Scope 1 \nemissions from 2030 onwards. Moreover, we have continued our efforts and focused on \nfurther emission sources within the scope of our sustainability strategy. For instance, we are \nswitching to climate-friendly electricity at our office sites as current agreements expire. \nExamples are our campus in Essen and our office complex in Swindon, UK. To identify potential \nfor reductions, we are also reviewing emissions from our supply chain, for instance from the \nprocurement of wind farm components, and have forged partnerships as part of a pilot \nproject in the renewables business in order to gradually scale back emissions from the \nproduction of major input materials such as steel. One such partnership was forged with steel \nproducer ArcelorMittal in 2022. The letter of intent envisages working together on the \ndevelopment, construction and operation of offshore wind farms and hydrogen plants which \nwill provide the green energy necessary to manufacture low-emissions steel in Germany. \nFurthermore, we champion climate protection in our dialogue with major stakeholders and via \nindustrial partnerships. Here, our focus primarily lies on the continued, rapid expansion of \nrenewable energy and on driving the hydrogen economy with innovative cross-sector \nconcepts to enable us to play our part in decarbonising industry. We expect the industrial \nassociations of which we are members to defend our key positions on climate matters. This is \nwhy, in the spring of 2022, we completed a review of the associations we are affiliated with, \nwhich involved examining and evaluating the public statements of some 30 associations. In \n2022, we conducted our first climate risk analysis for over 250 sites around the world in order \nto be prepared for the long-term effects of climate change. We drew on the latest findings and \nsimulations of climate science, including those from the sixth IPCC report. The main points \nwere potential changes in precipitation, temperature and wind speed in the marine and \ncoastal areas of Asia, Australia, Europe as well as North and South America. Further \ninformation on this can be found in the section on the EU Taxonomy.\nTechnologies driving sustainable development. The resolve with which the energy \ntransition is implemented will determine how successful it is. Another decisive factor is the \ninnovative contribution we make and how successful we are in forming partnerships to this \nend. Be it in expanding renewable energy, building the hydrogen economy or recycling \ncarbon in a climate-friendly manner, solutions must be found for technological challenges in \nall these areas. More detailed information on our activities is set out in chapter 2.2 Innovation.\nGrowth in harmony with biodiversity. Worldwide biodiversity loss and damage caused to \necosystems pose a risk to our planet. Based on current knowledge, this is exacerbated by \nclimate change. Both the use of renewable energy and the preservation of biological \ndiversity are crucial to the future of our planet’s habitability. However, construction work and \nproduction of electricity from renewable energy affect nature. Our lignite mining operations \nconsume natural resources and interfere with ecosystems. Therefore, we have made \nbiodiversity one of the priorities of our sustainability strategy. Environmental legislation and \napproval conditions, which are often strict, set the framework for our operating activities in \nthe regions in which we do business.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n83\n2\nCombined review  \n­of ­operations\nNon-financial  \nGroup statement"

      "text": "Responsibility for the fulfilment of our legal obligations relating to planning and building, \noperating as well as decommissioning our assets rests with the operating units, which have \nexperts in every area. We try to avoid, reduce or offset negative effects. These principles \nhave been established in our biodiversity guidelines, which we put into force in 2022 and \nsupplements existing rules at the segment level. Since 2015, RWE has had a set of rules \nthat establishes measures to protect and promote biodiversity in the Rhenish lignite mining \nregion. In our growth business, we already meet permit conditions, which can be extensive, \nthrough a variety of audits and measures. By taking early and continuous measures such as \nenvironmental compatibility audits and monitoring, we ensure that our activities have the \nleast possible impact on existing ecosystems and the flora and fauna they include. We apply \nthe highest standards in restoring biodiversity when recultivating land used for mining.\nEach RWE company nominates an environmental officer, who sits on its management \nboard. These officers work within the environmental management system to ensure that \nenvironmental protection is implemented responsibly and action is taken in compliance with \napplicable operator duties and our sustainability principles. Above and beyond this, \nenvironmental management officers and central environmental coordinators regularly \nreview, evaluate and improve the relevant environmental management systems. Within the \nframework of integrated compliance reporting, the Chief Compliance Officer also reports \nenvironmental protection matters as well as severe environmental events to the Executive \nBoard and Audit Committee of RWE AG. In certain cases, the responsible departments also \nreport directly to the Executive Board. The goals and processes we have in place to protect \nthe environment are set out in groupwide rules. For example, the Group’s environmental \npolicy leans on ISO 14001:2015 in determining the fundamentals of environmental \nprotection. This holds true for all affiliated companies reported in the consolidated financial \nstatements which have operations involving personnel and / or assets.\nWe want all new assets to have a positive net effect on biodiversity from no later than 2030 \nonwards – including measures implemented. Developing and operating energy assets and \nprojects as well as associated infrastructure requires being extremely mindful of flora and \nfauna, taking account of the fact that every project and asset has its own unique natural \nsurroundings. There are no standardised methods for measuring these influences, but we \nare working on developing them in initiatives such as the Science Based Targets for Nature. \nIn pilot projects, we are working on concepts that may be used in various applications to \nprotect biodiversity in various ways. \nOur environmental management system and established reporting to cover potential \nenvironmental events are important mainstays of our endeavours to protect environmental \nmatters. RWE uses the degree of coverage of its environmental management system as a \nkey performance indicator. Our objective is to achieve 100 % coverage by way of our \nenvironmental management system either via certification or internal audits. Coverage is \nmade up of the share of the workforce covered by the environmental management system \nand the degree of coverage. We achieved this goal yet again in 2022. In addition, we aim to \navoid severe environmental incidents, which, based on our definition, have serious \nramifications that are of substantial public interest and can only be controlled or managed \nwith external support. They also include permit infractions caused by or associated with our \nactivities.

      "text": "In the year being reviewed, we launched a pilot project to increase the variety of species on \nand surrounding our onshore wind farms, which could act as a lighthouse for other ventures. \nSmall bodies of water were created and piles of deadwood and stones were set up beside \nwind turbines on the site of the former lignite opencast mine near Bedburg to provide a new \nhabitat for local animal species. Furthermore, RWE is part of the Dutch Black Blade study, \nwhich involves seven RWE wind turbines each being given one black and two white rotor \nblades. One of the goals of this study is to find out whether painting rotor blades black can \nhelp birds fly between the turbines more safely. The study builds on the assumption that \nblack rotor blades create a starker contrast, thus increasing visibility and making it easier \nfor birds to detect the wind turbines and avoid collisions. The impact of the black rotor \nblades on birds will be monitored for two years. We have witnessed at a global level a rise in \ncalls for bids for new plants in which environmental and biodiversity matters play an \nimportant role. For instance, we participated in an invitation to tender by submitting an \ninnovative ecological concept. Even if we do not win a contract in this auction, the ideas and \nfindings will help us to continue developing our biodiversity activities.\nDriving the circular economy. At present, consumption of natural resources clearly \noutweighs replenishment and regeneration. To implement our strategy, we depend on a \nsteady supply of raw materials as well as of the components and products manufactured \nfrom them. Some of them have been identified as critical commodities, e. g. by the European \nUnion. Gradually increasing circular quotas enables us to reduce our dependency on primary \nmaterials while increasing value added by a more efficient use of resources. This can keep \ngrowth from being curtailed by scarcity. Furthermore, we expect stakeholders and legislation \nin the EU in particular to call for increasingly high standards in the circular economy. \nFlanking RWE’s Code of Conduct, which contains general goals regarding the protection of \nthe environment and usage of resources, we have detailed our efforts to help build a circular \neconomy in a Group policy. Responsibility for devising a roadmap through to at least 2030 \nand deriving goals from it lies within directly held Group companies. Implementation is up to \nthe management board members in charge of sustainability and the environment. They \nreceive assistance from the sustainability teams and environmental management officers. \nWe aim to become a company that observes the principles of the circular economy with \nevery step we take. One goal for our core business is to achieve a recycling rate of over 90 % \nby 2030. This figure reflects the share of materials and components no longer needed as \nwell as of our waste that is not disposed of in landfill sites or incineration plants but is instead \nput through a recovery, extraction or recycling process to ready it for reuse. This quota does \nnot consider ash from our lignite-fired electricity generation that is used to recultivate land \nin line with applicable permits. We aim to maximise our compatibility with the circular \neconomy by 2050. This involves reducing the use of natural resources as well as designing \nplants and processes that enable materials to be reused or recycled and waste to be \nminimised when working with our vendors and service providers. \nHaving made the circular economy a fixture of our sustainability strategy for the first time in \n2021, we completed an implementation project in the year under review. This resulted in \nuniform definitions, a framework and a roadmap for further steps and objectives. Our \nrecycling target for 2030 is one of the outcomes. Initiatives promoting a resource-friendly \neconomy were spurred within the Group: for example, in the Offshore Wind segment, \nrecyclable rotor blades were installed at our Kaskasi offshore wind farm for the first time in \n2022 and are now being tested in commercial operation. Whereas there are established \nrecycling methods for many wind turbine components such as the tower and nacelle, \nrecycling rotor blades has posed challenges to date. The new rotor blades at the Kaskasi site \nare the first of their kind and feature composite materials, which can be debonded at the \nend of their service life and recycled for new applications. This helps to reduce the amount of \nmaterial that is disposed of in landfill sites or incineration plants and to pave the way for fully \nrecyclable wind turbines.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n85\n2\nCombined review  \n­of ­operations\nNon-financial  \nGroup statement"

We \nreport on some of these groups in this chapter, amongst other things as we comment on \nour approach to diversity, health and social responsibility. To us, the last of these topics \nencompasses engaging with local communities and municipalities.\nPromoting diversity and inclusion within the company. Every day, more than 18,000 \nemployees give their all to ensure our company’s success. The breadth of experience, \nbackgrounds and talent in our company is what makes us unique and we believe this is an \nasset that helps our company grow. This highlights how important diversity is for RWE. \nMoreover, we are subject to statutory regulations in many markets, such as in relation to the \nnumber of women in managerial positions and antidiscrimination. \nIt is important to us to create a working environment that enables all our employees to \nreach their full potential at every stage of their career. Diversity, inclusion and \nantidiscrimination are enshrined throughout the Group in our Code of Conduct. We \nexpressly oppose all forms of discrimination. In 2022, we reinforced this pledge in the RWE \nAntidiscrimination Policy. In addition to the Corporate Diversity & Inclusion team, which \nprepares objectives and measures, companies within the Group are also accountable for \nspurring activities going above and beyond this. Diversity champions are nominated for this. \nAs regards employees, many groups and networks are active at RWE, including the \nadvocate group for the disabled, the Women’s Network, the LGBT*IQ & Friends Network, \nDiversity Ambassadors and the Empower Network for Disability, Neurodiversity and Mental \nHealth. In addition to the network members, a large number of further employees actively \nhelps to take measures and implement a lived, inclusive corporate culture. To promote \ngender diversity, the general rule at RWE is that all leadership and management positions \nshortlist a woman. Additional initiatives are carried out at the operational level. For example, \nhiring measures include a variety of one-on-ones with the aim of overcoming systemic bias. \nWe raise awareness through campaigns and purpose-designed measures in the fields of \npersonnel development, training, employment and health as well as suitable workplace \ndesigns and accessibility.\nRWE has set itself goals regarding various aspects of diversity. Information on targets \nimposed on supervisory boards and management by law in Germany can be found in the \nCorporate Governance Declaration, which has been published at www.rwe.com/corporate-\ngovernance-declaration.

This \nobjective only applies to our core business as setting a goal for the Coal / Nuclear segment is \nnot deemed practical given the personnel cuts necessary in this part of our business. In the \nyear under review, we increased the quota to 20.8 % in part by filling vacancies at the \nmanagement level. At the close of 2022, the 20-member Supervisory Board of RWE AG \nincluded seven women, four of whom are employer representatives. The share of women on \nthe Executive Board of RWE AG was 33.3 %.

The health, safety and wellbeing of our employees are \nparticularly important to us as an employer. To keep an eye on all matters related to the \nvariety of workplaces we have, occupational health and safety (H&S) has become a firm \nfixture in our corporate policy. The guiding principle ‘All accidents are avoidable – we give \npriority to occupational health and safety’ expresses our ambition in this area.\nThe Chief Human Resources Officer and Labour Director, who sits on the Executive Board of \nRWE AG, is responsible for the groupwide coordination and assessment of occupational \nH&S. She is informed, advised and assisted by the Health and Safety Unit of RWE Power AG \nwhich, in addition to providing occupational H&S services to RWE AG, also acts centrally in \naddressing general topics and pools expertise throughout the Group. Group companies \nhave their own units dedicated to H&S. The Occupational Health and Safety Group Policy \nhelps to organise and comply with H&S standards throughout the entire RWE Group. \nDesignated executive board members and managing directors at the Group companies \nensure implementation and compliance with H&S regulations. Each Group company is \nobligated to make at least one member of its executive or management board responsible \nfor occupational H&S. We have established occupational safety management systems in \nour Group companies to facilitate achieving the company’s H&S goals. The systems \nestablish structures, goals and procedures. Corresponding guidelines and processes are \nmonitored systematically and constantly improved adhering to the plan-do-check-act \ncycle. Furthermore, Group companies are advised to obtain external certification for their \noccupational safety management systems (e. g. ISO 45001). Tasks performed as part of the \nhealth management system satisfy the legal requirements in the relevant country. In \nGermany, these tasks primarily consist of services rendered by company physicians and \nemergency medical technicians, the continued development of measures to promote health \nand prevent illness and injury, ergonomic workplace design and counselling. The \nInternational Health Standard (IHS) of the RWE Group specifies the health products and \nservices that must be offered to every RWE employee such as counselling to assist them in \novercoming professional and personal challenges, referrals to specialised physicians and \nemergency care on business trips.\nWe aim to optimise the safety of every employee’s workplace, be it in an office, at a wind \nfarm, in an opencast mine or at one of our power stations. The object of our health \nmanagement work is to offer staff members measures tailored to their needs through which \nthey can maintain and promote their physical, mental and social health and wellbeing. \nOccupational safety is of central importance to the RWE Group and is thus linked to \nexecutive and management board remuneration. The key performance indicator \nestablished for occupational safety is the number of work-related accidents among \nin-house and contract staff resulting in at least one day of absence for every 1 million work \nhours (lost time incident frequency – LTIF). The target within the RWE Group is 1.9. This figure \nwas exceeded in 2021, but the LTIF dropped back down to 1.5 in 2022. The LTIF for RWE \npersonnel was 1.1 and also dropped compared to the preceding year. Our objective \nremains to allow not a single fatal work-related accident among our staff or the employees \nof our partner companies. Unfortunately a contract worker had a fatal accident while \ncleaning a coaling system at one of our power plants in November 2022.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n87\n2\nCombined review  \n­of ­operations\nNon-financial  \nGroup statement"

The RWE Group stopped imposing international minimum standards \nfor protective measures relating to the coronavirus in February 2022, transferring this \nresponsibility to the operating companies. At present, Group companies and locations take \nmeasures to prevent corona from spreading in line with risk assessments made on site. These \nmay include hygiene and social distancing rules, mandatory masks, mobile working, \nrestrictions imposed on business travel, events and meetings as well as free corona tests.\nDriving change together and justly. Our company is undergoing a process of \ntransformation. This is affecting both our employees and local communities. Despite the \ndifferences between these stakeholder groups, it is very important to us to interact with \nthem honestly to enable just change. After all, the transformation of the working world 2.0 \nalong with the challenging demographics and shortage of skilled labour it brings will change \nthe way in which people work. As plants are decommissioned, sites that have often been \noperated for years will have to be closed down. This will affect employees, suppliers, partners \nand local communities. At the same time, the construction and expansion of new power \ngeneration technologies will open the door to myriad opportunities and possibilities. As a \ncompany, it is incumbent upon us to shape this change transparently and in a socially \nacceptable manner. We strive to be a good employer, no matter where our employees work. \nMaintaining a dialogue to involve and communicate with them early on is important for us.\nRWE interacts with a large number of stakeholders on a daily basis. We take their interests \ninto account to ensure that their views are considered in our goals and plans, from project \nplanning and execution to operation. Accountabilities vary within the Group from one set of \nstakeholders to the next. \nRWE AG and its HR team create the framework for employees. The operating companies \nhave their own HR departments, which implement independent processes and measures in \nareas such as career development and recruitment while taking account of regional needs.\nOperating functions manage their own contacts with local municipalities and communities \nin the areas in which they operate, paying due regard to national regulations and local \nrequirements. This enables us to cater to local needs and expectations. \nIt is our ambition to make a positive contribution to the communities in which we operate. To \nensure a just transition, we stand by those of our employees whose jobs are affected by the \nenergy transition and come up with socially acceptable solutions and prospects for them. To \nus, a just transition translates into treating employees, partners and communities both fairly \nand responsibly especially whenever disruptive steps are unavoidable. In our company, we \nwant to offer a working environment that attracts new talent, promotes existing potential \nand provides fair, performance-based pay. The engagement index is an important indicator \nwhen it comes to measuring our success in this area. The index is compiled at the Group \nlevel, which ensures comparability with other industrial groups.

This involves \ncalculating the percentage share of people responding to questions by selecting one of the \nfirst two options (‘I agree entirely’ and ‘I agree’). In the year being reviewed, the engagement \nindex rose to 84 %, up 3 % compared to 2021 and surpassing the 78 % target. Therefore, all \nkey indicators improved, based on a participation rate of 74 % (compared to 67 % in 2021).\nEngagement index \n%\n2022\n2021\n+ / –\nRWE Group\n84\n81\n3\nThere is no general indicator that would enable progress in local engagement to be \nmeasured. Due to the differences in approach, a variety of formats is evaluated by the \nresponsible units to establish whether they are fit for purpose.\nWe are supporting the company’s transformation by taking measures for our employees. \nWhereas the growth business involves recruiting new staff, we are confronted with \nnecessary decommissioning activities in the Coal / Nuclear segment. Despite the manpower \nrequired for dismantling, in the next few years, thousands of jobs will have to be cut in a \nsocially acceptable manner and existing staff will have to be transferred to new positions. \nThe announced accelerated exit from lignite will have significant ramifications for many \nemployees. We will need more personnel in the short term to operate power plants longer \nthan envisaged during the European energy crisis caused by the continuing war in Ukraine. \nHowever, job cuts will pick up considerably towards the end of the decade. As before, RWE \nplans to carry out the personnel adjustment to the new decommissioning roadmap in a \nsocially acceptable manner. One objective is to provide younger employees, who cannot \ntake early retirement, with prospects within the company or with other employers. Extensive \nqualification and retraining measures will underpin the adjustment path. RWE AG’s HR \norganisation was rearranged in the year under review to support the continued growth \nstrategy. A focal point of the new structure will primarily consist of creating and improving \nservices and processes, for instance when onboarding new staff members, identifying talent \nor recruiting new employees. For RWE, it is important to attract new talent and retain skilled \nlabour while increasing the staff’s identification with our company. To this end, an employer \nbrand under the motto ‘Our energy has impact’ and an employer value proposition were \ndeveloped and launched in the year being reviewed. One improvement relates to the ways in \nwhich talent and interested individuals come across job offers. RWE’s central career website \nwas revamped extensively and now accepts applications without prior registration. \nFurthermore, the internal job board has been made uniform, enabling vacancies to be \nsearched across borders. In the reporting year, all internal onboarding, offboarding and job \nchange processes were reviewed, harmonised and standardised both groupwide and \naround the globe. These improvements guarantee uniform quality throughout the Group, \npaving the way for automation. This increases the efficiency of HR processes, provides \neveryone involved with an optimal experience and supports the growth strategy of our \ncompany. We are currently preparing for new ways of working in our offices, and work \nstarted on a pilot for hybrid offices in 2022. A pilot concept including office equipment and \nfurnishings is being worked on at several locations. This mainly involves redesigning team \nrooms and offices in order to create a more comfortable working environment and create a \nbalance between individual work stations and work spaces designed for interaction, in which \ncolleagues can collaborate more effectively than in the past.\nIn addition to our employees, the people who live in the areas adjacent to and surrounding \nour facilities are important, and we involve them early on and – if possible – share the value \nadded by our plants with them. Payments continued to be made via community funds in \n2022. In the year under review, through wind farms operated by RWE in the UK and Ireland, \nwe invested over €5 million in local communities. In Germany, we decided to give all \ncommunities in which an RWE wind farm or ground-mounted solar system is located a share \nof the profit in accordance with the German Renewable Energy Act. The ‘RWE Climate \nBonus’ went into effect on 1 January 2023 and generally applies to existing facilities as well \nas future RWE assets once they are commissioned.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n89\n2\nCombined review  \n­of ­operations\nNon-financial  \nGroup statement"

Good company management and adequate corporate governance \nare indispensable in terms of achieving our growth goals and creating value for our \nstakeholders. In this chapter, we set out our approach and progress made in \ncompliance and ethics.\nIntegrity and legal compliance are pillars of our action. We seek to grow in adherence to \napplicable laws while staying true to our own values and principles. In this context, we believe \nour priority topics compliance and ethics translate into preventing corruption and bribery \nwhile being guided by our values when working with our vendors and partners. They must \nmeet the standards we impose on ourselves.\nAll our business activities and decisions meet pre-established compliance requirements. \nCorruption and all types of compliance infractions are not tolerated. As a preventive \nmeasure, we set up a Compliance Management System (CMS) for the RWE Group, which is \nregularly reviewed in accordance with the IDW 980 Audit Standard of the Institute of Public \nAuditors in Germany and was last subjected to a review in 2021. Overarching control of the \nsystem is handled by the Chief Compliance Officer. Furthermore, Group companies in \nGermany and abroad have designated compliance officers, who work to ensure uniform \nimplementation of groupwide compliance. The compliance officers report to the Chief \nCompliance Officer of RWE AG, who keeps the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board’s \nAudit Committee abreast of relevant issues such as developments in legislation, the \nrefinement of the CMS and leads on potential compliance violations. \nThe main objective of the CMS is to permanently ingrain compliant behaviour in the mindset \nand actions of all staff members and strengthen the compliance culture within the Group in a \nsustainable manner. A regular compliance risk analysis is an integral component of the CMS. \nDepartments and operating units are covered by the risk assessment conducted by the \nCompliance Department, which starts by identifying and assessing the key compliance risk \nfields and ends by deriving from the analysis any necessary measures. Our employees attend \ntraining sessions to learn about specific behaviours and measures, in particular to avoid \ncorruption and the appearance thereof. Mandatory compliance training is conducted once a \nyear on a web-based platform with variable points of focus. Furthermore, employees attend \nin-person training sessions depending on the risks to which their work is exposed. The training \nconcept also includes the Executive Board. We support our employees in notifying their \nsuperiors, the appropriate compliance officers / managers and / or the Chief Compliance \nOfficer of RWE AG of potential breaches of our Code of Conduct and other non-compliant \nbehaviour. In addition, throughout the Group our employees have access to a web-based \nwhistleblower system. With the option of remaining anonymous, whistleblowers can use this \nsystem to report incidents, e. g. violations of our Code of Conduct or the German Basic Data \nPrivacy Regulation, white-collar offences and actions that harm the company. Furthermore, \nour staff members and external entities such as vendors and other business partners can get \nin touch with an independent external contact via the phone or e-mail. We treat received tips \nconfidentially and, if so desired, anonymously. We protect whistleblowers by all means \nnecessary from the potential fallout of their notification. When following leads, we protect the \njustified interests of individuals affected by a notification. We investigate all tips pointing at \npotential compliance infractions. These are recorded by the Compliance Department and \nreviewed by the Group functions in charge of the investigation. Thereafter, if necessary, \nremedies are initiated as part of a systematic follow-up process. Necessary and appropriate \nmeasures are set in motion for all confirmed compliance violations committed by employees \nand / or business partners.\nThe Group’s purchasing teams have established structures and processes to minimise the \nrisk of bad business practices by our partners and vendors and to ensure ethical and \nresponsible action.

The \nEU Taxonomy is a key element of the European Green Deal. It forms a system for a uniform \nclassification of environmentally sustainable company activities. Business activities are \nanalysed for their contribution to six defined environmental goals (climate change \nmitigation, climate change adaptation, sustainable use and protection of water and marine \nresources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection \nand restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems).

Taxonomy-eligible activities relate to business activities listed in \nthe delegated legal acts of the Taxonomy Regulation for which concrete, defined technical \nscreening criteria are available. We screened the listed activities that we undertake based \non the defined technical screening criteria to determine whether they can be classified as \nenvironmentally sustainable activities as defined by the EU Taxonomy (taxonomy \nalignment). \nThe requirements for taxonomy alignment are met if all the following criteria are fulfilled:\n\t\na) \u0007the business activity makes a major contribution to achieving one or more of the \nenvironmental goals;\n\t\nb) it does not significantly harm (‘DNSH’) any of the other environmental goals;\n\t\nc) it is carried out while ensuing minimum safeguards.\nOur aligned economic activities primarily comprise electricity generation from wind, \nphotovoltaics and hydropower. We also state electricity storage and the establishment of \nhydrogen production among our taxonomy-aligned activities.\nOur taxonomy-eligible business activities predominantly comprise electricity generation \nfrom natural gas. As our natural gas activities do not satisfy the criteria of the Taxonomy \nRegulation, we state them as taxonomy-eligible, but not taxonomy-aligned. In the previous \nyear, these activities were stated as being not taxonomy-eligible, because the applicable \nsupplementary delegated legal act had not entered into force yet. We also state our \nbioenergy activities as not being taxonomy-aligned at present due to the criterion that \nrequires exclusive use of bioenergy. Furthermore, certain offshore wind farms are currently \nnot taxonomy-aligned but are taxonomy-eligible because they are pending proof or \nclarification of supplementary measures regarding existing permits.\nOur business activities that are not taxonomy-eligible mainly comprise electricity generation \nfrom coal and nuclear energy. The latter is stated as not taxonomy-eligible since no more \nexpansion investments are being made in this technology. As a result, the mandatory \ncriterion of activity 4.28 of the supplementary delegated legal act on gas and nuclear \nenergy is not satisfied. This is in line with the prior year’s presentation. At the time, electricity \nproduction from nuclear energy had not yet been addressed by the Taxonomy Regulation \nbecause the corresponding delegated legal act hat not entered into force yet.\nTaxonomy-alignment was assessed in a multi-stage process. First, we clustered our asset \nportfolio by business activity in accordance with the EU Taxonomy and by region, e. g., the \nUSA and the European Union. Regional clustering allows screening criteria to be considered \nappropriately through similarities in regional legislation. Then we assessed their material \ncontributions to climate change mitigation since all our taxonomy-eligible activities \ncontribute to achieving this goal of the EU Taxonomy. For most of our activities, no further \ntechnical screening criteria have been defined to prove that they make a major contribution \nto climate change mitigation. The delegated legal acts only define specific screening criteria \nincluding firm limits for electricity generation from hydropower, hydrogen production and \nelectricity generation from fossil gaseous fuels. As we comply with these limits with the \nexception of our natural gas activities, these activities do not meet the alignment criteria. \nAfter considering the technical screening criteria for determining major contributions to \nclimate change mitigation (1), an analysis was performed to determine whether any of the \nfive other taxonomy goals, i. e., climate change adaptation (2), sustainable use and \nprotection of water and marine resources (3), transition to a circular economy (4), pollution \nprevention and control (5), and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems \n(6) are being jeopardised and procedures to ensure minimum safeguards are implemented. \nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n93\n2\nCombined review  \n­of ­operations\nNon-financial  \nGroup statement"

      "text": "We took a systematic approach at the Group level to goal 2 (climate change adaptation), \nwhich applies to all activities, and conducted the first cross-portfolio climate risk \nassessment for our taxonomy-aligned business activities in this reporting year. The \nassessment focused on climate projection scenarios that are the best possible fit for the \nlifetimes of our newest assets. In so doing, we also considered long-term scenarios. All the \npredefined and evaluable climate hazards listed in annex 2 to the delegated legal act were \nconsidered. The climate models do not contain any projection data relating to climate \nhazards caused by solid matter or certain serious events such as hailstorms. Projected \nchanges to climate variables were identified using a group of global climate models. Various \nsources of uncertainty are mitigated by taking account of various driver scenarios, amongst \nother things. The first result of the assessment reveals a higher relevance for assets that are \nplanned, under construction, or have recently been commissioned. In addition, as a rule, \ntechnology-dependent climate data were also analysed for material identified risks and \nadaptation solutions were implemented, some of which were extensive. Examples are flood \nprotection for run-of-river power stations and retaining basins for plants with water-based \ncooling systems. The first step of the vulnerability assessment revealed, among other things, \nchanges in wind, sunshine, precipitation and drought duration as being technology-specific \nclimate hazards. The next step will involve looking at further specific data such as the age \nand service life of individual assets to concretise vulnerability. \nAccording to the delegated legal act, activities that help achieve goal 3, ‘sustainable use \nand protection of water and marine resources’, must satisfy criteria regarding the impact of \ntheir construction and operation on existing bodies of water. Our offshore wind, hydropower \nand hydrogen production activities meet these criteria. The criteria that must be met are \nproven at the project and asset level by means of permit applications, environmental \nimpact assessments, studies, and permit requirements in relation to bodies of water in \nco-ordination with the relevant authorities. Goal 4, ‘transition to a circular economy’, is being \npursued systematically and is not significantly jeopardised. The transition to a circular \neconomy is an element of our sustainability strategy. Associated processes are \nimplemented throughout the Group. In addition, we prove that requirements are met by \ntaking measures specific to the circular economy at the project and asset level. The only \nrequirements defined for goal 5, ‘pollution prevention and control’, and proven via \ninvestigations are those for the activity ‘hydrogen production’. The delegated legal act \ndefines criteria for all our activities in relation to goal 6, ‘protection and restoration of \nbiodiversity and ecosystems’. Here, taxonomy alignment is achieved through compliance \nwith requirements imposed by approval procedures and is proven at the asset level. This is \ndone, e. g., by furnishing proof of environmental impact assessments and studies.\nAs regards the ‘minimum safeguards’, we lean on the report of the platform for sustainable \nfinance on minimum safeguards and have focused our screening and proof of alignment on \nkey topics for which honouring minimum guarantees at the company level based on EU and \ninternational standards have been defined as relevant. Human rights, corruption and \nbribery, taxes, competition and antitrust law and data privacy. Overall, we ensure minimum \nsafeguards.\nWhen it comes to human rights, notable mention should be made of RWE’s Code of \nConduct, which provides a general explanation of human rights and the main labour \nstandards of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). This Code of Conduct is binding on \nall employees and is an element of the contracts entered into by the purchasing teams. We \nhave supplemented the Code with a policy statement on our human rights strategy. \nTo combat corruption and bribery, RWE has a compliance management system designed to \ndetect corruption, which has been institutionalised in several Group regulations, among \nother things. The management system is regularly audited by an external auditing firm. Our \nstaff members have a groupwide web-based whistleblower system and external contacts at \ntheir disposal.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n94\n2\nCombined review  \n­of ­operations\nNon-financial  \nGroup statement"

      "text": "RWE has had a tax compliance management system based on German audit standards \nsince 2019. Its suitability and effectiveness are monitored internally. We monitor \ncompliance risks of major foreign companies of the RWE Group through the international \nmanagement system by reviewing tax declarations, tax payments and tax risks on a \nquarterly basis. Similar measures have been taken in the remaining compliance areas with a \nview to ensuring minimum safeguards at all times.\nOur reporting is carried out in accordance with the metrics for the three key performance \nindicators (KPIs): revenue, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx). \nThese metrics are calculated using the EU Taxonomy definitions: revenues correspond to \nthe proportion of net revenues with goods or services, which are associated with taxonomy-\naligned business activities (numerator), in total consolidated revenues (denominator).  \nCapEx corresponds to the proportion of additions to property, plant and equipment and \nintangible assets during the fiscal year before depreciation, amortisation and re-evaluations, \nwhich are associated with aligned business activities (numerator), in the total amount of \nCapEx (denominator). OpEx corresponds to the proportion of direct, non-capitalised costs \nfor research and development, building refurbishment measures, short-term leasing, \nmaintenance and repair, and all other direct expenditure in relation to the day-to-day \nmaintenance of assets included in property, plant and equipment, which are associated with \ntaxonomy-aligned business activities (numerator), in the total amount of OpEx \n(denominator). Expenditure in connection with daily maintenance of our property, plant and \nequipment primarily relates to expenses for the maintenance of wind and solar farms as well \nas of our conventional power plants. This takes account of purchased and in-house repair \nmeasures. In addition to the service cost, directly attributable material costs, personnel \ncosts and other operating expenses are also included here.\nThe first step of determining the KPIs was an analysis of our business activities. This involved \ndirectly assigning individual business units and, in turn, the revenue, CapEx and OpEx \ngenerated by them, to a business activity in accordance with the Taxonomy Regulation. This \nwas followed by a review of each business activity to establish its taxonomy alignment. If a \ndirect assignment to business activities was not possible, we were able to use appropriate \nallocation procedures to allocate the KPIs to taxonomy-aligned, taxonomy-eligible but \nnon-taxonomy-aligned and non-taxonomy-eligible activities. To calculate revenue, it was \nallocated to our business activities essentially based on internal revenue from the \nSupply & Trading segment. The reason for this is that electricity production is carried out at \nthe level of the individual business activities, whereas the sale of electricity generally takes \nplace via the Supply & Trading segment. \nWe calculated the following data for the taxonomy-aligned activities of the RWE Group for \nthe reporting year:\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \nstatements\n5\nFurther information\n95\n2\nCombined review  \n­of ­operations\nNon-financial  \nGroup statement"

On 1 April 2021, RWE \nacquired the roughly 40 % share in Rampion Renewables Limited (‘RRL’), Coventry, UK, which \nhad been held by E.ON until then.

Upon  \ncompletion of the transaction in January and August 2021, RWE deconsolidated the above \nwind farms and reported its remaining 25 % stake as an investment accounted for using the \nequity method. The gain on deconsolidation amounted to €156 million and was recognised \nin the ‘other operating income’ line item on the income statement in the previous year.  \nAdditionally, in relation to the derecognition of a commodity derivative in this transaction,  \na current expense of €34 million reported under ‘other operating expenses’ in the previous \nyear was also taken into account.\nSale of 100 % of the shares in Energies France and Investerg to KELAG.

KELAG is an associate company of RWE.\nSale of the grid connection for the Rampion offshore wind farm. In order to comply with \ncompetition law requirements, RWE was obligated to sell the grid connection for the  \nRampion offshore wind farm, which had been fully consolidated since 1 April 2021. The sale \nof the grid connection, which was part of the Offshore Wind segment, was completed on  \n19 November 2021. No disposal result was recorded.\nDisposal of parts of the Belectric Group. In December 2021, RWE sold the companies \nBELECTRIC GmbH, Kolitzheim, Germany, Belectric France S.à.r.l., Vendres, France, Belectric \nIsrael Ltd., Be’er Scheva, Israel, Belectric Italia s.r.l., Latina, Italy, and Belectric Solar Ltd., \nSlough, United Kingdom, to the Elevion Group B.V. The deconsolidation gain on this  \ntransaction amounted to €4 million, which was recognised in the ‘other operating income’ \nline item on the income statement in the previous year. The divested companies were  \nassigned to the segment Onshore Wind / Solar.\nConsolidation principles\nThe financial statements of German and foreign companies included in the scope of the \nGroup’s financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies. On principle, \nsubsidiaries whose fiscal years do not end on the Group’s balance-sheet date  \n(31 December) prepare interim financial statements as of this date. One subsidiary has a \ndifferent balance-sheet date of 31 March (previous year: one). Different fiscal years  \ncompared to the calendar year stem from tax-related reasons or country-specific  \nregulations. \nBusiness combinations are reported according to the acquisition method. This means that \ncapital consolidation takes place by offsetting the purchase price, including the amount of \nthe non-­controlling interests, against the acquired subsidiary’s revalued net assets at the \ntime of acquisition. In doing so, the non-controlling interests can either be measured at the \nprorated value of the subsidiary’s identifiable net assets or at fair value. The subsidiary’s \nidentifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at full fair value, \nregardless of the amount of the non-controlling interests. Intangible assets are reported \nseparately from goodwill if they are separable from the company or if they stem from a \ncontractual or other right. In accordance with IFRS 3, no new restructuring provisions are \nrecognised within the scope of the purchase price allocation. If the purchase price exceeds \nthe revalued prorated net assets of the acquired subsidiary, the difference is capitalised as \ngoodwill. If the purchase price is lower, the difference is included in income.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n129\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \n­statements\nNotes\n5\nFurther information"

      "text": "In the event of deconsolidation, the related pro-rata goodwill is derecognised with an effect \non income. Changes in the ownership share which do not alter the ability to control the \nsubsidiary are recognised without an effect on income. By contrast, if there is a loss of \ncontrol, the remaining shares are remeasured at fair value with an effect on income. \nExpenses and income as well as receivables and payables between consolidated companies \nare eliminated; intra-group profits and losses are eliminated. \nFor investments accounted for using the equity method, goodwill is not reported separately, \nbut rather included in the value recognised for the investment. In other respects, the \nconsolidation principles described above apply analogously. If impairment losses on the \nequity value become necessary, we report such under income from investments accounted \nfor using the equity method. The financial statements of investments accounted for using \nthe equity method are also prepared using the Group’s uniform accounting policies. \nForeign currency translation\nIn their individual financial statements, the companies measure non-monetary foreign \ncurrency items at the balance-sheet date using the exchange rate in effect on the date they \nwere initially recognised. Monetary items are converted using the exchange rate valid on the \nbalance-sheet date. Exchange rate gains and losses from the measurement of monetary \nbalance-sheet items in foreign currency occurring up to the balance-sheet date are \nrecognised on the income statement.\nFunctional foreign currency translation is applied when converting the financial statements \nof companies outside of the Eurozone. As the principal foreign enterprises included in the \nconsolidated financial statements conduct their business activities independently in their \nnational currencies, their balance-sheet items are translated into euros in the consolidated \nfinancial statements using the average exchange rate prevailing on the balance-sheet date. \nThis also applies for goodwill, which is viewed as an asset of the economically autonomous \nforeign entity. Expense and income items are translated using annual average exchange \nrates. Foreign currency translation differences from converting the financial statements of \ncompanies outide the euro area are reported in other comprehensive income without an \neffect on income. When translating the adjusted equity of foreign companies accounted for \nusing the equity method, we follow the same procedure.\nThe following exchange rates (among others) were used as a basis for foreign currency \ntranslations:\nExchange rates\nAverage\nYear-end\nin €\n2022\n2021\n31 Dec 2022\n31 Dec 2021\n1 US dollar\n0.95\n0.85\n0.94\n0.88\n1 British pound\n1.17\n1.16\n1.13\n1.19\n100 Czech korunas\n4.08\n3.90\n4.15\n4.02\n1 Polish zloty\n0.21\n0.22\n0.21\n0.22\n1 Danish crown\n0.13\n0.13\n0.13\n0.13\n1 Swedish crown\n0.09\n0.10\n0.09\n0.10\n1 Norwegian crown\n0.10\n0.10\n0.10\n0.10\nSince 30 June 2022, Türkiye has been classified as a hyperinflationary economy according \nto IAS 29. In these financial statements as of 31 December 2022, RWE thus applies IAS 29 \nin respect of the financial statements of one fully consolidated Turkish subsidiary.

As a result of the application of IAS 29, a loss of \n€13 million from the net positions of the monetary items was recorded in the reporting \nperiod, which was reported in depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses as well as in \nthe financial result. In this regard, the consumer price index of the Turkish Statistical Institute \nwas used to adjust purchasing power effects. As of 1 January 2022, this amounted to  \n687 basis points, which increased to 1,128 basis points at the end of the reporting period. \nIn accordance with IAS 21, the prior-year figures were not adjusted.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n130\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \n­statements\nNotes\n5\nFurther information"

Furthermore, asset recognition requires that there be a sufficient \nlevel of certainty that the development costs lead to future cash inflows. Capitalised develop-\nment costs are amortised over the period during which the products are expected to be \nsold. Research expenditures are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are \nincurred. \nAn impairment loss is recognised for an intangible asset if the recoverable amount of the \nasset is less than its carrying amount. A special regulation applies for cases when the asset \nis part of a cash-generating unit. Such units are defined as the smallest identifiable group of \nassets which generates cash inflows; these inflows must be largely independent of cash \ninflows from other assets or groups of asset. If the intangible asset is a part of a cash-­\ngenerating unit, the impairment loss is calculated based on the recoverable amount of this \nunit. If goodwill was allocated to a cash-generating unit and the carrying amount of the unit \nexceeds the recoverable amount, the allocated goodwill is initially written down by the \ndifference. Impairment losses which must be recognised in addition to this are taken into \naccount by reducing the carrying amount of the other assets of the cash-generating unit on \na prorated basis. If the reason for an impairment loss recognised in prior periods has ceased \nto exist, a write-back to intangible assets is performed. The increased carrying amount \nresulting from the write-back may not, however, exceed the amortised cost.

Borrowing costs are \ncapitalised as part of the asset’s cost, if they are incurred directly in connection with the \nacquisition or production of a ‘qualified asset’. What characterises a qualified asset is that a \nconsiderable period of time is required to prepare it for use or sale. If necessary, the cost of \nproperty, plant and equipment may contain the estimated expenses for the decommission-\ning of plants or site restoration. Maintenance and repair costs are recognised as expenses.\nWith the exception of land and leasehold rights, as a rule, property, plant and equipment is \ndepreciated using the straight-line method, unless in exceptional cases another deprecia-\ntion method is better suited to the usage pattern. The depreciation methods are reviewed \nannually. We calculate the depreciation of RWE’s typical property, plant and equipment \naccording to the following useful lives, which apply throughout the Group and are also \nreviewed annually:\nreceived lease incentives. Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line \nmethod over the lease term.\nFor short-term leases and leases for low-value assets, lease instalments are recognised  \nas an expense over the lease term. For operating leases of which RWE is the lessor, the \nminimum lease instalments are recognised as income over the lease term.\nImpairment losses and write-backs on property, plant and equipment are recognised \naccording to the principles described for intangible assets. \nInvestments accounted for using the equity method are initially accounted for at cost and \nthereafter based on the carrying amount of their prorated net assets. The carrying amounts \nare increased or reduced annually by prorated profits or losses, dividends and all other \nchanges in equity. Goodwill is not reported separately, but rather included in the recognised \nvalue of the investment. Goodwill is not amortised. An impairment loss is recognised for \ninvestments accounted for using the equity method, if the recoverable amount is less than \nthe carrying amount.\nThe initial measurement of other financial assets occurs at the settlement date.

They also \ninclude production-­related depreciation. Borrowing costs, however, are not capitalised as \npart of the cost. The determination of cost is generally based on average values. \nIf the net realisable value of inventories written down in earlier periods has increased, the \nreversal of the write-down is recognised as a reduction of the cost of materials. \nNuclear fuel assemblies are stated at amortised cost. Depreciation is determined by \noperation and capacity, based on consumption and the reactor’s useful life. \nInventories which are acquired primarily for the purpose of realising a profit on a short-term \nresale transaction are recognised at fair value less costs to sell. Changes in value are \nrecognised with an effect on income. The fair value of gas inventories purchased for resale \nis determined every month on the basis of the current price curves of the relevant indices for \ngas (e. g. TTF). The valuations are based on prices which can be observed directly or  \nindirectly (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). Differences between the fair value and the \ncarrying value of inventories acquired for resale purposes are recognised on the income \nstatement at the end of the month.\nSecurities classified as current marketable securities essentially consist of fixed-interest \nsecurities which have a maturity of more than three months and less than one year from the \ndate of acquisition. Securities are measured in part at fair value through profit or loss or at \nfair value through other comprehensive income. The transaction costs directly associated \nwith the acquisition of these securities are included in the initial measurement, which \noccurs on their settlement date. Unrealised gains and losses are recognised through profit \nor loss or other comprehensive income, with due consideration of any deferred taxes \ndepending on the underlying measurement category. In part, current marketable securities \nare also measured at amortised cost. An impairment in the amount of the expected credit \nlosses is recognised through profit or loss for debt instruments that are stated at fair value \nthrough other comprehensive income. Changes included in other comprehensive income \nare recognised through profit or loss on disposal of such instruments.\nReceivables are comprised of financial receivables, trade accounts receivable and other \nreceivables. Aside from financial derivatives, receivables and other assets are stated at \namortised cost minus a risk provision in the amount of the expected losses. \nLoans reported under financial receivables are stated at amortised cost minus a risk \nprovision in the amount of the expected losses. Loans with interest rates common in the \nmarket are shown on the balance sheet at nominal value; as a rule, however, non-interest \n­or low-interest loans are disclosed at their present value discounted using an interest rate \ncommensurate with the risks involved.\nCO2 emission allowances and certificates for renewable energies are accounted for as \nintangible assets and reported under other assets; both are stated at cost and are not \namortised. \nDeferred taxes result from temporary differences in the carrying amount in the separate \nIFRS financial statements and tax bases, and from consolidation procedures. Deferred tax \nassets also include tax reduction claims resulting from the expected utilisation of existing \nloss carryforwards in subsequent years. Deferred taxes are capitalised if it is sufficiently \ncertain that the related economic advantages can be used. Their amount is assessed with \nregard to the tax rates applicable or expected to be applicable in the specific country at the \ntime of realisation. The tax regulations valid or adopted as of the balance-­sheet date are key \nconsiderations in this regard. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are netted out for \neach company and / or tax group. \nInventories are assets which are held for sale in the ordinary course of business (finished \ngoods and goods for resale), which are in the process of production (work in progress – goods \nand services) or which are consumed in the production process or in the rendering of services \n(raw materials including nuclear fuel assemblies). \nInsofar as inventories are not acquired primarily for the purpose of realising a profit on a \nshort-term resale transaction, they are carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value. \nProduction costs reflect the full costs directly related to production; they are determined \nRWE Annual Report 2022\n133\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \n­statements\nNotes\n5\nFurther information"

In the determination of the settlement amount, \nany cost increases likely to occur up until the time of settlement are taken into account.\nIf necessary, the cost of property, plant and equipment may contain the estimated expenses \nfor the decommissioning of plants or site restoration. Decommissioning, restoration and \nsimilar provisions are recognised for these expenses. If changes in the discount rate or \nchanges in the estimated timing or amount of the payments result in changes in the \nprovisions, the carrying amount of the respective asset is increased or decreased by the \ncorresponding amount. If the decrease in the provision exceeds the carrying amount, the \nexcess is recognised immediately through profit or loss.\nAs a rule, releases of provisions are credited to the expense account on which the provision \nwas originally recognised.\nProvisions for pensions and similar obligations are recognised for defined benefit plans. \nThese are obligations of the company to pay future and ongoing post-employment benefits \nto entitled current and former employees and their surviving dependents. In particular, the \nobligations refer to retirement pensions. Individual commitments are generally oriented to \nthe employees’ length of service and compensation. \nProvisions for defined benefit plans are based on the actuarial present value of the  \nrespective obligation. This is measured using the projected unit credit method. This method \nnot only takes into account the pension benefits and benefit entitlements known as of the \nbalance-sheet date, but also anticipated future increases in salaries and pension benefits. \nThe calculation is based on actuarial reports, taking into account appropriate biometric \nparameters (for Germany, in particular the ‘Richttafeln 2018 G’ by Klaus Heubeck, and the \nStandard SAPS Table S3PA of the respective year for the United Kingdom, taking into  \nconsideration future changes in mortality rates). The provision derives from the balance of \nthe actuarial present value of the obligations and the fair value of the plan assets. The \nservice cost is disclosed in staff costs. Net interest is included in the financial result. \nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand ­deposits and current \nfixed-interest securities with a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition. \nAssets are stated under Assets held for sale if they can be sold in their present condition \nand their sale is highly probable within the next twelve months. Such assets may be certain \nnon-current assets, asset groups (‘disposal groups’) or operations (‘discontinued  \noperations’). Liabilities intended to be sold in a transaction together with assets are a  \npart of a disposal group or discontinued operations, and are reported separately under \nLiabilities held for sale. \nNon-current assets held for sale are no longer depreciated or amortised. They are  \nrecognised at fair value less costs to sell, as long as this amount is lower than the  \ncarrying amount. \nGains or losses on the valuation of specific assets held for sale and of disposal groups are \nstated under income from continuing operations until final completion of the sale. Gains or \nlosses on the valuation of discontinued operations and on certain assets of a discontinued \noperation, which are not subject to the valuation rules pursuant to IFRS 5, are stated under \nincome from discontinued operations. \nThe stock option plans granted by RWE to executives and members of corporate bodies  \nare accounted for as cash-settled share-based payment. At the balance-sheet date, a \nprovision is recognised in the amount of the prorated fair value of the payment  \nobligation. Changes in the fair value are recognised with an effect on income. The fair  \nvalue of options is determined using generally accepted valuation methodologies. \nProvisions are recognised for all legal or constructive obligations to third parties which \nexist on the balance-sheet date and stem from past events which will probably lead to an \noutflow of resources, and the amount of which can be reliably estimated. Provisions are \ncarried at their prospective settlement amount and are not offset against reimbursement \nclaims.

They remain outside profit or \nloss in subsequent periods as well. \nIn the case of defined contribution plans, the enterprise’s obligation is limited to the amount \nit contributes to the plan. Contributions to the plan are reported under staff costs. \nWaste management provisions in the nuclear energy sector are based on obligations under \npublic law, in particular the German Atomic Energy Act, and on restrictions from operating \nlicenses. These provisions are measured using estimates, which are based on and defined in \ncontracts as well as on information from internal and external specialists. \nProvisions for mining damage are recognised for obligations existing as of the balance-­\nsheet date and identifiable when the balance sheet is being prepared to cover land  \nrecultivation, resettlement and relocation and remediation of mining damage that has \nalready occurred or been caused. The provisions must be recognised due to obligations \nunder public law, such as the German Federal Mining Act, and formulated, above all, in \noperating schedules and water law permits. Such provisions are measured at full expected \ncost or according to estimated compensation payments. Cost estimates are based on \nexternal expert opinions to a significant extent. \nA provision is recognised to cover the obligation to submit CO2 emission allowances and \ncertificates for renewable energies to the respective authorities; this provision is primarily \nmeasured at the secured forward price of the CO2 allowances or certificates for renewable \nenergies. If a portion of the obligation is not covered with allowances that are available or \nhave been purchased forward, the provision for this portion is measured using the market \nprice of the emission allowances or certificates for renewable energies on the reporting \ndate. \nLiabilities consist of financial liabilities, trade accounts payable, income tax liabilities \nand derivatives and other liabilities. Upon initial recognition, these are generally stated at \nfair value including transaction costs and are carried at amortised cost in the periods \nthereafter (except for derivative financial instruments). Lease liabilities are measured at the \npresent value of the future lease payments. For subsequent measurements, the lease \npayments are divided into the financing costs and repayment portion of the outstanding \ndebt. Financing costs are distributed over the lease term in such a manner that a steady \ninterest rate is created for the outstanding debt.\nIf uncertain income tax items are recognised in income tax liabilities because they are \nprobable, the former are generally measured at the most likely amount. Measurement at \nexpected value is only considered in exceptional cases.\nMoreover, other liabilities also include contract liabilities. ­A contract liability is the \nobligation of the Group to transfer goods or services to a customer, for which we have \nalready received consideration or for which the consideration is already due.\nGovernment grants provided in relation to the acquisition of an asset are not deducted from \nthe cost of the subsidised asset; they are reported as deferrals under other liabilities. These \ndeferrals are reversed with an effect on income over the economic life of the subsidised asset. \nGovernment grants related to income are offset against the corresponding expenses. \nDerivative financial instruments are recognised as assets or liabilities and measured at fair \nvalue, regardless of their purpose. Changes in this value are recognised with an effect on \nincome, unless the instruments are used for hedge accounting purposes. In such cases, \nrecognition of changes in the fair value depends on the type of hedging transaction.\nFair value hedges are used to hedge assets or liabilities carried on the balance sheet \nagainst the risk of a change in their fair value.

Changes in the fair value of the firm \ncommitments with regard to the hedged risk result in the recognition of an asset or liability \nwith an effect on income. \nCash flow hedges are used to hedge the risk of variability in future cash flows related to an \nasset or liability carried on the balance sheet or related to a highly probable forecast \ntransaction. If a cash flow hedge exists, unrealised gains and losses from the hedging \ninstrument are initially stated as other comprehensive income. Such gains or losses are only \nincluded on the income statement when the hedged underlying transaction has an effect on \nincome. If forecast transactions are hedged and such transactions lead to the recognition of \na financial asset or financial liability in subsequent periods, the amounts that were  \nrecognised in equity until this point in time are recognised on the income statement in the \nperiod during which the asset or liability affects the income statement. If the transactions \nresult in the recognition of non-financial assets or liabilities, for example the acquisition of \nproperty, plant and equipment, the amounts recognised in equity without an effect on \nincome are included in the initial cost of the asset or liability. \nThe purpose of hedges of a net investment in foreign operations (net investment hedges) is \nto hedge the currency risk from investments with foreign functional currencies. With the \nexception of hedging costs, unrealised gains and losses from such hedges are recognised \nin other comprehensive income until disposal of the foreign operation. \nHedging relationships must be documented in detail and meet the following effectiveness \nrequirements:\n•\t there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, \n•\t the value change of hedging relationship is not dominated by the credit risk, and\n•\t the hedge ratio is the same as that resulting from the quantities used within the scope of \nrisk management.\nOnly the effective portion of a hedge is recognised in accordance with the preceding rules. \nThe ineffective portion is recognised immediately on the income statement with an effect \non income. \nContracts on the receipt or delivery of non-financial items in accordance with the company’s \nexpected purchase, sale or usage requirements (own-use contracts) are not accounted for \nas derivative financial instruments, but rather as executory contracts.

Contingent liabilities are only recognised on the balance sheet if they were \nassumed within the framework of a business combination.

The estimates can have an \nimpact on the recognised value of the assets and liabilities carried on the balance sheet, on \nincome and expenses and on the disclosure of contingent liabilities. \nAmongst other things, these assumptions and estimates relate to the accounting and \nmeasurement of provisions. With regard to non-current provisions, the discount factor \nand price increases to be applied are important estimates, in addition to the amount and \ntiming of future cash flows. The discount factor for pension obligations is determined on the \nbasis of yields on high-quality, fixed-rate corporate bonds on the financial markets as of the \nbalance-sheet date, in accordance with the maturities and due dates.\nThe rules governing valuation allowances for financial assets under IFRS 9 stipulate that the \nexpected credit losses must be determined.

Determination of the fair value is based \non valuation methods which require a projection of anticipated future cash flows. \nDeferred tax assets are recognised if realisation of future tax benefits is probable. Actual future \ndevelopment of income for tax purposes and hence the realisability of deferred tax assets, \nhowever, may deviate from the estimation made when the deferred taxes are capitalised. \nFurther information on the assumptions and estimates upon which these consolidated \nfinancial statements are based can be found in the explanations of the individual items. \nAll assumptions and estimates are based on valuation methods and input factors. These, in \nturn, are based on the circumstances and forecasts prevailing on the balance-sheet date. \nFurthermore, as of the balance-sheet date, realistic assessments of overall economic  \nconditions in the sectors and regions in which RWE conducts operations are taken into \nconsideration with regard to the prospective development of business. Actual amounts \nmay deviate from the estimated amounts if the overall conditions develop differently than \nexpected. In such cases, the assumptions, and, if necessary, the carrying amounts of the \naffected assets and liabilities are adjusted. \nAs of the date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements, it is not presumed \nthat there will be any material changes compared to the assumptions and accounting \nestimates. \nCapital management. The focus of RWE’s financing policy is on ensuring uninterrupted \naccess to the capital market. The goal is to be in a position to refinance maturing debts and \nfinance the operating activities at all times. Maintaining a solid rating and a positive \noperating cash flow from continuing activities serve this purpose.\nThe management of RWE’s capital structure is oriented towards a leverage factor of three \nor less. This indicator is calculated by adding material non-current provisions, with the \nexception of mining provisions, to net financial debt and comparing the resulting figure to \nthe adjusted EBITDA of the core business. RWE’s liabilities of relevance to net debt primarily \nconsist of (hybrid) bonds, commercial paper, tax equity liabilities, short-term borrowing and \nprovisions for pensions, nuclear waste management and wind and solar farms. \nIn the reporting period, the issuance of a mandatory convertible bond and cash flows from \ncontinuing operations had a positive effect on the RWE Group’s net cash. Conversely, capital \nexpenditures, in particular on wind and solar power, increased compared to the previous \nyear. In total, net financial assets amounted to €8.6 billion on 31 December 2022 and were \nthus lower than at the end of 2021 (€9.1 billion). Furthermore, net debt provisions fell by \n€1.8 billion to €6.9 billion (previous year: €8.7 billion). On average, provisions have a very long \nduration; their level is primarily determined by external factors such as the general level of \ninterest rates. A precise calculation of net debt / net cash and net financial debt / assets is \npresented on page 59 of the review of operations. In total, as of 31 December 2022, RWE’s \nnet cash amounted to €1.6 billion (previous year: €0.4 billion). As of 31 December 2022, the \nleverage factor was – 0.3 (previous year: – 0.1) and was thus well below the planned ceiling.\nRWE’s credit rating is influenced by a number of qualitative and quantitative factors. These \ninclude aspects such as the amount of cash flows and debt as well as market conditions, \ncompetition and the political framework. Our hybrid bonds also have a positive effect on \nour rating. The leading rating agency, Moody’s, classifies part of hybrid capital as equity. \nIn October and December 2022, the rating agencies Moody’s and Fitch both confirmed \ntheir credit ratings for RWE. RWE’s long-term creditworthiness is now classified as Baa2 \n(Moody’s) and BBB+ (Fitch), with a stable outlook.

      "text": "Changes in accounting regulations\nThe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has approved several amendments \nto existing IFRSs, which are effective for the RWE Group as of fiscal 2022 due to EU \nendorsement:\n•\t Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations: Reference to the Conceptual Framework \n(2020)\n•\t Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use \n(2020)\n•\t Amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: Onerous \nContracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (2020) )\n•\t Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 (2020)\nThese new regulations do not have any material effects on the RWE Group’s consolidated \nfinancial statements.\nChange in the reporting of amounts from CfD contracts. In the past, revenue contained \nstate subsidies for the sale of green electricity and the refund of such to the state, including \nsubsidies from contracts for differences (CfD). These contracts for differences are used as a \nstate subsidy mechanism within the framework of climate-protection measures and  \nessentially result in a fixed price for the electricity that is sold, by offsetting positive and  \nnegative deviations (in so-called two-way CfD contracts) and negative deviations (in  \nso-called one-way CfD contracts) from a defined reference price that is agreed with state \ncontractual partners or the subsidy mechanism counterparty. \nIn order to more accurately present the effects of these subsidy systems, starting from this \nreporting year the related refunds paid to government bodies are reported in the cost of \nmaterials. The prior-year figures were adjusted accordingly, as a result of which the revenue \nand cost of materials reported for the previous year both increased by €45 million.\n \nNew accounting policies\nThe IASB issued further standards and amendments to standards, which were not yet \nmandatory in the EU in fiscal 2022. These standards and amendments to standards, which \nare not expected to have any material effects on RWE’s consolidated financial statements, \nare listed below:\n•\t IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (2017)\n•\t Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as \nCurrent or Non-current (2020) and Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification \nof Liabilities as Current or Non-current – Deferral of Effective Date (2020)\n•\t Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (2021)\n•\t Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors \n(2021)\n•\t Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities \narising from a Single Transaction (2021)\n•\t Amendments to IFRS 17 Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 Comparative  \nInformation (2021)\n•\t Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Non-current Liabilities with \nCovenants (2022)\n•\t Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (2022)\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n139\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \n­statements\nNotes\n5\nFurther information"

      "text": "Notes to the Income Statement\n(1) Revenue\nRevenue is recorded when the customer has obtained control over goods or services.\nWe recognise income from the sale of the electricity generated by all of RWE Group’s \ngeneration technologies and the consumer business in revenue. Revenue resulting from the \ncommercial optimisation of generation dispatch is based on the net sale price, after \ndeduction of the relevant material costs. By contrast, all other revenue from our generation \nactivities and the consumer business is reported on a gross basis.\nIn the year under review, RWE did not generate reportable external revenue with any large \ncustomers (previous year: three large customers at €4,683 million, €2,475 million and \n€2,471 million in the Supply & Trading segment).\nA breakdown of revenue by division, geographical region and product is contained in the \nsegment reporting on pages 200 et seqq. \nThe item ‘natural gas tax / electricity tax’ comprises the taxes paid directly by Group companies. \nCertain performance obligations of the RWE Group were not yet or not yet fully met by the \nend of the fiscal year. The €1,816 million in revenue due from these performance obligations \n(previous year: €2,319 million) is expected to be received over the following three years. The \nreceipt of this revenue will depend on when these performance obligations to the customer \nare met. It does not include future revenue from contracts with an original contractual term \nof twelve months or less.\n(2)  Other operating income\nOther operating income\n2022\n2021\n€ million\nIncome from own work capitalised\n93\n47\nIncome from changes in product inventories\n3\n20\nIncome from release of provisions\n3\n20\nCost allocations / refunds\n88\n151\nIncome from disposal and write-back of non-current assets \nincluding income from deconsolidation\n2,065\n442\nIncome from derivative financial instruments\n2,867\n96\nCompensation and insurance benefits\n79\n33\nIncome from leases\n17\n16\nMiscellaneous\n668\n1,432\n5,883\n2,257\nTo improve the presentation of the development of business, unrealised and realised gains \nfrom contracts measured at fair value in the Supply & Trading segment are stated as a net \namount in income from derivative financial instruments.

      "text": "The amount of income from derivative financial instrument was mainly influenced by the \nhigh volatility of commodity market prices during the review period.\nIn the previous year, the miscellaneous operating income included the statutory  \ncompensation of €880 million for the residual production volumes of RWE-owned nuclear \npower plants which could no longer be used as a result of the accelerated German nuclear \nphaseout.\nIncome from the disposal of non-current financial assets and loans is disclosed under \nincome from investments if it relates to investments; otherwise it is recorded as part of the \nfinancial result as is the income from the disposal of current marketable securities. \nIn the segment Coal / Nuclear, during the reporting period the previously separate \ncash-generating units (CGU) Garzweiler and Hambach were combined into the CGU \nNord-Süd-Bahn, as there is a uniform decommissioning date within the framework of the \ncoal phaseout agreed with the Federal government for 2030. The new CGU Nord-Süd-Bahn \nincludes the Hambach and Garzweiler opencast mines, the Niederaußem and Neurath \npower stations and the refining operations. A write-back up of €801 million was recorded \nfor the CGU Nord-Süd-Bahn (recoverable amount: €1.0 billion; after-tax discount rate: \n5.25 %). Of this write-back, €794 million was recognised in property, plant and equipment \nand €7 million in intangible assets. Additionally, during the reporting period a write-back up \nto the amount of the depreciated cost of the CGU of €137 million was recorded for the CGU \nInden, on which impairments had been recognised in previous periods in accordance with \nIAS 36 (recoverable amount: €0.4 billion; after-tax discount rate: 5.25 %). The entire amount \nof this write-back was recognised in property, plant and equipment. The CGU Inden includes \nthe Inden opencast mine and the associated Weisweiler power station. The write-backs are \njustified primarily by the improvement in earnings expectations. \nIn the segment Hydro / Biomass / Gas, during the reporting period write-backs of  \n€462 million and €186 million were recorded for the CGU Dutch Power Plant Portfolio and \nthe CGU German Gas and Hydroelectric Power Plants, on which impairments had been \nrecognised in previous periods in accordance with IAS 36 (recoverable amounts:  \n€1.0 billion; after-tax discount rate: 5.25 %, and €4.0 billion; after-tax discount rate: 5.75 %, \nrespectively) as well as €304 million for previously impaired power plants in the United \nKingdom (recoverable amount: €1.5 billion; after-tax discount rate: 6.25 %). The write-backs \nwere applied exclusively to property, plant and equipment and are justified primarily by the \nimprovement in earnings expectations. The CGU Dutch Power Plant Portfolio includes the \ngas-, coal- and biomass-fired power plants in the Netherlands, while the CGU German Gas \nand Hydroelectric Power Plants contains the gas-fired and run-of-river power stations in \nGermany. The power plants in the United Kingdom are considered individually.\nOther write-backs of secondary importance which applied to property, plant and equipment \nwere mainly based on the improvement in earnings expectations.\nDetails on the calculation of recoverable amounts can be found on pages 142 et seq.

This essentially stemmed from a shorter-than-expected useful lifespan of the power \nplant, as a result of the UK government’s efforts to decarbonise the energy sector by 2035. \nIn the previous year, the impairment test in the Coal / Nuclear segment for the CGU  \nGarzweiler resulted in a write-down of €729 million on property, plant and equipment \n(recoverable amount: €0.1 billion; after-tax discount rate: 3.00 %). Additionally, impairments \nof €26 million were recognised in the previous year on property, plant and equipment \noutside of the CGU Garzweiler.\nOther impairments on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were recognised \nprimarily on the basis of cost increases, changes in price expectations and higher capital \ncosts. \nRecoverable amounts are generally determined on the basis of fair values less costs to sell; \nin the Onshore Wind / Solar segment, they are also determined on the basis of values in use. \nFair values are determined using valuation models based on planned cash flows.

In doing so, goodwill is allocated  \nto the cash-­generating units (CGUs). In the reporting period, the decision was made to \nmove the timing of the regular impairment test to the fourth quarter, and consequently a \nnew regular impairment was performed in the fourth quarter. The following information \npertains to the latest impairment test.\nThe recoverable amount of the CGU is determined, which is defined as the higher of fair \nvalue less costs to sell or value in use. Fair value is the best estimate of the price that an \nindependent third party would pay to purchase the CGU as of the balance-sheet date. \nValue in use reflects the present value of the future cash flows which are expected to be \ngenerated with the CGU. \nFair value less costs to sell is assessed from an external perspective and value in use from a \ncompany-­internal perspective. Values are determined using a business valuation model, \nbased on planned future cash flows. These cash flows, in turn, are based on the medium- and \nlong-term business plans, as approved by the Executive Board and valid at the time of the \nimpairment test. They pertain to a detailed planning period of three to ten years. The cash \nflow plans are based on experience as well as on expected market trends in the future. If \navailable, market transactions in the same sector or third-party valuations are taken as a \nbasis for determining fair value. Based on the use of internal planning assumptions, the \ndetermined fair values are assigned to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. \nThe medium- and long-term business plans are based on country-specific assumptions \nregarding the development of key economic indicators such as gross domestic product, \nconsumer prices, interest rate levels and nominal wages. These estimates are, amongst \nothers, derived from macro-economic and financial studies. \nOur key planning assumptions for the business segments active in electricity and gas \nmarkets relate to the development of wholesale prices of electricity, crude oil, natural gas, \ncoal and CO2 emission allowances, market shares and regulatory framework conditions.\nFor the renewables segments, the valuation is based on a normal wind year, which is \ncalculated as the average of the last 20 years.\nThe discount rates used for business valuations are determined on the basis of market \ndata. During the period under review, they were 6.00 % for the CGU Supply & Trading \n(previous year: 4.25 %), 5.50 % for Offshore Wind (previous year: 3.75 %), 5.75 % for Onshore \nWind / Solar (previous year: 3.50 %) and 6.00 % for Hydro / Biomass / Gas (previous year: \n4.00 %).\nIn the CGUs Offshore Wind and Onshore Wind / Solar, we used a growth rate of 0.75 % \n(previous year: 0.50 %) as a basis for extrapolating future cash flows going beyond the \nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\n3\nResponsibility statement\n5\nFurther information\n4\nConsolidated financial \n­statements\nNotes\n149"

      "text": "detailed planning period. For all of the other CGUs, we do not base the extrapolation of \nfuture cash flows going beyond the detailed planning period on growth rates. The growth \nrate for each segment is generally derived from experience and expectations of the future \nand does not exceed the long-term average growth rates of the respective markets in \nwhich the Group companies are active. The annual cash flows assumed for the years after \nthe detailed planning period include as a deduction capital expenditure in the amount \nnecessary to maintain the scope of business.\nAs of the balance-sheet date, the recoverable amounts of the CGUs, which are determined \nas the fair value less costs to sell, were higher than their carrying amounts. The surpluses \nreact especially sensitively to changes in the discount rate, the growth rate – insofar as such \nare used in the model – and cash flows in terminal value. The change in the CGU Offshore \nWind results from translation differences. \nOf all of the CGUs, the CGU Onshore Wind / Solar exhibited the smallest surplus of  \nrecoverable amount over the carrying amount.

Additionally, transaction costs related to the issuance of the \nmandatory convertible bond were offset directly against equity in the amount of \n€1,319,970. \nPursuant to a resolution passed by the Annual General Meeting on 26 April 2018, the \ncompany was further authorised until 25 April 2023 to acquire shares of the company up to \na volume of 10 % of the capital stock when the resolution on this authorisation was passed, \nor if the following is lower, when this authorisation is exercised. Based on the authorisation, \nthe Executive Board is authorised to cancel treasury shares without a further resolution by \nthe Annual General Meeting. Moreover, the Executive Board is authorised to transfer or sell \nsuch shares to third parties under certain conditions and excluding shareholders’ \n­subscription rights. Furthermore, treasury shares may be issued to holders of option or \nconvertible bonds under certain conditions. The Executive Board is also authorised to use \nthe treasury shares to discharge obligations from future employee share schemes; in this \nregard, shareholders’ subscription rights shall be excluded. \nNo treasury shares were held as of 31 December 2022, as was also the case at last year’s \nreporting date.\nIn fiscal 2022, RWE AG purchased a total of 424,120 RWE shares (previous year: 288,624) \nfor a purchase price of €16,794,705.09 on the capital market (previous year: \n€9,459,816.32).

This resulted in total \nproceeds of €16,596,862.76 (previous year: €9,356,616.42). The difference to the \npurchase price was offset against freely available retained earnings. \nAs a result of equity capital transactions with subsidiary companies which did not lead to a \nchange of control, the share of equity attributable to RWE AG’s shareholders changed by a \ntotal of €0 million (previous year: – €10 million) and the share of equity attributable to other \nshareholders changed by a total of €0 million (previous year: €6 million). \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) reflects changes in the fair values of \ndebt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, cash flow \nhedges and hedges of the net investment in foreign operations, as well as changes  \nstemming from foreign currency translation adjustments from foreign financial statements. \nAs of 31 December 2022, the share of accumulated other comprehensive income  \nattributable to investments accounted for using the equity method amounted to  \n– €35 million (previous year: – €11 million). \nDuring the reporting year, €17 million in differences from currency translation which had \noriginally been recognised without an effect on income were realised as income (previous \nyear: €7 million).\nDividend proposal\nWe propose to the Annual General Meeting that RWE AG’s distributable profit for fiscal \n2022 be appropriated as follows: \nDistribution of a dividend of €0.90 per share. \nThis dividend proposal is based on the number of shares issued at the time that the financial \nstatements were prepared.\nDividend\n€608,598,043.20\nProfit carryforward\n€60,919,561.45 \nDistributable profit\n€669,517,604.65 \n \n \nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\n3\nResponsibility statement\n5\nFurther information\n4\nConsolidated financial \n­statements\nNotes\n163"

The expenses associated with these are borne by the Group companies which \nemploy the persons holding notional stocks. \nThe LTIP SPP 2016-2020 was introduced in 2016. It uses an internal performance target (net \nincome of relevance to remuneration) derived from the mid-term planning and takes into \naccount the development of RWE AG’s share price. Executives receive conditionally granted \nvirtual shares (performance shares). The final number of virtual shares in a tranche is \ndetermined based on the achievement of the adjusted net income target. Each of the issued \nLTIP SPP tranches has a term of four years before payment is possible. \nThe plan conditions of the LTIP SPP were adjusted and extended for grants starting from \nfiscal 2021. In the future, along with the development of adjusted net income of relevance \nto remuneration, the share-based payment scheme LTIP SPP 2021 will orientate to two \nadditional success factors: the carbon footprint of our generation portfolio and the relative \ntotal shareholder return, which puts the total return of the RWE share in relation to that of \nother European utility stocks. These three success factors determine how many of the \nconditionally granted performance shares are finally granted at the end of the performance \nperiod. The performance period was extended from the previous one year to three years. \nOnce it ends, all three success factors will be given equal weight in calculating the final \ngrant. Thereafter, the performance shares must be held for a further year.

These are exposed to the typical risks of \nlongevity, inflation and salary increases.\nIn the reporting period, €36 million (previous year: €36 million) was paid into defined \ncontribution plans.

If ABP’s \nfunds are insufficient, it can either curtail pension benefits and future post-employment \nbenefits, or increase the contributions of the employer and employees. In the event that RWE \nterminates the ABP pension plan, ABP will charge a termination fee. Amongst other things, \nits level depends on the number of participants in the plan, the amount of salary and the \nage structure of the participants. As of 31 December 2022, we had around 550 active \nparticipants in the plan (previous year: approximately 600).\nRWE transferred assets to RWE Pensionstreuhand e.V. within the framework of a  \ncontractual trust arrangement (CTA) in order to finance the pension commitments of  \nGerman Group companies. There is no obligation to provide further funds. From the assets \nheld in trust, funds were transferred to RWE Pensionsfonds AG to cover pension commit-\nments to most of the employees who have already retired. RWE Pensionsfonds AG falls \nunder the scope of the Act on the Supervision of Insurance Undertakings and oversight by \nthe Federal Financial Supervisory Agency (BaFin). Insofar as a regulatory deficit occurs in the \npension fund, supplementary payment shall be requested from the employer. Independently \nof the aforementioned rules, the liability of the employer shall remain in place. The boards of \nRWE Pensionstreuhand e.V. and RWE Pensionsfonds AG are responsible for ensuring that \nthe funds under management are used in compliance with the contract and thus fulfil the \nrequirements for recognition as plan assets. In March 2021, RWE made an extraordinary \nfunding payment of €1,049 million to the assets held in trust, in order to further improve the \ncapital coverage of the domestic pension obligations.\nIn the United Kingdom, it is legally mandated that defined benefit plans are provided with \nadequate and suitable assets to cover pension obligations. The corporate pension system is \nmanaged by the sector-wide Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS). There are two \ndedicated, independent sections: the RWE Section and the Innogy Section. The sections are \nmanaged by trustees which are elected by members of the pension plans or appointed by \nthe sponsoring employers. The trustees are responsible for managing the pension plans. \nThis includes investments, pension payments and financing plans. The pension plans \ncomprise the benefit obligations and plan assets for the subsidiaries of the RWE Group. It \nis required by law to assess the required financing of the pension plans once every three years \nin compliance with the UK regulations for pensions (a so-called funding valuation). This \ninvolves measuring pension obligations on the basis of conservative assumptions, which \ndeviate from the requirements imposed by IFRS. The underlying actuarial assumptions \nprimarily include the projected life expectancies of the members of the pension plans as well \nas assumptions relating to inflation, imputed interest rates and the market returns on the \nplan assets. \nThe last funding valuation for the RWE Section occurred as at 31 March 2022. This \nvaluation had not been completed prior to the balance-sheet date. We do not expect that \nthe valuation will identify a financing deficit. For the Innogy Section, the last funding  \nvaluation as at 31 March 2021 did not reveal a financing deficit. The next funding  \nvaluation must occur by 31 March 2024. \nThe payments to settle a financing deficit that is identified are charged to the participating \ncompanies on the basis of a contractual agreement. Above and beyond this, payments are \nregularly made to finance the newly arising benefit obligations of active employees which \nincrease the pension claims. \nProvisions for defined benefit plans are determined using actuarial methods.

Additionally, some commitments grant annual \nadjustments of pensions, which may exceed the adjustments in compliance with the legally \nmandated adjustment obligation. \nSome domestic pension plans guarantee a certain pension level, taking into account the \nstatutory pension (total retirement earnings schemes). As a result, future reductions in the \nstatutory pension can result in higher pension payments by RWE. \nThe weighted average duration of the pension obligations was 12 years in Germany \n(previous year: 16 years) and 11 years outside of Germany (previous year: 16 years). \nIn fiscal 2022, RWE expects to make €45 million in payments for defined benefit plans \n(previous-year target: €65 million), as direct benefits and contributions to plan assets.\nProvisions for nuclear waste management are recognised in the full amount for the \nnuclear power plants Biblis A and B, Emsland and Gundremmingen A, B and C, as well as \nLingen and Mülheim-Kärlich. Provisions for waste disposal for the Dutch nuclear power plant \nBorssele are included at a rate of 30 %, in line with RWE’s stake. \nProvisions for nuclear waste disposal are almost exclusively reported as non-current \nprovisions, and their settlement amount is discounted to the balance-sheet date. Based on \nthe current state of planning, these provisions will essentially be used by the beginning of \nthe 2040s. The average discount rate calculated on the basis of the current level of market \ninterest rates for no-risk cash investments was 2.5 % as of the balance-sheet date (previous \nyear: 0.0 %); the average escalation rate based on current inflation expectations was 2.6 % \n(previous year: 1.5 %). As a result, the real average discount rate used for nuclear waste \nmanagement purposes, which is the difference between the average discount rate and the \naverage escalation rate, amounted to – 0.1 % (previous year: – 1.5 %). An increase (decrease) \nin this rate by 0.1 percentage point would reduce (increase) the present value of the \nprovision by roughly €30 million. \nExcluding the interest accretion, additions to provisions for nuclear waste management \nare mainly based on inflation-driven increases in the provisions as well as updates of the \ncost estimates and amount to €541 million. Of the changes in provisions, €6 million was \noffset against the corresponding costs of nuclear power plants still in operation.

A request to decommission and dismantle the nuclear power plant will \nbe filed with the nuclear licensing authority during its operating period so that the  \ndecommissioning and dismantling work can be performed in time after the expiry of the \noperating permit. Dismantling operations essentially consist of dismantling and removal of \nthe radioactive contamination from the facilities and structures, radiation protection and \nregulatory monitoring of the dismantling measures and residual operations. \nWe thus subdivide our provisions for nuclear waste management into the residual operation \nof nuclear power plants, the dismantling of nuclear power station facilities as well as the \ncost of residual material processing and radioactive waste treatment facilities.\nProvisions for the residual operation of nuclear power station ­facilities cover all steps that \nmust be taken largely independent of dismantling and disposal but are necessary to ensure \nthat the assets are safe and in compliance with permits or are required by the authorities. \nIn addition to works monitoring and facility protection, these mainly include service, recurrent \naudits, maintenance, radiation and fire protection as well as infrastructural adjustments. \nProvisions for the dismantling of nuclear power plant facilities include all work done to \ndismantle plants, parts of plants, systems and components as well as on buildings that must \nbe dismantled to comply with the Nuclear Energy Act. They also consider the  \nconventional dismantling of nuclear power plant facilities to fulfil legal or other obligations. \nProvisions for residual material processing and waste management include the costs of \nprocessing radioactive residual material for non-hazardous recycling and the costs of \ntreating radioactive waste produced during the plant’s service life and dismantling \noperations. This includes the various processes for conditioning, proper packaging of the \nlow-level and intermediate-level radioactive waste in suitable containers, and the  \ntransportation of such waste to BGZ Gesellschaft für Zwischenlagerung mbH (BGZ), which \nhas been commissioned by the Federal government for intermediate storage. This item also \ncontains the cost of transporting the waste produced by recycling and of the proper \npackaging of spent nuclear fuel elements, i. e. the cost of procuring and loading freight and \ninterim storage containers. \nCommissioned by the plant operator, the internationally renowned company NIS  \nIngenieurgesellschaft mbH, Alzenau, assesses the prospective costs of residual operation \nand dismantling of the nuclear power plants on an annual basis. The costs are determined \nspecifically for each facility and take into consideration the current state of the art, \nregulatory requirements and previous practical experience from ongoing and completed \ndismantling projects. Additionally, current developments are also incorporated into the cost \ncalculations. They also include the cost of conditioning and packaging radioactive waste \ngenerated during dismantling operations and the transportation of such waste to BGZ. \nFurther cost estimates for the disposal of radioactive waste are based on contracts with \nforeign reprocessing companies and other disposal companies.

The obligations include the anticipated \nresidual costs of reprocessing and returning the resulting radioactive waste. These costs \nstem from existing contracts with foreign reprocessing companies and with GNS. Moreover, \nthese provisions also include the costs for transport and intermediate storage containers \nfor and the loading of spent fuel assemblies within the framework of final direct storage. \nFurthermore, this item also includes the amounts for the professional packaging of  \nradioactive operational waste as well as the in-house personnel costs incurred for the \ndecommissioning of plants which are permanently shut down. \nProvisions for nuclear waste ­management\n€ million\n31 Dec 2022\n31 Dec 2021\nProvisions for nuclear obligations, not yet contractually defined\n3,940\n4,148\nProvisions for nuclear obligations, ­contractually defined\n1,764\n1,881\n5,704\n6,029\n \n \nProvisions for mining damage also consist almost entirely of non-current provisions and \nfully covered the volume of obligations as of the balance-sheet date.

The cost estimates are \nbased on internal planning and estimates and are largely backed by external expert  \nopinions. \nIn discounting the amounts used in the coming 30 years, we have oriented ourselves \ntowards the current market interest rates for risk-free cash investments. Since no market \ninterest rates are available for later periods, a sustainable, long-term interest rate is used to \ndiscount the amounts used after the next 30 years. The average discount rate was 3.2 % \n(previous year: 2.1 %). The majority of the provisions pertains to claims that are expected to \nmaterialise over the next 30 years. The average escalation rate based on current inflation \nexpectations was 2.2 % (previous year: 1.5 %). As a result, the real average discount rate \napplied for mining purposes, which is the difference between the average discount rate and \nthe average escalation rate, amounted to 1.0 % (previous year: 0.6 %). \nA decline of 0.1 percentage point in the real discount rate would increase the present value \nof the provision by around €130 million, while an increase of 0.1 percentage point would \nreduce the present value by around €120 million. \nExcluding the interest accretion, additions to provisions for mining damage amounted to \n€2,260 million in the reporting period. These mainly include the additional costs for  \nrecultivation of the Garzweiler opencast mine area due to the early phaseout of lignite-fired \npower generation in 2030, the inflation-driven increase in the obligatory volume and \nupdates of the cost estimates, of which €177 million was capitalised in the item ‘property, \nplant and equipment’.

Current market interest rates corresponding to the \nremaining maturity are used for discounting. \nDerivative financial instruments are recognised at their fair values as of the balance-sheet \ndate, insofar as they fall under the scope of IFRS 9. Exchange-traded products are  \nmeasured using the published closing prices of the relevant exchange. Non-exchange \ntraded products are measured on the basis of publicly available broker quotations or, if such \nquotations are not available, on generally accepted valuation methods. In doing so, we draw \non prices on active markets as much as possible. If such prices are not available, company-­\nspecific planning estimates are used in the measurement process.

Assumptions pertaining to the energy sector \nand economy are made within the scope of a comprehensive process with the involvement \nof both in-house and external experts. \nMeasurement of the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities is \nconducted on the basis of the net risk exposure per business partner. \nThe following overview presents the classifications of financial instruments measured at \nfair value in the fair value hierarchy prescribed by IFRS 13. The individual levels of the fair \nvalue hierarchy are defined as follows:\n•\t Level 1: Measurement using (unadjusted) prices of identical financial instruments formed on \nactive markets,\n•\t Level 2: Measurement on the basis of input parameters which are not the prices from \nLevel 1, but which can be observed for the financial instrument either directly (i. e. as \nprice) or indirectly (i. e. derived from prices),\n•\t Level 3: Measurement using factors which cannot be observed on the basis of market data. \n(27)  Reporting on financial instruments\nFinancial instruments are divided into non-derivative and derivative. Non-derivative \nfinancial assets essentially include other non-current financial assets, accounts receivable, \nmarketable securities and cash and cash equivalents. Financial instruments are recognised \neither at amortised cost or at fair value, depending on their classification. \nFinancial instruments are recognised in the following categories:\n•\t Debt instruments measured at amortised cost: the contractual cash flows solely consist \nof interest and principal on the outstanding capital: there is an intention to hold the \nfinancial instrument until maturity.\n•\t Debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income: the \ncontractual cash flows solely consist of interest and principal on the outstanding capital; \nthere is an intention to hold and sell the financial instrument. \n•\t Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income: the \noption to recognise changes in fair value directly in equity is exercised.\n•\t Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss: the contractual cash flows of \na debt instrument do not solely consist of interest and principal on the outstanding capital \nor the option to recognise changes in the fair value of equity instruments in other  \ncomprehensive income is not exercised.\nOn the liabilities side, non-derivative financial instruments principally include liabilities \nmeasured at amortised cost. \nFinancial instruments recognised at fair value are measured based on the published \nexchange price, insofar as the financial instruments are traded on an active market.

We limit these risks via systematic, \ngroupwide risk management. The range of action, responsibilities and controls are defined \nin binding internal directives. \nMarket risks stem from changes in exchange rates and share prices as well as interest \nrates and commodity prices, which can have an influence on business results. \nDue to the RWE Group’s international profile, currency management is a key issue. Fuels are \ntraded in British pounds and US dollars as well as in other currencies. In addition, RWE does \nbusiness in a number of currency areas. The companies of the RWE Group are required to \nhedge their foreign currency risks via RWE AG. Foreign currency risks arising from the  \ninvolvement in and the financing of the renewable energy business are hedged by  \nRWE Renewables International Participations B.V.\nInterest rate risks stem primarily from financial debt and the Group’s interest-bearing  \ninvestments. We hedge against negative changes in value caused by unexpected  \ninterest-rate movements using non-derivative and derivative financial instruments.\nOpportunities and risks from changes in the values of non-current securities are centrally \ncontrolled by a professional fund management system operated by RWE AG.\nThe Group’s other financial transactions are recorded using centralised risk management \nsoftware and monitored by RWE AG. \nFor commodity operations, risk management directives have been established by RWE AG’s \nControlling & Risk Management Department. These regulations stipulate that derivatives \nmay be used to hedge price risks. Furthermore, commodity derivatives may be traded, subject \nto limits. Compliance with limits is monitored daily.\nRisks stemming from fluctuations in commodity prices and financial market risks (foreign \ncurrency risks, interest rate risks, securities risks) are monitored and managed by RWE using \nindicators such as the Value at Risk (VaR) and sensitivities, amongst other things. In addition, for \nthe management of interest rate risk, a Cash Flow at Risk (CFaR) is determined. \nUsing the VaR method, RWE determines and monitors the maximum expected loss arising \nfrom changes in market prices with a specific level of probability during specific periods. \nHistorical price volatility is taken as a basis in the calculations. With the exception of the \nCFaR data, all VaR figures are based on a confidence interval of 95 % and a holding period \nof one day. For the CFaR, a confidence interval of 95 % and a holding period of one year is \ntaken as a basis. \nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\n3\nResponsibility statement\n5\nFurther information\n4\nConsolidated financial \n­statements\nNotes\n185"

Historical scenarios of ­extreme prices and realistic, fictitious price \nscenarios are modelled. In the event that the stress tests exceed internal ­thresholds, \nthese scenarios are then analysed in detail in relation to their impact and probability, \nand – if necessary – risk-mitigating measures are considered.\nCommodity risks of the Group’s power generation companies ­are managed by the  \nCommodity Management Committee (CMC) and hedged by the Supply & Trading segment \non the basis of available market liquidity in accordance with the guidelines from the  \nCommodity Strategy Group. In accordance with the approach for long-term investments for \nexample, it is not possible to manage commodity risks from long-term positions or positions \nwhich cannot be hedged due to their size and the prevailing market liquidity using the VaR \nconcept. As a result, these positions are not included in the VaR figures. Above and beyond \nopen production positions which have not ­yet been transferred, Group companies are not \nallowed to maintain significant risk positions, according to a Group guideline. Furthermore, \ncommodity price risks may exist in the gas storage business. The subsidiaries that own the \ngas storage facilities manage their positions independently, in compliance with  \nunbundling regulations.\nOne of our most important instruments to limit market risk is the conclusion of hedging \ntransactions. The instruments most commonly used are forwards and options with foreign \ncurrency, interest rate swaps, interest rate currency swaps, equity derivatives and forwards, \noptions, futures and swaps with commodities. \nMaturities of derivatives related to interest rates, currencies, equity, indices and commodities \nfor the purpose of hedging are based on the maturities of the underlying transactions and \nare thus primarily short term and medium term in nature. Hedges of the foreign currency risks \nof foreign investments have maturities of up to nine years. \nAll derivative financial instruments within the scope of IFRS 9 are recognised as assets or \nliabilities and are measured at fair value. When interpreting their positive and negative fair values, \nit should be taken into account that, with the exception of trading in commodities, these financial \ninstruments are generally matched with underlying transactions that carry offsetting risks. \nIn respect of interest rate risks, RWE distinguishes between two risk categories: on the one \nhand, increases in interest rates can result in declines in the prices of securities from the \nholdings of RWE. This pertains primarily to fixed-rate instruments. Price risk is measured  \nusing sensitivity analysis in relation to an interest rate change of 100 basis points. As of the \nbalance-­sheet date, it amounted to €35.6 million (previous year: €28.2 million). On the \nother hand, financing costs also increase along with the level of interest rates. The sensitivity \nof interest expenses to increases in market interest rates is measured with the CFaR. As of \n31 December 2022 this amounted to €86.1 million (previous year: €2.0 million). RWE  \ncalculates the CFaR based on the assumption of the refinancing of maturing debt. \nRisks related to financial positions in foreign currency are also measured using sensitivity \nanalysis, which shows the impact on the value of the position stemming from a 10 % change \nin the exchange rate. As of 31 December 2022, this sensitivity was €0.7 million (previous \nyear: €0.3 million).\nThe price risk of equities in RWE’s portfolio is also measured using sensitivity analysis. As of \nthe balance-sheet date, this analysis yielded the following results (before taxes): In the event \nof a 10 % rise in the relevant share prices, equity would increase by €370 million (previous \nyear: €490 million) and income by €4 million (previous year: €9 million). In the event of a 10 % \nfall in the relevant share prices, equity would decrease by €370 million (previous year: \n€490 million) and income by €4 million (previous year: €9 million).\nThe key internal control parameters for commodity positions at RWE Supply & Trading are \nthe VaR for the trading business and the VaR for the pipeline and liquefied natural gas \n(LNG) business. Here, the maximum VaR is €60 million and €45 million, respectively; in the \ncourse of the year, however, these were temporarily increased to €80 million and  \n€65 million. As of 31 December 2022, the VaR was €12.4 million in the trading business \n(previous year: €30.6 million) and €27.5 million for the pooled gas and LNG business  \n(previous year: €14.9 million).\nAdditionally, stress tests are carried out on a monthly basis in ­relation to the trading and \npooled LNG and gas business of RWE Supply & Trading to model the impact of commodity \nprice ­changes on the earnings conditions and take risk-mitigating measures if necessary.

Hedging \ninstruments consist of forwards, swaps and options with foreign currency and interest rates, \nand forwards, futures and swaps with commodities. Changes in the fair value of the \nhedging instruments – insofar as they affect the effective portion – are recorded in other \ncomprehensive income until the underlying transaction is realised. The ineffective portion of \nchanges in value is recognised in profit or loss. When hedging commodities, underlying and \nhedging transactions are based on the same price index. This generally does not result in \nineffectiveness. When hedging foreign currency risks, ineffectiveness can result from the \ndifference in timing between the origination of the hedged item and the hedging instrument. \nIneffectiveness can likewise stem from hedges containing material foreign currency basis \nspreads.

      "text": "meet their payment obligations. We identify these risks by conducting regular analyses of the \ncreditworthiness of our customers and initiate countermeasures if necessary. \nDue to the war in Ukraine, the coronavirus and the energy price crises, the economic \nsituation of many companies deteriorated and RWE’s business partners, competitors and \ncustomers may be impacted by the consequences of these crises. RWE is thus carefully \nmonitoring critical branches of the economy and exercising greater caution when conducting \nnew transactions or extending existing ones. If necessary, previously approved limits are \nbeing lowered.\nAmongst other things, RWE demands guarantees, cash collateral and other forms of \nsecurity in order to mitigate credit risks. Furthermore, RWE takes out credit insurance policies \nto protect against defaults. Bank guarantees received as collateral are from financial \ninstitutions with the required good ratings. Collateral for credit insurance is pledged by \ninsurers with an investment-grade rating.\nThe maximum balance-sheet default risk is derived from the carrying amounts of the \nfinancial assets stated on the balance sheet. The default risks for derivatives correspond \nto their positive fair values. Risks can also stem from financial guarantees and loan \ncommitments which we have to fulfil vis-à-vis external creditors in the event of a default of \na certain debtor. As of 31 December 2022, these obligations amounted to €2,133 million \n(previous year: €1,231 million). As of 31 December 2022, default risks were balanced \nagainst credit collateral, financial guarantees, bank guarantees and other collaterals \namounting to €7.5 billion (previous year: €10.1 billion). Of this, €1.0 billion relates to trade \nreceivables (previous year: €0.6 billion), €1.1 billion to derivatives used for hedging \npurposes (previous year: €1.5 billion), and €5.4 billion to other derivatives (previous year: \n€8.0 billion). There were no material defaults in fiscal 2022 or the previous year. \nIn the RWE Group, the risk provision for financial assets is determined on the basis of expected \ncredit losses. These are determined on the basis of the probability of default, loss given default \nand the exposure at default. We determine the probability of default and loss given default \nusing historical data and forward-looking information. The exposure at default date for \nfinancial assets is the gross carrying amount on the balance-sheet date. The expected \ncredit loss for financial assets determined on this basis corresponds to the difference \nbetween the contractually agreed payments and the payments expected by RWE,  \ndiscounted by the original effective interest rate. The assignment to one of the levels \ndescribed below influences the level of the expected losses and the effective interest  \nincome recognised. \n•\t Stage 1 – Expected 12-month credit losses: At initial recognition, financial assets are \ngenerally assigned to this stage – with the exception of those that have been purchased \nor originated credit impaired, which are thus considered separately. The level of impair-\nment results from the cash flows expected for the entire term of the financial instrument, \nmultiplied by the probability of a default within 12 months from the reporting date. The \neffective interest rate used for measurement is determined on the basis of the carrying \namount before impairment (gross).\n•\t Stage 2 – Lifetime expected credit losses (gross): ­If the credit risk has risen significantly \nbetween initial recognition and the reporting date, the financial instrument is assigned to \nthis stage. Unlike Stage 1, default events expected beyond the 12-month period from the \nreporting date are also considered in calculating the impairment. The effective interest \nrate used for measurement is still determined on the basis of the carrying amount before \nimpairment (gross).\n•\t Stage 3 – Lifetime expected credit losses (net): If in addition to the criteria for Stage 2 \nthere is an objective indication of an impairment, the financial asset is assigned to \nStage 3. The impairment is calculated analogously to Stage 2. In this case, however, the \neffective interest rate used for measurement is applied to the carrying amount after \nimpairment (net).\nIn the RWE Group, risk provisions are formed for financial instruments in the following \ncategories:\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\n3\nResponsibility statement\n5\nFurther information\n4\nConsolidated financial \n­statements\nNotes\n193"

In addition, a financial instrument is assigned to Stage 1 of the impairment \nmodel if the absolute credit risk is low on the balance-sheet date. \nThe credit risk is classified as low if the debtor’s internal or external rating is  \ninvestment-grade. For trade accounts receivable, the risk provision corresponds to the \nlifetime expected credit losses (Stage 2).\nTo determine whether a financial instrument is assigned to Stage 2 of the impairment \nmodel, it must be determined whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial \nrecognition. To make this assessment, we consider quantitative and qualitative information \nsupported by our experience and assumptions regarding future developments. In so doing, \nspecial importance is accorded to the sector in which the RWE Group’s debtors are active. \nOur experience is based on studies and data from financial analysts and government \nauthorities, amongst others. Special attention is paid to the following developments:\n•\t significant deterioration of the internal or external rating of the financial instrument,\n•\t unfavourable changes in risk indicators, e. g. credit spreads or debtor-related credit \ndefault swaps,\n•\t negative development of the debtor’s regulatory, technological or economic environment,\n•\t danger of an unfavourable development of business resulting in a significant reduction \nin ­operating income. \nIndependent thereof, a significant rise in credit risk and thus an assignment of the \nfinancial instrument to Stage 2 are assumed if the contractually agreed payments are \nmore than 30 days overdue and there is no information that contradicts the assumption \nof a payment default.\nWe draw conclusions about the potential default of a counterparty from information from \ninternal credit risk management. If internal or external information indicates that the \ncounterparty cannot fulfil its obligations, the associated receivables are classified as \nunrecoverable and assigned to Stage 3 of the impairment model. Examples of such \ninformation are:\n•\t The debtor of the receivable has apparent financial difficulties.\n•\t The debtor has already committed a breach of contract by missing or delaying payments.\n•\t Concessions already had to be made to the debtor. \n•\t An insolvency or another restructuring procedure is impending.\n•\t The market for the financial asset is no longer active.\n•\t A sale is only possible at a high discount, which reflects the debtor’s reduced creditwor-\nthiness.\nA payment default and an associated assignment of the financial asset to Stage 3 is also \nassumed if the contractually agreed payments are more than 90 days overdue and there is \nno information disproving the assumption of a payment default. Based on our experience, \nwe generally assume that this assumption does not apply to trade accounts receivable. \nA financial asset is impaired if there are indications that the counterparty is in serious \nfinancial difficulty and the situation is unlikely to improve. We may also take legal recourse \nand other measures in order to enforce the contractually agreed payments in the event \nof an impairment.\nThe following impairments were recognised for financial assets ­stated under the following \nbalance-sheet items within the scope of IFRS 7:\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\n3\nResponsibility statement\n5\nFurther information\n4\nConsolidated financial \n­statements\nNotes\n194"

      "text": "We bear legal and contractual liability from our membership in various associations \nwhich exist in connection with power plant projects, profit- and loss-pooling agreements, \nand for the provision of liability cover for nuclear risks, amongst others. \nOn the basis of a mutual benefit agreement, RWE AG and other parent companies of \nGerman nuclear power plant operators undertook to provide approximately €2,244 million \nin funding to liable nuclear power plant operators to ensure that they are able to meet their \npayment obligations in the event of nuclear damages. RWE AG has a 36.927 % contractual \nshare in the liability, plus 5 % for damage settlement costs.\nAs part of the Group restructuring that occurred in fiscal 2016, a large portion of the \npension commitments which up to then had been reported at the holding level were \ntransferred to former Group companies (former subsidiaries innogy SE, Essen, and affiliated \ncompanies) by cancelling the performance obligation existing on an intra-group basis. The \nguarantees remaining vis-à-vis external parties were cancelled. The Group is liable for the \naccrued claims of the active and former employees of these companies in the amount of \n€4,114 million (previous year: €5,875 million).\nRWE AG and its subsidiaries are involved in official, regulatory and antitrust proceedings, \nlitigation and arbitration proceedings related to their operations and are affected by the \nresults of such. In some cases, out-of-court claims are also filed. However, RWE does not \nexpect any material negative repercussions from these proceedings on the RWE Group’s \neconomic or financial position.\n(29)  Segment reporting\nRWE is divided into five segments, which are separated from each other based on functional \ncriteria. \nIn the Offshore Wind segment, we report on our business in offshore wind, which is overseen \nby RWE Offshore Wind. The main production sites are located in the United Kingdom and \nGermany. In addition to electricity generation, activities in this field also include the  \ndevelopment and realisation of projects to expand capacity. \nThe segment Onshore Wind / Solar encompasses our activities with onshore wind, solar \npower and parts of our battery storage. Here again, in addition to electricity generation, the \nfocus is on expanding capacities. Depending on the continent, RWE Renewables  \n(Europe / Australia) or RWE Renewables Americas has operating responsibility. Along with \nthe USA, the main production sites are located in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy,  \nSpain, Poland and the Netherlands, as well as in Australia in the field of solar power. \nActivities with run-of-river, pumped storage, biomass and gas-fired power plants are \nbundled in the Hydro / Biomass / Gas segment. It also contains the Dutch power stations \nAmer 9 and Eemshaven, which use hard coal and biomass, certain battery storage units \nand the company RWE Technology International, which specialises in project management \nand engineering services. This segment is the responsibility of RWE Generation, which is  \nalso responsible for formulating and implementing RWE’s hydrogen strategy. The 37.9 % \nstake in the Austrian energy utility KELAG is also reported in the Hydro / Biomass / Gas \nsegment.\nThe Supply & Trading segment handles the proprietary trading of energy commodities and \nintermediary trading with pipeline gas and LNG. This segment is the responsibility of  \nRWE Supply & Trading, which also supplies energy to some major industrial and commercial \ncustomers. Additionally, gas storage facilities in Germany and the Czech Republic also belong \nto this segment, as well as our LNG infrastructure development activities.\nThe Coal / Nuclear segment, which represents our non-core business, covers German \nelectricity production using coal and nuclear power, as well as lignite mining operations in \nthe Rhineland. It also includes the pro-rata activities of the Dutch power plant operator EPZ \n(30 %) and shares in the German company URANIT (50 %), which holds a 33 % stake in \nUrenco, a uranium enrichment specialist.

Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement correspond to the \namount stated on the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, \ndemand deposits and fixed-interest marketable securities with a maturity of three months \nor less from the date of acquisition. \nAmong other things, cash flows from operating activities include: \n•\t cash flows from interest and dividends of €381 million (previous year: €263 million) and cash \nflows used for interest expenses of €428 million (previous year: €284 million),\n•\t €77 million (previous year:  €163 million paid) in taxes on income received,\n•\t income from investments, corrected for items without an effect on cash flows, in particular \nfrom accounting using the equity method, which amounted to €262 million (previous year: \n€185 million),\n•\t variation margins paid in the amount of €4,026 million (previous year: €2,154 million received), \nof which €2,413 million related to trading activities (previous year: €2,923 million received). \nCash flows from the acquisition and sale of consolidated subsidiaries and other business \nunits are included in cash flows from investing activities, while effects stemming from \nIncome and expenses that are unusual from an economic perspective, or stem from \nexceptional events, prejudice the assessment of operating activities. They are reclassified to \nthe non-operating result. In addition to proceeds from the disposal of shareholdings or \nnon-current assets not necessary for operations, this item mainly covers effects from the \nvaluation of certain derivatives. These involve valuation effects which are only temporary \nand mainly arise because financial instruments to hedge price risks are reported at their fair \nvalue on the respective reporting date, while the hedged underlying transactions may only \nbe recorded with an effect on income upon the realisation of such. In fiscal 2022, we also \nadjusted the methodology for the presentation of the financial result in the table ‘Reconcili-\nation of income items’. Previously, this item only contained unadjusted components. Starting \nfrom this fiscal year, we report the adjusted financial result, which excludes special items. For \nexample, this removes one-off effects from the adjustment of discount rates, which we use \nto determine nuclear power or mining provisions and temporary gains or losses stemming \nfrom the measurement of currency derivatives used for hedging purposes. These kinds of \nspecial items are now reported in the non-operating result. The prior-year figures were \nadjusted accordingly.\nA loss of – €485 million is reported in the item ‘other’ (previous year: – €168 million). The \n2021 result included impairment charges on lignite-fired power plants and opencast mines \namounting to €780 million. In the reporting period, write-backs to our lignite-fired power \nplants and opencast mines in the amount of €962 million and to our operations in  \nHydro / Biomass / Gas in the amount of €952 million had a positive effect. There were \nburdens from additions to mining and restructuring provisions due to the early lignite \nphaseout (€1,157 million and €239 million). In addition to this, inflation-induced cost \nincreases made it necessary to raise the amount of mining and nuclear provisions.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\n3\nResponsibility statement\n5\nFurther information\n4\nConsolidated financial \n­statements\nNotes\n203"

On 31 January 2023, RWE \npurchased 100 % of the shares in the company Eemshaven Magnum B.V., Amsterdam, \nNetherlands. With this acquisition, RWE took over the gas-fired power plant Magnum with a \nnet capacity of around 1.4 GW, together with about 70 employees and related solar \nactivities of approximately 6 MW.\nThe preliminary purchase price amounts to €443 million. This may still change due to the \npurchase price mechanism. As a result, it is not possible to provide any information on the \nfinal purchase price and fair value of the assets involved, including the receivables and \ndebts acquired.\nPurchase of Con Edison’s renewable energy business.

This acquisition was agreed with the US group Con Edison, Inc., New York, USA, in \nOctober 2022. CEB is a leading renewables company in the United states, with 3.1 GW of \npower generation capacity, around 90 % of which comes from solar systems. The portfolio is \ncomplemented by a development pipeline which could contribute more than 7 GW.\nThe transaction was based on an enterprise value of US$ 6.8 billion.

As a result, it is not possible to provide any \ninformation on the final purchase price and fair value of the assets involved, including the \nreceivables and debts acquired.\nAcquisition of the UK developer JBM Solar. On 1 March 2023, RWE acquired 100 % of the \nshares in the UK photovoltaic and battery storage developer JBM Solar Ltd, Cardiff, United \nKingdom. Along with a PV project pipeline with a total capacity of around 3.8 GW and  \n2.3 GW of battery storage, RWE is also taking on a team of around 30 employees.\nThe purchase price was based on an enterprise value of approximately £355 million. The \nfinal purchase price will be determined taking into account JBM Solar’s net debt and net \nworking capital as at the time of acquisition on 1 March 2023. This information was not yet \navailable when RWE’s consolidated financial statements were finalised.

At a British capacity market auction in \nFebruary 2023, all participating RWE power stations secured a capacity payment. RWE \nassets with 6,638 MW of generation capacity qualified at the auction. From 1 October \n2026 to 30 September 2027 they will receive a payment of £63 / kW / year (plus inflation \nadjustment).\nRWE and Equinor agree strategic partnership. In January 2023, RWE and Equinor \nentered into a strategic partnership to drive the ramp-up of the hydrogen economy and the \nexpansion of renewables. With the help of major projects, the two companies are working \ntowards using Norwegian hydrogen to decarbonise the German energy economy. The plan \nis for Equinor to create up to 2 GW of capacity for producing ‘blue’ hydrogen in its domestic \nmarket of Norway by 2030. Adding the term ‘blue’ highlights the fact that the hydrogen is \ngenerated using fossil fuels (e. g. methane) and the resulting carbon dioxide is stored \nunderground. The hydrogen would be transported via a North Sea pipeline to Germany, \nwhere it would be used for power generation. For this purpose, RWE and Equinor are looking \nto build hydrogen-capable gas-fired power stations totalling 3 GW over the current decade. \nIn addition, the partners are considering building offshore wind farms and electrolysers near \nthe North Sea pipeline, so green hydrogen, which is to slowly replace blue hydrogen, can be \nfed into the grid. The cooperation with Equinor also includes purely wind power projects in \nNorway and Germany that are exclusively focused on power production. One basic  \nrequirement for the realisation of these major projects is the completion of the hydrogen \npipeline between Norway and Germany. In addition, Germany’s hydrogen infrastructure will \nhave to be sufficiently developed.\nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\n3\nResponsibility statement\n5\nFurther information\n4\nConsolidated financial \n­statements\nNotes\n208"

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained \nis sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated \nfinancial statements and on the group management report.\nKey Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most \nsignificance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from \nJanuary 1 to December 31, 2022. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit \nof the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion \nthereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\nIn our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows:\n\t Recoverability of goodwill\n\t Measurement of property, plant and equipment in the “Coal / Nuclear” and “Hydro /  \nBiomass / Gas” segments\n\t Measurement of provisions for mining damage and restructuring\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows:\n\t Matter and issue\n\t Audit approach and findings\n\t Reference to further information \nHereinafter we present the key audit matters:\n   Recoverability of goodwill\n\t In the consolidated financial statements of RWE Aktiengesellschaft, goodwill amounting \nto EUR 2.8 billion (2.0 % of consolidated total assets) is reported under the “Intangible \nassets” balance sheet item. \n\t\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually or when there are indications of impairment, \nto determine any possible need for write-downs. The carrying amounts of the relevant \ncash-generating units, including goodwill, are compared with the corresponding \nrecoverable amounts in the context of the impairment tests. The recoverable amount is \ngenerally calculated on the basis of fair value less costs of disposal. The impairment \ntests are performed at the level of the cash-generating units or groups of cash- \ngenerating units to which the respective goodwill is allocated. The measurements to \ncalculate the fair value less costs of disposal carried out for the purposes of the  \nimpairment tests are based on the present values of the future cash flows generally \nderived from the planning projections for the next three years (medium-term plan) \nprepared by the executive directors and acknowledged by the supervisory board. \nExpectations relating to future market developments and country-specific assumptions \nabout the performance of macroeconomic indicators are also taken into account. \nPresent values are calculated using discounted cash flow models. The discount rate \napplied is the weighted average cost of capital for the relevant cash-­generating unit. \nThe impairment test determined that no write-downs were necessary. The outcome of \nthese valuations is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive \ndirectors of the future cash inflows of the cash-generating units, and on the respective \ndiscount rates, rates of growth and other assumptions employed. The measurement is \ntherefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background and due to the \nunderlying complexity of the measurement, this matter was of particular significance in \nthe context of our audit.\n\t As part of our audit, we, among other things, evaluated the method used for performing \nimpairment tests and assessed the calculation of the weighted average cost of capital. \nIn addition, we assessed whether the future cash inflows underlying the measurements \ntogether with the weighted average cost of capital used represent an appropriate basis \nfor the impairment tests overall. We evaluated the appropriateness of the future cash \nRWE Annual Report 2022\n1\nTo our investors\n2\nCombined review \n­of ­operations\n3\nResponsibility statement\n4\nConsolidated financial \n­statements\nIndependent auditor’s report\n5\nFurther information\n270"

In this context, we also assessed whether the costs of Group \nfunctions were properly included in the respective cash-generating unit. With the \nknowledge that even relatively small changes in the discount rate applied can have \nmaterial effects on the fair values less costs of disposal calculated in this way, we also \nfocused our assessment on the parameters used to determine the discount rate applied, \nand evaluated the measurement model. Furthermore, we evaluated the sensitivity \nanalyses performed by the Company in order to assess any impairment risk (carrying \namount higher than recoverable amount) in the event of a reasonably possible change \nin a material assumption underlying the measurement. Overall, the measurement  \nparameters and assumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our \nexpectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be reasonable.\n\t The Company’s disclosures relating to goodwill are contained in the notes to the \nfinancial statements in section “Notes to the Balance Sheet” in note “(10) Intangible \nassets”. \n\t Measurement of property, plant and equipment in the “Coal / Nuclear” and \n“Hydro / Biomass / Gas” segments\n\t In the consolidated financial statements of RWE Aktiengesellschaft, property, plant and \nequip-ment amounting to EUR 5.7 billion in total (4.1 % of consolidated total assets) is \nreported in the “Coal / Nuclear” and “Hydro / Biomass / Gas” segments. The Company \nidentified indications for both impairment and reversals of impairment on assets in the \n“Coal / Nuclear” and “Hydro / Biomass / Gas” segments due to the major changes in the \npolitical and economic environment (including significantly increased interest rates and \nprices), and consequently carried out impairment tests. The measurement of items of \nproperty, plant and equipment was tested on the basis of their fair values less costs of \ndisposal that exceed their values in use. The fair values of the respective property, plant \nand equipment are determined by the Company as the present value of the future cash \nflows using discounted cash flow models. The budget projections for the coming three \nyears (medium-term planning) prepared by the executive directors and acknowledged \nby the supervisory board are used as a basis and extrapolated on the basis of long-term \nassumptions with regard to electricity, coal, natural gas and CO2 certificate prices as \nwell as the planned service lives of the power plants. The assessment of the  \nmeasurement of property, plant and equipment identified write-downs amounting in \ntotal to EUR 136 million and the need to reverse write-downs by a total of \nEUR 1.924 million. The outcome of these valuations is dependent to a large extent on \nthe estimates made by the executive directors of the future cash flows, and on the \ndiscount rates and other assumptions employed. The measurements are therefore \nsubject to considerable uncertainties, meaning that this matter was of particular \nsignificance in the context of our audit. \n\t As part of our audit, we, among other things, evaluated the method used for testing the \nmeasurement of property, plant and equipment and assessed the calculation of the \nweighted average cost of capital.

Overall, the measurement parameters and \nassumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are \nalso within the ranges considered by us to be reasonable.\n\t The Company’s disclosures relating to reversals of write-downs on items of property, \nplant and equipment are contained in the notes to the financial statements in section \n“Accounting policies”, and in section “Notes to the Income Statement” in note “(2) Other \noperating income” and note “(5) Depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses”.\n3 \t Measurement of provisions for mining damage and restructuring\n1 \t In the consolidated financial statements of RWE Aktiengesellschaft, provisions for \nmining damage and restructuring (hereinafter “provisions”) amounting to EUR 7.2 billion \n(5.2 % of total assets) are reported under the “Provisions” balance sheet item. The \nmaterial reason for assessing and recognizing additions to these provisions was the \npolitical understanding reached in October 2022 between the Federal Ministry of \nEconomics and Climate Protection, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Industry, Climate \nAction and Energy of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia, and RWE AG to phase out \ncoal in the Rhenish lignite area early by 2030. For the purposes of measuring the \nprovisions, the expected future payments at the prices as of the end of the reporting \nperiod were first escalated using expected price increases, and then discounted using  \nan appropriate rate of interest to calculate the settlement amount. This was based on \nthe restoration plans drawn up by the executive directors using opinions issued by \nexternal experts. The escalation and discount rates were modified in the financial year  \nto reflect incurring expenditure at an earlier date as a result of bringing forward the coal \nphaseout, as well as the market rate of interest for this amended period. The result of \nmeasuring provisions depends to a large extent on the executive directors’ planning \nassumptions and estimates as to the amount and timing of future cash outflows,  \nas well as of the escalation and discount rates used for the measurement models. The \nmeasurements are therefore subject to considerable uncertainties, meaning that this \nmatter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n2 \t As part of our audit, we began by assessing whether the conditions for recognizing the \nearlier coal phaseout in the consolidated financial statements were fulfilled on their  \nmerits. We then evaluated which obligations could have increased in value. As part of  \nour audit of the provisions for existing obligations, we assessed, among other things,  \nthe measurement method and evluated the calculation of the discount and escalation \nrates. In addition, we assessed whether the future cash outflows underlying the  \nmeasurements together with the discount and escalation rates used represent an \nappropriate basis for the measurement overall. We evaluated the appropriateness of  \nthe future cash outflows used in the calculations, among other things by comparing this \ndata with the planning projections and restoration plans prepared by the executive \ndirectors and by reconciling them against general and sector-specific market  \nexpectations. In the knowledge that even relatively small changes in the discount rates \nand, in the measurement of restoration provisions, the escalation rates applied can in \nsome cases have a material impact on the settlement amount calculated in this way, we \nalso focused our testing on the parameters used to determine the discount and \nescalation rates applied, and assessed the respective calculation model. We inspected \nthe opinions drawn up by external experts and assessed their usability, among other \nthings by evaluating the assumptions they contained and checking them for plausibility. \nOverall, the measurement parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors \nare in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be \nreasonable.\n3 \t The Company’s disclosures relating to the effects of the earlier coal phaseout in \nGermany on the measurement of provisions are contained in the notes to the financial \nstatements in section “Notes to the Balance Sheet” in note “(22) Provisions”.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty \nexists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in \nthe consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such \ndisclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions.
