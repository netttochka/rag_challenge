Hon Sir Stephen O’Brien KBE\nChairman\nThis time last year, we were coming through the challenges  \nof the Covid-19 pandemic and looking forward to returning to \n‘business as usual’. Little did we know what was coming down \nthe line for 2022.\nChairman’s statement\nBut I’m happy to say that our customers have been able to count \non excellent service during these difficult times and this is credit \nto the dedication, determination and commitment of our people, \nparticularly those in customer-facing positions. I’m proud of the \npositive impact Motability Operations has on the lives of disabled \npeople and their families. No one at Motability Operations has lost \nsight of the fact that they’re dealing with people who may need us \nmore than ever to help them enjoy their freedom and independence. \nThe challenges of the past few years for the business have been \nsubstantial: working through the Covid-19 pandemic, adapting (very \nsuccessfully) to hybrid working, a global shortage of semiconductors \nhaving a serious impact on the availability of new cars, and now the \nhorrific war in Ukraine exacerbating rising fuel prices and supply chain \nissues. Our customers have been affected by all of these problems, \nalong with growing cost-of-living challenges. So it’s been even more \nimportant for us to support the affordability of their Scheme vehicle.\nThis year, when we were reviewing the way the Scheme runs we found \nthat because our customers are taking such good care of their vehicles, \nwe can pay £350 of the Good Condition Payment early. We hope this \npayment can provide some help and keep our customers on the road, \nat a time when all costs are rising. Please read more about how we \nare reinvesting for our customers on page 7.\nFocusing on what’s important for our customers\n‘Business as usual’ looks very different at the moment, but I’m \ndelighted that we can continue to support our customers: our \nlatest customer satisfaction ratings still stand at 9.6 out of 10, \ndespite the upheavals of the past few years. \nPlanning for a greener and more connected future is key to the \ndevelopment of the business, and the Board is fully behind our \nCEO Andrew Miller, who is driving innovation throughout Motability \nOperations. ‘Lean into green’ – our transition to an electric fleet – is well \nunderway. As one of the UK’s largest leasers of electric vehicles (EVs), \nwe’re leading the way to carbon-free motoring and the phasing out of \ninternal combustion engine vehicles by 2030.\nMotability Operations continues to be an extremely well-run business \nunder Andrew’s leadership. The Board is supportive of the strategy, \nclarity of vision and purpose he has brought to the Company. We have \nan excellent leadership and executive team, and this year I’ve been \ndelighted to welcome Peter Pritchard onto the Board as a Non-\nExecutive Director. Peter’s long career in retail, online and offline, \nbrings a wealth of experience and insight for the team to draw upon.\nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n9"

We work closely together to develop products and \nservices to make life easier for our customers and their families, such \nas when we first enabled parents of children with disabilities to use \ntheir allowance to lease a Motability Scheme vehicle.\nWe’re pleased that as a result of headroom in our financial results this \nyear we were able to donate £200m to Motability, the Charity.

      "text": "We’re prepared to support our customers \nthrough tough times\nAndrew Miller\nCEO, Motability Operations\nThe two years I’ve spent at Motability Operations so far have \nbeen unlike any the business has faced before, and we expect \nthe year ahead will be just the same. That’s why we think \nlong term – planning for hard times in good times. \nOur customers’ mobility is our top priority, so our business model is \ndesigned to make sure the Scheme is stable and sustainable. It’s at \ntimes like now, with rising costs across the board, that our model \ndelivers and we can give our customers peace of mind that the \nScheme will continue to be there for them.\nI’m proud to lead our team, who are all fiercely committed to supporting \nour customers as they navigate current challenges brought on by the \nrising cost of living and disruption in the car market – which we know \nimpacts people with disabilities more than most.\nThe long-term resilience of our business model means we have the \nfinancial and organisational strength to maintain the Scheme, and \ninnovate for the future. \nFor our customers, the Scheme means freedom\nWe measure our effectiveness by the impact we have on our \ncustomers’ lives and are proud to be a purpose-driven organisation. \nWe’ve worked hard this year to be really clear about what we mean \nby this, and you’ll see it set out on page 3. Our purpose empowers us \nto prepare for the future of mobility and unites us as an organisation \nto deliver for our customers. \nCEO statement\nWe run the Scheme to provide the best possible value. As the owner \nand operator of the country’s biggest vehicle fleet, we use our scale \nto negotiate the best deals on our customers’ behalf, and our worry-\nfree package goes well beyond providing ‘just’ a vehicle. On average, \nour package is 45% cheaper than other commercial alternatives, which \nis why our customers score us 9.5 out of 10 for affordability and 9.7 for \nbeing worry-free, which also explains our overall score of 9.6 out of 10 \nfor satisfaction.\nOur focus will always be to support customers to enjoy their everyday \nfreedom. They rely on the Scheme to get from A to B, and we work hard \nto make sure they get there, whatever crops up en route. If a Scheme \ncustomer has a puncture on the motorway, our partner, the RAC, acts \nas an extension of our own team: from getting the car and the \ncustomer home, taking care of tyre fitters, to organising a hire \ncar or taxi for the next day. Just one call to sort everything. \nOur customers tell us that they view the Scheme as a lifeline. Having \ntheir own vehicle gives customers a sense of security and ‘normality’ \nin their day-to-day lives. Public transport and second-hand vehicles \nare not seen as viable alternatives as they would mean big compromises \non our customers’ functional, financial and mental well-being. Even in \nthe context of the rising cost of living, the Scheme is seen to offer great \nvalue for money.\nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n13"

Despite being in a market where all our costs are rising, \nwe want our customers to rely on our worry-free package that \nkeeps them mobile.\n•\t And as the UK commits to reaching net zero, we’ve started to see \nresults from our investment of £300m in supporting our customers \nwith the transition to electric vehicles (EVs). We’re making EVs \nmore affordable, as well as installing home chargepoints, investing \nin innovative solutions for our customers, and working with \nmanufacturers and converters to help electrify our Wheelchair \nAccessible Vehicle (WAV) fleet. We simply won’t let our customers \nbe left behind in the switch to electric.\nSee page 7 for more information on our reinvestments\nOur capital reserves help us deliver for customers\nWe have a responsibility to ensure our customers can afford to \nstay mobile.\nAs our Chairman, Sir Stephen O’Brien, referred to in his statement, \nwe’re facing one of the toughest operating environments in our history. \nThe well-publicised supply chain issues, have seen the global supply of \nnew cars plummet since the start of the pandemic. Throughout this \ntime, we’ve been working with our manufacturing and dealer partners \nto make as many new cars as possible available for Motability Scheme \ncustomers in very challenging circumstances. In fact, we’ve actually \nincreased our market share of all new cars in the UK from 9% in 2015 \nto 16% in 2022. \nThis year has also seen a significant rise in our capital reserves because \nused-car prices have been unusually high, so we’re reinvesting this \nmoney to keep the Scheme as affordable as possible, now and in the \nfuture. We don’t pay shareholder dividends – any profits we make are \nused to keep prices affordable for our customers, provide donations to \nMotability, the Charity, or are returned to our customers. \nSee page 7 for more detail on how we reinvest in our customers\nAlongside measures to improve affordability, we’re also addressing \nissues of availability through extending leases for any customers who \nneed this. Our focus is on keeping our customers mobile.\nGoing green by 2030\nWe aren’t letting the challenging operating environment of today \ndistract us from the opportunities for the future. We’re already \nleveraging our purchasing power to be a leader in the transition \nto electric – and are proud to be at the forefront of the country’s \njourney to carbon-free motoring by 2030.\nWe buy over 10% of all new electric vehicles in the UK, making us \none of the largest EV buyers in the country. We’re also one of the \nUK’s biggest installers of home chargepoints. With the help of our \ninstallation partners Ohme and Easee, we arrange and cover the cost \nof a home chargepoint and standard installation for our EV customers \n– and we’re funding innovative solutions for the future of motoring. \nI’m delighted that our new innovation team is playing a leading role \nin championing accessibility in new technology. \nSee page 34 for more information \nAs a purpose-driven organisation, we’re committed to making an impact. \nSustainability is right at the heart of this, and we have begun the process \nof seeking accreditation as a certified B Corp. The assessment will help \nus measure and manage our impact on our people, our customers, our \nsuppliers, our communities and the environment around us.

This has inevitably led to extended wait times \nfor a new vehicle, so we have focused on keeping our customers mobile \nby providing automatic six-month lease extensions. A knock-on effect \nof the shortage of new vehicles has seen increased demand for used \nvehicles across the market, with used-car values continuing to track \nabove expectations. \nThis has had a direct impact on the value of our fleet, leading to higher \nvehicle resale prices at the end of a lease, and reduced depreciation \ncharges as we assess future residual values. These effects are covered \nin more detail throughout this report; however, this financial upside has \nprovided us with enough capital headroom to commit to a number of \ndirect and indirect investments to support customers through these \nchallenging times. \nSee page 7 for more information\nCustomer numbers, renewal rates and affordability\nOur year-end fleet stood at 652k, reflecting a 0.6% growth in customer \nnumbers during 2022. Despite a strong order-bank (from new and \nrenewing customers), our ability to fulfil orders continues to be \nsignificantly impacted by the global lack of new vehicles. \nAs a consequence, our customer order bank stood at 117k at \n30 September 2022 (an increase of 35k year-on-year), with lead times \n(from application to delivery) at 25 weeks compared to an order bank \nof 42k and a typical lead time of 10 weeks pre-pandemic, pre-supply \nchallenges. This has also resulted in the continued growth in the number \nof customers in lease extension (as we automatically extend leases to \nkeep customers mobile), with volumes standing at 135.9k at \n30 September 2022 (FY2021: 79.0k). \nWhilst we aim to provide a broad range of suitable vehicles at \naffordable prices, the supply-side constraints (which are expected \nto continue beyond 2023) and model range rationalisation by \nmanufacturers have affected the choices available to our customers. \nIn the final quarter’s price list (July-September 2022) there were 60 \nvehicles priced at “nil advance payment” compared to 205 vehicles \nin the same quarter last year.\nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n23"

      "text": "Financial overview\nWe continue to target a 1.5% post-tax return on assets in order to \nprovide sustainability into the long-run and ensure that there is built-in \nrecoverability in the event of market downturn. The unguaranteed \nresidual value of our fleet was £8.7 billion at September 2022, meaning \nthat a 1% movement in used-car values would impact us by £87.2m. \nThis means that whilst we hold capital reserves to provide protection \nagainst unexpected downside movements in values (so we can insulate \ncustomers from these financial impacts), any positive movements can \nlead to above target profitability.\nDuring the year ended September 2022, the strength of the used car \nmarket has been the primary driver of a post-tax profit of £922.9m, \nrepresenting a 7.8% return on assets. \nRevenue: Total revenue increased by 5.8% to £4,708.4m \n(FY2021: £4,449.5m).\n•\t Rental revenue £2,172.2m (FY2021: £2,054.2m): The increase is largely \ndriven by an increase in our customer numbers plus a 3% uplift in \nmobility allowances from April 2022 (allowances are uplifted each \nApril based on the Consumer Price Index recorded in the previous \nSeptember).\n•\t Disposal revenue £2,482.4m (FY2021: £2,357.6m): The increase year \non year comes despite a fall in disposal volumes from 201k in FY2021 \nto 163k in FY2022. Average sales values increased significantly during \nthe year, as outlined below.\nVehicle remarketing profit: £723.4 million (FY2021: £416.4m).\n•\t The strength of used car values across the industry has resulted in \nsignificant profitability upon vehicle resale at the end of lease. \nAverage gross sale values for car disposals were £15.7k across \nFY2022, an increase of 49.5% on sale values that were achieved in \nFY2019 (£10.5k). The crystallisation of blocked appreciation highlighted \nin the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts has contributed to this result. \nThis is where anticipated revaluation gains were not adjusted through \ndepreciation, as assets cannot be appreciated to a point above \nthe written down value at the beginning of the financial period.\nAssets and residual values: operating lease assets were  \n£9.6bn at September 2022 with an unguaranteed residual value \nof £8.7bn. \n•\t We undertake a quarterly reassessment of the anticipated value of \nthe fleet, and at each financial period-end recalibrate depreciation \nto reflect any movements in residual values. \n•\t The revaluation seeks to attribute a value to the existing fleet (which \nwe will return to market over the next three years). At September \n2022 the estimate of fleet value is significantly increased by a \npositive underlying base (current market value of three-year-old \ncars) and a buoyant medium-term outlook, reflecting favourable \ndemand conditions as a consequence of the continued new-vehicle \nsupply challenges. The projected revaluation anticipates a net gain \nof £1,628.5m after adjusting for selling costs and early termination \nleases. This positive outlook drives a depreciation credit of £577.4m \nin 2022. This impact, together with a £154.3m credit brought forward \nfrom prior year revaluation exercises, reduces the 2022 depreciation \ncharge by a total of £731.7m. \n•\t However, as referenced earlier, not all of the net revaluation gains \ncan be recognised through adjusted (reduced) depreciation, as \nassets cannot be appreciated to a point above the written down \nbook value at the beginning of the financial period. The positive \nmovement in forecast values may additionally result in vehicle \nremarketing profitability in future periods of up to £261.0m \nproviding that the current assessment of future values holds.\nInvesting to support \nour customers\nOur customers’ mobility is too important  \nto take risks with.

So we are pleased \nto be able to commit £645m of capital to support affordability across \nthe next two to three years. In effect we will be subsidising lease \nprices to ensure that a wider range of vehicles are more affordable \nfor our customers (including a broader offering at “nil advance \npayment”) as vehicle supply begins to normalise.\nCharity support – £200m donation to Motability, the Charity\n•\t Our capital headroom has also enabled our board to approve the \npayment of a £200m donation to Motability.

It is anticipated that approximately 70% of these \nfunds will be deployed in the form of grants to support customer \naffordability as they access the Scheme. The FY2022 result is net \nof this £200m donation.\nFinancial implications as we deploy our capital \nheadroom\nThe board is confident that Motability Operations has the capital \ncapacity and liquidity to support the investments outlined above. \nIn effect we are utilising capital headroom (over and above the \nprudently calculated capital requirement, set at a 99.99% confidence \nlevel, plus buffer). Whilst the donation to Motability, the Charity, has \nalready been recognised in the FY2022 financial statements, the nature \nof the wider affordability investments means that these will spread \nforward across multiple years. In effect we will deploy our capital \nheadroom to subsidise future lease price by pricing in a below 1.5% \nor negative return on asset. Importantly, these investments are \ntimebound, and once utilised we will revert to lease pricing based \non a 1.5% return on assets. Capital is expected to remain above the \nminimum requirement (plus buffer) throughout the forecast horizon.\nCFO statement continued\nCapital management: Capital reserves increased to £3.8bn at \nSeptember 2022 (FY2021: £2.9bn) \n•\t We continue to use an Economic Capital model to determine the \nappropriate level of capital required to protect the business from \nshock events and continue to apply a 99.99% confidence level for our \nassessment of risk. Our policy is to target a capital position above the \n99.99% threshold, plus buffer, above this minimum requirement.\n•\t As we do not pay shareholder dividends, any capital above the \ntarget level is actively invested to support current and future \ncustomers, and to support Motability, the Charity’s, wider mandate.\nInvesting to support our customers\nThe financial result in FY2022 has led to incremental capital \nheadroom and provided the opportunity to build on the investments \nto support our customers which were outlined in the FY2021 Annual \nReport and Accounts.\nDirect support for customers\n•\t £525m invested in an enhanced New Vehicle Payment (NVP):  \nWe are increasing the NVP from £250 to £750 for all renewing \ncustomers and any new to Scheme customers who place an \napplication during 2023 (payment will be made to both renewing \nand new customers at the point they take delivery of their new \nvehicle). Customers who have previously received a £250 NVP will \nreceive a £500 top-up payment. These payments, which represent \na significant investment in supporting affordability for customers, \nwill be rolled out from February 2023.\n•\t £220m of accelerated Good Condition Payments (GCP): \nWe have taken the decision to reduce the deposit we hold against \nthe condition of our fleet from £600 to £250 per vehicle. This allows \nus to accelerate a payment of £350 to all car Scheme customers and \nso put money back in our customers’ pockets today. In aggregate \nthis amounts to £220m in accelerated payments to customers. This \ndecision also allows us to reduce the amount that we hold against \nfuture leases, so keeping the cost of leases as low as possible.\nIndirect affordability support\n•\t £300m investment to support the transition to electric vehicles: \nLast year we ring-fenced £300m of capital to ensure that our \ncustomers are not left behind on the transition to electric vehicles, \nrecognising the higher cost of electric vehicles and challenges around \nthe vehicle charging infrastructure. To date £77m has been deployed \nin supporting 25,000 customer orders (across vehicles delivered and \nthe existing order-bank), with 16,000 standard home chargepoints \nhaving been installed free-of-charge.

MORL’s net exposure is contained through a conservatively \nstructured reinsurance programme. The Group financial statements \ninclude the consolidated results of MORL with segmental reporting \nto reflect the way we manage and report on this business activity. \nThe segmental analysis can be found in note 5 to the financial \nstatements, highlighting a profit of £5.2m in the year to September \n2022 (September 2021: £14.6m). MORL has been subject to ongoing \nmarket uncertainty due to heightened claims inflation, new vehicle \nsupply constraints and delays in confirming the ultimate impact of \nchanges in whiplash claim legislation. Motor claims inflation increased \ndue to supply chain disruption and anticipated increases in the cost of \non-going care, with claims also taking longer to settle. As a result, \nMORL continues to reserve to the 85th percentile for projected ultimate \nlosses and has applied an additional specific reserve for the effects of \ninflation on those reserves.\nTaxation\nFor the year ending September 2022, the Group’s underlying tax \ncharge was £153.2m (13.4%) with an additional £66.5m deferred tax \ncharge following the remeasurement of deferred tax. The tax rate is \nless than the headline rate of 19% because of non-taxable capital gains \narising in the year. These gains occurred due to the strength of the \nused-car market which has seen vehicles being sold for net proceeds \nexceeding the original cost of the vehicles as incurred at the start of \ntheir leases. The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK will change \nfrom 19% to 25% with effect from 1 April 2023 onwards and therefore \ndeferred tax has been re-measured at the rate at which timing \ndifferences are expected to reverse.\nCash and funding\nThe Group continues to pursue a strategy of maintaining appropriate \nliquidity headroom and a well-diversified ladder of funding maturities. \nTo date this has been achieved through a combination of GBP and EUR \ndenominated capital market bond finance and through committed \nbank facilities. MO intends to pursue this strategy which has served \nMO well to date. We raised incremental financing in January 2022 \nwith a GBP £500m 20-year bond. This is the third bond issued under \nthe Group’s Social Bond Framework. This refinancing provides liquidity \nto meet MO’s medium-term funding requirements and headroom to \nsettle the £400m bond which matured in June 2022.\nAs part of our commitment under the Social Bond Framework (which \nis in accordance with the ICMA Social Bond Principles (SBP) 2020 \nas confirmed by a ‘Second Party Opinion’ (SPO) our second “Annual \nReport on Eligible Social Projects,” will be published 12 months after \nthe issuance of the Group’s most recent bond, in January 2023, which \nwill demonstrate how the bond proceeds have been utilised. This \nimpact report has been verified by DNV GL under their Assurance \nStatement as complying with commitments given by Motability \nOperations in its Social Bond Framework.\nBank Facility Refinancing\nMotability Operations’ existing bank facilities were due to expire in \nSeptember 2023. The Group initiated a refinancing exercise during the \nsummer of 2022, with a view to arranging a new facility well in advance \nof the 2023 maturity. This transaction was successfully completed on \n31 October 2022, with a new five-year facility (£400m term loan and \n£1.5bn revolving credit facility), with two “plus one” options, syndicated \nacross our existing banking group. Aligned to our wider sustainability \nagenda, the new banking facility is a sustainability linked loan, with \nmargin ratchets linked to the delivery of challenging measures in respect \nof CO2 reduction and customer satisfaction targets.\nAt the year end the Group held cleared cash balances of £709.0m (of \nwhich £96.1m was ring-fenced in the Group’s reinsurance captive on \nthe Isle of Man). The Group’s average debt maturity was 8.5 years at \nthe balance sheet date (FY2021: 7.9 years).\nTreasury policy\nConsistent with other aspects of our business activities, we have \nadopted a measured approach to treasury management. We use \nderivative financial instruments (specifically interest rate swaps) to \nreduce our exposure to interest rate movements that affect the \nfunding of existing leased assets. The Group also fully hedges the foreign \ncurrency risk consequent on its four fixed-rate Eurobonds using cross-\ncurrency swaps. The Group’s overall interest rate risk management \nstrategy is to convert all newly issued foreign-denominated debt into \nthe Group’s functional currency of Sterling. We operate hedge \naccounting, and derivative financial instruments are ‘marked to market’ \nwith their value being shown on the face of the balance sheet. The value \nof the hedging reserve at 30 September 2022 was £52.2m post-tax.\nOutlook\nLooking ahead there are undoubtedly challenges to navigate as the \nnew-vehicle supply-side disruption continues to affect our order pipeline, \nand the impacts of rising interest rates and inflation begin to take hold.\nWe will continue to carefully monitor the demand and supply dynamics \naffecting the used-car market, and whilst this year we have benefitted \nfrom positive movements in the value of our fleet, with an assumption that \nused-car demand and so values will remain buoyant during 2023, we are \nacutely aware that this volatility can of course move in the other direction. \nHowever, the resilience of our business model enables us to continue \nsupporting customers through these difficult times and we are well-placed \nwith capital headroom which enables us to make positive investments to \nsupport existing and future customers as outlined earlier in this report.\nWe have strong liquidity as at 30 September 2022 and are confident \nthat our financing structure (bank term loan, revolving credit facility \nand well-laddered bond maturity profile) provides us with flexibility \nas we look ahead. \nMatthew Hamilton-James\nChief Finance Officer \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n26"

      "text": "Innovative ways to travel \nA partnership approach to an EV solution\nWe’ve always looked at developing bespoke solutions to help \nour customers, whether it’s new insurance products or specialist \nroadside assistance. \nThe approach we’re taking to finding solutions to help with the \ntransition to EVs is different. \nWe’re getting involved at ground level with some of the most  \nforward – thinking tech startups around, letting some of our \ncustomers trial their products and giving them the opportunity to \nfeed back on what works for people with disabilities and what doesn’t. \nSome of the partnerships and customer pilots we’ve \nbeen running include:\n•\t Over 250 of our customers joined a trial with Zap-Map, which plots \npublic chargepoints around the UK. The trial was designed to help \nassess the experience of charging an EV for disabled people on the \nUK’s public charging network.\n•\t Charge Fairy is a portable charging solution that uses an app to \nmonitor your car and send out a ‘charge fairy’ (a technician with \na mobile charging point) to top up your EV. The pilot was designed \nto understand whether offering a mobile and full-service solution \ncould reduce charging anxiety amongst our customers.\n•\t Bonnet is a payment aggregator that connects over 17+ different \ncharging apps into one simple app. They strive to provide the best \nEV charging experience possible by providing accurate and live data \nfor each chargepoint as well as standardised pricing. The aim of this \ntrial was to support Scheme customers by simplifying public charging \nand help to provide worry-free access to electric motoring.\n•\t Co Charger harnesses the power of local communities to give \neveryone access to local home chargers. The pilot enabled Scheme \ncustomers to rent out their home charger or use a neighbours’ — \nthe app co-ordinates everything, including payment.\n•\t drivvn’s Suitability Assessment Tool helps drivers decide if the \ntransition to an electric vehicle is the right choice. The results are \nbased on personalised factors such as driving habits, mileage \nrequirements, access to public and home charging, the customer’s \nconfidence in EVs and more. This trial further enhances our \ncommitment to prioritising customer personalisation and \ncommunication. \n•\t Sycada promotes green and safe driving, with their DriveTag \nproduct. This pilot will test if Scheme customers can improve \ntheir driving style. \nBy working with innovators who are already addressing some of these \nconcerns, we can help to make sure accessibility is embedded into the \nsolution from the beginning. \nThe charging infrastructure is perhaps the most pressing challenge in \nthe short to medium term, but there are other benefits to this approach. \nWe can spot potential future industry disruptors in any segment \nof the market and get our customers on their agenda. They could \nbe manufacturers selling direct to customers; the joined-up thinking \nof Mobility as a Service (MaaS) and multi-modal mobility and driverless \ncars and other app-based solutions to problems we might not yet \nknow exist.\nFor example, with driverless cars, we’re asking manufacturers \nto consider what would happen if the person operating their car \nhappened to be blind. If we can embed this thought process \nat an early stage, the resulting solution will benefit everyone.\nThe power of our brand and expertise\nAs one of the biggest purchasers of new cars in the UK, Motability \nOperations has significant buying power in the marketplace, which we \ncan leverage for the benefit of our customers. \nTech innovators and automotive manufacturers know that \ncollaborating with us is an asset for their business. Involving our \ncustomers in pilots gives them intelligence that helps make their \nproducts more accessible, not just for disabled people but everyone: \nparents with pushchairs, the elderly and drivers of large vehicles, \namong others.\nAs well as providing valuable insight into a growing section of their \ntarget market, the Motability Operations seal of approval could also \nlend substantial additional credibility to potential investors and \nbusiness partners. \nInnovation is the route to Motability Operations evolving and becoming \neven more relevant in the changing market environment.

In a lot of cases, it’s actually been a big \nbenefit: we can now welcome people from further \nafield and offer more flexibility to all our employees.\nPeople are coming into our offices less than they \nused to and there’s a lot more free space. So this \nyear we’ve closed buildings and floors and moved \nthings around, so that when people come to the \noffice they are closer to colleagues. This has \nallowed greater collaboration and teamwork. \nNot everyone has the desire, space or facilities to \nwork from home, but we’ve found that by deploying \na hybrid working model, we can attract and retain \nthe best people, who may have other responsibilities \nor require adjustments.\n“Being able to work flexibly now, really helps with being a mother. I \ncan be there for key milestones that I may have missed otherwise, \nand I have the time to work solidly without any distractions. \nMO supports you 100% to work flexibly. I discuss my career \nprogression with my manager and have no concerns that it \nwill impact my career in the future.”\nSophie, HR adviser in our Edinburgh office \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n43"

We’ve found \nthat our people stay here for a long time. We’re often told this is \nbecause there’s clear scope for progression up the career ladder  \nwithin the Company. \nLeadership development is a big focus for us. Diversity at a senior level \nis really important and something we want to improve, as we believe it \ncan empower people across the business to strive for success if they \nsee role models at the top.\nFor the past two years, we’ve run specialised development \nprogrammes for employees with disabilities. The aim is to help them \nrecognise what holds them back, to help them manage their disability \nin the workplace and ultimately help increase their confidence and \neffectiveness. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and we’re \nnow planning a similar programme for people from Black, Asian and \nMinority Ethnic groups for next year. This will focus on leadership \ndevelopment by playing to their personal strengths, building their \npersonal brand and building their confidence.\nWe want to increase the diversity of our workforce so that we \ncan reflect the profile of the general population more accurately. \nWe’re committed to increasing the proportion of Black, Asian \nand Minority Ethnic employees and employees with disabilities \nat Motability Operations. We’ve got a number of initiatives in place, \nincluding training for all recruiting managers, and our recruitment \nteam works hard to deliver diverse candidate shortlists where possible. \nOne way we’re working towards increased representation and \ndeveloping our talent pipeline is via our scholarship programmes. \nWe currently offer a programme to students with disabilities and \nto Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic students. \nThe scholarship covers university tuition fees for up to four years \nand includes summer work experience placements in Edinburgh, \nLondon or Bristol, along with mentoring and the opportunity \nto apply for a permanent job after graduating. \nPeople continued\n“I had never come across another \nscholarship targeted at disabled \nstudents.

Last \nyear we took our pay gap reporting further to include three of the \nfour employee demographics that we currently measure – gender, \nethnicity and disability. We currently don’t have enough data to \nreport on our fourth key demographic – LGBTQ+ – but we’re \nactively planning for this. \nGender pay \nOur mean gender pay gap in 2021 was 25.1%, which is higher than the UK \naverage. This is largely due to differences in gender balance in various roles \nand reflects three key factors. \n1.\tAt the time of reporting, our Executive team comprised four men and \none woman, which impacts the gender pay gap. Since reporting, \nwe’ve appointed more women to the team and now have an almost \n50:50 ratio. \n2.\tWe have a larger proportion of men working in relatively  \nhighly-paid IT roles (for example about three-quarters of \nthe IT department are men)\n3.\tWe have a larger proportion of women working in our customer \ncontact centre, which offers roles on flexible shift patterns. These \nfactors are similar to many other similar businesses and reflect \nwider society and industry trends. \nWe are committed to reducing our gender pay gap next year, and continue \nto champion every employee enjoying the same opportunities to progress \nand work in a way that suits them best. We will be publishing our next pay \ngap report in Spring 2023.\nDisability pay\nOur mean disability pay gap is 16.3%, which is a small improvement on \nthe national average. Disclosure of disabilities is not mandatory for \nemployees, but we are investing heavily in ensuring that disabled \npeople have the same opportunities as all other employees, \nas described earlier.\nEthnicity pay \nOur ethnicity pay gap is minus 12.2%, which means that Black, Asian \nand Minority Ethnic employees earn more than white employees, on \naverage. This can be explained by the high number of people from \nMinority Ethnic backgrounds in our IT department, where pay is \nhigher than many other areas of the business. \nSupporting our people through tough times\nWe know the past few years have been tough on everyone’s mental \nhealth and well-being, and our employees are no different. We’ve \nworked hard to ensure our employees feel supported throughout \nthis time and it continues to remain a top priority for us. \nMental health support\nOur Mental Health Ally network is made up of employees who are \ntrained to spot and support colleagues who might be having a difficult \ntime. This year we’ve seen new employees join the group and we now \nhave 54 people across the business in the network, with fantastic \nfeedback from those who have benefitted.\nDiversity networking\nBelonging@MO comprises four diversity networking groups \nwhich provide a two-way forum for discussion and ideas. \nThe groups are enABLE (disabilities), REACH (race and ethnicity), \nGENDER and PRIDE (LBGTQ+). They’re run by employees and \nsupported by our senior management teams. Employees are \nencouraged to join the networks, be themselves and have their \nvoice heard. Our new network leads receive professional training to \nhelp them go out among the workforce, enrol new members and \nspread the word about diversity at Motability Operations. Their \ninvolvement doesn’t impinge on their commitment to their day jobs, \nbut they are invaluable in helping influence policy and top-level \ndecision-making about diversity.\nListening to our people\nEvery year we carry out a survey, asking our employees for their views \non Motability Operations: our values, leadership, culture, customer \nfocus and engagement.\n“I am able to bring every part of myself to \nwork. I can do this knowing that there’s \nalways a friendly supportive face, no \nmatter where you are.” \nA comment from one of our team in our  \nannual employee survey\nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n45"

It is a core commitment that our approach protects the \ninterests of customers and seeks to ensure that risks are managed \nsufficiently to avoid financial, reputational, and operational shocks \nto the business.\nOur approach to risk management is both dynamic and robust, \naiming to ensure that we identify, quantify and manage all \nmaterial risks. Our risk management framework is enshrined within \nour day-to-day activities and our governance framework, which is \noverseen and managed by our Risk Management Committee.\nWe have a Director with specific responsibility for risk, as well as a \ndedicated Risk Management function. The business’s appetite for risk \nis managed through a comprehensive and independently verified Risk \nAppetite Framework. The Risk Management function is predicated on \na dynamic business partnering approach, supporting the business with \nidentification of risks and controls, risk awareness and enhancing MO’s \napproach to Enterprise Risk Management (ERM).\nThe challenges the business faces are becoming more complex.  \nThe risk landscape is changing, fuelled by the rapid pace of change, \nglobalisation, industry challenges and increasing regulation. To \nsupport this, the Business Risk team was expanded at the beginning \nof this year, focused on the wider landscape of emerging risks and \nforward-thinking analysis of external threats and opportunities. \nThis ensures risk management is integral within business strategy \nand transition, facilitated through a business partner approach.\nWe make certain that, through our policies, our approach and our \nactivities, we meet standards of behaviour that fall within boundaries \nthat are consistent with our agreed level of risk appetite.\nWe have designed our risk management framework around the ‘three \nlines model’ for risk governance.

As such, risk management is incorporated as \na core part of effective business planning and capital management. \nThe responsibility for managing the risks and control activities sits \nfirmly within the first line responsibilities.\nWe regularly review our risk management framework to ensure that \nit remains appropriate to the business and its strategy. These updates \ninclude regular assessments of risks and controls, including the update \nof risk registers, and early identification of any emerging risks to the \nachievement of our stated objectives.\nThe framework is designed to identify and mitigate risks to the \nbusiness and its operation, which has been proven through yet another \nchallenging year with new car supply chains significantly impacted by \nthe global semi-conductor shortage, raw material availability and rising \ncosts, exacerbated by the Russia and Ukraine conflict as well as \nlocalised lockdowns in Asia.\nIn line with the business strategy for a ‘Glide Path to Green’, we \nhave enhanced risk management and support to ensure the business \nremains focussed on risk and controls through strategic change and \ntransition activity, with Transformation added to the principal risks.\n“We recognise that  \nsound risk management \nis fundamental to the \nsuccessful and sustainable \noperation of the business.”\nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n48"

      "text": "Risk continued\nCapital adequacy and Economic Capital\nAlthough the Group is not regulated for capital purposes, our \napproach to balance sheet management aligns with best practice, \nwith the overarching objective being to ensure that we have the \nfinancial resilience to withstand economic turbulence without \ncompromising the customer offering. The Group holds capital in \nthe form of ‘restricted reserves’ to provide the necessary financial \nshock-absorber against the majority of unexpected loss to ensure \nsustainability into the long term.\nThe Group uses Economic Capital (EC) principles to determine the \nappropriate level of capital.\nThe EC process involves undertaking a comprehensive assessment \nof the material risks and evaluated potential impacts the Group \nfaces given its core activities. This enables us to determine an \nappropriate level of capital required to protect the Scheme \nfrom potential shock events.\nThe EC approach encompasses all material risks and the ability to \nrecover from a shock, delivering an outcome that management views \nas reasonable and prudent in the context of the impact that failure of \nthe Scheme would have on our customer base.\nWe undertake an annual review of our Economic Capital requirement \nand the key underlying assumptions inclusive of new or emerging \nCompany-specific or wider environmental factors which are considered \nto have a bearing on the Group’s capital requirements.\nIn line with NAO recommendations in 2018, Motability, the Charity, \ninitiated an external review from Oliver Wyman, to examine our capital \nmodelling methodology, our applied risk appetite and confidence levels \nand to benchmark our capital reserves levels against near-comparable \ncompanies. The review confirmed the appropriateness of Motability \nOperations’ Economic Capital approach and supported the Group’s \napplication of a 99.99% confidence level (or one in ten thousand loss \nevent), given Motability Operations’ unique risk profile. There were \nsome recommended future which were addressed by MO in 2020. \nMotability commissioned Oliver Wyman to undertake an independent \nfollow-up review, which was published in 2021, noting the “improved \nquality of the economic capital framework and that all material \nchanges are sound” and that MO’s assessment of capital is “within \na range of justifiable outcomes”. Motability Operations remains \ncommitted to ensuring the ongoing development and refinement  \nof the Economic Capital approach and methodology.\nCalculating the Economic Capital requirement\nWhere applicable we use our own data and experience and \nindependently reviewed statistical models to calculate the EC \nrequirement to a 99.99% confidence interval. We adopt a scenario-\nbased modelling approach with management judgment for the \nremaining risks. \nThe selected confidence level is more prudent than the minimum \nrequirements in certain regulatory environments (Basel III at 99.9%; \nSolvency II at 99.5%). However, we have maintained a consistent \nand transparent approach to capital management and have regularly \nsought independent review to validate our approach which reflects a \nlimited capacity to raise new capital or readily take actions to de-risk \nor diversify.\nOur approach to calculating economic capital allows for diversification \nacross all risks leading to a 29% reduction in our risk assessment for \n2022. This is in addition to the diversification impacts within the \ndifferent risks themselves. Post diversification, the EC requirement, \nas assessed through modelling, stands at £2.19bn.\nHaving defined the EC requirement, our policy is to maintain a buffer \nthat provides an appropriate contingency to this minimum capital \nrequirement and protects customer pricing for pipeline applications.\nAt the financial year end, the Group’s closing capital position \n(represented by restricted reserves on the balance sheet of £3.8bn) \nwas considered by the Executive team to be sufficient and appropriate \ngiven the current and emerging potential risks faced by the Scheme.\nThe largest risk MO is exposed to is the unforeseen and material \nmovements in the value of used cars, which remain unexpectedly high. \nForecasting residual values\nAn estimated residual fleet value of £8.7bn means that even a 1% \nerror in our forecast equates to a £87m financial exposure for MO. \nTo provide some market context, used-car values in the UK dropped \nby 22% in 12 months during the 2008/09 financial crash, demonstrating \nthe volatility and complexity in estimating future used-car values in \nsupport of fixed customer pricing and revaluing our fleet.\nWe seek to recruit and retain the expertise to develop our processes, \nsupported by leading third-party experts. We combine econometric \nmodelling techniques with car industry expertise with our aim to ensure \nthat customer pricing is based on a fair and reasonable assessment of \nfuture market values.\nIn 2019, an independent third-party, end-to-end assessment provided \nobjective assurance of our forecast process, stating “MO’s forecasting \napproach uses sophisticated techniques, is robust, fit-for-purpose and \naligns to forecasting best practice”. Whilst they confirmed there was \n“no evidence of systematic bias that results in either under- or over-\nforecasting” the review did highlight some minor recommendations \nthat MO implemented over 2020.\nThe independent third party has subsequently validated that the \nrecommendations have been completed, stating “we have found \nsufficient evidence to conclude that our recommendations have been \naddressed and are satisfied with MO’s approach in interpreting them”. \nWhilst the level of uncertainty is a challenge for all forecasters working \nwith a long forecast horizon (over three years), we have a strong track \nrecord of outperforming alternative market benchmarks.\nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n56"

The Executive team has assessed \nMotability Operations Group plc’s viability over a three-year period \nto September 2025.\nA three-year period is considered to be an appropriate period for the \nviability review for the following reasons:\n•\t Over 95% of customers take up a three-year lease product, and given \nthe Group’s objective of providing sustainability and affordability to \ncustomers, it is appropriate to assess the Company’s viability across \na period in which existing contractual obligations to customers can \nbe fulfilled; and\n•\t Linked to this, over 95% of the Group’s existing residual value risk will \nunwind across this same time period.\nThis assessment has been made taking account of the current position \nof the Group, its core three-year lease product, corporate planning \nprocess and the Group’s key risks and risk appetite as detailed in the \nStrategic report on pages 3-58.\nIn making their assessment, the Executive team took account of the \nGroup’s current financial and operational positions, as well as broader \nexternal risks and uncertainties that may impact the operation.\nThe financial assessment focussed on capital adequacy and \nliquidity under a range of stress scenarios, such as delayed/ failed \nbond issuance and varying levels of fleet volume. The review includes \na specific assessment of severe but plausible reductions in residual \nvalues related to economic impacts from significant additional \nwaves of Covid-19 infection, and/or the UK’s economic recovery  \npost-pandemic. \nAs detailed in the Chief Finance Officer’s review on page 23, the \nGroup’s closing financial position reflects capital reserves of £3.8bn, \nwhich provides headroom above the policy position (to hold capital at \n99.99% confidence, plus buffer). \nFrom an operational perspective, stress scenarios test the Group’s \nability to continue to provide affordable leases and consistent service \nlevels across a three-year period. These financial and operational \nreviews provide the Executive with appropriate confidence in making \nthis viability statement.\nThe Executive also assessed the Group’s ability to meet its outstanding \nbond and bank debt liabilities:\n•\t The Group will be required to repay two bonds in the period. The first \nis in June 2023 (€550m) and the second is in March 2025 (€500m). The \nExecutive team assessed that the Group has access to sufficient \nliquidity to make this repayment from existing cash balances, cash \nand funding) and/or its committed bank credit facilities of £1.5bn in \nthe event that refinancing in the debt capital markets is not viable.\n•\t Whilst it is noted that the longer-term nature of these obligations can \nextend significantly beyond the three-year period adopted for this \nviability review, the Executive are satisfied that lenders are not only \nprovided with robust protection through the relevant documentation, \nbut that the Group will have the resources to meet these obligations \nunder the full range of stress scenarios referenced above.\nIn making this statement, the Executive have made the following \nkey assumptions:\n•\t Customers will continue to be treated fairly and enjoy worry-free \nmotoring including excellent support and service throughout the UK\n•\t Motability Operations will continue to provide a broad selection of \naffordable vehicles that meet the needs of its customers\n•\t Motability Operations will continue to generate a level of profitability \nthat is adequate to protect the Scheme from economic shock, whilst \nalso covering any growth in the capital requirement and protecting \naffordability of the price list\n•\t Motability Operations will continue to minimise the impact of market \nvolatility through maintaining a robust balance sheet and \nappropriate level of reserves\n•\t Motability Operations will continue to minimise the impact of \nfinancial volatility through effective realisation and management \nof residual values\n•\t Motability Operations will continue to maintain access to funding \nwith sufficient headroom to meet its financing needs\n•\t Motability Operations will continue to focus and invest appropriately \nin IT infrastructure to ensure that a stable and resilient operating \nplatform is maintained\n•\t Motability Operations will ensure that strategic activities are \ndeveloped and align to the ‘Lean into green’ environmental objective \nto have a material positive impact on society and the environment\nThe Executive team have therefore concluded that, based on the extent \nof the corporate planning process and strong financial positions, there \nis a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources \nand will continue to operate and meet its liabilities as they fall due \nover the period of their assessment.\nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n58"

Our people positioning principles, culture and \nvalues form the bedrock to deliver these objectives.\nOur values of ‘We find solutions’, ‘We drive change’ and ‘We care’ are \ncentral to delivering and meeting the needs and expectations of our \ncustomers. We embrace diversity which enables us to have a wide \nvariety of approaches and perspectives, enhancing performance \nand creating value for customers.\nThe Group’s purpose, goals and values build on Motability Operations’ \ncommitment to good corporate governance with a clear focus on our \nenvironmental and social responsibility. As part of this commitment, it \nwas agreed by the Board that the Memorandum and Articles of both \nthe Group and Motability Operations Limited, be amended to reflect \nthe desire to have a ‘material positive impact on the environment \nand society’.\nAs we do not pay shareholder dividends we can focus purely on \ndelivering for our customers, with profits available for reinvestment \nto support their current and future needs. The Group’s strong financial \nposition has allowed us to assist customers in challenging economic \nconditions, and help reduce increased costs in the proposition caused \nby new car inflation. This was delivered in the form of the introduction \nof a ‘New Vehicle Payment’ to customers of £250 (£100 for PWS \ncustomers), such payment increasing to £750 from 1 January 2023. \nIn addition and as referenced on page 9, £350 of the Good Condition \nPayment has been released into lease pricing and a refund of this \ncost paid to all existing customers from 1 October 2022. This financial \nyear also saw Motability Operations make a donation to Motability, \nthe Charity, of £200m. \nPrinciple 2\nBoard Composition\nThe Board comprises a Chairman, Chief Executive, Chief Finance \nOfficer, four Non-Executives Directors and six Independent Non-\nExecutive Directors. This size and composition is appropriate given \nthe size and complexity of the business. The Group has a separate \nChairman and Chief Executive to ensure that the balance of \nresponsibilities, accountabilities and decision-making across \nthe Group is effectively maintained. \nThe responsibility of the Independent Non-Executive Chairman includes \nleading the Board and ensuring its effectiveness. This includes setting \nthe agenda for Board meetings, promoting a culture of openness and \ndebate and, with the assistance of the Company Secretary, arranging \nfor the Directors to receive timely, accurate and clear information \nahead of Board meetings.\nThe Chief Executive is responsible for leading and managing \nthe business on a day-to-day basis with authorities delegated by \nthe Board, and is accountable to the Board for the financial and \noperational performance of the Group. This day-to-day management \nis effected through the Executive Committee, with the Chief Executive \nas Chair.\nThe Non-Executive Directors combine broad business and \ncommercial knowledge to enable them to challenge and contribute \nto the development of our strategy. They bring an independent \njudgement to all business issues through their contribution at \nBoard and Committee meetings. The Chairman is satisfied that \nthe Independent Non-Executive Directors are independent in \nboth character and judgement.\nThe Board meets at least six times a year in December, March, April, \nJune, September and November.

      "text": "Principle 5\nRemuneration\nThe Remuneration Committee has clearly defined terms of reference \nand is responsible for making recommendations to the Board \nconcerning the Group’s remuneration strategy and recruitment \nframework. In doing so, the Committee takes advice from independent \nexternal consultants who provide updates on legislative requirements, \nbest market practice and remuneration benchmarking, drawing \nevidence from across the sector in which the Company operates \nand from other relevant sectors.\nOur aim is to design a competitive remuneration package that is \nsufficient to attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills, \nexperience and expertise to run a business of the size and complexity \nof Motability Operations on a sustainable basis. Our policy ensures we \ndo not encourage inappropriate behaviours or actions and we do not \nreward poor performance or failure.\nIn the interests of continued transparency in relation to the \nremuneration of the Executive, Motability Operations voluntarily elects \nto publish a Remuneration Report. The aim of the report is to set out \nthe key elements of our Remuneration Policy that ensure a robust \nand reasonable balance is achieved between financial reward and \nperformance. The report also demonstrates how the Remuneration \nPolicy has been applied in the current year and the intended approach \nfor the forthcoming year. The detailed report can be found on page 75.\nThis year we took our pay gap reporting further to include three of \nour four employee demographics – gender, ethnicity and disability. \nWhile we pay equally for equal roles, in 2021 we identified a mean \ngender pay gap of 25.1%; a 16.3% disability pay gap; and a negative \n12.2% ethnicity pay gap. For more information please see pages 45 \nof the People section. The Group is an active equal opportunities \nemployer and promotes an environment free from discrimination, \nharassment and victimisation, where everyone receives equal \ntreatment and career development regardless of age, gender, \nnationality, ethnic origin, religion, marital status, sexual orientation \nor disability. All decisions relating to employment practices (including \nremuneration) are objective, free from bias and based solely upon \nwork criteria and individual merit.\nCorporate governance report continued\nPrinciple 6\nStakeholders\nThe Board is clear that good governance and effective communication \nare essential on a day-to-day basis to deliver our purpose and protect \nthe Company’s reputation and relationships with all our stakeholder \ncommunity including customers, employees, suppliers, Motability, \nthe Charity, manufacturers and dealers, disability groups, investors \nand the local communities in which we work.\nExternal impacts\nThe Board is committed to social responsibility, community \nengagement and environmental stability. It achieves this in part \nthrough its commitment to: a culture of zero harm (ensuring the \nsafety, health and well-being of everyone who works with us); \ncreating positive environmental and social impact; being an \nemployer of choice where everyone is valued and respected; and \ncontinuing to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Scheme. \nCorporate governance report continued\nWe have an Executive Director with specific responsibility for risk, as \nwell as a dedicated Risk Management function. The business’s appetite \nfor risk is managed through a comprehensive and independently \nverified Risk Appetite Framework. \nWe have designed our risk management framework around the ‘three \nlines model’. Consistent with this approach, we have a dedicated Risk \nfunction that is integral to coordinating, monitoring and advising on \ncontrol activities. This holistic approach encompasses all material risks, \nwith clearly identified accountabilities and responsibilities for risk \nmanagement, control and assurance. As such, risk management is \nincorporated as a core part of effective business planning and capital \nmanagement. The responsibility of managing the risks and control \nactivities sits firmly within the first line responsibilities.\nWe regularly review our risk management framework to ensure that \nit remains appropriate to the business and its strategy. These updates \ninclude regular assessments of risks and controls, including the update \nof risk registers, and early identification of any emerging risks to \nthe achievement of our stated objectives. Further details of our risk \nmanagement framework and approach are outlined in the Strategic \nreport 3-58.\nThe Risk Management Committee, consisting of Executive Committee \nmembers and Heads of Function, ensures that inherent and emerging \nrisks are identified and managed appropriately and in a timely manner. \nThe Company’s principal risks and mitigations are outlined in the Risk \nManagement report (on pages 48-55).\nA list of emerging risks is maintained by the Risk Management \nCommittee and considered at each meeting – an emerging risk \nis included on the risk register once its likelihood and impact of \noccurrence becomes material to the Company.\nThe Company’s Strategic report on pages 3-58 includes key risks that \nare monitored by the Risk Management Committee. The risk register is \npresented to the Executive Committee and the Group Audit Committee \non a quarterly basis. The Company’s systems and controls are designed \nto manage, rather than to entirely eliminate, the risk of failure to \nachieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable \nand not an absolute assurance against a risk materialising.\nOur risk appetite is reviewed and set by the Executive on at least \nan annual basis, utilising information from strategic planning, \nrisk management activity and business objectives.\nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n66"

Our policy ensures we \ndo not encourage inappropriate behaviours or actions and we do not \nreward poor performance or failure.\nAs outlined in the 2021 Remuneration Report, a revised \nannual performance incentive framework was introduced  \nin 2022. The revised framework ensures that performance-related \npay retains an appropriate balance between day-to-day delivery \nand a longer-term focus on innovation and strategic implementation. \nDetails of this revised framework and the 2022 performance \noutcomes are covered later in this report.\nCurrent year application and context\nThe early part of this year saw the continued easing of Covid-19 \nrestrictions, with the successful roll-out of the UK’s vaccine programme \nsignificantly reducing transmission rates and levels of hospitalisation. \nHowever, the longer-term impacts of the pandemic continued to have \na major impact on the Company’s operations, with the global supply-\nchain challenges resulting in a significant and sustained contraction \nin the production and supply of new vehicles (a result of the well-\npublicised global semiconductor shortage). This has affected both the \nprice and availability of new vehicles to the Scheme, with a significantly \nreduced offering on the customer price list. The production delays have \nalso resulted in extended lead-time for customers who have placed an \napplication and an elevated volume of lease extensions (in order to \nkeep customers mobile, Motability Operations has offered automatic \nlease extensions to existing customers).\nThese supply-side impacts were compounded by the war in the \nUkraine and subsequent inflationary pressures leading to the \ncurrent cost-of-living challenges.\nLetter from the Committee Chairman\nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n75"

As set out in last year’s \nRemuneration report, the revised framework:\n•\t Includes revised criteria for minimum threshold performance (below \nwhich no performance-related payments are paid)\n•\t Ensures a robust and objective measurement of individual \nperformance and contribution\n•\t Reflects revised, measurable, and stretching corporate targets\n•\t Includes defined long-term (multi-year) targets in relation to \nstrategic implementation\n•\t Reflects specific objectives aligned to the business’s commitment \nto reduce its environmental impact, reflecting the Board’s \ncommitment and intent to define specific targets in this \nimportant area of its operations \nDetails of the revised framework are set out in the Remuneration \nReport below.\nThe maximum potential annual performance incentive for the \nCEO and CFO has been set at 150% and 125% of salary respectively. \nThese maximum levels provide the Committee some discretion to \nreward for exceptional step-change events or performance during \nthe year but ensure that there is an absolute limit on individual \npayments that can be made.\nPerformance against this framework resulted in a bonus expressed  \nas a percentage of the maximum potential of 53% for Andrew Miller \nand 61% for Matthew Hamilton-James. A detailed breakdown of \nperformance against the revised framework is set out in the \nRemuneration report below.\nBonus deferral and release\nTo support a culture of long-term decision-making in the ordinary \ncourse of business, 50% of bonus awards are deferred for a period \nof three years with performance criteria used to assess the final \nrelease of this payment.\nBased on performance in the three-year period ended 30 September \n2022, the Committee determined that the underpinned conditions \nattached to deferred bonus awards made in respect of FY2019 \nwere achieved and as such the awards were released to the \nExecutive Directors. \nSalary\nThe Remuneration Committee determines the salary of each \nExecutive Director with regard to the role and responsibilities, \nthe experience of the individual currently undertaking the role, \nthe criticality of the role and the individual to the business, \nperformance and market comparatives. Changes are made \nas appropriate taking these factors into account and giving \ndue consideration to increases awarded to the wider workforce.\nCore benefits\nThe Group provides Executive Directors with a number of core benefits \nincluding private medical insurance, life assurance, travel insurance \nand a company car (or cash allowance in lieu).\nPension\nThe Group provides a Defined Contribution scheme contribution or \ncash allowance in lieu of pension for Executive Directors. The normal \ncontribution rate for all employees (including Executive Directors) \nis 15% of base salary (other than where legacy agreements exist).\nApproach for FY2023\nThe Remuneration Committee will keep the revised performance \nframework under review in 2023, to ensure that the metrics provide \na challenging and appropriately broad set of measures in the context \nof current and longer-term business priorities.\nRemuneration Committee continued\nNeill Thomas\nRemuneration Committee Chairman\n“Ensuring a clear linkage between \nperformance and financial reward.”\nNeill Thomas\nChair of Remuneration Committee\nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n76"

A total potential award of 50% of base salary \nis achievable for delivery in full against these targets, with a potential 10% attributable to each of the five \nmeasures set out below:\nCustomer satisfaction: 10% award\nCustomer service is measured through an independent review by Ipsos MORI which is commissioned jointly \nby Motability Operations and Motability, the Charity. The survey measures feedback across a comprehensive \nrange of customer touchpoints. The April 2022 survey showed 96% overall customer satisfaction and is \nconsidered a positive validation of the focussed efforts across the organisation, particularly given the \nbackdrop of the ongoing supply-side challenges.\nEmployee engagement: 5% award\nEmployee engagement is measured via an independent employee survey conducted by Willis Towers \nWatson with results benchmarked against a pool of UK high performing companies. The employee \nengagement score for 2022 was 92%. Whilst this outcome is significantly above the survey’s “High-\nPerforming Organisation” benchmark, the result moved backwards from 2021 (94% engagement).\nNumber of pilots: 10% award\nAs set out on page 20, the third pillar of Motability Operations’ strategy is to focus on developing new \nproducts for our customers. In 2022 we established an innovation team, tasked with exploring opportunities \nand mobilising a series of pilots in partnership with a number of innovative businesses. During the year 12 \npilots were launched.\nEnvironment: 0% award\nIn line with Motability Operations’ commitment to support the transition to electric vehicles, a new \ncorporate objective, targeting the electric and hybrid fleet composition, was introduced. Notwithstanding the \nsignificant investment to support electric vehicle pricing (as we have begun to invest the £300m announced \nin the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts), supply-side constraints continue to frustrate product availability \nand lead times. At September 2022 12% of the fleet was electric/hybrid compared to the 18% target.\nFinancial sustainability: 10%\nCapital levels were maintained above the MCR and buffers throughout the year. This capital position has \nenabled Motability Operations to commit to the various customer investments outlined earlier in this report, \nincluding the enhanced new vehicle payment, the £300m investment in electric vehicles and wider \naffordability support.\nGiven the performance levels delivered, the Committee approved a 35% payment out of a potential 50% \nagainst the corporate objectives.\nService\nCulture\nInnovation\nEnvironment\nFinancial Sustainability\n% overall customer\nsatisfaction*\nEmployee \nengagement score**\nNumber of pilots\n% of ﬂeet \nElectric/hybrid\nCapital Reserves\n% Payout\nActual Performance\nnil\n1-49\n50-99\n100\nCapital > MCR + Buffer\nCapital > MCR, but < Buffer\nCapital < MCR\n96%\n92%\n88%\n94%\n92%\n90%\n18%\n16%\n14%\n10\n6\n2\nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n80"

Our gender pay gap continues to be driven by \ngender imbalance influenced by a number of factors including the \ncompetition for female talent in specialist technical roles and a large \nproportion of females in our customer contact centre where roles are \noffered on flexible shift patterns (for further detail please refer to the \nPeople section on pages 40-45)\nFollowing each Remuneration Committee meeting, the Committee \nreports to the Group Board and works closely with the Audit and \nNomination Committees. The terms of reference of the Remuneration \nCommittee are reviewed annually and approved by the Group Board.\nThe effectiveness of the Committee is evaluated at least every two years. \nA review was undertaken in October 2020 with positive feedback being \nreceived from the Committee members concluding that the Committee \nwas effective and had discharged all its duties and responsibilities. \nA further review will be undertaken in October 2022.\nAdvisers\nThe Committee draws on the expertise of external independent \nspecialists for benchmarking, advice on best practice and to \nconfirm that a well-governed process is applied. In accordance with \nthe Remuneration Policy which states that the remuneration advisers \nshould be reviewed every three years, a review took place in 2020 \nwhich resulted in Deloitte being awarded the role.

The Group \nregularly reviews its remuneration against the market to ensure that \nit is competitive over the long term, is able to attract talent, and \nincentivises and encourages retention, whilst at the same time \nensuring it does not encourage inappropriate behaviours and \nactions. Remuneration is very clearly linked to overall business \nstrategy, with Group targets set in the context of both annual \nand longer-term objectives and milestones. Individual objectives \nare aligned to the achievement of the Group’s annual objectives \n(both financial and non-financial), the delivery of the strategic \nagenda and the demonstration of core values.\nEach Executive receives a copy of the Strategic Review, the Annual \nOperating Plan (describing corporate and divisional objectives and \nbudgets), together with an Accountability Statement setting out \nperformance expectations in respect of a range of matters including \nrisk management, corporate governance, compliance, adherence to \nGroup policies, diversity, employee engagement, fraud and bribery \nprevention and personal objectives against which 50% of performance-\nrelated payments will be judged.\nThe Group’s culture is regarded as central to delivering excellent \nperformance and based on our principles of:\n•\t We always treat customers fairly\n•\t We’re competitive on value and professional expertise\n•\t We always provide value for stakeholders\n•\t We work hard to make sure our finances will sustain our efforts \ninto the future\n•\t We make sure we are an outstanding, responsible employer\nThe performance of the Group, its culture and the risks facing \nthe organisation are regularly considered when the Board and \nthe Remuneration Committee address remuneration matters.\nLeaving and joining arrangements for  \nExecutive Directors\nThe Chief Executive and Chief People Officer work with the \nRemuneration Committee to ensure that contractual terms on \ntermination, and payments made, are fair to the individual and \nthe Group and failure is not rewarded. The remuneration for a \nnew Executive (whether recruited externally or promoted from \nwithin the business) will be based on the experience of the individual \nand market comparatives for the role and its responsibilities and will \nbe consistent with the Remuneration Policy when determining each \nelement of remuneration.\nOther matters\nEqual & fair pay – The Group’s Remuneration Policy recognises Equal \nPay. The Group is also committed to paying at least at the level of the \ncurrent Living Wage (as calculated by the Living Wage Foundation) \nfor an individual’s base location.\nEmployees – A key underlying principle is that, as far as practicable \nand appropriate, decisions in relation to pay and reward for the \nExecutive Directors should be applied consistently with the \napplication to other employees.\nNon-executive appointments at other companies – The Group considers \nthat the release of Executive Directors to serve as non-executive \ndirectors elsewhere can be beneficial as part of their ongoing \ndevelopment, enabling Executives to broaden their experience and \nexpertise. Any potential appointments are reviewed and agreed by \nthe Nomination Committee. Under the Group’s Remuneration Policy \nExecutives may retain any fees received for non-executive activities.\nBasis of employment\nAll employees (including Executive and Independent Non-Executive \nDirectors) are paid through payroll, with payments being subject \nto PAYE and National Insurance contributions as appropriate. \nThe Group does not make use of Service Contracts.\nRemuneration report continued\nNeill Thomas\nRemuneration Committee Chairman\nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n84"

Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement  \n(whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. \nWe summarise below the key audit matters (unchanged from 2021), in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, \nas required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of \nthe financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nKey Audit Matter\nThe risk\nOur response\nResidual values of used cars\nRefer to page 70 (Audit \nCommittee Report), page 102 \n(accounting policy) and page 117 \n(financial disclosures)\nSubjective estimate:\nThe Group leases a fleet of cars to customers which are held as operating leases.  \nThese cars are depreciated to their residual value over the life of the operating lease.\nThe residual values are set at the start of each lease, based on a model that takes into account a \nnumber of variables and assumptions. These are an estimate of the amount that would currently \nbe obtained on disposal at the end of the lease if the cars were already of the age and condition \nat the end of the lease.\nEvery six months, the Group reviews the residual values for the fleet, and if appropriate, updates \nthese to represent their current best estimate, based upon the latest available information\nThere are a number of elements to the Group’s estimation that require judgement, such as the \nimpact of past events and the expected condition of the vehicle at the end of the lease, that \ncollectively create significant uncertainty in the estimation of residual values. There continues to \nbe a high degree of uncertainty and therefore subjectivity in the assumptions as a result of the \nuncertainties arising from the current high-inflation environment, ongoing conflict in Ukraine \nand lasting economic impact of COVID-19.\nThe change in estimate of residual values of used cars impacts the amount of depreciation \nrecognised over the life of the lease as follows:\n•\t An upwards revision of residual value estimates leads to the recognition of a lower \ndepreciation charge for the year and in future years;\n•\t A downwards revision of residual value estimates leads to the recognition of a higher \ndepreciation charge for the year and in future years.\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the \nresidual value of used cars has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range \nof reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, \nand possibly many times that amount. The financial statements disclose the sensitivities \nestimated by the Group.\nWe performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the group’s \ncontrols because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain \naudit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.\n•\t Historical comparisons: We assessed the Group’s historical forecasting \nperformance, comparing the Group’s residual value forecasts to the actual  \nre-sale value of different cohorts of cars;\n•\t Benchmarking assumptions: We assessed the Group’s forecasts against \nalternative industry benchmarks such as CAP index;\n•\t Our expertise: We used our economics specialists to assess the assumptions \nover the macroeconomic outlook;\n•\t Test of detail: We assessed the completeness and accuracy of key data inputs \nincluding current sales prices and economic data;\n•\t Test of detail: We calculated our own range for the estimate, by assessing the \nvariability used in car sales data experienced by the Group. We focussed on similar \ntransactions, carried out at similar points in time, such that we were able to narrow \nthis range to only reasonable values. We compared the Group’s estimate to our \nrange, and assessed the Group’s rationale for the point estimate chosen; and\n•\t Assessing transparency: We assessed whether the disclosures appropriately \nreflect and address the uncertainty which exists when determining the \nresidual value of used cars. As a part of this, we assessed the sensitivity \nanalysis that is disclosed.\nOur results\nWe found the resulting estimate of the residual values of used cars and the \nrelated disclosures to be acceptable (2021 result: acceptable).\nIndependent auditor’s report continued\nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n90"

Valuation of these liabilities is highly judgmental as it requires a number \nof assumptions to be made that have high estimation uncertainty and can have material impacts \non the valuation. Further, valuation of these liabilities involves selection of appropriate methods \nand involves complex calculations.\nThe key assumptions used to value the IBNR reserves are expected loss ratios, which depend on \nestimates of the frequency and severity of claims, including the impact of COVID-19, and, for the \nlatter, inflation. Certain areas of the IBNR contain greater uncertainty, for example third party \nbodily injury claims exhibit greater variability and are more long tailed than the damage classes.\nSimilar estimates are required in establishing the reinsurers’ share of insurance provisions, \nin particular share of IBNR claims.\nThe IBNR reserve forms part of the provision for insurance claims outstanding which includes \nan actuarial best estimate (‘ABE’) and a margin to make allowance for risks and uncertainties \nthat are not specifically allowed for in establishing the ABE. The appropriate margin to \nrecognise is a subjective judgement and estimate taken by the Directors, based on the \nperceived uncertainty and potential for volatility in the underlying claims.\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the \nvaluation of IBNR reserves has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range \nof reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole.\nWe performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the Group’s \ncontrols because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain \naudit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.\n•\t Independence re-performance: We carried out alternative projections of \nthe gross and net IBNR reserve balances using standard actuarial methods;\n•\t Sector experience and benchmarking: We compared the assumptions, reserving \nmethodologies and estimates of gross and net IBNR (of reinsurance) losses to \nexpectations based on the Group’s historical experience, current trends, externally-\nderived data and benchmarking against industry trends including information \nrelating to new legislation that may affect claims settlement; \n•\t Margin evaluation: We evaluated the appropriateness of the margin applied to \nthe actuarial best estimate. In order to do this we assessed the Directors’ approach \nto, and analysis performed, in setting the margin with respect to recognised \nactuarial methods. In particular, we considered the allowance for uncertainties \ninherent in the data and assumptions in developing the actuarial best estimate \nthrough inquiry with the Directors and with respect to our understanding of any \nchanges in the Group’s risks and our own sector experience of approaches to \nsetting the margin and the level of margin held by the Groups peers; and \n•\t Assessing transparency: We assessed the appropriateness of the accounting \npolicy and disclosures relating to valuation of IBNR reserves. \nOur results\nWe found the resulting estimate of the valuation of incurred but not reported \nreserves to be acceptable (2021 result: acceptable). \nRecoverability of parent \nCompany’s loans to \nsubsidiaries \nRefer to page 70 (Audit \nCommittee Report), page 103 \n(accounting policy) and page 120 \n(financial disclosures)\nLow risk, high value\nThe carrying amount of the parent Company’s loans to subsidiaries represents 86.8% \n(2020: 91.6%) of the Company’s total assets.\nTheir recoverability is not at a high risk of significant misstatement or subject to significant \njudgement. However, due to their materiality in the context of the Parent Company financial \nstatements, this is considered to be the area that had the greatest effect on our overall parent \nCompany audit.\nWe performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the Group’s \ncontrols because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain \naudit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described:\n•\t Test of detail: We have assessed 100% of the loans to Group companies to identify, \nwith reference to the relevant subsidiaries’ draft balance sheet, whether they have \na positive net asset value and therefore coverage of debt owed, as well as \nassessing whether those subsidiaries have historically been profit-making.\nOur results \nWe found the Group’s assessment of the recoverability of parent Company’s loans \nto subsidiaries to be acceptable (2021 result: acceptable).\nIndependent auditor’s report continued\nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n91"

Our application of materiality and an overview of \nthe scope of our audit\nMateriality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set \nat £33.0m (2021: £34.0m), determined with reference to a benchmark \nof Group total revenue, of which it represents 0.7% (2021: 0.8% of \ntotal revenue). \nMateriality for the parent Company financial statements as a \nwhole was set at £23.0m (2021: £23.8m), determined with reference  \nto a benchmark of Company total assets, of which it represents 0.34% \n(2021: 0.38% of total assets) given this was capped at a percentage \nof Group materiality. \nIn line with our audit methodology, our procedures on individual \naccount balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, \nperformance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the \nrisk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account \nbalances add up to a material amount across the financial statements \nas a whole. \nPerformance materiality was set at 65% (2021: 65%) of materiality \nfor the financial statements as a whole, which equates to £21.4m \n(2021: £22.1m) for the Group and £14.9m (2021: £15.4m) for the \nparent Company. We applied this percentage in our determination \nof performance materiality based on our assessment of the increased \nlevel of aggregation risk.\nWe agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or \nuncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £1.6m (2021: £1.7m) \nfor the Group and £1.1m (2021: £1.5m) for the Company, in addition \nto other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on \nqualitative grounds. \nWe subjected all three of the Group’s reporting components to full \nscope audits for Group purposes. The components within the scope \nof our work accounted for 100% of the Group revenue, profit before \ntax and total assets. \nThe Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant \nareas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and \nthe information to be reported back.

At these meetings, the \nfindings reported to the Group team were discussed in more \ndetail and any further work required by the Group team was \nthen performed by the component auditor.\nWe were able to rely upon the Group’s internal control over financial \nreporting in several areas of our audit, where our controls testing \nsupported this approach, which enabled us to reduce the scope of \nour substantive audit work; in the other areas the scope of the \naudit work performed was fully substantive.\nTotal revenue\nGroup materiality\nRevenue\n£4,708.4m (2021: £4,459.5m)\nGroup materiality\n£33.0m (2021: £34.0m)\n£33.0m\nWhole ﬁnancial statements\nmateriality (2021: £34.0m)\n£21.4m\nWhole ﬁnancial \nstatements perfromance\nmateriality (2021: £22.0m)\n£31.0m\nRange of materiality at 3\ncomponents (£8.0m to £31.0m)\n(2021: £6.8m to £32.0m)\n£1.6m\nMisstatements reported to the\naudit committee (2021: £1.7m)\nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n92"

Going concern\nThe Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going \nconcern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the \nCompany or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded \nthat the Group’s and the Company’s financial position means that \nthis is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material \nuncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability \nto continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of \napproval of the financial statements (“the going concern period”). \nWe used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general \neconomic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business \nmodel and analysed how those risks might affect the Group’s and \nCompany’s financial resources or ability to continue operations over \nthe going concern period. The risks that we considered most likely to \nadversely affect the Group’s and Company’s available financial \nresources and metrics relevant to debt covenants over this period were:\n•\t Reduced disposal proceeds from disposal of operating lease assets; \nand\n•\t Economic uncertainty impacting the fleet valuations. \nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity \nand covenant compliance in the going concern period by comparing \nsevere, but plausible downside scenarios that could arise from these \nrisks individually and collectively against the level of available financial \nresources and covenants indicated by the Group’s financial forecasts. \nWe considered whether the going concern disclosure in note 2 to the \nfinancial statements gives a full and accurate description of the \nDirectors’ assessment of going concern.\nOur conclusions based on this work:\n•\t We consider that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis \nof accounting in the preparation of the financial statements \nis appropriate;\n•\t We have not identified, and concur with the Directors’ assessment \nthat there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or \nconditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant \ndoubt on the Group’s or Company’s ability to continue as a going \nconcern for the going concern period; and\n•\t We found the going concern disclosure in note 2 to be acceptable.\nHowever, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as \nsubsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with \njudgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the \nabove conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the \nCompany will continue in operation. \n5. Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations – \nability to detect\nIdentifying and responding to risks of material misstatement \ndue to fraud\nTo identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud risks”) \nwe assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or \npressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. \nOur risk assessment procedures included:\n•\t Enquiring of Directors, the Audit Committee, internal audit and \ninspection of policy documentation as to the Group’s high-level \npolicies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the \ninternal audit function, and the Group’s channel for “whistleblowing”, \nas well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or \nalleged fraud.\n•\t Reading Board, Audit Committee and Financial Risk Management \nCommittee meeting minutes.\n•\t Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance \ntargets for management and Directors.\n•\t Using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or \nunexpected relationships.\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team \nand remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit . \nThis included communication from the Group audit team to the \ncomponent audit team of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group \nlevel and request to the component audit team to report to the Group \naudit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material \nmisstatement at the Group level.\nAs required by auditing standards, we perform procedures to address \nthe risk of management override of controls, in particular the risk that \nGroup and component management may be in a position to make \ninappropriate accounting entries and the risk of bias in accounting \nestimates and judgements such as residual value of used cars and \nvaluation of IBNR reserves. On this audit we do not believe there \nis a fraud risk related to revenue recognition because there is limited \nopportunity to commit fraud due to the lack of inherent complexity in \nrevenue recognition and there is limited perceived pressure on \nmanagement or incentives to achieve an expected revenue target.\nWe identified fraud risks in relation to residual value of used cars and \nvaluation of IBNR reserves due to the significant judgement involved in \nthese estimates. Further detail in respect of these areas is set out in the \nkey audit matter disclosures in section 2 of this report.\nWe performed procedures including:\n•\t Identifying journal entries to test based on risk criteria and \ncomparing the identified entries to supporting documentation. \nAn example of our high risk criteria is journal entries posted to \nseldom used accounts. \n•\t Assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting \nestimates are indicative of a potential bias.\nIdentifying and responding to risks of material misstatement \nrelated to compliance with laws and regulations\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably \nbe expected to have a material effect on the financial statements \nfrom our general commercial and sector experience, and through \ndiscussion with the Directors and other management (as required \nby auditing standards), and from inspection of the Group’s regulatory \nand legal correspondence and discussed with the directors and other \nmanagement the policies and procedures regarding compliance with \nlaws and regulations. \nAs the Group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining \nan understanding of the control environment including the entity’s \nprocedures for complying with regulatory requirements. \nWe communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our \nteam and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance \nthroughout the audit. This included communication from the \nGroup audit team to the component audit team of relevant laws \nand regulations identified at the Group level, and a request for the \ncomponent auditor to report to the Group audit team any instances \nof non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to \na material misstatement at the Group level. \nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial \nstatements varies considerably.\nFirstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly \naffect the financial statements including financial reporting \nlegislation (including related companies legislation), distributable \nprofits legislation, and taxation legislation and we assessed the \nextent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of \nour procedures on the related financial statement items. \nSecondly , the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations \nwhere the consequences of non-compliance could have a material \neffect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for \ninstance through the imposition of fines or litigation or the loss of the \nGroup’s license to operate. We identified the following areas as those \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n93"

      "text": "Notes to the financial statements  \nNotes to the financial statements \n \n1. General information \nMotability Operations Group plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom, whose shares are privately \nowned. The address of the registered office is City Gate House, 22 Southwark Bridge Road, London SE1 9HB. The nature of the \nCompany’s operations and its principal activities are set out on pages 3 to 5 and 15, and the Group's shareholders are detailed in the \nCorporate governance report on page 61. \nMotability Operations Group plc (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries will be referred to as ‘the Group’ in this report. \nThese financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in \nwhich the Company operates. \nAccounting convention \nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except the revaluation of financial assets and \nfinancial liabilities (including derivative instruments) which are valued at fair value through profit or loss, apart from derivative \ninstruments relating to cash flow hedges which are classified and measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. \n2. Significant accounting policies \nBasis of preparation \nOn 31 December 2020, IFRS as adopted by the European Union at that date was brought into UK law and became UK-adopted \nInternational Accounting Standards, with future changes being subject to endorsement by the UK Endorsement Board. Motability \nOperations Group plc transitioned to UK-adopted International Accounting Standards in its Company financial statements on \n1 October 2021. This change constitutes a change in accounting framework. However, there is no impact on recognition, \nmeasurement or disclosure in the period reported as a result of the change in framework.  \nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and with the \nrequirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under those standards. \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect \nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and \nexpenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on the Directors’ best knowledge of the amount, event or \nactions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, \nor areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements and Motability Operations \nGroup plc’s individual Company financial statements, are disclosed in note 3.  \nExcept as described below, the accounting policies have been applied consistently to the years 2022 and 2021. \nAdoption of new or revised standards \nThe following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted in these financial statements. Their adoption has \nnot had a material impact on the amounts reported. \nIFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and \nIFRS 16 (Amendments) \nInterest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\b\n100\b"

The Group is assessing the impact \nof the changes for the reporting of the fleet reinsurance segment and has no plans to apply the requirements of the standard earlier \nthan the required date. \nAside from IFRS 17 (which is still being assessed), the Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards, amendments and \ninterpretations in future periods is not likely to have a material effect on the financial statements of the Group, and do not plan \nto apply any of the new IFRSs in advance of their required dates. \nOther standards, amendments and interpretations not described above are not material to the Group or the Company’s \nfinancial statements. \nInterest Rate Benchmark Reform \nThe Group has adopted Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and \nIFRS 16) (the Phase 2 amendments) and applied the Phase 2 relief for the first time in the period to 30 September 2022. \nHistorically, the variable rate paid or received on interest rate swap contracts used by the Group has been based on LIBOR. \nUpon the cessation of the LIBOR benchmarks in 2021 the Group updated its bank facilities to reference the market-standard \nrisk-free rate. The replacement of LIBOR with the SONIA benchmark has been applied to the Group’s syndicated bank facility \nand bilateral bank facility; both facilities remain in operation as at 30 September 2022. The adoption of SONIA as the \nreference rate also required both facilities to adopt Credit Adjustment Spreads (“CAS”). The CAS eliminate, as can be best \nachieved, any economic value transferring between the lenders and the Group resulting from this change. All other critical \nterms within the facilities are unaffected. \nNone of the Group’s derivatives contracts were impacted by the switch as the only open derivative positions in place at the \ntime of the transition were executed on a ‘fixed pay, fixed received’ basis. These derivates (swaps designated in eligible hedge \nrelationships) therefore do not reference a floating rate. All pre-existing floating rate derivative contracts had expired prior to \nthe cut-over date. \nThe Phase 2 amendments provide practical relief from certain requirements in the standards related to modifications of \nfinancial instruments, lease contracts or hedging relationships when a benchmark interest rate is replaced with a new \nalternative benchmark rate when the modifications are a direct consequence of interest rate benchmark reform and are made \non an economically equivalent basis. As this is the case with the Group’s modifications, the reliefs have been adopted and the \nGroup has also elected not to restate the prior period to also reflect the application of these amendments. \n \n \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\b\n101\b"

Significant accounting policies continued \nGoing concern \nThe Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set \nout in the Strategic report on pages 3 to 47. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing \nfacilities are described in the Strategic report on pages 23 to 26. In addition, note 36 to the financial statements includes the Group’s \nobjectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial \ninstruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit, liquidity and foreign exchange risk. \nThe Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements, which is deemed appropriate for the \nreasons described below. \nThe Group has considerable financial resources, with restricted reserves of £3,804.3m at 30 September 2022, together with a  \nlong-term contract with Motability to operate the ‘Motability Scheme’. \nDuring the year ended 30 September 2022, there have been additional local and national restrictions in response to the global \nCovid-19 pandemic. Business operations have been uninterrupted throughout this period as all employees are capable of working \nremotely where possible. In addition, the used-car market has remained operational and due to key component shortages, \nexacerbated by the war in Ukraine, constraining new vehicle supplies, used-car values remain buoyant and in line with \nmanagement expectations. \nFollowing the year-ended 30 September 2022, on 31 October 2022, the Group completed a refinancing exercise which secured two \nnew five-year facilities: a £1.5bn revolving credit facility and a £400m term loan, as described in note 35. \nThe Directors have prepared budgets and cash flow forecasts for the period to 31 March 2024 by means of a baseline forecast. \nThe baseline forecast is based on economic conditions and forecasts as at 30 September 2022. \nIn addition, the Directors have applied severe, yet plausible, downside scenarios to the baseline forecast, reflecting the potential \neffects to operations and financial performance as the country and economy recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. These include a \ndeterioration in revenue from disposal of operating lease assets and an inability to issue debt under the Euro Medium Term Note \nProgramme, should it be required. \nWithin both the baseline and stressed forecasts the Group has significant headroom to: \n• continue to fund the business and meet its liabilities utilising current and refinanced banking facilities, detailed in notes 25 and 35; \n• meet the objectives of its capital and reserves management policy, detailed in note 36; and \n• comply with its debt financing covenant, detailed in note 36. \nThe forecast headroom in the event of these severe, yet plausible, scenarios coming to fruition indicates that no mitigating action \nis required. \nConsequently, the Directors are confident that the Group and Company will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its liabilities as \nthey fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements and therefore have prepared the financial \nstatements on a going concern basis. \nBasis of consolidation \nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to or has \nrights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the \nentity. In terms of subsidiaries, the Group: \n• Consolidates subsidiaries from the date on which control passes to the Group and deconsolidates from the date control ceases \n• Changes the accounting policies of subsidiaries, where necessary, to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group \n• Eliminates intercompany transactions and balances in the Group results \n \n \n \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\b\n102\b"

      "text": "Notes to the financial statements continued  \n2. Significant accounting policies continued \nInvestment in subsidiaries \nThe Company’s investments in its subsidiaries are stated at cost less any charge for impairment in the Company’s balance \nsheet. Impairment adjustments are charged to the income statement. In accordance with IAS 36, impairment is considered as part \nof the Group’s going concern analysis. \nIntangible assets \nIntangible assets represent computer software costs. In accordance with IAS 38, computer software is capitalised on the basis of \nthe costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software and includes capitalised internal labour where appropriate. \nThese costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, between three and seven years. Annually, \nintangible assets are reviewed for impairment triggers which in these cases would be idleness or loss of use of the assets. \nProperty, plant and equipment \nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for any impairment in \nvalue. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition \nfor its intended use. The carrying values of all property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes \nin circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if \nappropriate, at each balance sheet date. \nDepreciation is calculated to write down assets, on a straight-line basis, over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows: \nMotor vehicles (company cars) \nFour years\nLeasehold improvements \nRemaining term of lease\nFixtures, fittings and office equipment \nThree years\nThe estimated useful life of right-of-use assets is to the end of the lease contracts. The lease maturity dates are disclosed in \nnote 31. \nGains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within net \noperating costs in the income statement. Property, plant and equipment assets are reviewed annually for impairment triggers \nmeaning loss/cessation of use. \nAssets held for use in operating leases \nAssets leased to customers, under agreements which do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, are \nclassified as operating leases. Operating lease assets are capitalised and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their anticipated \nuseful lives to estimated residual values. Estimated residual values are reviewed at the balance sheet date against the latest used-\ncar price information and any resulting changes are accounted for prospectively as a recalibration of depreciation for the year and \nremaining lease term.  \nAssets are reviewed annually for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount \n(including any recalibration arising from the review of residual values) may not be fully recoverable, considering both external \nas well as internal sources of information. If such an indication for impairment exists, an analysis is performed to assess whether  \nthe carrying value of the assets exceeds the recoverable amount. An impairment charge is booked for the amount by which the \nasset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the ‘value in use’. The value in use is \ndetermined as the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from each monthly tranche of leases by lease \ninception date (as ‘cash generating units’). This is done at a monthly tranche level as the lowest possible level of aggregation \ngiven the portfolio characteristics of the leased fleet in terms of future costs and the uncertainty of future early termination \nrates which would impact the prospects of individual vehicle assets. \nAny impairment charge is unwound when either the tranche of leases affected comes to an end or there has been a change in the \nestimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment charge is reversed only to the extent of the asset’s carrying \namount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, if no impairment charge had been recognised. \nInventories \nIn accordance with IAS 2, operating lease assets are transferred to inventories at their carrying amount when they cease  \nto be leased and become held for sale. Inventories are subsequently measured at the lower of their transfer value and net \nrealisable value.  \n \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\b\n103\b"

      "text": "Notes to the financial statements continued  \n2. Significant accounting policies continued \nRevenue recognition – leasing (under IFRS 16) \nRevenue comprises both advance rentals payable directly by lessees and periodic rentals receivable from lessees by means of \nmandated payments of: the Higher Rate Mobility Component of the Disability Living Allowance; the War Pensioners’ Mobility \nSupplement; the Enhanced Rate of the Mobility Component of the Personal Independence Payment; or the Armed Forces \nIndependence Payment. The total rental receivable under each leasing contract is then split further into leasing revenue, in-life \nservice costs revenue and insurance cover-related revenue. The terms of payment of the overall rental are as described above – \na single upfront payment where applicable followed by mandated four-weekly payments from the relevant Government agency. \nThe rental revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the goods and services provided. Rental \nrevenue (including advance rentals) from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  \nProceeds from disposal of operating lease assets are recognised when the physical vehicles have been sold and control of the \nvehicles has been passed to the buyer at the point of sale (usually to a car dealership or at auction). For insurance reimbursements, \nrevenue is recognised when the claim has been accepted by the insurer and a valuation provided for the compensation amount. \nProvisions for customer rebates \nRental income received in respect of conditional customer rebates is not recognised as revenue to the extent that it is expected to \nbe repaid to customers on the return of their leased assets.  \nRevenue recognition – in-life service costs and insurance services (under IFRS 15) \nRental income received in respect of in-life service costs (“ILSC”) or insurance services is deferred to the extent that it relates to \nfuture performance obligations under each of these two elements of the contract. For each of these two revenue streams, the \nmeasure of progress selected as the most appropriate measure to depict the Group’s performance in transferring control of \nservices promised to the customer is the ‘cost-to-cost’ input method (that is, costs incurred relative to total estimated costs). \nThese are performance obligations which are satisfied at specific times as routine or recurring services during the period of \ncontract, so using relative costs to determine the completion rate is appropriate. \nManagement has made a judgement in applying the disaggregation of the contractual obligations to treat ILSC and insurance \ncover rentals as separate revenue streams (and not to disaggregate any further). This is due to a) maintenance, servicing, tyres, \nwindscreens and breakdown cover all being similar in nature in terms of keeping vehicles on the road in good condition and having \na well-established history of timing effects in terms of the historic spend curve of such services and b) the insurance element being a \nseparate obligation with different timing characteristics. All other services provided relate to the leasing of the vehicle itself and are \noutside the scope of IFRS 15. \nILSC spend curves occur because such services are back-loaded for a new vehicle, as maintenance costs are lower in the first year \nof a vehicle’s life compared with later years. For insurance, premium payments to the Group’s fronting insurer are generally \nexpected to rise every six months, so that the obligation to pay premiums in the latter stages of a lease is typically higher than the \nearly stages, requiring a deferral of revenue recognised. \nMargins have been applied to each of these revenue streams giving due consideration to possible future increases to prices in  \nboth the ILSC and insurance sectors, to protect these revenue streams from impairment in the event of such increases. To do so, \npast changes in historical spending curves are reviewed. \nAll historical spending curves are reviewed periodically to ensure that they remain a fair representation of the expected changes in \ncost profiles as a proxy for performance obligations in line with the leasing contracts. \nNet operating costs \nNet operating costs comprise: net book value of disposed operating lease assets, depreciation, insurance, maintenance, dealer \nsupply and service payments, roadside assistance, charitable donations and other Scheme-related costs including the Motability \nlevy (see note 33) and overheads. An analysis is provided in note 6. \nThe Group’s insurance costs are presented net of a ‘profit sharing’ arrangement with the fronting insurer. These premium rebates \nare recognised as receivable by the Group once loss ratios are determined following actuarial review, in line with IAS 37 ‘Provisions, \nContingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’. \nOverheads include the cost to the Group of the Directors’ long-term incentives, recognised on an accruals basis over the period \nto which the performance criteria relate, adjusted for changes in the probability of performance criteria being met or conditional \nawards lapsing. \nCharitable donations \nCharitable donations are recognised when paid, or when a constructive obligation is established by the creation of a clearly \ncommunicated expectation in sufficient detail to effectively make the obligation irrevocable. \n \n \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\b\n104\b"

      "text": "Notes to the financial statements continued  \n2. Significant accounting policies continued \nFinance costs \nFinance costs are recognised as an expense on an accruals basis using the straight-line method, as this is materially equivalent to \nthe effective interest rate method for the Group. \nRetirement benefit costs \nCompany pension contributions are calculated as a fixed percentage of the pensionable salaries of eligible employees. These \ncontributions are charged in the period to which the salary relates. The Company pension scheme is a defined contribution scheme. \nThe Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. \nTaxation \nTaxation on the profit for the year comprises both current and deferred tax as well as adjustments in respect of prior years. \nTaxation is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income \nor directly in equity, in which case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. \nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the profit for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance \nsheet date. \nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for reporting \npurposes and the amounts charged or credited for tax purposes. Deferred tax is calculated at the rate of tax expected to apply \nwhen the liability is settled or the asset is realised using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. \nA deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the \nasset can be utilised. Any estimates of rate change effect on the measurement of deferred tax balances are disclosed separately. \nLong-term incentive arrangements \nPayments falling due under long-term incentive arrangements depend upon length of service and performance criteria (see note 34). \nThe cost is recognised during the years in which services are rendered subject to meeting specific performance requirements.  \nShare capital \nOrdinary share capital is classified as equity. The Group’s preference shares are classified as debt, with the associated dividend \nbeing recognised on an amortised cost basis in the income statement as a finance cost. As regards ordinary shareholders, there is \nno dividend entitlement. A reserves management policy has been established to ensure that the business and the customer \nproposition are sustainable throughout the economic cycle. \nFinancial instruments \nFinancial assets and liabilities include trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables, preference \nshares and derivative instruments.  \nRecognition and initial measurement \nTrade receivables are initially recognised when originated, and initially measured at the transaction price. Other financial assets and \nliabilities are recognised when the Company within the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and \nare initially valued including transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition or issue. \nClassification and subsequent measurement  \nFinancial assets are measured at amortised cost, and this classification would only be changed if the Group changed its business \nmodel (in which case all affected financial assets would be reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the \nchange in the business model). \nIn classifying these assets at amortised cost, both of the following conditions have been found to apply: the business model has an \nobjective to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are \nsolely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. \nThe business model  \nThe financial assets at amortised cost are held at MORL, the reinsurance captive. MORL holds investments in a managed bond \nsolution segregated into portfolios with differing maturity profiles, reflecting the fact that cash arises from two sources: capital \nand reinsurance premiums. The portfolios are managed with the main aim of capital preservation, with key restrictions set by the \ntreasury policy on credit quality, asset type, duration of assets and maximum exposures. Over the life of these portfolios no early \nsales have ever been made. The only provision for making an early disposal is where a significant increase to an asset’s credit risk \noccurs (e.g. a significant downgrade in a bond’s rating to below investment grade – with the Group’s minimum rating requirement \nbeing A- or A3 this would mean a four-notch fall in the bond’s rating).  \nThe remainder of the Group’s financial assets (trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents) are held to collect. \n \n \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\b\n105\b"

      "text": "Notes to the financial statements continued  \n2. Significant accounting policies continued \nFinancial instruments continued \nAssessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest \nThe Group has considered the contractual terms of the instruments, including assessing whether the financial asset contains \na contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition, \nincluding contingent events that would change the timing of cash flows, variable-rate features, prepayment and extension features \nand non-recourse features.  \nThe treasury policy adopted by the Group in respect of financial assets does not allow for investments in instruments with \ntrigger events which could change the amounts or timing of cash flows, callable bonds, or arrangements denominated in foreign \ncurrencies. The allowable investments are corporate and Government debt instruments which pay interest as per the bond issue and \nprincipal at maturity.  \nSubsequent measurement \nFinancial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method, where relevant reduced by \nimpairment losses with interest income and impairment recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition would be \nrecognised in profit or loss. \nFinancial liabilities – classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses \nTrade and other payables \nTrade and other payables are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, \nit is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation, and reliable \nestimates of the amount of obligation can be made. \nTrade and other payables are short-term financial liabilities which do not carry any interest and are stated at nominal value, which \napproximates to the fair value because of their short maturities. \nFinancial liabilities \nFinancial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs. They are subsequently held at amortised cost. \nAny difference between the amount on initial recognition and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement using the \neffective interest method.  \nShort-term financial liabilities, such as bank overdrafts, are measured at nominal value, which approximates to the fair value \nbecause of their short maturities. \nRight-of-use asset lease liabilities \nLeases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is made available \nfor use. Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance costs. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the \nlease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. The right-of-use asset is \ndepreciated over the shorter of its useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. In determining the lease term, we consider \nall the facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option or not exercise a termination \noption over the planning horizon of five years. In general, it is not expected that the discount rate implicit in the lease is available so \nthe lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used. This is the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to \nobtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.  \nAny lease modification to our property leases will be accounted for as a separate lease if both a) the modification increases the \nscope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets and b) the consideration for the lease increases by \nan amount commensurate with the stand-alone price for the increase in scope. \nInsurance receivables and payables \nReceivables and payables arising under insurance contracts are recognised when due. A provision for impairment is established \nwhen there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition, the estimated \nfuture cash flows have been impacted. \nDerecognition \nFinancial assets are derecognised when contractual rights to the cash flows expire or are transferred along with substantially \nall the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligations are discharged or \ncancelled, or expire. The Group would also derecognise a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the \nmodified terms are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms would be recognised \nat fair value.  \n \n \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\b\n106\b"

      "text": "Notes to the financial statements continued  \n2. Significant accounting policies continued \nFinancial liabilities – classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses continued \nOffsetting \nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the \nGroup currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise \nthe asset and settle the liability simultaneously. \nDerivative financial instruments and hedge accounting: cash flow hedges \nThe Group enters into derivative financial instruments, comprising interest rate and cross-currency swaps, to manage its exposures \nto interest rate and foreign exchange risk, chiefly on the Group’s Eurobonds. Further details of derivative financial instruments are \ndisclosed in note 26. \nAt the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged \nitem, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the \ninception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether or not the hedging instrument that is used in a \nhedging relationship is effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.  \nNote 26 sets out details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes. Movements in the fair value \nreserve (net of tax effects) are also detailed in the statement of changes in equity. \nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured \nto their fair value at each balance sheet date. When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective \nportion of changes in fair value of the derivative is recognised in OCI and accumulated in the hedging reserve. Any ineffective \nportion would be recognised immediately in profit or loss. \nImpairment policy: financial assets \nFinancial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date and impaired where there is objective \nevidence that, as a result of one or more events (such as a default or a significant increase in credit risk) that occurred after \nthe initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been reduced. \nOn investments held to collect, the Group considers that the low credit risk practical expedient in IFRS 9 applies as the treasury \npolicy limits the range of investments such that the instruments have a strong capacity to meet their contractual cash flow obligations, \nthey are resilient to adverse changes in economic and business conditions, and have a strong external rating (see ‘The business \nmodel’ above). This means that only 12-month expected credit losses (“ECL”) will be recorded for these financial instruments, \nand these are not material for the Group. \nIn terms of ECL on trade receivables, the Group’s policy is to collect all trade debt via direct debit at the point of sale for vehicle \ndisposals, or monthly in other cases. Customer rentals are either paid upfront or by assignment of Government allowances which \nare collected electronically on a four-weekly basis. No trade receivables include a significant financing component. For trade \nreceivables, cash equivalents and inter-company loans the key elements used in the calculation of ECL are: the probability of \ndefault, the loss given a default occurring, and the exposure at default. The measurement is a probability weighted estimate of \ncredit losses over the expected life of the financial instrument. \nIFRS 9 allows for a simplified approach (rather than a ‘staging’ approach) in such circumstances and the Group uses a provision \nmatrix combining historical provision rates with current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future.  \nForeign currency translation \nThe Company has issued fixed-rate Eurobonds and at the same time entered into cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements \nto hedge its foreign exchange risk. The Company’s overall foreign exchange risk management strategy is to translate all new issued \nforeign-denominated debt into the Company’s functional currency of Sterling. \nMonetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at rates of exchange prevailing at \nthe balance sheet date. Foreign currency amounts are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the \ntransactions. Individual transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the exchange rates prevailing \non the dates payment takes place. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are, with the exception of the effective portion  \nof foreign exchange gains or losses on debt instruments designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge relationship, \nincluded in the income statement for the period and are classified as either operating or financing depending on the nature of the \nmonetary item giving rise to them. The Company hedged all its foreign exchange risks on the Eurobonds and does not have any \nother monetary assets or liabilities in foreign currencies. \n \n \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\b\n107\b"

      "text": "Notes to the financial statements continued  \n2. Significant accounting policies continued \nFinancial liabilities – classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses continued \nInsurance contracts \nInsurance contracts are those contracts that transfer significant insurance risk. Such contracts may also transfer financial risks.  \nRecognition and measurement \nInsurance and reinsurance claims and loss adjustment expenses are charged (and credited) to the income statement as incurred \nbased on the best estimate of liabilities for compensation owed to contract holders together with a risk margin. They include direct \nand indirect claims settlement costs and arise from events that have occurred up to the balance sheet date even if they have not \nyet been reported to the Group. The measurement of insurance liabilities and reinsurance recoveries is described in more detail \nin note 24. \nThe Group does not discount its insurance liabilities as they are generally short term in nature. Liabilities for unpaid claims are \nestimated using the input of data for individual cases reported to the Group and statistical analysis for the claims incurred but not \nreported, including an estimate of the impact on claims that may be affected by external factors such as court decisions and \nlegislative changes. \nPayments made by the insurance subsidiary in respect of Group-owned fleet vehicles written off are eliminated on consolidation \n(see note 5). \n3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty \nIn the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions \nabout the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  \nThe estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. \nActual results may differ from these estimates. \nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in \nthe period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if \nthe revision affects both current and future periods.  \nJudgements are made when applying significant accounting policies and disclosed below where these judgements materially  \naffect the reported numbers. Judgements and estimates also apply when preparing for going concern analysis and disclosures \n(see note 2). \nThe Company has no significant accounting estimates. \nKey estimate: residual values of operating lease assets  \nThe method by which the Directors have determined the Group’s residual values of the operating lease assets is described in \nnote 13, and the impact of the change in estimates during the year is also disclosed in note 6. \nSensitivity analysis \nBecause of the inherent uncertainty associated with such valuation methodology and in particular the volatility of the prices  \nof second-hand vehicles, the carrying value of the operating lease assets may differ from their realisable value (see note 13).  \nAs at 30 September 2022, if the value of the expected net sales proceeds for our existing portfolio of operating leases were to \ndecrease/increase by 1% from our estimates (1% being a reasonable, scalable base unit for movements in the used-car market), \nthe effect would be to increase/decrease the depreciation on these vehicles by £87.2m (2021: £75.9m). Approximately 25% of this  \nwill crystallise at the end of the contracts (in particular in cases where the leases terminate early) but for the majority of the fleet a \nrevaluation exercise is undertaken in order to prospectively adjust the depreciation expense over the remaining terms of the leases. \nThis would be booked from the start of the current accounting year onwards. A 1% fall would increase this year’s depreciation \ncharge by approximately £19.2m (2021: £15.1m) and there is no impact on impairment charges (2021: no impairment charge). A 1% \nrise would decrease this year’s depreciation charge by approximately £18.5m (2021: £14.8m) and there would be no impact on \nimpairment charges (2021: no impairment charge). \n \n \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\b\n108\b"

      "text": "Notes to the financial statements continued  \n3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty \ncontinued \nKey estimate and judgement: insurance contracts \nThere are many factors that cause uncertainty when the Group is estimating its ultimate claims liability. Principally, the complex \nnature of the bodily injury claims (in particular) usually result in a lengthy legal process during which the estimated claims quantum \ncan fluctuate, and judgements are made by actuaries in the selection of appropriate actuarial methods when estimating the claims \nliabilities. The methods and basis of selection are described in more detail in note 24.  \nTherefore, the key estimates and judgements relating to insurance contracts concern the valuation of claims liabilities. \nValuation of liabilities of insurance contracts \nClaims incurred include all losses occurring during the year (reported or not), related handling costs, a reduction for the value of salvage \nand other recoveries and any adjustments to claims outstanding from previous years. The provision for claims outstanding is made on \nan individual basis plus an estimate of the cost of claims incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) at the balance sheet date using statistical \nmethods. The estimation of IBNR is generally subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than notified claims as some cases can take \ntime to become notified and the total amount of the potential claim is not always apparent from initial information supplied to the \ninsurer. In calculating the estimated cost of unpaid claims, the Group, in conjunction with independent actuaries, uses a variety of \nestimation techniques, generally based upon statistical analysis of both market data and its own historic experience.  \nDuring 2021 the new measures from the UK Civil Liability Act relating to whiplash-related injury claims came into effect. The new \nregulations have so far led to a reduction in this type of claim though there is some uncertainty about the longer-term effect.  \nThe Group has assessed the continuing impact of Covid-19 on repair delays and the time claims take to be progressed and settled, \nwhich have resulted in slower loss development and the potential for higher costs. In addition, the Group has recognised that repair \ncost inflation continues to increase, together with key-to-key times on repairs. For these reasons, the Group has determined that it is \nappropriate to continue to apply a higher risk margin than in a normal period.  \nThe risk margin would normally be calibrated at the 80th percentile, but since 30 September 2020 it has been temporarily moved to \na higher confidence interval (85th), giving an additional risk margin on the retained risk layer of £3.3m (2021: £2.8m). The actuary has \nprovided the Directors with a number of models and sensitivity tests to evaluate the adequacy of this risk margin. The conclusion  \nof the analysis was that the risk margin at the 85th percentile would be adequate in a range of scenarios. This has given the Group \nassurance that a range of downside scenarios, including repair cost inflation and increasing delays in loss development impacts, \nis not expected to exceed the margin applied.  \nThe reserves held in the financial statements of the Group are adequate and match the best estimates calculated by the \nindependent actuaries. See note 24 for details of claims reserves balances. \nSensitivity analysis \nA 1% change in the insurance loss ratio would impact pre-tax profits by £2.9m in the year (2021: £2.7m). The precise outcome of \nsuch changes would depend on the impacted layer and frequency of claims in each scenario. Note 24 describes in more detail the \nsources of uncertainty in the estimation of future claims payments. \nGiven the current high inflationary environment and uncertainty over future inflation, alternative adverse inflation scenarios have \nbeen considered which also provide an indication of the sensitivity of the Group’s insurance claims reserves to this assumption. \nAssuming claims inflation peaks at 8% at Q4 2022, and is sustained at least 4.8% until Q4 2023, this would result in a £2.7m increase \nin liabilities in the net layer and a further £7.9m increase in the liabilities of the reinsurance layer. \n \n \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\b\n109\b"

This is different to the standard rate due to non-taxable capital gains on disposals of motor vehicles for values  \nabove cost, and non-deductible expenses consisting predominantly of depreciation on leasehold improvements and preference \ndividends payable. \nThe Group’s effective tax rate for next year is expected to be 22.2%. \nTax paid \nUnder HMRC’s quarterly instalments regime for corporation tax, with effect from this accounting period all four instalments become \npayable during the year (for the Group, in December, March, June and September). During 2022, the Group paid £106.0m towards \nthe overall current tax charge of £93.8m (2021: £85.3m towards a tax charge of £74.2m) and the Group also paid £nil relating to prior \nyears (2021: £8.6m paid relating to prior years). The cumulative effect is a debtor balance of £23.2m, which includes £11.0m relating \nto the prior year (2021: a debtor balance of £11.0m), shown as corporation tax receivable at the year end.  \n \n \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\b\n114\b"

      "text": "Notes to the financial statements continued  \n24. Provision for insurance claims outstanding and insurance risk management \nInsurance risk management \nThe risk under any one insurance contract is the possibility that the insured event occurs and the uncertainty of the amount of \nthe resulting claim. By the very nature of an insurance contract, this risk is defined although occurrence is random and therefore \nunpredictable. The principal risks of insurance relate to underwriting and insurance provision (reserving) risk. Underwriting risks \narise out of day-to-day activities in underwriting contracts of insurance, as well as risks associated with outward reinsurance. \nInsurance provision (reserving) risk is the possibility that actual claims payments differ from the carrying amount of the \ninsurance reserves. This could occur because the frequency or severity of claims is greater or less than estimated. \nThe Group manages this risk through a proactive approach, including: \n• regular Board and insurance steering committee meetings, at which the claims information is analysed together with any \nmaterial changes to the risk; \n• the Board recognising that it is responsible for the assessment of the total cost of risk and setting of premiums which are \ncommensurate with the exposure, revisable on a six-monthly basis based upon actuarially forecast information; \n• the purchase of reinsurance to protect against losses exceeding individual or cumulative risk tolerances; \n• insurance managers’ receipt of claims data on a monthly basis, the content of which is reviewed and any unexpected  \nmovements queried; \n• significant individual losses being notified separately and the development of claims monitored; \n• appointment of independent third-party claims handlers, selected on the basis of their ability to manage significant claims \nvolumes whilst negotiating efficient and equitable claims settlements; and \n• a system of review is in place whereby all claims in excess of £250,000 are reported separately to the Group. \nThe Directors of the Group are responsible for ensuring that the premiums charged under the insurance contracts are \ncommensurate with the estimated value of claims, operational costs and any remaining exposure presented to the Group.  \nFor all risks, the quantum of individual claims is managed by a prescribed system of proactive claims handling by the appointed \nclaims handler.  \nMotor insurance risks  \nThe Group provides 80% motor quota-share reinsurance in respect of the fleet block insurance policy. Comprehensive cover is \nprovided including motor own damage, motor third-party damage and motor third-party liability. Due to the nature of this class of \nbusiness, the frequency and severity of insured losses is difficult to predict. The Group mitigates its exposure through the purchase \nof appropriate reinsurance.  \nSources of uncertainty in the estimation of future claim payments \nClaims in respect of the motor quota-share reinsurance are payable on a loss-occurring basis. The Group is liable for all insured \nevents that occur during the term of the contract. There are several variables that affect the amount and timing of cash flows from \nthese contracts. These mainly relate to the timing of claims settlements. The estimated cost of claims includes direct expenses to \nbe incurred in settling claims, net of the expected subrogation value and other recoveries. The Group takes all reasonable steps to \nensure that it has appropriate information regarding its claims exposures. However, given the uncertainty in establishing claims \nprovisions, it is possible that the final outcome will prove to be different from the original liability established.  \nThe estimation of the incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserve is determined by utilising an actuarial assessment and is based \non historical claims experience. In estimating the liability for the cost of reported claims not yet paid, the Group considers any \ninformation available from loss adjusters and legal advisers and information on the cost of settling claims with similar \ncharacteristics in previous periods.  \nReinsurance contracts \nThe Group has limited its motor risk exposure by the purchase of reinsurance. Quota-share reinsurance has been purchased to \nprotect the Group against any individual losses exceeding the Group’s net retention of £40,000 (2021: £30,000) each and every \nclaim. Excess of loss reinsurance protects the Group and ceding insurer against individual losses exceeding £5,000,000 (2021: \n£5,000,000) each and every claim. Stop Loss reinsurance protects the Group against accumulation of losses exceeding 123.11% \n(2021: 122.16%) of the Group’s net earned premium income or £392,627,000 (2021: £357,435,000) in the aggregate, whichever is the \nlesser. Stop Loss reinsurance cover is limited to a maximum of 131.35% (2021: 132.58%) of net premium earned or £26,290,000 \n(2021: £30,500,000) in aggregate, whichever is the lesser. The Group’s exposure above these limits is unlimited. \nClaims which have not been recovered from reinsurers at the balance sheet date are included in insurance receivables in the \nbalance sheet and are deemed to be fully recoverable. The Group manages its reinsurance risk through: \n• regular Board and insurance steering committee meetings, at which the reinsurance markets are considered; \n• the Group’s policy to only select those reinsurers that have a minimum credit rating of A- or better; \n• significant individual losses being notified separately and the development of the claim being monitored; and \n• independent third-party reinsurance brokers being appointed on the basis of their ability to negotiate, recommend and place \nreinsurance with appropriate markets.  \n \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\b\n124\b"

Claims reserves are based on assumptions regarding past \nclaims experience and on assessments by an independent claims handler, and are intended to provide a best estimate of the most \nlikely or expected outcome.

The methods adopted are summarised below: \nChain Ladder method \nThe Chain Ladder method uses the development profile of paid or incurred claims on historical accident years to project the more \nrecent accident years to their ultimate position.  \nExpected Burning Cost method \nThis method takes an assumed initial expected burning cost and estimates the ultimate cost directly based on this initial \nexpectation. The initial expected burning cost has been derived based on the historical ultimate cost (from the Chain Ladder \nmethod on either paid or incurred claims as deemed appropriate) adjusted for frequency and average severity inflation \nas appropriate. \nBornhuetter-Ferguson method \nThis method takes as a starting point an assumed initial expected burning cost and blends in the burning cost implied by the \nexperience to date (based on the historical claim development pattern).  \nAverage Cost per Claim method \nThis method uses an ultimate average cost multiplied by a selected ultimate number of claims. The ultimate number of claims has \nbeen derived using the Chain Ladder method for each claims type and band. The ultimate average cost has been derived by \ncreating an average cost development triangle and then applying the Chain Ladder method.  \nThe Directors have considered the report of the Group actuary and the peer review of an independent actuary, and the pattern \nof development is believed to be sufficiently consistent period on period to provide an appropriate basis to establish \nadditional reserves.  \n \n \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\b\n125\b"

      "text": "Notes to the financial statements continued  \n25. Financial liabilities continued \nUnder the cash flow hedge accounting rules outlined in IFRS 9, to the extent the hedge remains effective, any resulting net \nvaluation difference is shown (after tax) as a hedging reserve on the balance sheet, and any movements in the hedging reserve are \nrecognised as other comprehensive income rather than through the income statement. \nWhen exchange rates or expected interest rates change, this can lead to large fluctuations in these valuations. At 30 September \n2022, the Eurobond debt liability was increased by £67.2m (30 Sep 2021: was increased by £28.8m). This movement of £38.4m is \na result of Sterling weakening against the Euro to 1.14 (2021: 1.16). The associated assets and liabilities relating to derivatives at \n30 September 2022 were a net asset of £134.2m (30 Sep 2021: net asset of £27.5m). This movement of £106.7m is a result of an \nincrease in valuation. The net valuation difference at 30 September 2022 is therefore an asset of £67.0m which, after tax at 22%, \nleads to a hedging reserve of £52.2m. \nPreference shares \nCumulative preference shares of £9,950,000 were issued on 30 June 2008 at an issue price of £1 per share.

Events after the reporting year \nBank facility refinancing \nMotability Operations’ existing bank facilities were due to expire in September 2023. The Group initiated a refinancing exercise \nduring the summer of 2022, with a view to arranging a new facility well in advance of the 2023 maturity. This transaction was \nsuccessfully completed on 31 October 2022, with a new five-year facility (£400m term loan and £1.5bn revolving credit facility), with \ntwo ‘plus one’ options, syndicated across our existing banking group. As a result of this, although at the balance sheet date these \nfacilities are classified as ‘current’, at the date of signing the financial statements these are now moving back to ‘non-current’ and \nwill be classified as such in the Half Year Report in 2023. \nThere have been no other events arising after the reporting date that require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements \nfor the year ended 30 September 2022. \n \n \n \n \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\b\n137\b"

      "text": "Notes to the financial statements continued  \n36. Funding and financial risk management \nCapital risk management \nThe capital structure of the Group and the Company consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 25, net of  \ncash and cash equivalents and equity capital. For capital risk management purposes the equity capital consists of equity share \ncapital, preference share capital and restricted reserves. The hedging reserve relating to the fair value of swaps is excluded.  \nThe Group’s debt funding is provided through the Company via bank loans and debt issuance. \nThe objective of the Group’s capital and reserves management policy is to ensure that the Group maintains adequate levels of \nequity capital and reserves to: \n• maintain the sustainability and longevity of the business through having adequate reserves to withstand the impact of potential \nmacro-economic, industry and Company-specific shock events; \n• provide relative stability of pricing and affordability to customers; and \n• provide confidence to lenders and credit rating agencies that allows the Group to raise sufficient funding at competitive rates. \nAs part of the capital and reserves management policy of the Group, any profits that arise in the Group are reinvested back into the \nScheme for the benefit of disabled customers. The banks as owners of the Group cannot access reserves (the ordinary shares do not \ncarry any entitlement to dividends). \nThe Risk Management Committee reviews the capital structure and particularly the level of restricted reserves on a regular basis. \nThe Group operates an Economic Capital methodology to determine the level of capital required in the business. The Group aims \nto hold capital at a level that is considered at least adequate to ensure that it can withstand potential market or economic \nshock events. \nThe Group’s debt financing (bank loans) is subject to a customary loan covenant whereby the adjusted Total Group Assets: Total Net \nDebt ratio is targeted to be no less than 1.25:1. At 30 September 2022 the ratio was 1.96:1, and the Group has complied with the terms \nof the covenant throughout the year. The covenant ratio is reported on a monthly basis and reviewed by the Directors to ensure \nthere is no breach of the covenant and to take appropriate action if necessary. \nFrom the perspective of the Company, capital risk management is integrated with the capital risk management of the Group and  \nis not managed separately.  \nSignificant accounting policies \nDetails of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and \nequity instrument, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are \nrecognised, are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.  \nCategories of financial instruments  \n2022\nGroup\ncarrying value\n£m\n2021 \nGroup \ncarrying value \n£m \n2022 \nCompany \ncarrying value \n£m \n2021\nCompany\ncarrying value\n£m\nNon-derivative financial assets measured at amortised cost\n \n \nFinancial assets at amortised cost\n280.6\n207.7 \n– \n–\nTrade receivables \n69.3\n71.8 \n– \n–\nLoans to other Group companies\n–\n– \n5,819.4 \n5,719.4\nCash and bank balances \n769.3\n484.8 \n640.0 \n341.1\nTotal non-derivative financial assets \n1,119.2\n764.3 \n6,459.4 \n6,060.5\nNon-derivative financial liabilities measured at amortised cost\n \n \nTrade and other payables \n(181.8)\n(154.4) \n(494.4) \n(209.6)\nFinancial liabilities \n(5,985.6)\n(5,847.2) \n(5,875.4) \n(5,746.4)\nTotal non-derivative financial liabilities \n(6,167.4)\n(6,001.6) \n(6,369.8) \n(5,956.0)\nNet non-derivative financial instruments at amortised cost\n(5,048.2)\n(5,237.3) \n89.6 \n104.5\nDerivative financial instruments measured at fair value through \nother comprehensive income \n \n \nInterest rate swaps \n3.6\n(0.3) \n3.6 \n(0.3)\nCross-currency swaps \n130.6\n27.8 \n130.6 \n27.8\nTotal derivative financial instruments \n134.2\n27.5 \n134.2 \n27.5\nTotal financial instruments \n(4,914.0)\n(5,209.8) \n223.8 \n132.0\n \n \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\b\n138\b"

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the financial \ninstruments for disclosure purposes: \n• the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates to the carrying amount due to its short-term nature; \n• the carrying values less impairment provision of trade and other receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their \nfair values due to the short-term nature of the trade receivables and payables; \n• the fair value of preference shares for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the cash flows using market data at the \nbalance sheet date; \n• the fair value of debt issued under the Euro Medium Term Note Programme for disclosure purposes is based on market data at \nthe balance sheet date; and \n• the fair value of swaps is determined by discounting future cash flows using current market data at the balance sheet date.  \nIFRS 13 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source of inputs, \ngrouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: \n• quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) \n• inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (that is, \nas prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2) \n• inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (Level 3). \nGroup \n2022 \nLevel 1\n£m\nLevel 2\n£m\nLevel 3 \n£m \nTotal\n£m\nNon-derivative financial assets\n \nFinancial assets at amortised cost\n261.6\n–\n– \n261.6\n \n261.6\n–\n– \n261.6\nNon-derivative financial liabilities \n \nFinancial liabilities \n(4,475.4)\n(10.8)\n– \n(4,486.2)\n \n(4,475.4)\n(10.8)\n– \n(4,486.2)\nDerivative financial instruments\n \nInterest rate swaps \n–\n3.6\n– \n3.6\nCross-currency swaps \n–\n130.6\n– \n130.6\n \n–\n134.2\n– \n134.2\nTotal  \n(4,213.8)\n123.4\n– \n(4,090.4)\nGroup \n2021 \nLevel 1\n£m\nLevel 2\n£m\nLevel 3 \n£m \nTotal\n£m\nNon-derivative financial assets\n \nFinancial assets at amortised cost\n207.6\n–\n– \n207.6\n \n207.6\n–\n– \n207.6\nNon-derivative financial liabilities \n \nFinancial liabilities \n(913.3)\n(4,804.6)\n– \n(5,717.9)\n \n(913.3)\n(4,804.6)\n– \n(5,717.9)\nDerivative financial instruments\n \nInterest rate swaps \n–\n(0.3)\n– \n(0.3)\nCross-currency swaps \n–\n27.8\n– \n27.8\n \n–\n27.5\n– \n27.5\nTotal \n(705.7)\n(4,777.1)\n– \n(5,482.8)\n \n \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\b\n140\b"

The nature and characteristics of the Level 2 fair valued items, i.e. issued debt, preference \nshares and swaps, are as described in note 2 and note 25. As these valuation exercises are not wholly market based they are \nconsidered to be Level 2 measurements. Financial assets held at amortised cost are investments held by MORL as described in \nnote 2. These have quoted prices and so are classified as Level 1. \nFinancial risk management objectives \nThe Group’s funding and financial risk is overseen and managed by the Treasury Operations Group and the Risk Management \nCommittee. The Group’s treasury function, operating under the control of the Risk Management Committee, monitors and manages \nthe financial risks relating to the funding and treasury operations, as well as co-ordinating access to the financial markets. The \ntreasury policy of the Group and the principles set out by the policy are endorsed by the Board and applied through delegated \nauthority by the Chief Executive Officer operating through the Executive Committee and the Risk Management Committee. The \ntreasury policy and treasury control framework are overseen by the Audit Committee.  \nThe risks of the Group arising from its funding activities include interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. \nThe Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in interest rates. The Group enters into interest rate swaps and \nissues fixed-rate bonds to mitigate the risk of movements in interest rates. The Group does not enter into or trade financial \ninstruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.  \nThe Group’s debt funding is provided through the Company via bank loans and capital markets issuance. As with the capital risk \nmanagement, the overall funding and financial risk management of the Company is integrated with the funding and financial risk \nmanagement of the Group and is not managed separately. As with the Group, the Company’s operations expose it to a variety of \nfinancial risks that include interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s exposure to these risks is disclosed \nseparately in the related sections below.  \n \n \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\b\n141\b"

Funding and financial risk management continued \nInterest rate risk management \nThe Group’s revenues arise primarily from operating lease rentals and proceeds from disposal of operating lease assets – typically \nthree years for an operating lease contract. Apart from fixed rate bonds issued under the EMTN Programme, the Group and the \nCompany’s borrowings are subject to floating interest rates. Borrowings arranged at floating rates of interest expose the Group \nand Company to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas those arranged at fixed rates of interest expose the Group and Company to \nfair value interest rate risk.  \nThe Group and the Company seek to minimise cash flow interest rate risk by entering into fixed interest rate swaps to hedge \nfloating rate borrowings. Interest rate swaps are employed to fix the interest rate profile of the borrowings and align these \nborrowings to the repayment profile of the assets. To the extent that borrowings at the balance sheet date will be used to fund new \nassets purchased during the year, the rentals will be set to reflect interest rates at the time the asset will be purchased. The Group’s \npolicy is that at least 90% of the total borrowings should be fixed in nature except where specific short-term dispensations are \npermitted (and commensurate with the overall funding policy). The Group only hedges the variable rate term borrowings; variable \nrate working capital facilities are not hedged. \nFloating rate debt substantially swapped into fixed interest rates has a carrying value as at 30 September 2022 of £399.8m (£nil \ndrawn on MO Group’s revolving credit facility, unhedged) (2021: £399.5m with £nil drawn on MO Group’s RCF, unhedged).  \nNotes issued subject to fixed interest rates have a carrying value as at 30 September 2022 of £5,437.1m (2021: £5,305.8m).  \nThe Group and the Company have one interest rate swap of £400m maturing on 28 January 2022 (2021: £400m maturing on 29 \nDecember 2021). Under the swap the Group and the Company pay a fixed rate of 0.74% (2021: 0.32%). \nForeign exchange risk \nThe Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk due to the issue of Euro-denominated fixed-rate bonds. This risk has been managed \nby the use of cross-currency swaps to fix the exchange rate on all coupon and principal cash flows from the outset of the bonds. \nIn the event of any change in foreign exchange rates, there would be no material effect on the reserves of the Group and the Company. \nInterest rate sensitivity analysis \nThe sensitivity analysis stated below is based on exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the \nbalance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance \nsheet date was outstanding for the whole year.  \nIn the event of any change in interest rates, there would be no material effect on the reserves of the Group and the Company. \nAlthough an increase in interest rates will lead to changes in interest payable on borrowings, this will be offset by a corresponding \neffect in either interest rate swaps or rental increases on new assets purchased during the year.  \nIf average interest rates had been 1% higher and all other variables were held constant, this would have resulted, over a period \nof one year, in a pre-tax profit decrease of approximately £nil as at 30 September 2022 (2021: £0.5m). 1% is used to measure the \nsensitivity of average interest rates as it is an easily scalable base unit for readers to evaluate the impact on the Group of various \nchanges in interest rates. \n \n \nMotability Operations Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2022\b\n142\b"

      "text": "Notes to the financial statements continued  \n36. Funding and financial risk management continued \nHedge effectiveness: sources of ineffectiveness \nThe Group’s hedges are assessed using the retrospective dollar offset method (on a cumulative basis). The swap valuations may \nbe subject to CVA/DVA adjustments (credit or debit value adjustments) reflecting the exposure to counterparty credit risk over the \nlife of the hedge. Potential ineffectiveness from a CVA/DVA adjustment is derived using a hypothetical derivative and the \ntransacted swap. Any deterioration of a counterparty’s credit rating may result in potential ineffectiveness and management will \nconsider the materiality of such movements on the reported fair values in the balance sheet. To mitigate exposure to financial loss \nin the event of a default by a swap counterparty the Group limits swap counterparties to approved high-quality investment grade \nbanks. Hedging counterparties are required to maintain an investment grade credit rating from at least one of Moody’s and \nStandard and Poor’s. \nCredit risk management \nCredit risk is managed using an established process encompassing credit limits, credit approvals, control of exposures and the \nmonitoring and reporting of exposures. Credit risk may arise from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and \ndeposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as from credit exposures to customers.  \nThe Group’s principal source of income is the Department for Work and Pensions, through the assigned allowances received \nby customers of the Group, and therefore the credit risk is considered to be very low. A small residual credit risk arises from \nmiscellaneous customer billings and monies due from dealers, auction houses and vehicle manufacturers. Group management \nregularly carries out credit assessments of the limits set for auction houses, manufacturers and dealers.  \nFor banks and financial institutions, only independently rated institutions with a minimum ‘A’ rating are accepted. All new proposed \ncounterparties are subject to internal credit approval and Asset & Liability Management Committee ratification prior to entering \ninto any transaction. Credit limits for non-derivative financial assets and credit reporting thresholds for derivative financial assets \nare set by the treasury function and are subject to approval by the Asset & Liability Management Committee.  \nThe Group’s credit risk policy includes limits on large exposures to mitigate any concentration risk in respect of its investments. \nCredit risk on these balances, and the interest accrued thereon, is considered to be minimal.  \nFor the year under review the following figures represent the Group’s total counterparty credit limit and the balance as at \n30 September 2022 and 2021, and the highest limit and utilisation during the year attributable to banks/financial institutions.  \n2022 \n2021 \nLimit\n£m\nUtilisation \n£m \nLimit \n£m \nUtilisation\n£m\nCounterparty credit limit as at 30 September \n2,125.0\n747.6 \n1,190.0 \n484.7\n \n2022 \n2021 \nLimit\n£m\nUtilisation \n£m \nLimit \n£m \nUtilisation\n£m\nMaximum counterparty credit limit for calendar year\n2,225.0\n1,371.2 \n1,590.0 \n993.9\nNo counterparty credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any losses from  \nnon-performance by these counterparties. \nThe carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the \nGroup’s maximum exposure to credit risk.  \nConcentration of credit risk \nFinancial assets at amortised cost \nThe Group monitors concentration of credit risk arising from financial investments by sector.
