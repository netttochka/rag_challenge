The projects acquired by the Company have been developed over a period of time \nby the prior owners of the projects. Management and the Board have developed a three pillar strategy to provide investors and \nshareholders with access to the opportunities presented in the mining industry. Arcadia listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on \nthe 22nd of November 2021.  \n- \nPillar One, Potential development and exploitation of a cash generating asset (Pillar One),  \n- \nPillar Two, Use of the potential cash resources from pillar one to explore and potentially transform the Company’s assets \n(Pillar Two) and   \n- \nPillar Three, utilise human capital of industry specific experience tied with a history of project generation to bring projects \nto results (Pillar Three)  \n \nSome of the Company’s projects are located in the neighbourhood of established mining operations and significant discoveries, \nand all the projects holds significant potential to host economic quantities of minerals that may be capable of further development \nand extraction. \n \nThe projects under investigation are as follows;  \n1. The Swanson Project – advanced tantalum project with early development potential \n2. Kum-Kum Project – prospective for nickel, copper, and platinum group elements \n3. Karibib Project – prospective for copper and gold \n4. Bitterwasser Brines Project – prospective for lithium-in-brines \n5. Bitterwasser Clays Project – prospective for lithium-in-clays \n \nDuring the financial year, the Company commenced exploration across all projects. The projects are detailed below:  \n \nSwanson Tantalum/ Lithium Project (Swanson) \nThe advanced Swanson Tantalum exploration project situated in Tantalite Valley, Namibia. The Project is held through the \nCompany’s 80% owned Namibian subsidiary Orange River Pegmatite (Pty) Ltd (ORP). The strategy with Swanson is to advance the \nproject into a potentially cash generating mining operation and forms part of Pillar One. \n \nKey highlights during the year were the rapid mobilisation of drilling contractors and two diamond drill rigs on site. Road building \noperations, drill pad preparation and the construction of water for drilling infrastructure was completed and drilling commenced.  \n \nThe program was a follow on from the initial drilling program conducted by ORP in August 2020. The intention of the program was \nto explore an additional 11 (D0, D1, D2 E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, E7, E8 & F1) of the 15 pegmatites identified at Swanson. In addition, the \ndrilling program specifically explored the opencast potential of the E5, E6, E7 and E8 pegmatites, and the up-dip underground \npotential of the F1, E4, and E5 pegmatites1.  Down-dip exploration and the mineralisation of the remaining undrilled pegmatites \nat Swanson remains to be tested. \n \n \n \n \n1 Refer announcement 01 September 2021, Drilling underway at Swanson and First Ta/Li Resource Estimate expected"

The Mineral Resource is based on \nan exploration program that includes: 283 channel / chip samples and 52 diamond boreholes on a 50m grid spacing over 10 (of \n15) outcropping open-castable shallow pegmatites located at Swanson, namely the D0, D1, D2, E2, E3, E4, E6, E7, E8 and F1. To \ndate only 15 of the more than 200 known pegmatites present over Arcadia’s three licenses have been explored. Refer below for \nfurther information on the Swanson Tantalum Project Mineral Resource.  \n \nSubsequent to the release of the updated Mineral Resource estimate, the Minister for the Department of Mines and Energy of \nNamibia granted the previously applied for Mining License, ML 223 to ORP on the 3 June 2022. The license authorises ORP to \ncommence with the necessary development work towards mining operations for Base and Rare Metals, Industrial Minerals and \nPrecious Metals over the Swanson Tantalite Project for a period of 15 years (from 19 May 2022 up to 18 May 2037). In terms of \nthe Minerals (Prospecting and Mining Act) of 1992, the mining license is renewable by application 12 months before its expiry \ndate subject to ORP showing that the mineral to which the mining license relates exists in the mining area in sufficient quantity \nthat it can be won or mined and sold. The Minister may not refuse to grant an application for the renewal of a mining licence if \nthe holder of the license complied with the terms of the mining license and the proposed programme of mining operations and \nhas expended the capital required for the purposes of which the mining license was granted. \n \nWithin this reporting period, ORP also received notice that an Environmental Clearance Certificate (ECC) to undertake the \nproposed development of a Tantalite Mine at Swanson and to commence with activities specified in ORP’s environmental \nassessment report and environmental management plan filed with the Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism of Namibia \nwas granted under reference ECC 02187.  \nThe updated Mineral Resource estimate, granting of the Mining License and Environmental permits has established Swanson \nTantalum Project in good stead for the upcoming year. \n \nKum Kum Nickel and PGE Project  \nThe Kum-Kum exploration project situated in Tantalite Valley Complex, Namibia.

      "text": "ARCADIA MINERALS LIMITED \nDIRECTORS REPORT \nArcadia Minerals Limited – Annual Report 2022 \n9 | P a g e  \n \n \nREVIEW OF OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES (continued) \n \nThe Tantalite Valley Complex (TVC) geological study involved various field sampling campaigns (94 field samples collected) \naugmented with detailed consideration of historical drill core segments (57 samples), and supporting data from historical records, \nhyperspectral mapping, and stream sediment sampling. The field samples collected with the historical core samples were \nsubjected to a suite of analytical protocols including reflected and transmitted-light optical petrography, whole-rock major and \ntrace element chemistry, precious metal assays, sulphur isotope analyses, scanning electron microscopy with associated \nspectrometry and in-situ Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) of individual sulphide grains. \nTogether, the results provided novel insights into the known mineralisation and prospectively of the TVC. \n \nThe TVC hosts two main categories of sulphides, viz primary magmatic sulphides, hosted by an orthopyroxenite, as well as \nsecondary (or hydrothermal) sulphides inside amphibolitised host rocks and typically found near shear zones (including the \nintrusion’s sheared contacts). The latter remobilized category only hosts sub-economic Cu (<0.29 wt.%) and minor Ni (<0.17 wt.%), \nwhile Pd+Pt values never exceed 0.15 ppm. Texturally, this assemblage comprises of predominantly pyrite, with later paragenetic \nrims of chalcopyrite + magnetite and ilmenite. In contrast, the primary magmatic sulphides comprise of pyrrhotite + pentlandite \n+ chalcopyrite, with the best assay results measured for a 10-15 cm long split core, with 0.28% Cu, 0.71% Ni and 1.24 ppm Pd+Pt.  \n \nImportantly, the above stated assay values and corroborating Scanning Electron Microscope analyses constitute the first records \nof PGE and Au (max. Au assay value = 0.26 ppm) in the TVC. Using metal prices at the time of the study, their presence adds \nsignificantly (~24 %) to the in-ground value of the mineral assemblage. Sulphur isotopes indicate that the magmatic sulphides \ncarry a mantle signal and no contamination by crustal sulphur. Further, various in situ and whole rock geochemical proxies enable \nthe calculation of an R factor, which represents the degree to which an immiscible sulphide melt interacted with a silicate magma \nchamber to obtain its precious metal signatures. The R factor for the TVC is estimated to be between 800 and 3000, which plots \ntowards the high end for Ni-Cu deposits, but towards the low end for world-class PGE deposits. \n \nFollowing an established relationship between Ni and total PGE, as well as these being hosted within a relatively unique \northopyroxenitic orthocumulate, this most mineralized target layer within the ultramafic units of the south-eastern TVC is \nsuspected to have been intersected by historical boreholes TV03, N01, and PW01. These intersection depths range between 150 \nand 250 m below surface and likely coincide with at a pyroxenite-troctolite contact. Further targeting of this most interesting \nhorizon should endeavour to discern the dip, strike and true thickness of the mineralized layer, whether it outcrops at surface, the \ndegree to which it has been affected by post-magmatic processes (e.g., amphibolitisation), and its lateral and vertical (i.e., within \nunit) grade variability. \n \nSuperficial insights that have implications for the metallurgical properties of the mineralisation are detailed as the results of a \npreliminary scanning electron microscopy study of the precious metal minerals. \n \nKaribib Project – Cu and Au  \nThe Karibib exploration project is situated near the mining town of Karibib, Namibia. The Project is held through the Company’s \n80% owned subsidiary (see-through 68%) Karibib Pegmatite Exploration (Pty) Ltd (Karibib).  \n \nAt the Karibib Copper-Gold Project field work confirmed mineralisation trends over the license extends over the exposed rocks of \na 20 km x 2 km metasedimentary structural feature.  Outcropping skarn-type mineralisation pointed to significant mineralisation \ndisplaying, on average, grades of 4.32 % Cu (highest 28.40% Cu), 1.49 g/t Au (highest 7.65 g/t Au), 50.50 g/t Ag (highest 453 g/t \nAg) and 0.23 % (highest 1.00% WO3). Outcropping vein-type mineralisation rock chip samples returned the following results: \n1.94% Cu (highest 5.69% Cu), 2.06 g/t Au (highest 26.30 g/t Au) and 12.68 g/t Ag (highest 30.10 g/t Ag)3.  \n \n \n \n \n3 Refer announcement 07 September 2021, High Grade Sampling Results at Karibib Copper and Gold Project"

A controlled entity is any entity over which Arcadia Minerals Limited has the \npower to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from the entity’s activities. Control will \ngenerally exist where the parent owns, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, more than half of the voting power \nof an entity. In assessing the power to govern, the existence and effect of holdings of actual and potential voting rights \nare also considered.  \n \nWhere controlled entities have entered or left the consolidated entity during the year, the financial performance of \nthose entities are included only for the period of the year that they were controlled.   \n \nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, all inter-group balances and transactions between entities in the \nconsolidated entity have been eliminated on consolidation.  Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed \nwhere necessary to ensure consistency with those adopted by the parent entity. \n \nNon-controlling interests, being the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent, are shown \nseparately within the Equity section of the statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss and other \ncomprehensive income.  The non-controlling interests in the net assets comprise their interests at the date of the \noriginal business combination and their share of changes in equity since that date. \n \n(d) \nForeign Currency Translation \nThe financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is Arcadia Minerals Limited’s functional and \npresentation currency. \n \nForeign currency transactions \nForeign currency transactions are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of \nthe transactions.  Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the \ntransaction at the financial year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies \nare recognised in profit or loss. \n \nForeign operations \nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates at the \nreporting date.  The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the \naverage exchange rates, which approximate the rates of the transactions, for the period.  All resulting foreign exchange \ndifferences are recognised in other comprehensive income through the foreign currency reserve in equity. \n \nThe foreign currency reserve is recognised in profit or loss when the foreign operation or net investment is disposed of. \n \n(e) \nOther Income  \ni.  \nInterest \nInterest revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method. This is a method of calculating \nthe amortised cost of a financial asset and allocating the interest income over the relevant period using the effective \ninterest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the \nfinancial interest to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. \n \nii. \nOther revenue \nOther revenue is recognised when it is received or when the right to receive payment is established."

Current tax liabilities (assets) \nare therefore measured at the amounts expected to be paid to (recovered from) the relevant taxation authority. \n \nDeferred income tax expense reflects movements in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances during the \nperiod as well as unused tax losses. \n \nCurrent and deferred income tax expense (income) is charged or credited directly to equity instead of the profit or loss \nwhen the tax relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity. \n \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are ascertained based on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of \nassets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets also result where \namounts have been fully expensed but future tax deductions are available.  No deferred income tax will be recognised \nfrom the initial recognition of an asset or liability, excluding a business combination, where there is no effect on \naccounting or taxable profit or loss. \n \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset \nis realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting \nperiod.  Their measurement also reflects the manner in which management expects to recover or settle the carrying \namount of the related asset or liability. \n \nDeferred tax assets relating to temporary differences and unused tax losses are recognised only to the extent that it is \nprobable that future taxable profit will be available against which the benefits of the deferred tax asset can be utilised. \n \nWhere temporary differences exist in relation to investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates, and joint ventures, \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can \nbe controlled and it is not probable that the reversal will occur in the foreseeable future. \n \nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists and it is intended that net \nsettlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur.  Deferred tax \nassets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists, the deferred tax assets and liabilities \nrelate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable \nentities where it is intended that net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and \nliability will occur in future periods in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be \nrecovered or settled. \n \n(g) \nExploration and evaluation expenditure \nAcquisition costs of exploration and evaluation of separate areas of interest for which rights of tenure are current are \ncarried forward as an asset in the statement of financial position where it is expected that the expenditure will be \nrecovered through the successful development and exploitation of an area of interest, or by its sale; or exploration \nactivities are continuing in an area and activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable estimate of the \nexistence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves. Where a project or an area of interest has been \nabandoned, the expenditure incurred thereon is written off in the year in which the decision is made.  \n \nExploration and evaluation expenditure on each separate areas of interest, subsequent to its acquisition, are expensed \nto profit of loss."

For the purpose of the statement of \ncash flows, cash includes cash on hand and in bank, and bank securities readily convertible to cash, net of outstanding \nbank overdrafts. \n \n(i) \nTrade and Other Receivables \nTrade and other receivables include amounts due from customers for goods sold and services performed in the ordinary \ncourse of business. Receivables expected to be collected within 12 months of the end of the reporting period are \nclassified as current assets. All other receivables are classified as non-current assets. The consolidated entity has applied \nthe simplified approach to measuring the expected credit losses, which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance. To \nmeasure expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped on days overdue. Other receivables are \nrecognised at amortised cost, less any allowance for expected credit losses.  \n \n(j) \nImpairment of Assets \nAssets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets \nthat are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate \nthat the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's \ncarrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs \nto sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which \nthere are separately identifiable cash flows. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of \nthe asset, other than goodwill, is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent \nthe increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no \nimpairment loss been recognised in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or \nloss.  \n \n(k) \nTrade and Other Payables \nLiabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for goods and services received whether or not billed to \nthe consolidated entity.  Trade payables are usually settled within 30 days of recognition. \n \n(l) \nEmployee Benefits \ni. \nShort-term employee benefits \nLiabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and long service leave expected to be \nsettled within 12 months of the reporting date are recognised in current liabilities in respect of employees' services up \nto the reporting date and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. \n \nii. \nOther long-term employee benefits \nThe liability for annual leave and long service leave not expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date \nare recognised in non-current liabilities, provided there is an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability. The \nliability is measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by \nemployees up to the reporting date using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to the expected \nfuture wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments \nare discounted using market yields at the reporting date on national government bonds with terms to maturity and \ncurrency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows."

Equity-settled transactions are awards of shares, or options over shares, that are provided to employees in \nexchange for the rendering of services. Cash-settled transactions are awards of cash for the exchange of services, where \nthe amount of cash is determined by reference to the share price. \n \nThe cost of equity-settled transactions are measured at fair value on grant date. Fair value is independently determined \nusing an appropriate valuation model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of \ndilution, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield \nand the risk free interest rate for the term of the option, together with non-vesting conditions that do not determine \nwhether the consolidated entity receives the services that entitle the employees to receive payment. No account is \ntaken of any other vesting conditions. \n \nThe cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity over the \nvesting period. The cumulative charge to profit or loss is calculated based on the grant date fair value of the award, the \nbest estimate of the number of awards that are likely to vest and the expired portion of the vesting period. The amount \nrecognised in profit or loss for the period is the cumulative amount calculated at each reporting date less amounts \nalready recognised in previous periods. \n \nThe cost of cash-settled transactions is initially, and at each reporting date until vested, determined by applying an \nappropriate valuation model, taking into consideration the terms and conditions on which the award was granted. The \ncumulative charge to profit or loss until settlement of the liability is calculated as follows: \n• \nDuring the vesting period, the liability at each reporting date is the fair value of the award at that date \nmultiplied by the expired portion of the vesting period. \n• \nFrom the end of the vesting period until settlement of the award, the liability is the full fair value of the liability \nat the reporting date. \n \nAll changes in the liability are recognised in profit or loss. The ultimate cost of cash-settled transactions is the cash paid \nto settle the liability. \n \nMarket conditions are taken into consideration in determining fair value. Therefore, any awards subject to market \nconditions are considered to vest irrespective of whether or not that market condition has been met, provided all other \nconditions are satisfied. \n \nIf equity-settled awards are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the modification has not been made. \nAn additional expense is recognised, over the remaining vesting period, for any modification that increases the total \nfair value of the share-based compensation benefit as at the date of modification. \n \nIf the non-vesting condition is within the control of the consolidated entity or employee, the failure to satisfy the \ncondition is treated as a cancellation. If the condition is not within the control of the consolidated entity or employee \nand is not satisfied during the vesting period, any remaining expense for the award is recognised over the remaining \nvesting period, unless the award is forfeited. \n \nIf equity-settled awards are cancelled, it is treated as if it has vested on the date of cancellation, and any remaining \nexpense is recognised immediately. If a new replacement award is substituted for the cancelled award, the cancelled \nand new award is treated as if they were a modification."

Under the equity method, the share of the profits \nor losses of the associate is recognised in profit or loss and the share of the movements in equity is recognised in other \ncomprehensive income. Investments in associates are carried in the statement of financial position at cost plus post-\nacquisition changes in the consolidated entity's share of net assets of the associate. Goodwill relating to the associate \nis included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment. \nDividends received or receivable from associates reduce the carrying amount of the investment. \n \nWhen the consolidated entity's share of losses in an associate equal or exceeds its interest in the associate, including \nany unsecured long-term receivables, the consolidated entity does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred \nobligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. \n  \nThe consolidated entity discontinues the use of the equity method upon the loss of significant influence over the \nassociate and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the associate's carrying \namount, fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss."

The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of the financial \nmarkets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. The Group uses different \nmethods to measure and manage different types of risks to which it is exposed. These include monitoring levels of exposure to \ninterest rate and foreign exchange risk and assessments of market forecasts for interest rate and foreign exchange prices. Ageing \nanalysis and monitoring of specific credit allowances are undertaken to manage credit risk. Liquidity risk is monitored through \nthe development of future cash flow forecasts. \n \nRisk management is carried out by Management and overseen by the Board of Directors with assistance from suitably qualified \nexternal advisors. The main risks arising for the Group are foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. \nThe Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. \n \nThe carrying values of the Group’s financial instruments are as follows: \nFinancial Assets \n  \n \n  \nTrade and other receivables \n \n75,791 \n40,398 \nCash and cash equivalents \n \n2,840,406 \n6,165,049 \n \n \n2,916,197 \n6,205,447 \n \n \n \n \nFinancial Liabilities \n \n \n \nTrade and other payables \n \n(107,422) \n(633,780) \n \n(a) \nMarket risk \ni. \nForeign exchange risk \nThe currency risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to change in foreign exchange rates. Currency \nrisk arises when future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not \nthe Group’s functional currency. The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures primarily \nwith respect to the Australian Dollar (AUD), the Group’s functional currency. The Group’s policy is not to enter into any currency \nhedging transactions."

The Group’s exposure to this risk relates primarily to the \nGroup’s cash and any cash on deposit.  The Group does not use derivatives to mitigate these exposures. The Group manages its \nexposure to interest rate risk by holding certain amounts of cash in fixed and floating interest rate facilities.  At the reporting \ndate, the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments was: \n \n \n  \nWeighted average \ninterest rate * \nBalance \nCash and cash equivalents \n \n0.31% \n$2,840,406 \n \nMovements in the changes to interest rates will not have material effect on the profit or loss of the Group. \n \n(b) \nCredit risk \nCredit risk arises from the financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables \nand other financial assets. The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from potential default of the counterparty, with maximum \nexposure equal to the carrying amount of the financial assets. \n \nThe Group’s policy is to trade only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy that all customers who \nwish to trade on credit terms will be subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on \nan ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. There are no significant concentrations \nof credit risk within the Group. \n \n(c) \nLiquidity risk \nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.  The Group’s approach to \nmanaging liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, \nunder both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to its reputation. \n \nThe Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves from funds raised in the market and by continuously \nmonitoring forecast and actual cash flows.  The Group does not have any external borrowings. \n \nThe following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities: \n \n \n6 months \n6-12 months \n1-5 years \n> 5 years \nTotal \n \n$ \n$ \n$ \n$ \n$ \n2021 \n \n \n \n \n \nTrade and other payables \n633,780 \n- \n- \n- \n633,780 \n2022 \n \n \n \n \n \nTrade and other payables \n107,422 \n- \n- \n- \n107,422 \n \n(d) \nCapital risk management \nThe Group’s objectives when managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue \nto provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce \nthe cost of capital. \n \nCapital is regarded as total equity, as recognised in the statement of financial position, plus net debt. Net debt is calculated as \ntotal borrowings less cash and cash equivalents."

We also: \n  \n• \nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, \ndesign and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient \nand appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting \nfrom fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional \nomissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  \n \n• \nObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are \nappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the \nGroup’s internal control. \n \n• \nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates \nand related disclosures made by the directors.  \n \n• \nConclude on the appropriateness of the director’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based \non the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may \ncast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material \nuncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the \nfinancial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on \nthe audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may \ncause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. \n \n• \nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and \nwhether the financial report represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair \npresentation.  \n \n• \nObtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business \nactivities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report.

Under the Company’s Board Charter, the duties that would ordinarily be assigned to individual committees \nare currently carried out by the full Board under the written terms of reference for those committees. \nThe information in the statement is current at 28 September 2022 and was approved by a resolution of the Board on the 28 \nSeptember 2022. \nCorporate governance policies and procedures \nThe Company has adopted the following suite of corporate governance policies and procedures (together, the Corporate \nGovernance Plan): \nCorporate Governance  \n• \nStatement of Values  \n• \nBoard Charter \n• \nCorporate Code of Conduct  \n• \nAudit and Risk Committee Charter \n• \nRemuneration Committee Charter \n• \nNomination Committee Charter \n• \nPerformance Evaluation Policy \n• \nContinuous Disclosure Policy \n• \nRisk Management Policy  \n• \nTrading Policy \n• \nDiversity Policy  \n• \nWhistleblower Policy Protection Policy  \no \nSummary of protections under the Corporations Act  \no \nSummary of protections under the Taxation Administration Act  \no \nDesignated Disclosure Officers \n• \nAnti-Bribery and Corruption Policy \n• \nShareholder Communication Strategy  \n• \nAnnexure A – Definition of independence  \nThe Company’s Corporate Governance Plan is available on the Company’s website at https://arcadiaminerals.global/"

The Board has not \nset measurable objectives for achieving gender diversity.   \nGiven the Company’s stage of development and the number of \nemployees, the Board considers it is not practical to set measurable \nobjectives for achieving gender diversity at this time.  \nThe respective proportions of men and women on the Board, in \nsenior executive positions and across the whole organisations are set \nout in the following table.  Senior executives for these purposes \nmeans those person who report directly to the chief executive officer \n(or equivalent):"
