His leadership of our \nscience, entrepreneurial skills, ability to \nidentify and recruit great people and sheer \nhard work have underpinned our return to \ngrowth and achievements of the past decade. \nIt has been a privilege to work with him and it \nwas only fitting that his contribution to UK life \nsciences and leadership in the global \nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic was \nrecognised with the award of a knighthood. \nI look forward to seeing AstraZeneca continue \nto thrive and grow under his leadership.\nLeif Johansson\nChair\nApril 2022 marked my tenth anniversary as a \nDirector of AstraZeneca and I have served as \nChair since June 2012.

This was followed \nby its swift approval in the US as the first ever \nHER2-directed therapy in this indication and \nrepresents a major advance for patients with \nHER2-low metastatic breast cancer. \nOur commitment to science was further \ndemonstrated during the year by our \nannouncement in April of plans for a new \nstrategic R&D centre and Alexion \nheadquarters in Kendall Square, Cambridge, \nMA, US. This move will bring together \ncolleagues from across AstraZeneca and \nAlexion in a world-leading life sciences hub.\nOf course, pushing boundaries sometimes \nmeans setbacks and we had some life-cycle \nmanagement trials during the year that did not \nmeet their primary objectives. However, 2022 \nwas predominantly a year of scientific \nsuccess, including the approval of three new \nmedicines: Imjudo for liver cancer and \nnon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); Beyfortus \nfor the prevention of RSV, respiratory syncytial \nvirus in infants; and Airsupra for asthma. We \nare also initiating new late-stage trials for \nhigh-potential medicines such as \ncamizestrant, datopotamab deruxtecan \nand volrustomig.\nOur R&D success and revenue increase in \n2022 demonstrate that we are on track to \ndeliver industry-leading revenue growth \nthrough 2025 and beyond, and have set \nAstraZeneca on a path to deliver at least 15 \nnew medicines before the end of the decade.\n2022 was a year of continued strong \nperformance and execution of our long-term \ngrowth strategy. Total Revenue increased \nby 19% (25% at CER) to $44.4 billion, with \n$7.1 billion coming from our Rare Disease \nportfolio that was incorporated into the \nGroup’s results from 21 July 2021. \nIn our therapy areas, Total Revenue for \nOncology increased by 15% (20% at CER); \nCardiovascular, Renal & Metabolism by 13% \n(19% at CER); Respiratory & Immunology fell \nby 1% but rose 3% at CER; and Rare Disease \nrose by 4% (10% at CER).\nIn the US, Total Revenue was up 47% in 2022 \nand in Europe it grew by 9% (21% at CER). \nWhile Total Revenue in Emerging Markets fell \nby 4% (growth of 1% at CER), largely the \nresult of the anticipated decline in growth in \nChina, it grew in Established Rest of World \nduring the year by 22% (40% at CER).\nPioneers in science\nOur success is built on relentlessly pushing \nthe boundaries of science to deliver life-\nchanging medicines. In that regard, we made \nexcellent progress in 2022 with a remarkable \n72 regulatory events, either submissions or \napprovals for our medicines in major markets, \nand 29 pipeline progression events.\nDuring the year, our pioneering science was \nevident across all therapy areas. For example, \nin BioPharmaceuticals, the DELIVER Phase III \ntrial established Forxiga as the first heart \nfailure (HF) medicine to demonstrate mortality \nbenefit across the full ejection fraction range. \nThis represents a population of patients, \nmany of whom had previously had no \ntreatment options.\nBuilding on Alexion’s 30-year history in Rare \nDisease, in 2022 we announced the positive \nhigh-level results of the ALPHA Phase III trial \nof danicopan, an investigational oral Factor D \ninhibitor, as an add-on to Ultomiris or Soliris \nThe success of \nAstraZeneca is built \non being true to our \nPurpose and living our \nValues to deliver for \npeople, society and \nthe planet.\n7\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nCorporate Governance\nAdditional Information\nFinancial Statements\nStrategic Report\nChief Executive Officer’s Review\nChief Executive\nOfficer’s Review"

      "text": "Patients\nAs well as requiring us to follow the science, \nAstraZeneca’s Values put patients first. In this \nregard, our industry-leading growth means \nmore patients around the world are benefiting \nfrom our medicines and our continued \ncommitment to innovate for patients and \nimprove health outcomes – including the use \nof data, digital technologies and AI.\nI am particularly proud of what we were able \nto achieve for patients in Japan in 2022, with a \nrecord-breaking five approvals for our cancer \ntreatments in one day, and a remarkable total \nof 12 medicine approvals for the year. Also in \n2022, cancer patients around the world \nbenefited, not only from Enhertu and Imjudo, \nbut also from Imfinzi and Lynparza which, \ntaken together, saw eight new indication \nlaunches and 21 major market approvals.\nFollowing last year’s acquisition of Alexion, \nby combining resources, we have been able \nto bring treatments for rare diseases to \npatients in 10 more countries around the \nworld, including the availability of Alexion’s \nfirst medicine in China, Soliris.\nWe have also remained at the frontline in the \nfight against COVID-19, with independent \nanalysis showing that our vaccine, Vaxzevria, \nsaved more than six million lives in its first \nyear. Our long-acting antibody combination, \nEvusheld, continues to play an important role \nhelping to protect those most vulnerable to \nCOVID-19. However, as the COVID-19 virus \ncontinues to evolve, so too must our \nresponse, and we have commenced a \nlate-stage trial for our next-generation \nCOVID-19 long-acting antibody.\nWe were honoured when TIME magazine \nannounced that Evusheld had been named \non its annual list of the Best Inventions, which \nfeatures 200 extraordinary innovations \nchanging our lives. Additionally, our top-three \nranking in the 2022 Access to Medicine Index \nis external recognition of our focus on \nincreasing equitable and affordable access \nto our life-changing treatments.\nAstraZeneca’s role in society\nIn addition to helping patients and in line with \nour value of doing the right thing, we work to \ncreate healthier societies, collaborating with \npartners to tackle major health challenges.\nWe are working to identify barriers and give \nmore people equitable access to healthcare. \nFor example, our Healthy Heart Africa \nprogramme is committed to reducing \nhypertension and the burden of \ncardiovascular disease. We work with \npartners to raise awareness and offer training, \nscreening and reduced cost treatment, \nwhere applicable. By the end of 2022, the \nprogramme had launched in nine countries \nand conducted more than 32 million \nscreenings for high blood pressure since \nlaunch, with plans for further expansion. \nOur Young Health Programme, which helps \nyoung people make informed choices about \ntheir health, provides a further example. So \nfar, we have reached more than nine million \nyoung people with health information in \n39 countries.\nGiven the multiple challenges facing the \nworld today, we continue to do all we can to \nensure healthcare systems are more resilient, \neffective and sustainable. We used the \nopportunities provided by a pandemic-\ndelayed EXPO 2020 in Dubai to collaborate \nacross the health, private and academic \nsectors to launch multiple initiatives in \nsupport of our science, therapy areas and \na sustainable healthcare network across \nthe Middle East and Africa.\nOur Partnership for Health System \nSustainability and Resilience is a collaboration \nwith the London School of Economics and the \nWorld Economic Forum (WEF) and continues \nits work to strengthen global health systems. \nIt is now active in more than 30 countries. \nAt the WEF annual meeting in January 2023, \nour Chair, Leif Johansson, led AstraZeneca’s \nadvocacy for the continued prioritisation of \nhealth as the foundation for strong societies \nand economies, as well as the need to \nencourage a fundamental re-evaluation \nof health as a long-term investment for \nthe future.\nLooking after the planet\nWe continue to make important progress with \nour own science-led Ambition Zero Carbon \nstrategy. By the end of December 2022, we \nhad achieved a 59% reduction in our Scope 1 \nand 2 greenhouse gas emissions compared \nto our 2015 baseline. Our efforts include a \npartnership with Honeywell to develop a \nnext-generation respiratory inhaler which will \nhave a near-zero global warming potential.\nWe are also playing a leading role in \naccelerating change across the health sector, \nincluding through the Sustainable Markets \nInitiative (SMI) which was launched by \nHM King Charles III in 2021. Ahead of COP27 \nin 2022, the SMI Health Systems Task Force, \nwhich I am honoured to champion, \nannounced shared commitments and actions \nto reduce emissions in line with the pathway \nto limit global warming to 1.5°C and deliver \nthe transition to net-zero health systems.\nMy thanks to all AstraZeneca colleagues\nIn January 2023, after almost 25 years \nwith AstraZeneca, Katarina Ageborg, our \nExecutive Vice-President Global Sustainability, \nChief Compliance Officer and President, \nAstraZeneca AB in Sweden, retired.

Findings \nhighlighted the high disease burden on \npatients and healthcare systems and the \nurgent need to improve early screening, \ndiagnosis and treatment.\nHyperkalaemia (HK) remains a key risk \nfor people living with CKD. As the K+ binder \nmarket grows globally, CVRM is well \npositioned with Lokelma as the leading \nglobal branded novel K+ binder with \nquarter-over-quarter growth. \nIn September, NLRP3 advanced into Phase I \nfor the treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI), \nwhich each year affects approximately 13 million \npeople, resulting in two million deaths.\nHeart failure\nOur aim is to eliminate HF as first cause of \nhospitalisation and to cure HF with reduced \nejection fraction. DELIVER Phase III trial \nresults, published in August 2022, showed \nthat Forxiga significantly reduced the risk of \nCV death or worsening of HF in patients \nregardless of ejection fraction. Importantly, in \nthe pooled analysis of the DAPA-HF and \nDELIVER Phase III clinical trials, Forxiga \ndemonstrated a reduction in CV death, \nmaking Forxiga the first HF treatment to \ndemonstrate mortality benefit across the full \nejection fraction range. These findings were \nsimultaneously published in 11 top-tier articles \nin peer-reviewed journals including \nNew England Journal of Medicine, Nature \nMedicine and The Lancet. In November, an \nadditional data analysis of DELIVER showed \nForxiga improved symptom burden and \nhealth-related quality of life in patients with \nmildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. \nIn an encouraging example of our early CVRM \nR&D pipeline, a preclinical study published in \nMay 2022 in Nature Cell Biology showed \nhuman ventricular progenitor cells promote \nthe formation of new heart tissue following a \nheart attack with improved cardiac function \nand reduced scar tissue in a laboratory \nsetting.

In July, the first patient was \ndosed in the Phase IIb/III PROXYMO-\nADVANCE for cotadutide in non-cirrhotic \nNASH. Our precision medicine portfolio in \nNASH also advanced with the start of the \nPhase I trial for our investigational antisense \noligonucleotide (ASO) AZD7503 17bHSD. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, a Phase I MAD \nstudy on ASO precision medicine AZD2693, \ncompleted in NASH patients homozygous for \nthe PNPLA3 I148M risk allele, a gene linked to \na significant proportion of NASH cases globally.\nTransthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR)\nATTR cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) and \npolyneuropathy are progressive, systemic \ndiseases caused by aging or genetic \nmutations that result in tissue damage leading \nto poor quality of life, which can be fatal \nwithout treatment. In June, eplontersen met \nco-primary and secondary endpoints in the \ninterim analysis of the NEURO-TTRansform \nPhase III trial for hereditary transthyretin-\nmediated amyloid polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN). \n  \u0007See Rare Disease on page 30.\nFactor Xa-related bleeds\nAndexxa is the first approved reversal agent for \nFactor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban or apixaban, \nproviding a major advance in the treatment of \npatients hospitalised with life-threatening \nbleeding.

Under a sub-licence agreement \nwith AstraZeneca, the vaccine is manufactured \nand supplied by the Serum Institute of India \nunder the name Covishield.\nVaxzevria has been granted marketing or \nemergency-use authorisation as both a \nprimary vaccine schedule and as a booster \nin multiple countries worldwide. In May 2022, \nthe EU granted conditional marketing approval \nfor the use of Vaxzevria as a third-dose \nbooster in adults in both homologous (same \nvaccine) or heterologous (mixed vaccine) \nsettings. In November 2022, Vaxzevria was \ngranted full marketing approval in the EU as \nboth a primary vaccination series and a \nthird-dose booster.\nTo date, AstraZeneca and our global partners \nhave released over 3.1 billion doses for supply \nto over 180 countries. Approximately two \nthirds of these doses went to low- and middle-\nincome countries, and more than 580 million \ndoses have been delivered to 130 countries \nthrough the COVAX Facility. In July 2022, \nAirfinity reported that Vaxzevria is estimated \nto have helped save more than six million lives \nin its first year of use. \nThe majority of vaccine product sales and \ndoses delivered related to pandemic contracts. \nAstraZeneca will continue to supply the \nvaccine around the world as needed, in line \nwith our agreement with the University of Oxford. \nEvusheld\nEvusheld is a long-acting antibody (LAAB) \ncombination for the pre-exposure prophylaxis \n(prevention) and treatment of COVID-19. \nEvusheld is approved and being supplied in \nabout 50 countries around the world. \nEvusheld is intended to protect those most \nvulnerable to COVID-19, including those who \nmay not be well protected against the virus \nfrom vaccination, such as the \nimmunocompromised, and those at high risk \nfor severe COVID-19 hospitalisation and death \nif they get infected.\nIn February 2022, AstraZeneca finalised an \nagreement with the US Department of Health \nand Human Services for them to purchase an \nadditional one million units of Evusheld. \nIn March 2022, Evusheld was approved for \npre-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) of \nCOVID-19 in the EU in a broad population of \nadults and adolescents aged 12 years and \nolder weighing at least 40kg.

We are continuing that legacy \nof leadership across multiple geographies \nand disease areas.\nUltomiris is now the established standard of \ncare in the US, Germany and Japan for both \nPNH and aHUS, two chronic and potentially \nlife-threatening diseases that can lead to \nserious health complications, including organ \ndamage. We are working with healthcare \nsystems around the world to enable access \nin additional countries.\nApproval of subcutaneous administration of \nUltomiris in the US for the treatment of adults \nwith PNH or aHUS will give patients a choice \nfor how they receive their treatment \n(submission under review in the EU).\nThe US, EU and Japan have approved \nUltomiris for the treatment of adults with gMG, \na progressive autoimmune neuromuscular \ndisease. We have also seen increased use of \nSoliris by patients with gMG and NMOSD, an \nautoimmune disorder of the central nervous \nsystem that affects the optic nerve and \nspinal cord.\nFull results from the Phase III CHAMPION- \nNMOSD trial demonstrated that Ultomiris \nachieved a statistically significant and \nclinically meaningful reduction in the risk \nof relapse in adults with anti-aquaporin-4 \nantibody-positive (AQP4 Ab+) NMOSD \ncompared with the external placebo arm. \nUltomiris met the primary endpoint of time to \nfirst on-trial relapse as confirmed by an \nindependent adjudication committee (zero \nadjudicated relapses were observed over a \nmedian treatment duration of 73 weeks). \nResults demonstrated Ultomiris reduced the \nrisk of relapse in AQP4 Ab+ NMOSD by 98.6% \ncompared with placebo.\nAdditional clinical trials of Ultomiris are \nongoing in a number of disease areas where \nthe complement pathway is thought to play a \nrole, including a Phase III trial in haematopoietic \nstem cell transplant-associated thrombotic \nmicroangiopathy and Phase II clinical trial \nin dermatomyositis.\nWe discontinued the Phase III trial of Soliris in \nJapanese adults with Guillain-Barré syndrome \n(GBS) due to lack of efficacy in that disease. \nWe discontinued our Phase III trial of Ultomiris \nin complement-mediated thrombotic \nmicroangiopathy as a result of a strategic \nportfolio prioritisation exercise.\nConsistent with our efforts to expand the \navailability and use of our existing medicines \ninto new geographies and diseases, we \nhave filed for approval of Ultomiris in nearly \n60 countries globally.\nBeyond Ultomiris\nWe are advancing a broad development \nportfolio across research platforms to inhibit \ncertain complement system targets, including \nC5, Factor D, and Factor P, which enables us \nto pursue a range of indications. \nC5 inhibition\nWe are exploring the ability to treat earlier-line \ngMG patients with gefurulimab (ALXN1720), \nan internally discovered potential third-\ngeneration C5 inhibitor that is being evaluated \nin a Phase III trial.\nFactor D\nFactor D is a component of the complement \nalternative pathway and plays a critical role in \nmultiple complement-mediated rare diseases. \nTargeting Factor D can potentially address a \nwide range of therapeutic areas of interest, \nincluding haematology, nephrology and \nophthalmology. \nIn September 2022, we announced positive \nhigh-level results from our Phase III trial \nevaluating danicopan (ALXN2040), an \ninvestigational, oral, Factor D inhibitor, as \nadd-on therapy to Ultomiris or Soliris. The \nALPHA Phase III trial for patients with PNH \nwho experience clinically significant \nextravascular haemolysis met the primary \nendpoint, demonstrating a statistically \nsignificant improvement compared with \nplacebo in haemoglobin levels from baseline \nto week 12. \nA Phase II trial of danicopan in geographic \natrophy, a chronic and progressive eye \ndisease, is ongoing. \nWe advanced two Phase II trials of \nvemircopan (ALXN2050) as a monotherapy \nin PNH, gMG and two rare renal diseases: \nproliferative lupus nephritis and \nimmunoglobulin A nephropathy.\nWe initiated a Phase I trial of ALXN2080, \npotentially our third-generation Factor D \ninhibitor.\nFactor P\nProperdin, or Factor P, is an important regulator \nof complement alternative pathway activation \nand amplification.

Significant \npricing pressure is driven by payer \nconsolidation, restrictive reimbursement \npolicies and cost control tools, such as \nexclusionary formularies and price protection \nclauses. Many formularies employ ‘generic \nfirst’ strategies and/or require physicians to \nobtain prior approval for the use of a branded \nmedicine where a generic alternative exists. \nWe continued to launch new medicines and \nsaw sustained performance of innovative \nmedicines. \nBioPharmaceutical Total Revenue declined by \n7% (grew 4% at CER).

We work with \nlocal and global partners to raise awareness \nand offer training, screening and reduced cost \ntreatment, where applicable. By the end of \n2022, the programme had conducted over \n32 million blood pressure screenings and \ntrained over 10,600 healthcare workers since \nlaunch in 2014. In 2022, the programme \nexpanded to Nigeria and Zanzibar and was \nidentified as a Best Practice in the 2022 \nAccess to Medicine Index. At the end of 2022, \nit was agreed to expand to 10 new countries, \nstarting in 2023.\nYoung Health Programme\nSince 2010, the AstraZeneca Young Health \nProgramme has helped young people aged \n10 to 24 to make informed choices about \ntheir health, to counter the prevalence of \nnon-communicable diseases, as well as \nmental health conditions. In collaboration \nwith UNICEF and Plan International, we \nsupport research, advocacy, education and \ndevelopment of young people. By the end of \n2022, the programme had reached 9.1 million \nyoung people with health information and \ntrained 260,191 peer educators in 39 countries \nsince its launch.\nCommunity investment\nWe aim to make a positive impact on people \nin all the communities where we are present. \nOur Global Standard on External Funding \nincludes community investment and provides \nguidance to ensure a consistent, transparent, \nand ethical approach around the world, based \non local needs. Our activities are focused on \nsupporting programmes to advance patient \nhealth, increase access to care, drive scientific \ninnovation and build resilience, and include \nfinancial and non-financial contributions. \nIn 2022, we provided $108 million to more \nthan 1,000 non-profit organisations across \n64 countries.

As technologies \nand healthcare systems evolve, so should \nsolutions to reduce energy, water, material use, \nwaste and pollution generated from designing, \nmanufacturing and delivering medicines to \npatients. We follow a life-cycle approach that \ncovers all stages of our products and our \ninternal Product Sustainability Index ensures \nwe understand their environmental impacts \nand prioritise improvement opportunities.\nA key product-related element of our Ambition \nZero Carbon strategy is our commitment to \ndeveloping a next-generation pressurised \nmetered-dose inhaler (pMDI) using the propellant \nHFO-1234ze, which has a near-zero global \nwarming potential, in partnership with Honeywell. \nThis is a significant innovation given the clinical \nneed for pMDIs. In 2022, project milestones \nachieved included the Phase III investment \ndecision, initiation of pivotal studies, first delivery \nof commercial-grade propellant from Honeywell \nand positive regulatory interactions globally.\nAs part of our commitment to drive thought \nleadership and innovation to manage \nPharmaceuticals in the Environment, we lead the \nInnovative Medicines Initiative PREMIER project, \na public-private partnership between the \nEuropean Commission and EFPIA. One aim is to \ndevelop tools to identify potential environmental \nrisks of APIs earlier in drug development and \nmake these tools and data more visible and \naccessible to all stakeholders. We also lead our \nindustry with respect to reporting API emissions \nfrom manufacturing and through our \nEcoPharmacoVigilance (EPV) programme.\nNatural resources\nThe conservation and sustainable use of natural \nresources, along with the protection and \nrestoration of ecosystems, is vital to shape a \nhealthy future and tackle the environmental \ndrivers of disease. We are committed to \nreducing our impact on the planet through the \nefficient, circular use of natural resources \nacross the value chain. This includes \nresponsible sourcing, consumption, production, \nand disposal. We also invest in nature and aim \nto protect biodiversity to improve both \nenvironmental and societal health.\nCircular economy\n‘Circularity’ is a key tool for conserving natural \nresources, designing out waste and pollution, \nkeeping products and materials in use (for \nexample by designing for durability and \nrecycling) and avoiding non-renewable \nresources. In 2022, we implemented projects to \nenable circular use of natural resources within \nour sites in Sweden. At our operations site in \nSödertälje, recycling condensate and rejected \npurified water will deliver savings of 150,000m³ \nof water annually. Our R&D site in Gothenburg \nis recovering and reusing over 95% of liquid \nhelium, an increasingly scarce natural resource.\nWater stewardship\nIn 2022, we increased the ambition of our 2025 \nwater efficiency target, now aiming to reduce \nwater use by 20% from 2015 baseline levels, \nin support of water security and resilience. \nMoving beyond efficiency, we are working in \npartnership with our stakeholders, including \nthe World Wide Fund for Nature Sweden, to \nfurther adopt water stewardship practices in \nalignment with the Alliance for Water \nStewardship Standard and to set long-term \ncontextual targets at high-risk sites by 2025.\nAZ Forest\nWe have AZ Forest activities in Australia, \nIndonesia, and the UK, in addition to two \nnew projects announced in 2022:\n\t\n> \tIn Ghana, we committed to planting and \nmaintaining over three million trees to \nsupport natural forest restoration and \ncommunity-led agroforestry. \n\t> \tIn the US, we committed to planting and \nmaintaining one million trees, contributing to \nthe restoration of water quality and wildlife \nhabitats in the Delaware River Watershed. \nSince 2020, AZ Forest has planted more than \n10.5 million trees.\nSustainability continued \nBV\nEnvironmental protection  BV\nWe recognise the connection between healthy \npeople and a healthy planet. A significant \nimpact of climate change is increasing levels \nof ill health, including a rise in chronic \nconditions such as heart disease, stroke, lung \ncancer and respiratory disease. We are using \na science-led approach to lower the economic \nand environmental burden of healthcare, while \nimproving health outcomes. We are proactively \nmanaging our environmental impact across all \nactivities, limiting our use of finite resources, \nand investing in nature and biodiversity. \nThrough our Natural Resource Efficiency \nFund, we have invested approximately \n$150 million in environmental efficiency \ninnovations since 2015. This, together with \nother central capital investments, has seen a \nfurther $26.6 million spent in 2022, including \n31 new projects. \nAchievements in 2022\n\t\n> \t59.3% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG \nemissions since 2015\n\t\n> \t14.4% reduction in energy consumption \nsince 2015\n\t\n> \tMore than 10.5 million trees planted by \nAZ Forest since 2020\n\t\n> \t18.7% reduction in water usage and \n18.6% reduction in our waste since 2015\n\t\n> \t100% safe API discharges for AstraZeneca \nsites and 92% safe API discharges for \nglobally managed first-tier supplier sites\n\t\n> \t97.5% of paper-based product packaging \nmaterials used were supplied from \nsustainable sources in 2021, achieving the \n2022 target.\nAmbition Zero Carbon\nApproximately 5% of global GHG emissions \ncome from the healthcare sector, from mineral \nextraction and processing through to use of \nmedicines and their disposal.

      "text": "Managing risk \nOur approach to risk management is designed \nto encourage clear decision making on which \nrisks we take and how we manage these risks. \nWe strive to embed sound risk management \nin our strategy, planning, budgeting and \nperformance management processes. The \nBoard defines the Group’s risk appetite. This \nenables the Group, in both quantitative and \nqualitative terms, to judge the level of risk it \nis prepared to take in achieving its overall \nobjectives. The Board expresses the \nacceptable levels of risk for the Group using \nthree key dimensions. These are: (i) earnings \nand cash flow, (ii) return on investment and \n(iii) ethics and reputation. Annually, the Group \ndevelops a detailed three-year bottom-up \nbusiness plan and 10-year long-range \nprojection to support the delivery of its \nstrategy. The Board considers these in the \ncontext of the Group’s risk appetite. \nAdjustments are made to the plan or risk \nappetite to ensure they remain aligned.\nThe SET is required by the Board to oversee \nand monitor the effectiveness of the risk \nmanagement processes implemented by \nmanagement. Within each SET function, \nleadership teams discuss the risks the \nbusiness faces. Quarterly, each SET function \nassesses changes to these risks, new and \nemerging risks and mitigation plans. These \nare assimilated into a Group Risk Report for \nthe Board, Audit Committee and SET. \nGlobal Compliance, Finance and Global \nInternal Audit support SET by advising on \npolicy and standard setting, monitoring and \nauditing, communication and training, as well \nas reporting on the adequacy of line \nmanagement processes as they apply to risk \nmanagement. The Board believes that existing \nprocesses provide it with adequate information \non the risks and uncertainties we face. The \nBoard has carried out a robust assessment \nof the Principal and Emerging risks facing the \nGroup. Our Principal Risks are those risks that \nare most likely to have a material impact on \nour business and are a subset of the total risk \nlandscape facing the Group. The table on \npages 58 and 59 provides insight into these \nPrincipal Risks.\nEmerging risks\nEmerging risks are ‘new’ risks that have the \npotential to crystallise in the future but are \nunlikely to impact the business during the next \nyear. The outcome of such risks is often more \nuncertain. They may begin to evolve rapidly \nor simply not materialise. \nWe monitor our business activities and \nexternal and internal environments for new, \nemerging and changing risks to ensure these \nare managed appropriately. Annually, we \ncombine input from each SET function and \nexternal insight to scan the horizon for \nemerging risks and a summary is presented \nto the Audit Committee and Board. Emerging \nrisks continue to be monitored as part of the \nongoing risk management processes \noutlined above.\nClimate risk\nThe identification and assessment of climate \nrisk form part of our existing risk management \nprocesses. ‘Failure to meet regulatory and \nethical expectations on environmental impact, \nincluding climate change’ is a component of \nthe Group’s risk landscape but is not currently \nconsidered to be a Principal Risk for the Group.\nWe support the TCFD framework and \ncontinue to develop our disclosures in line \nwith its recommendations. Our TCFD \nStatement from page 53 summarises the \nwork undertaken to date to understand the \npotential impact of climate change on our \nbusiness and outlines future areas of \nmanagement focus.\n “We face a diverse \nrange of risks and \nuncertainties. Those \nrisks that have the \npotential to have a \nmaterial impact on our \nStrategic Priorities are \nour Principal Risks.”\n56\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nStrategic Report\nRisk Overview"

      "text": "Viability statement \nIn accordance with provision 31 of the \n2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the \nBoard has determined that a three-year \nperiod to 31 December 2025 constitutes an \nappropriate period over which to provide its \nviability statement. \nThe Board assesses the Company’s \nprospects using a 10-year long-range \nprojection. It notes the rich and varied \nportfolio of medicines in development across \na range of therapy areas and the medicines \ncurrently commercialised in more than 100 \nmarkets and concludes that the Company’s \nlong-term prospects remain strong. The \nBoard also considers annually and on a \nrolling basis, a three-year bottom-up \ndetailed business plan and, given the \ninherent uncertainty involved, believes that \nthe three-year statement presents readers \nof this Annual Report with a reasonable \ndegree of assurance over the ongoing \nviability of the Company while still providing \na longer-term perspective.\nThe three-year detailed business plan \ncaptures risks to the sales and cost forecasts \nat a market and SET function level. The plan \nis used to perform central net debt and \nheadroom profile analysis. The following \nscenarios have been applied to this analysis \nto create a severe but plausible downside \ncombining a number of the Principal Risks \ndetailed on pages 58 to 59. \n\t\n> Principal Risks: Pricing, affordability, \naccess and competitive pressures; failures \nor delays in the quality and execution of \nthe Group’s commercial strategies. \n\t– Scenario 1 – Government action on \npricing, higher than anticipated \ncompetition and other commercial \nheadwinds result in lower than \nanticipated growth rates for our \nmedicines.\n\t– Scenario 2 – A significant incident leads \nto reputational damage in a key market \nresulting in an ongoing 10% reduction \nin revenue achieved in this market.\n\t\n> Principal Risk: Failure or delay in the \ndelivery of our pipeline or launch of new \nmedicines. \n\t– Scenario 3 – Assumes no launches \nof new products.\n\t\n> Principal Risk: Failure to maintain supply \nof compliant, quality medicines.\n\t– Scenario 4 – Major equipment failure or \nsignificant regulatory observation at one \nof our major manufacturing sites results \nin a 12-month loss of formulation \ncapability for one of our key oncology \nproducts leading to supply interruption.\n\t\n> Principal Risks: Failure in information \ntechnology or cybersecurity. Adverse \noutcome of litigation and/or government \ninvestigations.\n\t– Scenario 5 – Legal, regulatory, cyber \nor other non-compliance results in a \npayment of $500 million in 2024.\n\t\n> Principal Risk: Geopolitical and/or \nmacroeconomic volatility disrupts the \noperation of our global business.\n\t– Scenario 6 – Measures taken to mitigate \nthe impact of inflation do not deliver to \nthe extent anticipated and add an \nadditional $300 million to the 2023 \ncost base.\nIn addition, the Board has considered more \nstressed scenarios including restrictions on \ndebt factoring and no access to capital \nmarkets to raise new debt. In each scenario \n(or combination of scenarios above), the \nGroup is able to rely on its existing cash, \ncash equivalents and short-term fixed income \ninvestments, committed credit facilities, \nleverage its cost base, reduce capital \nexpenditure and take other cash management \nmeasures to mitigate the impacts and still \nhave residual capacity to absorb further shocks.\nBased on the results of this analysis, the \nDirectors have a reasonable expectation \nthat the Company will be able to continue \nin operation and meet its liabilities as they \nfall due over the three-year period of \ntheir assessment.\n“\u0007Leadership teams \nwithin each of our \nSET functions \ndiscuss the risks to \nour business every \nquarter, with findings \nincluded in our Group \nRisk Report.”\nCorporate Governance\nAdditional Information\nFinancial Statements\nStrategic Report\n57\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nRisk Overview"

Our operating results \ncan be affected by a number of factors other \nthan the delivery of operating plans and \nnormal competition.\n  \u0007Further details of the risks faced by the business are \ngiven in Risk Overview from page 56 and in the Risk \nsupplement at www.astrazeneca.com/annualreport2022.\nOver the longer term, the success of our R&D \nis crucial and we devote substantial resources \nto this area. The benefits of this investment \nare expected to emerge over the long term \nand there is considerable inherent uncertainty \nas to the scale and timing of outcomes and \ntheir transition to saleable products.\nMeasuring performance \nReported and Core performance are referred \nto in this Financial Review when reporting on \nour performance in absolute terms, but more \noften in comparison with earlier years:\n\t\n> Reported performance takes into account \nall the factors (including those which we \ncannot influence, such as currency \nexchange rates) that have affected the \nresults of our business. The Consolidated \nFinancial Statements have been prepared in \naccordance with UK-adopted IAS and with \nthe requirements of the Companies Act \n2006 as applicable to companies reporting \nunder those standards. The Consolidated \nFinancial Statements also comply fully with \nIFRS as issued by the IASB and IAS as \nadopted by the EU.\n\t\n> Core performance measures are adjusted \nto exclude certain significant items, using a \nset of established principles.\n  \u0007For a detailed definition of Core measures, see page 63. \nUse of non-GAAP performance measures\nCore performance measures, EBITDA, Net \ndebt, CER, Gross margin and Operating \nmargin are non-GAAP performance measures \nbecause they cannot be derived directly from \nthe Financial Statements. \nBy disclosing non-GAAP performance and \ngrowth measures, in addition to our Reported \nfinancial information, we are enhancing \ninvestors’ ability to evaluate and analyse the \nfinancial performance and trends of our \nongoing business and the related key \nbusiness drivers. The adjustments are made \nto our Reported financial information in order \nto show non-GAAP performance measures \nthat illustrate clearly the impact on our \nperformance of factors such as changes in \nrevenues and expenses driven by volume, \nprices and cost levels relative to such prior \nyears or periods. These non-GAAP \nperformance measures are not a substitute \nfor, or superior to, financial measures \nprepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAs shown in the 2022 Reconciliation of \nReported results to Core results table on \npage 64, our reconciliation of Reported \nfinancial information to Core performance \nmeasures includes a breakdown of the items \nfor which our Reported financial information \nis adjusted, and a further breakdown by \nspecific line item as such items are reflected \nin our Reported income statement. This \nillustrates the significant items that are \nexcluded from Core performance measures \nand their impact on our Reported financial \ninformation, both as a whole and in respect \nof specific line items.\nManagement presents these results externally \nto meet investors’ requirements for \ntransparency and clarity. Core financial \nmeasures are also used internally in the \nmanagement of our business performance, in \nour budgeting process and when determining \ncompensation. As a result, Core performance \nmeasures allow investors to differentiate \nbetween different kinds of costs but they \nshould not be used in isolation. \n  \u0007Readers should also refer to our Reported financial \ninformation in the Summary performance in 2022 table \non page 61, our reconciliation of Core performance \nmeasures to Reported financial information in the 2022 \nReconciliation of Reported results to Core results table \nand the Excluded from Core results table on page 64 for \nour discussion of comparative growth measures that \nreflect all factors that affect our business.\nOur determination of non-GAAP measures and \nour presentation of them within this Financial \nReview, may differ from similarly titled \nnon-GAAP measures of other companies.\nThe SET retains strategic management of \nthe costs excluded from Reported financial \ninformation in arriving at Core financial \nmeasures, tracking their impact on Reported \nOperating profit and EPS, with operational \nmanagement being delegated on a case-by-\ncase basis to ensure clear accountability and \nconsistency for each cost category.\nWe strongly encourage readers of this Annual \nReport not to rely on any single financial \nmeasure but to review our Financial \nStatements, including the Notes thereto, and \nour other publicly filed reports, carefully and \nin their entirety.\n62\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nStrategic Report\nFinancial Review  \ncontinued"

      "text": "Non-GAAP measures: definitions\nRevenue\nConstant \nexchange rate \n(CER) growth \nrates \n  \u0007Reconciliation, \nsee page 64.\nDefinition: Retranslation of the current year’s performance at the \nprevious year’s average exchange rates, adjusted for other exchange \neffects, including hedging.\nWhy we use them: CER measures allow us to focus on the changes in \nrevenues and expenses driven by volume, prices and cost levels relative \nto the prior period. Revenues and cost growth expressed in CER allow \nmanagement to understand the true local movement in revenues and \ncosts, in order to compare recent trends and relative return on \ninvestment. CER growth rates can be used to analyse revenues in a \nnumber of ways but, most often, we consider CER growth by products \nand groups of products, and by countries and regions. \nCER revenue growth can be further analysed by revenue volumes and \nselling price. Similarly, CER cost growth helps us to focus on the real local \nchange in costs so that we can manage the cost base effectively.\nLimitations: CER measures are not always better indicators of \nperformance. Where countries are subject to high inflation and currencies \nthat depreciate persistently, adjusting out the effect of foreign exchange \nfluctuations could give an overly optimistic view of growth. \nProfitability\nCore \nperformance \nmeasures\n  \u0007Reconciliation, \nsee page 64.\nCore performance measures are adjusted to exclude certain significant \nitems. In determining the adjustments to arrive at the Core result, we use \na set of established principles relating to the nature or materiality of \nindividual items or groups of items, excluding, for example, events which \nare (i) outside the normal course of business, (ii) incurred in a pattern that \nis unrelated to the trends in the underlying financial performance of our \nongoing business, or (iii) related to major acquisitions, to ensure that \ninvestors’ ability to evaluate and analyse the underlying financial \nperformance of our ongoing business is enhanced. \n  \u0007See the 2022 Reconciliation of Reported results to Core results table on page 64 \nfor a reconciliation of Reported to Core performance, as well as further details \nof the adjustments.\nOur Core adjustments are summarised as:\nRestructuring costs, including charges that relate to the impact of our \nglobal restructuring programmes on our capitalised manufacturing \nfacilities and IT assets. These can take place over multiple reporting \nperiods, given the long life-cycle of our business. \nWhy we use them: We adjust for these charges and provisions \nbecause they primarily reflect the financial impact of change to \nlegacy arrangements, rather than the underlying performance of \nour ongoing business. \nIntangible amortisation and impairments, including impairment \nreversals but excluding any charges relating to IT assets. Intangibles \ngenerally arise from business combinations and individual licence \nacquisitions. \nWhy we use them: We adjust for these charges because their pattern \nof recognition is largely uncorrelated with the underlying performance \nof the business. \nAcquisition of Alexion, principally comprising acquisition-related costs \nresulting from the Alexion business combination. \nWhy we use them: We adjust for this item to enable a more meaningful \ncomparison of the performance of acquired business and products to \nthat of internally developed products, as well as removing charges whose \npattern of recognition is largely uncorrelated to the underlying \nperformance of the business.\nOther, principally comprising acquisition-related costs, other than those \nassociated with Alexion, the remeasurement of certain other payables \nassumed from the Alexion acquisition (which related to contingent \nconsideration in Alexion pre-acquisition by AstraZeneca), a one-off \nfavourable net adjustment to deferred taxes arising from an internal \nreorganisation to integrate the Alexion organisation, finance charges and \nfair value movements relating to contingent consideration on business \ncombinations or asset acquisitions, and costs for legal settlements. \nWhy we use them: We adjust for these items to enable a more meaningful \ncomparison of the performance of acquired businesses and products to \nthat of internally developed products, as well as removing charges whose \npattern of recognition is largely uncorrelated to the underlying \nperformance of the business.\nIt should be noted that some costs excluded from our Core results, such \nas intangibles amortisation and finance charges related to contingent \nconsideration, will recur in future years, and other excluded items such \nas impairments and legal settlements costs, along with other \nacquisition‑related costs, may recur in the future.\nLimitations: Core results exclude significant costs (such as restructuring, \nintangible amortisation and impairments, and other acquisition-related \nadjustments), but incorporate associated benefits, including Product Sales \narising from business combinations, asset acquisitions and assets which \nhave been amortised, as well as the benefits resulting from restructuring \nactivities and, as such, they should not be regarded as a complete picture \nof the Group’s financial performance, which is presented in its Reported \nresults. The exclusion of the adjusting items may result in Core earnings \nbeing materially higher or lower than Reported earnings. \nGross margin \npercentage\n  \u0007Reconciliation, \nsee page 64.\nDefinition: Gross margin, as a percentage, by which Product Sales \nexceeds the Cost of sales, calculated by dividing the difference between \nthe two by the sales figure. The calculation of Reported and Core Gross \nmargin excludes the impact of Collaboration Revenue and any associated \ncosts, thereby reflecting the underlying performance of Product Sales.\nWhy we use it: This measure sets out gross profitability of Product Sales \nwhen taking account of only direct Cost of sales. It is a key performance \nmeasure of the contribution to fund operating costs and overall quality \nof the business. \nLimitations: Gross margin percentage excludes the impact of \nCollaboration Revenue and related costs and therefore should not be \nregarded as giving a full picture of Total Revenue performance.\n63\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nCorporate Governance\nAdditional Information\nFinancial Statements\nStrategic Report\nFinancial Review"

As detailed \nin Note 30, payments to our partners may not \nbecome payable due to the inherent \nuncertainty in achieving the development and \nrevenue milestones linked to the future \npayments. We may enter into further \ncollaboration projects in the future that may \ninclude milestone payments and, as certain \nmilestone payments fail to crystallise due to, \nfor example, failure to obtain regulatory \napproval, unfavourable data from key studies, \nadverse reactions to the product candidate \nor indications of other safety concerns, they \nmay be replaced by potential payments under \nnew collaborations.\nInvestments, divestments and capital \nexpenditure \nWe have completed more than 80 major or \nstrategically important business development \ntransactions over the past three years.\nIn addition to the business development \ntransactions detailed under Collaboration \nRevenue from page 67 of this Financial \nReview, the following significant collaborations \nremain in the development phase:\nDaiichi Sankyo \n\t\n> In July 2020, AstraZeneca entered into \na new global development and \ncommercialisation agreement with Daiichi \nSankyo for DS-1062, its proprietary \ntrophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-\ndirected ADC and potential new medicine \nfor the treatment of multiple tumour types. \nAstraZeneca agreed to pay Daiichi Sankyo \nan upfront payment of $1 billion in staged \npayments: $350 million was due upon \ncompletion, with $325 million after \n12 months and $325 million after 24 months \nfrom the effective date of the agreement. \nAstraZeneca also agreed to pay additional \nconditional amounts of up to $1 billion for \nthe successful achievement of regulatory \napprovals and up to $4 billion for sales-\nrelated milestones. The transaction was \naccounted for as an intangible asset \nacquisition, recognised initially at the \npresent value of non-contingent \nconsideration, with any potential future \nmilestone payments capitalised into the \nintangible asset as they are recognised. \nThe companies will jointly develop and \ncommercialise DS-1062 worldwide, except \nin Japan where Daiichi Sankyo will retain \nexclusive rights. AstraZeneca and Daiichi \nSankyo will share equally development and \ncommercialisation expenses as well as \nprofits relating to DS-1062 worldwide, \nexcept for Japan where Daiichi Sankyo will \nbe responsible for such costs and will pay \nAstraZeneca mid-single-digit royalties. \nDaiichi Sankyo will record sales in the US, \ncertain countries in Europe and certain \nother countries where Daiichi Sankyo has \naffiliates. Profits shared with AstraZeneca \nfrom those countries will be recorded as \nCollaboration Revenue by AstraZeneca. \nAstraZeneca will record Product Sales in \nother countries worldwide, for which profits \nshared with Daiichi Sankyo will be recorded \nwithin Cost of sales. Daiichi Sankyo will \nmanufacture and supply DS-1062. \nInnate Pharma\n\t\n> In April 2015, we entered into two oncology \nagreements with Innate Pharma: first, a \nlicence which provides us with exclusive \nglobal rights to co-develop and commercialise \nIPH2201 in combination with Imfinzi; and, \nsecond, an option to license exclusive \nglobal rights to co-develop and commercialise \nIPH2201 in monotherapy and other \ncombinations in certain treatment areas. \nWe jointly fund Phase II studies with Innate \nPharma and we lead the execution of these \nstudies. In respect of these agreements, we \nmade an initial payment to Innate Pharma of \n$250 million. The agreement also includes a \nPhase III initiation milestone of $100 million, \nas well as additional regulatory and \nsales-related milestones. We record all \nsales and pay Innate Pharma double-digit \nroyalties on net sales. The arrangement \nincludes the right for Innate Pharma to \nco-promote in Europe for an equal share of \ncosts and income in the territory.\n\t\n> In October 2018, we exercised our option \nover IPH2201 and simultaneously entered \ninto a further multi-element transaction with \nInnate Pharma. Under the agreement, we \npaid $50 million to collaborate on, and \nacquire an option to license, IPH5201, a \npotentially first-in-class anti-CD39 mAb. \nAdditionally, we paid $20 million to acquire \noptions over four future programmes \ncurrently being developed by Innate \nPharma, and paid EUR 62.6 million to \nacquire a 9.8% stake in Innate Pharma. \nThe $100 million option fee and $50 million \npremium paid over market price for the \ninvestment in Innate Pharma have been \ncapitalised as intangible assets. The \npayment for future programmes will be \nexpensed as R&D expenditure over four years. \nWe determine these business development \ntransactions to be significant using a range of \nfactors. We look at the specific circumstances \nof the individual arrangement and apply \nseveral quantitative and qualitative criteria. \nAs we consider business development \ntransactions to be an extension of our R&D \nstrategy, the expected total value of \ndevelopment payments under the transaction \nand its proportion of our annual R&D spend, \nboth of which are proxies for overall R&D \neffort and cost, are important elements of the \ndetermination of the significance. Other \nquantitative criteria we apply include, without \nlimitation, expected levels of future sales, the \npossible value of milestone payments and the \nresources used for commercialisation \nactivities (for example, the number of staff). \nQualitative factors we consider include, \nwithout limitation, new market developments, \nnew territories, new areas of research and \nstrategic implications.\n71\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nCorporate Governance\nAdditional Information\nFinancial Statements\nStrategic Report\nFinancial Review"

      "text": "Rebates, chargebacks and returns in the US\nWhen invoicing Product Sales in the US, we \nestimate the rebates and chargebacks that \nwe expect to pay, which are considered to be \nestimates. These rebates typically arise from \nsales contracts with third-party managed \ncare organisations, hospitals, long-term care \nfacilities, group purchasing organisations \nand various federal or state programmes \n(Medicaid contracts, supplemental rebates, \netc.). They can be classified as follows:\n\t\n> Chargebacks, where we enter into \narrangements under which certain \nparties, typically hospitals, long-term care \nfacilities, group purchasing organisations, \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs, Public \nHealth Service Covered Entities, and the \nDepartment of Defense, are able to buy \nproducts from wholesalers at the lower \nprices we have contracted with them. \nThe chargeback is the difference between \nthe price we invoice to the wholesaler and \nthe contracted price charged by the \nwholesaler to the other party. Chargebacks \nare credited directly to the wholesalers.\n\t\n> Regulatory, including Medicaid and other \nfederal and state programmes, where we \npay rebates based on the specific terms \nof agreements with the US Department \nof Health and Human Services and with \nindividual states, which include product \nusage and information on best prices and \naverage market prices benchmarks.\n\t\n> Contractual, under which entities such as \nthird-party managed care organisations are \nentitled to rebates depending on specified \nperformance provisions, which vary from \ncontract to contract.\nThe effects of these deductions on our US \npharmaceuticals revenue and the movements \non US pharmaceuticals revenue provisions \nare set out on this page.\nAccrual assumptions are built up on a \nproduct-by-product and customer-by-\ncustomer basis, taking into account specific \ncontract provisions coupled with expected \nperformance, and are then aggregated into a \nweighted average rebate accrual rate for each \nof our products. Accrual rates are reviewed \nand adjusted on an as needed basis. There \nmay be further adjustments when actual \nrebates are invoiced based on utilisation \ninformation submitted to us (in the case of \ncontractual rebates) and claims/invoices are \nreceived (in the case of regulatory rebates and \nchargebacks). We believe that we have made \nreasonable estimates for future rebates using \na similar methodology to that of previous \nyears. Inevitably, however, these estimates \ninvolve assumptions in respect of aggregate \nfuture sales levels, segment mix and \ncustomers’ contractual performance.\nOverall adjustments between gross and net \nUS Product Sales amounted to $14,846 \nmillion in 2022 (2021: $11,970 million) with \nthe increase driven by our US Product Sales.\nCash discounts are offered to customers to \nencourage prompt payment. Accruals are \ncalculated based on historical experience and \nare adjusted to reflect actual experience. Our \nrevenue recognition policy is described within \nGroup Accounting Policies from page 142. \nIndustry practice in the US allows wholesalers \nand pharmacies to return unused stocks \nwithin six months of, and up to 12 months \nafter, shelf-life expiry. The customer is \ncredited for the returned product by the \nissuance of a credit note. Returned products \nare not exchanged for products from inventory \nand once a return claim has been determined \nto be valid and a credit note has been issued \nto the customer, the returned products are \ndestroyed. At the point of sale in the US, we \nestimate the quantity and value of products \nwhich may ultimately be returned. Our returns \naccruals in the US are based on actual \nexperience. Our estimate is based on the \nhistorical sales and returns information for \nestablished products together with market-\nrelated information, such as estimated shelf \nlife, product recall, and estimated stock levels \nat wholesalers, which we receive via third-\nparty information services. For newly \nlaunched products, we use rates based on \nour experience with similar products or a \npre-determined percentage.\nSarbanes-Oxley Act section 404 \nAs a consequence of our Nasdaq listing, \nwe are required to comply with those \nprovisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act \napplicable to foreign issuers. Section 404 \nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires \ncompanies annually to assess and make \npublic statements about the quality and \neffectiveness of their internal control over \nfinancial reporting. As regards Sarbanes-\nOxley Act section 404, our approach is \nbased on the Committee of Sponsoring \nOrganizations (COSO) 2013 framework.\nOur approach to the assessment has been \nto select key transaction and financial \nreporting processes in our largest operating \nunits and a number of specialist areas (e.g. \nfinancial consolidation and reporting, treasury \noperations and taxation etc.), so that, in \naggregate, we have covered a significant \nproportion of the key lines in our Financial \nStatements. Each of these operating units and \nspecialist areas (which for 2022 now includes \nour Rare Disease therapy area) has ensured \nthat its relevant processes and controls are \ndocumented to appropriate standards, taking \ninto account, in particular, the guidance \nprovided by the SEC.\nWe have also reviewed the structure and \noperation of our ‘entity level’ control \nenvironment.

In my time as a Director \nand Chair of the AstraZeneca Board, I have \nbeen fortunate to work with excellent Board \ncolleagues and a great management team to \nensure AstraZeneca is run in a way most likely \nto promote its long-term sustainable success.\nCorporate governance\nOne of the roles of the Nomination and \nGovernance Committee, which I have chaired, \nis to review and provide advice to the full \nBoard on matters of corporate governance. \nDuring my time as Chair, there have been \na number of changes to the Listing Rules \ndesigned to improve the way in which we \noperate. 2022 was no different in that \nrespect as we considered proposed audit \nand governance reforms in the UK.\nGiven AstraZeneca’s focus on inclusion and \ndiversity as part of its great place to work \nefforts, I am pleased that we are able to \nreport this year, earlier than strictly required, \nmore information about diversity and inclusion \non our Board and SET. While there is more we \ncan and will do in this regard, our achievements \nthus far were noted externally during 2022 \nas we were named the highest-ranking \npharmaceutical company in the FTSE 100 \nfor representation of women on the combined \nexecutive committee and their direct reports \nin the FTSE Women Leaders Review.\nOur new Chair\nWhen I stand down from the Board at the \nconclusion of this year’s AGM, I will be \nhanding over the role of Chair to Michel \nDemaré. Mr Demaré’s appointment was \nannounced after a thorough search led \nby Philip Broadley in his role as Senior \nindependent Non-Executive Director with \nthe whole Board fully engaged throughout. \nI am delighted that Mr Demaré will be succeeding \nme as Chair. He is an internationally-respected \nleader with extensive experience in strategy, \nplanning, execution, governance and corporate \nstewardship, and a proven track record \nleading multinational companies, as well as \nexperience of the pharmaceutical industry \ngained at Baxter and as a member \nof the AstraZeneca Board. Mr Demaré and I \nare already undertaking a comprehensive \nhandover process ahead of the AGM.\nBoard Committees\nI would like to thank Mr Broadley for leading \nthe recruitment process for the Chair so well, \nin addition to his longstanding role as Chair \nof the Audit Committee and the considerable \nresponsibility that entails. My thanks also \nto Nazneen Rahman for her continued \nchairing of the Science and Sustainability \nCommittees, two important aspects of our \nwork that continue to be at the heart of \nmany Board discussions.\nFollowing the appointment of Mr Demaré \nas Board Chair-designate, he stood down \nas Chair of the Remuneration Committee. \nI am grateful to Sheri McCoy who became \nRemuneration Committee Chair on 1 December \n2022, to continue the good work leading our \nscrutiny of this important area. Ms McCoy has \nin-depth knowledge of AstraZeneca’s \nremuneration arrangements, having been a \nmember of that Committee since July 2018. \nShe also became a member of the Nomination \nand Governance Committee in December 2022.\nBoard members\nEach of the Board’s Committees performs \nan important function but they do so on \nbehalf of the full Board.

      "text": "The Company’s Senior independent Non-\nExecutive Director serves as a sounding \nboard for the Chair and as an intermediary \nfor the other Directors when necessary. The \nSenior independent Non-Executive Director \nis also available to shareholders if they have \nconcerns that contact through the normal \nchannels of Chair or Executive Directors has \nfailed to resolve, or for which such contact is \ninappropriate. Philip Broadley was appointed \nSenior independent Non-Executive Director \non 1 March 2021. \nAs well as their work in relation to formal Board \nand Board Committee meetings, Non-Executive \nDirectors commit time throughout the year to \nmeetings and telephone calls with various \nlevels of executive management and other key \nstakeholders, visits to AstraZeneca’s sites \nthroughout the world (whether in person or \nvirtually) and, for new Directors, induction \nsessions and site visits. The Chair and \nindividual Board members ensure that Board \nmembers’ time commitment to the Company is \nsufficient to fulfil their duties as Directors and \nfully discharge their obligations to shareholders, \nparticularly in the case of the Chairs of Board \nCommittees. For the Chair of the Board, \ngenerally, as a basic commitment, it is expected \nthat they would need to devote about 40% of \ntheir time or the equivalent of not less than 90 \ndays per annum in the fulfilment of their duties.\nWhen contemplating taking up additional \nappointments, Non-Executive Directors \nconsult the Chair to ensure thought is given to \nany potential impact on their time commitment \nto AstraZeneca. Careful consideration is given \nto the nature of the potential appointment and \nthe type of company involved (for example, \nwhether the company is a public listed \ncompany or privately held), to help assess the \nlikely time requirement. \nThe performance of the Non-Executive \nDirectors is assessed annually as part of the \nBoard’s performance evaluation, as described \non page 91. \nSubject to specific Board approval, Directors \nand SET members may accept external \nappointments as non-executive directors of \nother companies and retain any related fees \npaid to them, provided that such \nappointments are not considered by the \nBoard to prevent or reduce the ability of the \nexecutive to perform his or her role within \nthe Group to the required standard.\nI. Company Secretary \nThe Company Secretary is responsible to the \nChair for ensuring that all Board and Board \nCommittee meetings are properly conducted, \nthat the Directors receive appropriate \ninformation prior to meetings to enable them \nto make an effective contribution and that \ngovernance requirements are considered and \nimplemented. The 2022 Board evaluation set \nout on page 91 provides details of the \neffective operation of the Board. \n3. Composition, succession and evaluation \nJ. Appointments and succession planning \nThe Nomination and Governance Committee \nand, where appropriate, the full Board, \nregularly review the composition of the Board \nand the status of succession to both SET- and \nBoard-level positions. Directors have regular \ncontact with, and access to, succession \ncandidates for SET positions. The Committee \nalso recognises the importance of diversity \nwhen considering potential appointments. \nThere is a formal, rigorous and transparent \nprocedure for appointments to the Board. \nThe Nomination and Governance Committee \nReport details changes in Board composition \nduring the year, and the appointment and \ninduction processes, from page 92.\nIn accordance with Article 66 of the Articles, \nall Directors retire at each AGM and may offer \nthemselves for re-election by shareholders. \nThe Notice of AGM will give details of those \nDirectors seeking election or re-election.\nK. Skills, experience and knowledge \nWhen the Nomination and Governance \nCommittee reviews the composition of the \nBoard and its Committees, it uses a matrix \nthat records the skills and experience of \ncurrent Board members, and compares this \nwith the skills and experience it believes are \nappropriate to the Company’s overall business \nand strategic needs, both now and in the future.\nThe Committee is also mindful of Directors’ \nlengths of tenure and the need to refresh \nmembership over time. \n  \u0007For more information, see the Nomination and \nGovernance Committee Report from page 92.\nL. Board evaluation \nIn 2022, the Board undertook an internal \nBoard performance evaluation. More \ninformation on the evaluation process, \nincluding the results and actions taken, \ncan be found on page 91. \n4. Audit, risk and internal control \nM. Internal and external audit \nThe Audit Committee is responsible for \nreviewing the relationship and independence of \nour external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers \nLLP. The Committee maintains a policy for \nthe pre-approval of all audit services and \naudit-related services undertaken by the \nexternal auditor, the principal purpose of \nwhich is to ensure that the independence \nof the external auditor is not impaired. \n  \u0007For more information, see page 99 and Note 31 to the \nFinancial Statements on page 198. \nThe Audit Committee also reviews the \nindependence and effectiveness of Group \nInternal Audit. \n  For more information, see page 98. \nN. Fair, balanced and understandable \nassessment \nThe Board considers this Annual Report, \ntaken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and \nunderstandable, and provides the information \nnecessary for shareholders to assess \nAstraZeneca’s position and performance, \nbusiness model and strategy. The Board’s \nassessment is described on page 102. \nThe Board and the Audit Committee review \nthe Company’s quarterly financial results \nannouncements to ensure they present a fair, \nbalanced and understandable assessment \nof the Company’s position and prospects \nto shareholders. \nO. Risk management \nThe Board is responsible for the Company’s \nrisk management system and internal controls, \nand their effectiveness. The Board delegates \nsome responsibilities for risk management \noversight to the Audit Committee, such as \nquarterly reviews of the Company’s principal \nand key active risks. During 2022, the Directors \ncontinued to review the effectiveness of our \nsystem of controls, risk management \n(including a robust assessment of the \nemerging and principal risks) and high-level \ninternal control processes. This included an \nannual Governance and Assurance Report \nto all Directors, which is considered in detail \nby the Audit Committee and reviewed by \nthe Board. \nAny areas of concern are highlighted in the \nAudit Committee Chair’s update to Directors \nat the relevant Board meeting and discussed \nby the Board. The Report is based on a full \nyear-end review of the Company’s risk and \ncontrol processes (incorporating financial, \noperational and compliance controls) and \nfindings from assurance processes. \nThe Directors believe that the Group maintains \nan effective, embedded system of internal \ncontrols and complies with the FRC’s \nguidance entitled ‘Guidance on Risk \nManagement, Internal Control and Related \nFinancial and Business Reporting’.\n  \u0007For more information about the ways in which we manage \nour business risks, our procedures for identifying our \nemerging risks, how we describe our Principal Risks and \nuncertainties, and our Viability statement, see Risk \nmanagement and controls on the following page, and the \nRisk Overview from page 56. \n5. Remuneration \nP. Remuneration policies and practices \nThe Remuneration Committee is responsible \nfor determining, approving and reviewing the \nCompany’s global remuneration principles \nand frameworks, to ensure that they support \nthe strategy of the Company and are designed \nto promote long-term sustainable success. \n  \u0007For more information on the Remuneration Committee’s \nwork, see page 104. \n84\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nCorporate Governance\nCorporate Governance Report\nCompliance with the UK \nCorporate Governance Code continued"

      "text": "Q. Developing executive remuneration policy \nThe Remuneration Committee routinely reviews \nthe Directors’ Remuneration Policy and \nexecutive remuneration arrangements to ensure \nthey continue to promote the delivery of the \nlong-term strategy and support the Company’s \nability to recruit and retain executive talent to \ndeliver against that strategy. The Committee \nalso considers remuneration arrangements in \nthe context of corporate governance best \npractice and arrangements for the wider \nworkforce, and regularly consults with its major \ninvestors on remuneration proposals. No \nDirector is involved in determining their own \nremuneration arrangements or outcomes.\n  \u0007For more information, see the Directors’ Remuneration \nReport, from page 104. \nR. Remuneration outcomes and independent \njudgement \nTo ensure it maintains independent judgement \nwhen determining remuneration outcomes, \nthe Remuneration Committee considers a \nrange of data including detailed business and \nindividual performance information. The \nCommittee also consults with other Board \nCommittees to utilise their expertise when \ndetermining performance outcomes. \n  \u0007For more information, see the Directors’ Remuneration \nReport, from page 104.\nFurther information on Directors’ \nappointments\nChair of the Board\nMr Johansson was first elected to the Board \nin April 2012 and was considered to be \nindependent on his appointment as Chair \non 1 June 2012. Provision 19 of the Code \nrecommends a company chair’s tenure should \nnot extend beyond nine years from their \nappointment to the board, although the period \ncan be extended for a limited time to facilitate \neffective succession planning. Acknowledging \nthat he had served as a Director for more than \nnine years, the Board believed it would be in \nthe best interests of shareholders for \nMr Johansson to seek re-election at the 2022 \nAGM and continue to serve as Chair for one \nfurther year, to facilitate succession planning \nand the transition to a new Chair.\nDuring 2022, it was announced that Mr \nJohansson would be retiring from the Board \nat the conclusion of the Company’s AGM in \n2023, and that Michel Demaré had been \nappointed as the Chair-designate of the \nBoard. Mr Demaré’s appointment will take \neffect immediately on Mr Johansson’s \nretirement. Further information on the Chair’s \nsuccession is included in the Nomination \nand Governance Committee Report, from \npage 92.\nNon-Executive Directors’ independence\nIn December 2022, the Board considered the \nindependence of the Non-Executive Directors, \nother than the Chair of the Board, for the \npurposes of the Code and the Nasdaq \nListing Rules. Taking into account the \nrecommendations set out in the Code and the \nNasdaq Listing Rules, the Board considers \nthat all the Non-Executive Directors except \nMarcus Wallenberg are independent. Marcus \nWallenberg was appointed as a Director of \nAstra in May 1989 and subsequently became \na Director of the Company in 1999. He is a \nNon-Executive Director of Investor AB, which \nhas a 3.33% interest in the issued share \ncapital of the Company as at 8 February 2022. \nFor these reasons – his overall length of tenure \nand relationship with a significant shareholder \n– the Board does not believe that he can be \ndetermined independent under the UK \nCorporate Governance Code. However, the \nBoard believes that he has brought, and \ncontinues to bring, considerable business \nexperience and makes a valuable contribution \nto the work of the Board. \nAs well as being a Non-Executive Director \nof AstraZeneca and Chair of the Board’s \nSustainability Committee, Nazneen Rahman \nis the Director of the Sustainable Medicines \nPartnership (SMP), a multi-stakeholder, \nnot-for-profit collaboration with the aim of \nadvancing the environmental sustainability \nof medicines. AstraZeneca is a strategic \ncollaborator in the SMP. Dr Rahman has \nrecused herself from acting as the lead \ncontact for the SMP in its relationship with \nAstraZeneca, and this relationship, including \nproject work and overall programme \nmanagement, is handled by other members \nof the SMP team. \nRisk management and controls\nGlobal Compliance and Group Internal \nAudit (GIA) \nGlobal Compliance helps the Group achieve \nits priorities and do business the right way. \nIt takes a global approach that addresses \nkey risk areas, including those related to \nthird parties and anti-bribery/anti-corruption. \nIts work helps us to reinforce compliant \nbehaviours through our Code of Ethics, \npolicies, training, advice and guidance. We \nalso conduct risk assessment activities and \nfoster a culture where individuals can raise \nconcerns.\nWe take alleged compliance breaches or \nconcerns seriously. We investigate and take \nappropriate disciplinary and remediation \naction to address and prevent reoccurrence \nthrough internal functions and external \nadvisers. Depending on breach severity, the \nGroup may need to disclose and/or report \nthe incident to a regulatory or government \nauthority.\nGlobal Compliance provides assurance \ninsights to the Audit Committee on \ncompliance matters. GIA carries out a range \nof audits and periodically reviews the \nassurance activities of other Group functions.\nThe results from these activities are reported \nto the Audit Committee. Global Compliance \nand GIA share outcomes and coordinate \nreporting on compliance matters throughout \nthe organisation. GIA is established by the \nAudit Committee on behalf of the Board and \nacts as an independent and objective \nassurance function guided by a philosophy \nof adding value to improve the operational \ncontrol framework of the Group. The scope \nof GIA’s responsibilities encompasses, but is \nnot limited to, the examination and evaluation \nof the adequacy and effectiveness of the \nGroup’s governance, risk management and \ninternal control processes in relation to the \nGroup’s defined goals and objectives. \nAmong others, internal control objectives \nconsidered by GIA include:\n\t\n> compliance with significant policies, plans, \nprocedures, laws and regulations \n\t\n> consistency of operations or programmes \nwith established objectives and goals, and \neffective performance \n\t\n> safeguarding of assets. \nBased on its activity, GIA is responsible for \nreporting significant risk exposures and \ncontrol issues identified to the Board and to \nsenior management, including fraud risks, \ngovernance issues and other matters needed \nor requested by the Audit Committee. It may \nalso evaluate specific operations at the \nrequest of the Audit Committee or \nmanagement, as appropriate.\n85\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nCorporate Governance\nAdditional Information\nFinancial Statements\nStrategic Report\nCorporate Governance Report  /  Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code"

Engagement with employees \nis an important element in ensuring an \nenvironment in which all employees are \nrespected, where openness is valued, \ndiversity celebrated and every voice heard. \nWe rely on our global workforce to uphold \nour Values, deliver our strategic priorities \nand work to sustain and improve short- and \nlong-term performance. For AstraZeneca, \n‘global workforce’ includes our full-time and \npart-time employees, fixed-term workers and \nexternal contractors working full- or part-time, \nanywhere in the world.\nThe Directors believe that the Board as a \nwhole should be responsible for engaging \nwith and understanding the views of the \nworkforce. To do this, it uses various \nmechanisms and long-standing \ncommunication channels in place across the \nGroup that enable and facilitate engagement \nwith the global workforce. These include the \nBoard’s review of the global workforce Pulse \nsurvey and the biannual Workforce Culture \nand Employee Engagement Report; Board \nmembers hosting ‘townhall’ meetings for the \nworkforce, including Q&A sessions; and \nreview of data relating to talent, development, \ninclusion and diversity initiatives, and online \nsocial media channels. Directors also visit our \nsites and carry out virtual engagements, \nwhich facilitate understanding of business \noperations and also provide opportunities \nfor interactions between Directors and the \nworkforce, including engagement with \nhigh-potential employees. Where required, \nissues or concerns raised by the workforce \nare fed back to management and discussed \nby the Board. Whenever relevant, the Board \nconsiders the views of the workforce and the \npotential impact on the workforce when it \nmakes key decisions.\n  \u0007For more information, see How the Board engages with \nstakeholders on page 88, the Audit Committee Report \nfrom page 96 and the Science Committee Report from \npage 94.\nEngaging with the wider workforce can \npresent challenges due to the size of the \nworkforce and the global footprint, as well \nas the variety of roles throughout the \norganisation. Virtual engagements help to \nensure that individual Directors, as well as \nBoard Committees, have the opportunity to \nmeet with a range of employees from across \nthe global workforce, and to hear and \nunderstand their views.\nDuring the year, the Board reviewed the \neffectiveness of these engagement \nmechanisms and was satisfied that the \narrangements in place continue to be an \neffective way of engaging with AstraZeneca’s \nglobal workforce, meeting the requirements of \nthe 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, in \nthat they provide a variety of information and \ndata that the whole Board can use when \nconsidering the impact of its strategic \ndecisions on employees, and opportunities \nfor meaningful dialogue for all Directors. \nEmployee opinion surveys (Pulse)\nTwice a year, employees are invited to take \npart in an opinion survey, which seeks their \nviews of the business. The results are \nreviewed by management and trends are \nmonitored. The results are shared with the \nBoard, which enables the Directors to \nunderstand the views and sentiments of the \nworkforce. \n89% \nof employees stated they believe strongly \nin AstraZeneca’s future direction and \nkey priorities in the November 2022 \nPulse survey.\nSite visits \nDirectors have visited various Group sites \nacross the world during 2022 including those \nin Ireland, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the UK, \nand the US. This included visits to two \nprincipal Alexion sites (in Boston, MA, US \nand Dublin, Ireland), following the Alexion \nacquisition in 2021. The majority of these \nwere in-person visits, but the engagements \nwith AstraZeneca’s businesses in Sweden, \nSpain and Taiwan were virtual. \nWellbeing\nWhere appropriate – for example in relation \nto Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – the Board \nreceives regular updates on the steps taken \nby management to create safe working \nenvironments and support the mental and \nphysical wellbeing of the workforce. \nWorkforce culture\nDuring 2022, the Board reviewed the biannual \nWorkforce Culture and Employee Engagement \nReport, which demonstrated how our Values \nand behaviours are embedded throughout all \nlevels of the workforce. The report contains a \nsummary metric dashboard which is divided \ninto categories reflecting AstraZeneca’s \nValues and behaviours. Where the Board has \nconcerns that the culture does not reflect our \nValues, the Board seeks assurances from \nmanagement that remedial action has been \ntaken and, where necessary, requests senior \nmanagement’s attendance at Board meetings \nto discuss corrective actions.\n19\nengagement events with employees \n(including both in-person and virtual).\n‘Townhall’ meetings, ‘fireside chats’ and \n‘Ask anything’ discussions\nBoth Non-Executive Directors and Executive \nDirectors regularly participate in meetings \nwith sites, or large groups of the workforce \n– either virtually or in person.

Lintstock \nhas no other commercial relationship with \nthe Company or any individual Directors. \nBased on Board members’ responses to the \nweb-based questionnaire covering a wide \nrange of topics, Lintstock prepared a report \nwhich was discussed by the Board at its \nmeeting in December 2022, and was used by \nthe Chair and Chair-designate as the basis \nfor individual conversations with each Board \nmember prior to the full Board discussion. \nThe Company’s last externally facilitated \nBoard evaluation occurred in 2020. \nAs part of each Director’s individual \ndiscussion with the Chair during the Board \nevaluation, his or her contribution to the work \nof the Board and personal development \nneeds were considered.

      "text": "As well as being considered in decisions about \nsuccession and Board appointments, inclusion \nand diversity is integrated across our Code of \nEthics and associated workforce policy. We \npromote a culture of diversity, respect and \nequal opportunity, where individual success \ndepends only on personal ability and \ncontribution. We strive to treat our employees \nwith fairness, integrity, honesty, courtesy, \nconsideration, respect, and dignity, regardless \nof sex, race, nationality, age, sexual orientation \nor other forms of diversity. The Board is \nprovided each year with a comprehensive \noverview of the AstraZeneca workforce, \ncovering a wide range of metrics and measures \n(including trends around gender diversity, \nleadership, ethnic diversity and age profile). \nIn the first year of the FTSE Women Leaders \nReview published in 2022, which is the third \nand successor phase to the Hampton-\nAlexander and Davies Reviews, we were \nnamed as the highest-ranking pharmaceutical \ncompany in the FTSE 100 for representation of \nwomen on the combined executive committee \nand their direct reports. For the year ended \n31 December 2022, women represented 42.7% \nof the SET and its leadership teams (42.3% \nfollowing the retirement of Katarina Ageborg \nin January 2023).\n \t \u0007Information about our approach to diversity in the \norganisation below Board level can be found in People, \nfrom page 45.\nBoard Inclusion and Diversity Policy\nThe Board has adopted an Inclusion and \nDiversity Policy (the Policy), which is \napplicable to the Board and its Committees. \nThe Policy reinforces the Board’s ongoing \ncommitment to all aspects of diversity and to \nfostering an inclusive environment in which \neach Director feels valued and respected. \nAlthough the Board appoints candidates \nprimarily based on merit and the relevance of \ntheir background and experience, measured \nagainst objective criteria, it recognises that \nan effective Board, with a broad strategic \nperspective, requires diversity. The Policy \nprovides a commitment to use at least one \nprofessional search firm that has signed up to \nthe ‘Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive \nSearch Firms’, to help recruit Directors from \na broad, qualified group of candidates, to \nincrease diversity of thinking and perspective. \nThe Board’s approach to inclusion and \ndiversity continues to yield successful results. \nAs at 31 December 2022, 31% of the \nCompany’s full Board identifies as an ethnic \nminority, 36% of the Company’s Non-\nExecutive Directors are women, and women \nmake up 38% of the full Board. The information \npresented in the following tables was \ncollected on a self-reporting basis. The Board, \nthe SET and the Company Secretary were \nprovided with the prescribed table, and asked to \ncomplete based on how they identify. Although \nnot yet applicable to the Company, the Board is \nmindful of the FCA’s new diversity targets and \nwhile pleased that it has met most of them, \nnotes that 38% of the Board are women and \nso it does not yet meet the 40% requirement. \nThe make-up of the Board is subject to \nfluctuations owing to the necessary expertise \nof the Board. However, mindful of the increased \nfocus on diversity, including the updated \nListing Rule requirements and evolving \nrecommendations of the FTSE Women \nLeaders Review, the Board reviewed the Policy \nfor 2023 and will be cognisant of the increased \n40% recommendation for female representation \non its Board. The updated Policy also sets out \nthe Board’s aim for at least one of the Chair of \nthe Board, Chief Executive Officer, Senior \nindependent Director or Chief Financial Officer \nto be a woman, which the Board is pleased to \nhave already met following the appointment of \nAradhana Sarin as CFO.\n \u0007The Board’s Inclusion and Diversity Policy can be \nread in full on our website, www.astrazeneca.com.\nOngoing training and development\nIn addition to arranging comprehensive \ninduction programmes when new Non-\nExecutive Directors are appointed to the \nBoard, the Committee recognises the \nimportance of continuing development and \ntraining opportunities for all Directors. We are \ncommitted to developing a culture of lifelong \nlearning throughout our organisation. Specific \nsessions with internal and external experts are \nperiodically arranged for the full Board, to \nensure that Directors have access to specialist \nknowledge across a broad range of areas to \nsupport their strategic decision making. For \nexample, this included a deep dive into our \nAmbition Zero Carbon targets in July 2022.\nAt least annually, I discuss with each Director his \nor her contribution to the work of the Board \nTable 1.

The Board determined that all members \nof the Committee are independent for the \npurposes of the Code and that the Committee \nmembers as a whole have competence \nrelevant to the sector in which the Company \noperates, by virtue of their experience of \nworking in science-driven, healthcare and/or \npharmaceutical industries, or as a result of \ntheir tenure with AstraZeneca. The Committee \nmembers’ qualifications, skills and experience \nare detailed in their biographies on pages 80 \nand 81 and meeting attendance is shown \non page 79.\nRole of the Committee\nThe Committee’s main responsibilities include \nmonitoring the integrity of financial reporting \nand formal announcements relating to \nfinancial performance, reviewing the \neffectiveness of internal controls and risk \nmanagement systems, and overseeing the \nexternal and internal audit processes. The \nCommittee reports to the Board the principal \nmatters it considers and any significant \nconcerns it has or that have been reported to \nit. Further information about the Committee’s \nrole and work during the year is set out in \nthis Report.\nActivities during the year \nFinancial reporting\nEffective internal controls, appropriate \naccounting practices and policies, and the \nexercise of experienced judgement by the \nCommittee and the Board underpin \nAstraZeneca’s financial reporting integrity.\nThe Committee reviewed key elements of the \nFinancial Statements and the estimates and \njudgements contained in the Group’s financial \ndisclosures, as well as considering the \nappropriateness of management’s and the \nexternal auditor’s analysis and conclusions \non judgemental accounting matters. The \nsignificant financial reporting issues \nconsidered are described in detail in the table \nfrom page 100. Further information on the \nsignificant accounting matters considered is \nincluded in the Financial Review under Critical \naccounting policies and estimates from page 73 \nand within our Group Accounting Policies \nfrom page 142. The Committee also \nconsidered the completeness and accuracy \nof the Group’s reported financial performance \nagainst its internal and external key \nperformance indicators.\nThe Committee discussed and reviewed \nthe preparation of the Directors’ Viability \nstatement and considered the adequacy \nof the analysis supporting the assurance \nprovided by that statement, as well as the \ngoing concern assessment and adoption of \nthe going concern basis in preparing this \nAnnual Report and the Financial Statements. \n  \u0007More information on the basis of preparation of Financial \nStatements on a going concern basis is set out on \npage 215 and in the Financial Statements on page 142.\nThe Committee considered the external \nauditor’s reports on its audit of the Group \nFinancial Statements, as well as reports from \nmanagement, Group Internal Audit (GIA), \nGlobal Compliance and the external auditor \non the effectiveness of our system of internal \ncontrols and, in particular, our internal control \nover financial reporting. This included \nconsideration of compliance with applicable \nprovisions of the SOx – in particular, the status \nof compliance with the programme of internal \ncontrols over financial reporting implemented \npursuant to section 404 of that Act. Alexion \nhas been fully integrated into the report on \nInternal Controls Over Financial Reporting \nsince the start of 2022.\nThe Committee also spent significant time \nduring the year discussing financial reporting \nconsiderations relating to significant \ntransactions that occurred in the year, \nvaluation and presentation of defined benefit \npension arrangements, impairment of \nintangible assets and valuation of contingent \nconsideration, restructuring programmes and \npresentation of collaboration revenues among \nothers. The Committee also reviewed the \nrationalisation and simplification of the \nResults Announcements and Annual Report \nfor the year. \n  \u0007Further information on the significant financial reporting \nissues considered is set out in the table from page 100.\nRisk identification and management\nThe Committee continued its regular \nreviews of the Group’s approach to risk \nmanagement, the operation of its risk \nreporting framework and risk mitigation. \nThis included consideration of how the risk \nmanagement process was embedded in the \nGroup and the Committee assuring itself \nthat management’s accountability for risks \nwas clear and functioning.\nWhen identifying risks, the Committee \nconsiders the total landscape of risks. \nThe most significant of these, as measured \nthrough potential impact and probability, \nare our Principal Risks. We then consider \nthose specific risks which are challenging \nour business presently, our key active risks. \nFinally, we scan the horizon and identify risks \nwhich may challenge us in the future, our \nemerging risks. This framework provided the \ncontext for the Committee’s consideration \nof the Directors’ Viability statement. The \nDirectors’ Viability statement is underpinned \nby the assurance provided through a ‘stress \ntest’ analysis under which key profitability, \nliquidity and funding metrics are tested \nagainst severe downside scenarios.\nEach of these scenarios assumes that the \nassociated risks crystallise and that \nmanagement will take mitigating actions \nagainst those risks. The Committee \nconsidered in detail the validity of each \nscenario. This included obtaining additional \nanalysis from management as to the indirect \nor unintended consequences of its proposed \nmitigating actions including, for example, \nassessing the likely response of a broader \nrange of stakeholders. The Committee also \nassessed whether the proposed mitigations \nwere viable.\nThe Committee is updated on key active and \nemerging risks facing the Company through \nquarterly risk management reports from the \nCFO. During the year, the business’s response \nto the conflict in Ukraine was identified as a \nnew key active risk, with the Committee \nclosely monitoring the potential impact on \nAstraZeneca’s business in the region and \nmore broadly, as well as the steps being \ntaken in response, including compliance \nwith relevant sanctions. The Committee also \nspent time considering: IT, cyber risk and \ndata security; and global fiscal and economic \npressures. Both of these key active risks were \ndeemed to have increased in significance and \nlikelihood during the year, chiefly driven by \nexternal factors.\nThe Committee’s consideration of risk \nmanagement was supported by deep dive \nreviews of topics aligned with AstraZeneca’s \nkey active risks and meetings with teams \nfrom within the business.\n  \u0007Further information about the Principal Risks faced by \nthe Group and the Viability statement is set out in \nRisk Overview from page 56. \n97\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nCorporate Governance\nAdditional Information\nFinancial Statements\nStrategic Report\nAudit Committee Report"

The deep dive \nalso provided an update on the integration of \nAlexion and the security of its digital systems. \nThe Committee additionally considered risks \nassociated with attrition of IT employees, \ndriven by increased demand for IT capabilities \nin all industries following the COVID-19 \npandemic.\n  \u0007For further information, see IT and IS resources on \npage 43. \nSustainability reporting and climate-related risk\nThe Committee is responsible for overseeing \nsustainability-related disclosures that are \nlinked to the Financial Statements, which \nincludes the Task Force on Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD) Statement and \nthe EU Taxonomy disclosures in this Annual \nReport and in the extended TCFD Statement \npublished separately. These statements are also \nreviewed by the Sustainability Committee, to \nsupport the Committee’s review. \nClimate-related risks, including risks of \nclimate change and transition risks associated \nwith the goals of the Paris Agreement, are \nroutinely assessed as part of AstraZeneca’s \nstandard risk management framework. \nSustainability planning is integrated within our \nbusiness operations and planning activities, \nwith progress on significant climate-related \ninitiatives, including Ambition Zero Carbon, \ncontinuously monitored. The implications of \nsustainability activities is considered for key \nfinancial reporting areas including \nimpairments, provisioning and contingent \nliabilities. In addition, management also \ncontinuously assesses developments in \nsustainability regulations that could impact the \nGroup’s operations as well as regulations over \nsustainability reporting across the different \njurisdictions of operations of the Group. The \nCommittee is kept closely informed about \nsuch regulations that could impact our \nfinancial and sustainability reporting. The \nCommittee received updates in the current \nyear regarding the proposed regulations by \nUS, EU and UK regulators on sustainability \nreporting, as well as the required disclosures \nunder the EU Taxonomy regulations.\nLegal and compliance\nThe Committee received and discussed \nquarterly reports from the Legal function to \nmonitor the status of significant litigation \nmatters and governmental investigations. \nQuarterly reports from Global Compliance \nprovided oversight of key compliance \nincidents (both substantiated and \nunsubstantiated), trends arising and the \ndispersion of incidents across our business \nfunctions and management hierarchy. The \nreports included any corrective actions taken \nso that the Committee could assess the \neffectiveness of controls, and monitor and \nensure the timeliness of remediation. The \nCommittee also received and discussed \nregular briefings from Legal and Compliance \non key investigations in China.\nThe Committee’s priorities include overseeing \ncompliance with AstraZeneca’s Code of \nEthics, ensuring high ethical standards and \nthat we operate within the law in all countries \nwhere we operate. During the year, the \nCommittee reviewed data from reports made \nby employees via the AZ Ethics helpline, online \nfacilities and other routes regarding potential \nbreaches of the Code of Ethics, together with \nthe results of enquiries into those matters.\nThe Committee continued to monitor and \nreview the effectiveness of our anti-bribery \nand anti-corruption controls across the \nGroup, prioritising its focus on countries/\nregions where we have significant operations \nand countries in which doing business is \ngenerally considered to pose higher \ncompliance risks. The Committee also \ndiscussed the monitoring, review, education \nand improvements made to support \nassurance that the risk of modern slavery and \nhuman trafficking is eliminated, to the fullest \nextent practicable, from AstraZeneca’s \nsupply chain.\n  \u0007For more information on our Code of Ethics, see page 51, \nand on Anti-bribery and anti-corruption, see page 41. \nAstraZeneca’s Modern Slavery Act Statement is available \non our website, www.astrazeneca.com.\nInternal audit\nThe Committee also received and discussed \nquarterly reports of work carried out by GIA, \nincluding the status of follow-up actions with \nmanagement. Separate meetings are \narranged to discuss follow-up actions in more \ndepth with specific teams, when required by \nthe Committee.\nAn independent External Quality Assessment \nof GIA was performed in late 2021, and the \nCommittee considered the findings in 2022. \nThe Committee was pleased to receive \nconfirmation that GIA ‘Generally Conforms’ \nto the Institute of Internal Auditors’ Global \nStandards (the highest rating that can be \nobtained), and showed leading practice in a \nnumber of areas, including through its quality \nassurance programme and use of technology.\nThe Committee carried out the annual \neffectiveness review of GIA in late 2022 by \nconsidering its performance against the \ninternal audit plan and key activities. In 2022, \nGIA provided assurance over compliance with \nsignificant policies, plans, procedures, laws \nand regulations, as well as risk-based audits \nacross a broad range of key business \nactivities, and continued its thematic reporting \nto the business. Following a period of working \nclosely together since the acquisition of \nAlexion, from 1 April 2022, the Alexion Rare \nDisease Unit Internal Audit team was \nintegrated with GIA, allowing the teams to \nalign on strategy, processes and reporting. \nThe combined 2022 audit plan was aligned to \nour key active risks and wider risk taxonomy. \nGIA also operates an emerging risk process \nwhich was used to adapt the 2022 audit plan \nto provide focused, real-time assurance over \nnew and evolving risks impacting the Group. \nThis included an audit of the governance \nmodel for the new Vaccines & Immune \nTherapies business unit and regular \nengagement with key members of the \nAstraZeneca response workstreams in \nrespect of the conflict in Ukraine.\nThe Committee considered the geographic \npresence, reach and capabilities of GIA, as \nwell as the Compliance function, and the \nappropriateness of the Group’s resource \nallocation for these vital assurance functions.\nThe Committee noted the continued \ncontributions of GIA, and the Legal and \nCompliance functions, in supporting and \ndelivering value to the business and the \nCommittee during the year.

Each quarter, the CFO \nreports on the carrying value of the Group’s intangible \nassets as well as the specific assets identified as at risk \nof impairment. In respect of intangible assets that are \nidentified as at risk of impairment, the Committee receives \ninformation on the difference between the carrying value \nand management’s current estimate of discounted future \ncash flows for ‘at risk’ products (the headroom). Products \nwill be identified as ‘at risk’ because the headroom is small \nor, for example, in the case of a medicine in development, \nthere is a significant development milestone such as the \npublication of clinical trial results which could significantly \nalter management’s forecasts for the product. The reviews \nalso cover the impact on any related contingent \nconsideration arising from previous business combinations.\nThe Committee considered the impairment reviews of the \nGroup’s intangible assets. Impairments of $146 million \narose in relation to launched products, and $172 million \narose in relation to products in development.\nThe Committee assured itself of the integrity of the Group’s \naccounting policy and models for its assessment and \nvaluation of its intangible assets, including understanding \nthe key assumptions and sensitivities within those models. \nThe Committee also considered the internal and external \nestimates and forecasts for the Group’s cost of capital \nrelative to the broader industry, as well as alignment of \nmethodology for legacy Alexion assets.

Revenue recognition, \nparticularly in the US, is affected by rebates, chargebacks, \nreturns, other revenue accruals and cash discounts. \nThe Committee pays attention to management’s estimates \nof these items, its analysis of any unusual movements and \ntheir impact on revenue recognition.\nThe Committee receives regular reports from management \nand the external auditor on this complex area. The US \nmarket remains highly competitive with diverse marketing \nand pricing strategies adopted by the Group and its peers.\nThe Committee recognised the close monitoring and \ncontrol by management and the continuous drive to \nimprove the accuracy in forecasting for managed market \nrebates and excise fees, which has supported a \nstabilisation of the overall gross-to-net deductions.\nAlternative \nperformance \nmeasures (APMs)\n  \u0007See Financial Review \nfrom page 60.\nAstraZeneca reports APMs to provide helpful \nsupplementary information to the IFRS measures to \nenable a better understanding of the Group’s financial \nperformance and position.

The \nGroup recognises that the present value of these liabilities \nis sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates, future \ninflation and mortality expectations. As a result, the \nassumptions used to value the liabilities for the Group’s \nmain post-retirement benefit obligations are updated every \nquarter along with ‘mark-to-market’ asset valuations. This \nenables an updated funding level to be calculated each \nquarter. The Group is cognisant of the wider regulatory \nenvironment and local requirements around funding levels \nand contributions.\nSignificant rises in long-term bond yields over the period \nresulted in material falls in liability valuations and reduced \ndeficits. Some post-retirement schemes are in surplus. \nThe Group applied appropriate guidance in determining the \naccounting and presentation of surplus amounts during \nthe year.\nRapid increases in UK Government bond yields over \nSeptember and October created liquidity issues for many \nUK defined benefit pension funds who hedge interest rate \nrisk and were required to post substantial margin to meet \ncollateral calls. The Group proactively engages with and \nprovides input to the Trustee. As a result, there is a robust \nrisk management framework in place for the UK Pension \nFund (the Fund). The Fund operated normally throughout \nthe period with investment strategy and hedging levels \nmaintained. No financial support from the Group \nwas required.\nThe Committee monitors the funding level of the Group’s \ndefined benefit obligations on a quarterly basis and the \nfunding requirements in each case, alongside key \ndevelopments. The Committee noted the overall \nimprovement in the funding position and material reduction \nin deficit over the year. Furthermore, a de-risking of \ninvestment strategy within the Fund was noted to reflect \nthe improvement in funding position. The Committee was \nsatisfied that the Group’s contribution policy and actuarial \nassumptions used to value liabilities were appropriate \nduring the year. The Committee has been assured that \ncorporate activity which may have the potential to \nmaterially impact the strength of the covenant provided to \nthe Fund is monitored and assessed such that appropriate \nstakeholders can be notified when required by the Pension \nScheme Act 2021. \nThe Committee was reassured by the Group’s engaged \nand balanced approach to managing the risks associated \nwith the funding of its defined benefit obligations. The \nCommittee reviewed management’s accounting and \npresentation of pension balances and concurred with \nmanagement’s approach. The Committee is cognisant of \nthe need to adhere to local funding regulations and best \npractice and to the security provided by the Group, which \nunderwrites obligations to members. \nThe Committee noted that due to careful oversight and \nmonitoring, the Fund managed well through a period of \nvolatile financial markets and steep rises in UK Government \nbond yields, with no issues and without any recourse to \nthe Group. \nFair, balanced and understandable \nassessment\nAs in previous years, at the instruction of \nthe Board, the Committee undertook an \nassessment of this Annual Report to ensure \nthat, taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced and \nunderstandable and provides the information \nnecessary for shareholders to assess the \nCompany’s position and performance, \nbusiness model and strategy. The Committee \nreviewed the Company’s governance \nstructure and assurance mechanisms for the \npreparation of the Annual Report and, in \nparticular, the contributor and SET member \nverification process. The Committee received \nan early draft of the Annual Report to review \nits proposed content and the structural \nchanges from the prior year and to undertake \na review of the reporting for the year, following \nwhich the Committee members provided their \nindividual and collective feedback. In addition, \nin accordance with its terms of reference, the \nCommittee (alongside the Board) took an \nactive part in reviewing the Company’s \nquarterly announcements and considered the \nCompany’s other public disclosures which are \nmanaged through its Disclosure Committee \n(the Committee was updated on matters \nconsidered by the Disclosure Committee \nregularly throughout the year). To aid its \nreview further, the Committee also received a \nsummary of the final Annual Report’s content, \nincluding the Company’s successes and \nsetbacks during the year and an indication of \nwhere they were disclosed within the document.\nThe processes described above allowed the \nCommittee to provide assurance to the Board \nto assist it in making the statement required of \nit under the Code, which is set out from \npage 83.\nInternal controls\nInformation on the Company’s internal \ncontrols is included in the Audit, risk and \ninternal control section in the Corporate \nGovernance Report on page 84. During the \nperiod covered by this Annual Report there \nwas no change in our internal control over \nfinancial reporting that occurred that has \nmaterially affected, or is reasonably likely to \nmaterially affect, our internal control over \nfinancial reporting.\nAt the January 2023 Committee meeting, \nthe CFO presented the conclusions of the \nevaluation by the CEO and CFO of the \neffectiveness of our disclosure controls \nand procedures that is required by Item 15(a) \nof Form 20-F at 31 December 2022. Based \non their evaluation, the CEO and the CFO \nconcluded that, as at that date, the Company \nmaintained an effective system of disclosure \ncontrols and procedures. \nExternal auditor\nPwC is the Company’s external auditor. \nIn April 2022, PwC was reappointed as the \nCompany’s auditor for the financial year \nended 31 December 2022, its sixth \nconsecutive year as auditor, having first \nbeen appointed for the financial year ended \n31 December 2017, following a competitive \ntender carried out in 2015.

Pre-approved audit and \naudit‑related services below the clearly trivial \nthreshold (within the overall annual fee limit) \nare subject to case-by-case approval by the \nSVP Finance, Group Controller & Head of \nGlobal Finance Services.\nPre-approved audit services included services \nin respect of the annual financial statement \naudit (including quarterly and half-year \nreviews), attestation opinion under section \n404 of the SOx, statutory audits for subsidiary \nentities, and other procedures to be performed \nby the independent auditor in order to form an \nopinion on the Group’s consolidated Financial \nStatements. The pre-approved audit-related \nservices, which the Committee believes are \nservices reasonably related to the \nperformance of the audit or review of the \nCompany’s Financial Statements, included \ncertain services required by law or regulation, \nsuch as financial statement audits of \nemployee benefit plans and capital market \ntransactions. The Policy prohibits any tax \nservices. Audit-related services included \nthe assurance in relation to tax regulatory \ncertificates required to be issued by the \nexternal auditor.\nThe CFO (supported by the SVP Finance, \nGroup Controller & Head of Global Financial \nServices), monitors the status of all services \nbeing provided by the external auditor. \nAuthority to approve work exceeding the \npre-agreed annual fee limits and for any \nindividual service above the clearly trivial \nthreshold is delegated to the Chair of the \nCommittee together with one other \nCommittee member in the first instance. \nA standing agenda item at Committee \nmeetings covers the operation of the \npre-approval procedures and regular \nreports are provided to the full Committee.\nAll services other than the pre-approved audit \nand audit-related services, require approval \nby the Committee on a case-by-case basis. \nIn 2022, PwC provided audit services \nincluding interim reviews of the results of the \nGroup for the period ended 30 June 2022 and \naudit-related and other assurance services. \n \nThe increase to the statutory audit fee for \n2022 is largely driven by inflationary increases, \nfees for additional audit procedures in relation \nto ISA 315 (Revised) and Alexion’s inclusion \ninto SOx scope and full year audit, offset by \nthe removal of non-recurring 2021 audit fees \nover the Alexion acquisition. The decrease to \naudit-related and other assurance services \nis largely driven by $6 million of services \nprovided in 2021 related to the acquisition \nof Alexion and related debt issuance.\n \nFees for audit-related and other assurance \nservices amounted to 4% of the fees payable \nto PwC for audit services in 2022 (2021: 27%). \nThe Committee is mindful of the 70% \nnon-audit services fee cap under EU \nregulation, together with the overall proportion \nof fees for audit and audit-related services in \ndetermining whether to pre-approve such \nservices. Fees for audit-related and other \nassurance services payable to PwC in 2022 \nwere 6% (2021: 34%) of average audit fees \nover 2019 to 2021. The 2021 percentages \nare higher due to the additional audit fee \nand other services required in respect of \nthe Alexion acquisition and associated \ndebt issuance.\nPwC were better placed than any alternative \nprovider to provide these services in terms of \ntheir familiarity with the Company’s business, \nskills, capability and efficiency with which they \ncould deliver the relevant services. All such \nservices were either within the scope of the \npre-approved services set out in the Policy or \nwere presented to Committee members for \npre-approval and all such services were \npermitted by the FRC Ethical Standard.\n$29.3m\n$34.9m\n2022\n2021\nStatutory audit fee¹\nAudit-related and other assurance services²\nAudit/audit-related and other assurance services\n1\t\n\u00072021 statutory audit fee excludes $0.3 million in relation to \npre-acquisition Alexion audit fees, recognised in Note 31 \nto the Financial Statements on page 198.\n2\t\n\u00072021 audit-related and other assurance services excludes \n$0.7 million in relation to pre-acquisition Alexion \nservices, recognised in Note 31 to the Financial \nStatements on page 198.\nAssessing external audit effectiveness\nIn accordance with its normal practice, \nthe Committee considered the performance \nof PwC and its compliance with the \nindependence criteria under the relevant \nstatutory, regulatory, and ethical standards \napplicable to auditors. The Committee \nassessed PwC’s effectiveness principally \nagainst four key factors, namely: judgement; \nmindset and culture; skills, character and \nknowledge; and quality control. As part of that \nassessment, it also took account of the views \nof senior management within the Finance \nfunction and regular Committee attendees. \nAs part of the Audit Committee’s assessment \nof the quality of the audit, the Committee \nfocused on the auditor’s effective use of \nexperts and technology as well as appropriate \nchallenge of management’s judgements \nespecially in relation to areas of significant \nfinancial reporting issues (as described in the \ntable from page 100). Areas that were \nreviewed by the Committee included PwC’s \nextensive and detailed review of the valuations \nand assumptions in the Alexion Legal Entity \nRestructuring, assumptions and calculations \nover Gross to Net Sales, and challenges to \ndiscount rates that underpin Intangible assets \nand Contingent consideration valuations. \nThe Committee also reviewed PwC’s use of \nautomated revenue testing on a pilot basis \nin the year.\nThe Committee concluded that the PwC audit \nwas effective for the financial year ended \n31 December 2022. In February 2023, the \nCommittee recommended to the Board the \nreappointment of PwC as the Company’s \nauditor for the financial year ending \n31 December 2023. Accordingly, a resolution \nto reappoint PwC as auditor will be put to \nshareholders at the Company’s AGM in \nApril 2023.\nThe external audit will be put out to tender in \nor before the 2027 financial year, in order to \ncomply with UK legal requirements regarding \nthe auditor’s tenure and audit tendering. The \nCommittee reviews the effectiveness of PwC \nas the external auditor on an annual basis and \nmay choose to commence a tender earlier if \nit deems this to be in the best interests of the \nCompany’s shareholders. The Committee \ndoes not believe that tendering the audit at \nthis time would be in the best interests of \nshareholders and is cognisant of the scale \nand complexity of the AstraZeneca Group, \nparticularly following the acquisition of Alexion \nin 2021. A sufficiently long transition period \nwould be required to ensure a new auditor \nbuilt up the necessary knowledge and \nbusiness familiarity to ensure the delivery of \nan effective audit and consequently any plans \nto tender the external audit should allow time \nfor an orderly transition.\nRegulation\nThe Committee considers that the Company \nhas complied with the Competition and \nMarkets Authority’s Statutory Audit Services \nfor Large Companies Market Investigation \n(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender \nProcesses and Audit Committee \nResponsibilities) Order 2014 in respect of its \nfinancial year commencing 1 January 2022. \n103\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nCorporate Governance\nAdditional Information\nFinancial Statements\nStrategic Report\nAudit Committee Report"

      "text": "We set stretching targets that incentivise our leaders to deliver exceptional performance, and to drive sustainable results for our patients, \nour employees and our shareholders. \n2023 targets:\n\t\n> The Committee has reviewed the proposed targets against internal and external forecasts, including market consensus, and is comfortable \nthat the level of stretch promotes exceptional performance. \n\t\n> In real terms, financial performance goals under the 2023 Group Scorecard and PSP would require achievement above prior year outturns \nand growth in excess of the average expected of the industry. \nConsistent with our approach in prior years we undertake the following robust process to setting annual bonus and PSP targets and \nassessing outcomes:\nStage 1 – \nTarget setting\nScience targets are based on a cohort of scientific opportunities \nspecified at the start of the performance period. Opportunities \nrepresent potential achievements through the pipeline, from an \nearly stage where our scientists work to discover new molecules, \nthrough to ultimately obtaining approvals and getting new \nmedicines to patients. Rewarding success at each stage \nrecognises the importance of creating and maintaining a \nlong-term sustainable pipeline. Stretch of proposed targets is \nreviewed by the Science Committee taking into account factors \nsuch as the expected net present value of the pipeline and the \nanticipated financial contribution it will make, past performance, \nthe external regulatory environment, and internal resourcing \nand efficiencies. Targets for realisation of these opportunities \nare ambitious.\nProposed targets for the Ambition Zero Carbon measure are \nreviewed and endorsed by the Sustainability Committee.\nGrowth and Therapy Area Leadership and Achieve Group \nFinancial Targets metrics align with the Company’s Mid-Term \nPlan (MTP), which sets out the financial framework for delivering \nour ambitious strategy over a three-year period. The MTP \nprocess includes detailed business reviews, during which plans \nand efficiencies of each unit are challenged, leading to a \nproposed MTP for the Board to review and challenge. The \nCommittee sets targets based on the Board‑approved MTP, \nconsidering consensus expectations, independent analytics \nand anticipated challenges and opportunities. Whilst Total \nRevenue and Core EPS targets are set at budget exchange \nrates at the beginning of the performance period and evaluated \nat those rates at the end of the performance period (so that any \nbeneficial or adverse movements in currency do not impact \nreward outcomes), the Committee also compares targets \nagainst prior plans at constant exchange rates, to ensure that \nnew targets incentivise ambitious levels of growth. This range \nof data is used by the Committee to ensure the stretching \nnature of performance targets is robustly tested. Additionally, \nthe PSP TSR measure is designed to reward strong \nperformance relative to our peers.\nStage 2 – \nCommittee review \nand approval of \ntargets\nThe Committee thoroughly reviews and challenges targets \nproposed by management.\nThe Committee is provided with considerable supporting \nmaterial for each metric and receives briefings from senior \nleaders across AstraZeneca. The science measures are \nreviewed and endorsed by the Science Committee, with a focus \non ensuring that the targets will result in long-term sustainable \nvalue creation, and the Committee reviews and approves the full \ncohort of opportunities. The ESG metric within the PSP is aligned \nto our Ambition Zero Carbon goal and reflects the importance \nof eliminating GHG emissions for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 \noperations by 2025. The Ambition Zero Carbon metric has been \nreviewed and endorsed by our Sustainability Committee.\nCommittee members participate in the full Board discussions \non the strategy, MTP and budget, which form the basis for the \ntargets. The Committee considers how proposed financial \ntargets align with the MTP and budget; prior years’ outcomes \n(in absolute terms and against target); how the ambition has \nchanged from the prior MTP and budget; external guidance \nthe Company has provided or plans to give; consensus from \nexternal financial analysts and factors it may be impacted by; \nand the underlying assumptions. Statistical analysis conducted \nby the Committee’s independent adviser is also used to assess \nthe proposals. This includes an assessment of historical levels \nof performance volatility.\nStage 3 – \nPerformance \nassessment\nAt the end of the period, final performance against each metric \nis assessed. Outcomes are calculated based on performance \nagainst each weighted metric. Each performance measure is \nassessed on a standalone basis, so that underperformance \nagainst one measure cannot be compensated for by \noverperformance against another. Data for the metrics is taken \nfrom the Group’s financial reports which are reviewed by the \nAudit Committee and approved by the Board.\nThe Science Committee independently considers and informs \nthe Committee whether science achievements represent a fair \nand balanced outcome, reflecting genuine achievements and \npipeline progression. Ambition Zero Carbon outcomes are \nvalidated by the Sustainability Committee. Apart from Cash \nflow, which is set at actual rates of exchange, financial metrics \nare set at budget rates of exchange and evaluated at those \nrates at year end, which means they are not directly comparable \nyear-on-year. The Committee is, however, provided with data to \nallow it to conduct year-on-year analyses.\nStage 4 – \nDetermination of \nExecutive Directors’ \nbonuses\nFor annual bonus, the fairness of the formulaic Group scorecard \noutcome is considered in the context of overall business \nperformance and the experience of shareholders. Such \nconsiderations include TSR performance and each Executive \nDirector’s personal impact on the delivery of the strategy, wider \nESG performance and other organisational achievements, such \nas inclusion and diversity targets and the realisation of \ntechnology‑based milestones. Each year, there are important \nindividual deliverables beyond the scorecard metrics which are \ntaken into account when determining individual bonuses.\nHaving considered the Group scorecard outcome, overall \nbusiness performance, the experience of shareholders and \nindividual performance, as detailed from page 115, the Committee \ncarefully determines a final bonus outcome for each Executive \nDirector that is considered fair and appropriate for the year’s \nperformance, and is in the best interests of shareholders.\n110\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nCorporate Governance\nHow the Remuneration Committee \nensures targets are stretching"

      "text": "Annual bonus continued\nIn 2022, the Growth and Therapy Area Leadership measure was based on Total Revenue. The Total Revenue and Core EPS measures are both \nset and evaluated at budget exchange rates at the beginning of the year and evaluated at those rates at the end of the performance period, so \nthat any beneficial or adverse movements in currency, which are outside the Company’s control, do not impact reward outcomes. The Cash flow \nmeasure is set and evaluated at the actual exchange rate and is evaluated by reference to net cash flow from operating activities less capital \nexpenditure, adding back proceeds from disposal of intangible assets, to be fully transparent with all elements easily derived from the Group IFRS \ncash flow statement. \nOverall assessment\nDuring 2022, the Executive Directors’ individual performance was assessed in the following key areas which align with the Company’s objectives. \nPascal Soriot\nMr Soriot has led AstraZeneca to an outstanding year of double-digit growth across all therapy areas through 2022, with our pipeline delivery now being \nrecognised as being amongst the strongest in the industry. The Committee considered Mr Soriot’s deep involvement and incisive leadership in delivering \nAstraZeneca’s financial and scientific performance in the context of his delivery against his personal objectives and Total Shareholder Return of 32% for 2022, \nset out below. \nDemonstrating \nleadership to support \ndevelopments in global \nlife sciences\nIn 2022, Mr Soriot continued to demonstrate his thought leadership, his ability to drive global change and his influence on key issues \nin healthcare through more than 20 external engagements with world leaders in the US, Asia, the Middle East and Europe.\nHighlights included attending COP27, AstraZeneca’s award for Outstanding Achievement for Service to Cancer Science and Medicine \nat the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Award ceremony and engagements with Chinese government officials on a \nvariety of topics, including a new state-of-the-art rare disease centre in China. \nLeading in \nEnvironmental, Social & \nGovernance (ESG) \nperformance\nMr Soriot continued to drive an ambitious sustainability agenda at AstraZeneca and through industry partnerships, exemplified by \nhis leadership of the cross-healthcare sector SMI Health Systems task force with HM King Charles III, aimed at the decarbonisation \nof healthcare. For the seventh year, we were double A listed on the CDP for both climate change and water security and, in 2022, \nAstraZeneca formed the Honeywell collaboration to develop next generation respiratory inhalers with up to 99.9% less global warming \npotential than propellants currently used in respiratory medicines.\nIn recognition of his leadership of AstraZeneca’s equitable access approach to COVID-19, Mr Soriot was the only private sector CEO \ninvited to deliver a high-level address at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Notably, an independent assessment by Airfinity \nLimited identified that Vaxzevria saved 6.3 million lives in the first year of its delivery, more than any other COVID-19 vaccine.\nMr Soriot ensured that the impact of AstraZeneca’s access to healthcare programmes continue to expand. In 2022, Healthy Heart \nAfrica (HHA) launched into Rwanda, Nigeria and Zanzibar. HHA has now conducted over 31 million screenings, trained over 10,500 \nhealthcare workers, activated over 1,250 healthcare facilities and identified over 6.2 million elevated blood pressure readings. Progress \non equitable healthcare initiatives overseen by Mr Soriot is also reflected in the increase in AstraZeneca’s position on the Access to \nMedicines Index (from seventh in 2021 to third in 2022).\nMaking AstraZeneca a \ngreat place to work \nMr Soriot continues in his role as Chair of the Global I&D council. In 2022, he oversaw the launch of the refreshed Global Inclusion & \nDiversity (I&D) strategy. Our progress was recognised externally, with AstraZeneca being included on the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-\nEquality Index, FTSE Women Leaders Review 2022, Human Rights Corporation Corporate Equality Index, the Forbes World’s Best \nEmployers 2022 and Forbes Top Female Friendly Companies 2022, the Financial Times Diversity Leaders 2023 (EU), 2022 Best Places \nto Work for LGBTQ Equality (US) and Diversity Inc. and 2022 Top 50 Companies for Diversity List (US).\nMr Soriot oversaw the further development of AstraZeneca’s culture of lifelong learning in 2022. 78% of our employees participated \nin our online learning platform, Degreed, completing approximately 1.22 million learning modules and 20 academies were launched in \n55 markets to ensure our employees remain at the forefront of innovation in their respective areas. We expanded ‘Professional Skills at AZ’ \ninto 14 languages along with extending Percipio, our immersive learning platform, to everyone in Degreed. We were proud that AstraZeneca \nreceived external recognition for AstraZeneca’s Learning & Development programmes in the form of 11 independent awards.\nUnder Mr Soriot’s leadership, in 2022 AstraZeneca launched ‘AZ Together’, the new global employee support fund. The fund provides \na simple, easy and secure way for all employees to make personal donations to financially support colleagues experiencing personal \nhardship or who have been affected by extreme events, such as a natural disaster.\n115\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nDirectors’ Remuneration Report  /  Annual Report on Remuneration\nCorporate Governance\nAdditional Information\nFinancial Statements\nStrategic Report"

As part of this committee, she has \napproved several investments in AstraZeneca’s sustainability initiatives which have helped the Company make progress on its \ncommitment to becoming zero carbon across operations without carbon credits. In order to ensure growth and development in this \narea, Dr Sarin has focused on sharing external perspectives from guest speakers in various forums, supporting the Company to reach \nits ambition to be carbon negative in the AstraZeneca value chain by 2030.\nDr Sarin’s commitment to AstraZeneca’s mission for science and patients was recognised externally by her being honoured by a patient \norganisation (Share the Joy Foundation) for ‘Seeing the Unseen’. She also recently joined the Board of Directors/Governors for the \nAmerican Red Cross, the largest non-profit organisation in the US. \nGreat place to work/ \nemployee engagement\nDr Sarin has undertaken a number of initiatives to increase diversity in the workplace and has advocated for women leaders in senior \npositions. She has also been involved in hosting many Network of Women employee resource group events in major AstraZeneca sites \nacross the globe. \nDr Sarin’s leadership and collaborative way of working is evidenced in the positive engagement of her teams, with 92% of Global \nFinance believing AstraZeneca is truly patient orientated, 89% believing they have improved their existing skills or learned new skills, \nand 88% believing AstraZeneca is a great place to work. \nCreating an enterprise-\nwide impact through \nGlobal Business \nServices (GBS)\nUnder Dr Sarin’s leadership, GBS has contributed to shaping a more effective and efficient AstraZeneca by optimising processes and \nrealising an 8% increase in productivity, the equivalent to freeing up 125,000 hours of work across AstraZeneca. GBS is an essential \npartner to the business, enabling AstraZeneca to grow and change at speed.\nOver 2022, GBS has supported Commercial to set up the new omnichannel delivery model, resulting in a 40% cost reduction and \n30-50% reduction in delivery times for campaigns in Spain, Canada and Italy. Development of advanced reporting and analytics has \ncontributed to generating $40 million in benefits helping the business to make faster and better decisions. \nGBS has scaled automation solutions with more than 150 robots helping the business to save more than 150,000 hours, and has \ncompleted the automation of the clinical end-of-study process which reduced the process lead time by 95% and saved $2 million, \nwhich has been reinvested in R&D’s transformation programme, Redefining Clinical Data Flow.\nFinal determination of Executive Directors’ bonuses\nIn determining the annual bonus outturn for Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee considers the formulaic Group scorecard \noutcome, as well as the overall business performance, shareholder experience and the personal contribution of the individual Executive. \nA description of the Executive Directors’ personal achievements is detailed above. \nThe Committee determined the bonus outturns for Mr Soriot and Dr Sarin should be 183% of target (or 92% of maximum).\nDeferred Bonus Plan\nA proportion of each Executive Director’s pre-tax annual bonus is compulsorily deferred under the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP). In respect of \nthe bonus deferred, the Executive Director is granted a conditional award over shares. No further performance conditions apply to DBP shares, \nbut release at the end of the three-year deferral period is ordinarily subject to continued employment. One half of the bonus earned in respect of \nperformance during 2021 was deferred and details of the consequent DBP awards granted in 2022 are shown below.

Fees for the \nNon-Executive Directors (other than the Chair of the Board) are determined by the Chair and the Executive Directors. The fee structure is \nreviewed, but not necessarily increased every two years. Non-Executive Directors’ fees were last changed in January 2022 with increases to \nthe basic Board fee for Non-Executive Directors, the Senior independent Non-Executive Director’s fee, and fees for membership of the Audit \nCommittee and the Remuneration Committee.\nIn July 2022, it was announced that effective 1 May 2023 the fee for the Chair of the Board would be increased to £800,000 per annum. From \n1 May 2023, no additional payments will be made to the Chair to reimburse office costs. Prior to this, the Chair’s fee was last increased in January \n2018. The Chair-designate did not participate in any decision relating to his own fee. The revised fee reflects the steady increase in workload and \nresponsibilities of the Chair since the last fee increase took effect in 2018, as well as the increase in the size and complexity of the Group following \nthe acquisition of Alexion. Market data on FTSE 10 and FTSE 30 companies’ Chair fees were also considered to ensure that the level of fee is \nappropriate. \n  Further information on the Non-Executive Directors’ fee structure can be found within the Remuneration Policy on the Company’s website, www.astrazeneca.com.\nNon-Executive Director fees\n2022\n£’000 \n2023\n£’000\nChair of the Board1\n625\n8002\nBasic Non-Executive Director\n95\n95\nSenior independent Non-Executive Director\n40\n40\nMember of the Audit Committee\n25\n25\nChair of the Audit Committee3\n45\n45\nMember of the Remuneration Committee\n20\n20\nChair of the Remuneration Committee3\n40\n40\nMember of the Sustainability Committee\n15\n15\nChair of the Sustainability Committee3\n30\n30\nMember of the Science Committee\n15\n15\nChair of the Science Committee3\n30\n30\n1\t The Chair of the Board does not receive any additional fees for chairing, or being a member of, a Committee.\n2\t The fee for the Chair of the Board will increase to £800,000 per annum with effect from 1 May 2023, as announced in July 2022.\n3\t The Committee Chairs do not receive additional fees for being a member of the Committee.\nAudited\nNon-Executive Directors’ remuneration\n120\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nCorporate Governance\nAnnual Report \non Remuneration \ncontinued"

The MSR for 2022 are set out below.

None of the Directors has a beneficial interest in the shares of any of the Company’s subsidiaries. \nBetween 31 December 2022 and 9 February 2023, there was no change in the interests in Ordinary Shares for current Directors shown in the \ntables on pages 121 to 122.\nPayments to former Directors\nMarc Dunoyer was granted a PSP award in 2020, whilst CFO and Executive Director of AstraZeneca PLC. Mr Dunoyer stepped down as an \nExecutive Director on 1 August 2021, part way through the 2020 PSP performance period, but remained a member of the SET. Consistent with \nother participants in the PSP, performance over the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022 will result in 97% of Mr Dunoyer’s award granted \nin 2020 vesting on completion of a further two-year holding period. This represents 21,246 shares vesting when pro-rated to reflect the \nperformance period during which Mr Dunoyer was an Executive Director (1 January 2020 to 1 August 2021).\nPayments for loss of office\nDuring 2022, no payments were made to Directors for loss of office.\nRemuneration in the wider context\nIn our Corporate Governance Report on page 90, we explain in detail how the Board has chosen to engage with AstraZeneca’s workforce, \nand how important engagement with our employees is if we are to be a great place to work and continue to deliver outstanding performance. \nThe Directors believe that the Board as a whole should continue to take responsibility for gathering the views of the workforce. Consequently, \ninstead of implementing one of the three methods for workforce engagement prescribed in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board \nchose to enhance and develop the long-standing channels of engagement which already exist in the organisation to ensure that the Board \ncontinues to understand the global workforce’s views on a wide variety of topics, including matters relating to remuneration.\nThe Committee communicates with, and receives feedback from, employees through a variety of channels, including meetings with high-potential \nemployees and attending site visits, both virtually and in person. This allows the Committee to communicate with employees on remuneration \nmatters where appropriate. Remuneration Committee members review wide-ranging data on reward across our global workforce, as well as \nbroader information on workforce trends and culture, which is also provided to the full Board. The Committee receives in-depth reports \nthroughout the year on colleague pay, benefits, incentives, performance management approach and broader talent policies at AstraZeneca to \nensure that the Committee is informed of wider workforce remuneration when making executive pay decisions. Decisions of the Committee \naffecting employees, such as the annual Group scorecard outcomes, are shared with employees through internal communications as well as \nthrough the Directors’ Remuneration Report. Additionally, we publish materials on executive remuneration and its implementation for employees \non our intranet site. In the event that more significant changes to workforce remuneration are proposed, active engagement with employee \nrepresentative groups provides feedback to help the Committee understand the impact upon the broader workforce. \nWhen reviewing executive remuneration, the Committee takes into consideration our global workforce, looking to ensure the global total reward \noffering is competitive, compelling and aligned to our business performance, while supporting a culture where everyone feels valued and \nincluded, as outlined in the table on page 124. People and Sustainability is one of our three strategic priorities, and we explain in our Business \nReview from page 34 the role that reward plays in developing a diverse culture that encourages and rewards innovation, entrepreneurship and \nhigh performance. In carrying out its responsibilities and when setting the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the Committee has taken into account \nthe principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the factors outlined within Provision 40 as described in the table below. \nArea\nOur approach\nClarity\nRemuneration arrangements should be transparent and \npromote effective engagement with shareholders and \nthe workforce.\nThe Committee believes the remuneration structures under the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, \nand those for the wider workforce as set out below, are clearly understood. The Committee regularly \nengages with employees and shareholders and considers their feedback when reviewing the \nDirectors’ Remuneration Policy and implementation. \nSimplicity\nRemuneration structures should avoid complexity and their \nrationale and operation should be easy to understand.\nWe operate a simple remuneration framework for our executives across both fixed and variable pay \nwhich is, where possible, aligned with the wider workforce. The purpose, structure and strategic \nalignment of each element of pay has been clearly laid out in our Directors’ Remuneration Policy.\nRisk\nRemuneration arrangements should ensure reputational \nand other risks from excessive rewards, and behavioural \nrisks that can arise from target-based incentive plans, are \nidentified and mitigated.\nWe seek to ensure alignment with long-term shareholder interests and to mitigate any potential risk \nthrough several mechanisms within our approach to executive remuneration. These include the \ntwo-year holding period under the Performance Share Plan on vesting, 50% mandatory deferral into \nshares for three years for any annual bonus award, operation of malus and clawback provisions, \nand a shareholding requirement for two years post-cessation of employment. \nPredictability\nThe range of possible values of rewards to individual \ndirectors and any other limits or discretions should be \nidentified and explained at the time of approving the policy.\nThe Committee set out under the Directors’ Remuneration Policy approved in May 2021 the range of \npossible values under specific performance scenarios.\nProportionality\nThe link between individual awards, the delivery of strategy \nand the long-term performance of the company should be \nclear. Outcomes should not reward poor performance.\nAs set out on page 110, the Committee follows a robust target-setting and assessment process to \nensure variable pay outcomes under the annual bonus and Performance Share Plan are proportional \nto our wider performance.\nOur Directors’ Remuneration Policy operated as intended in terms of Company performance and \nquantums during 2022, supporting the delivery of our strategy and another exceptional year for \nAstraZeneca.\nAlignment to culture\nIncentive schemes should drive behaviours consistent with \ncompany purpose, values and strategy.\nThe Committee believes that the remuneration structures in place are aligned to the Company’s culture \nand values and ensure the successful delivery of our strategy, with alignment between strategy and \nreward set out on page 109. For example, alongside the formulaic outcome, our annual bonus scheme \nfor Executive Directors includes a holistic assessment of their performance and broader ESG factors, \nfurther reinforcing the importance of our Purpose and Values.\nAudited\n123\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nDirectors’ Remuneration Report  /  Annual Report on Remuneration\nCorporate Governance\nAdditional Information\nFinancial Statements\nStrategic Report"

This review \ntakes account of country budget, relevant market comparators, \nthe skills, capabilities, knowledge and experience of each \nindividual, relative to peers within the Company and individual \ncontribution.\nIn setting the budget each year, we consider affordability as well \nas assessing how employee base pay is currently positioned \nrelative to inflation, market rates, forecasts of any further market \nincreases and turnover.\nThe base pay of our Executive Directors and SET forms the basis \nof their total remuneration, and we review their base pay annually.\nThe primary purpose of the review is to ensure base pay remains \ncompetitive and reflects the contribution each individual makes to \nthe organisation.\nPensions and benefits\nWe offer market-aligned wellbeing benefit packages reflecting \nmarket practice in each country in which we operate. \nWhere appropriate, we offer elements of personal benefit choice \nto our employees.\nThe benefit packages of our Executive Directors and SET are \nbroadly aligned with the wider workforce of the country in which \nthey are employed. Pension allowances for current UK Executive \nDirectors are in line with the wider UK workforce. \nAnnual bonus\nWith the exception of our sales representatives receiving \nsales-related incentives, our global workforce participates in \nthe same annual cash bonus plan as the Executive Directors and \nSET, with the same Group scorecard performance measures \noutlined on page 114. Achievement against the scorecard creates \na bonus pool from which all awards are made. \nFor employees within our commercial organisation, the \ncountry-level share of the global bonus pool also takes into \naccount country performance against KPIs.\nIndividual outcomes are based on manager assessment of \ncontribution against individual objectives and peers.

The ratios are based on total pay, which includes base pay, benefits, bonus and long-term \nincentive (LTI) awards with all elements adjusted on a full-time equivalent basis if required. Our calculations are in line with the single figure \nmethodology for UK employees where possible, with quartile data determined as at 31 December 2022. Calculations for UK employees are based \non actual base pay and benefits data for the year, with estimates only used for annual bonus outcomes and LTI dividend equivalent payments. \nThese estimates are based on the 2022 bonus budget and projected payouts, and anticipated dividends on LTI awards, respectively. No elements \nof pay have been excluded from the calculation, which has been determined following the approach of previous years.\nCEO\nUK employees\n25th percentile\n50th percentile\n75th percentile\nPay data1 (£’000)\nBase pay\nTotal pay\nBase pay\nTotal pay\nBase pay\nTotal pay\nBase pay\nTotal pay\n2022\n1,367\n15,323\n48\n67\n67\n96\n88\n143\n2021\n1,327\n13,858\n43\n58\n61\n86\n86\n130\n2020\n1,289\n15,447\n41\n54\n60\n78\n82\n119\n2019\n1,289\n14,330\n38\n51\n53\n75\n71\n117\n2018\n1,251\n11,356\n36\n49\n50\n71\n70\n110\n1\t The prior years’ figures have not been restated for subsequent share price changes (as shown in the CEO realised pay for 2022 table on page 111).\nDespite increased CEO realised pay in 2022, primarily driven by higher vesting achievement and share price appreciation under the 2020 \nPerformance Share Plan, a larger bonus budget across the wider UK employee population increased total pay year-on-year and saw pay ratios \nfall at the lower and median quartiles and remain broadly consistent at the upper quartile when compared to 2021.\nGiven the Committee’s focus on ensuring CEO pay is performance-driven, the majority of the single figure is comprised of variable pay and \ntherefore may vary significantly year-on-year due to annual bonus and PSP outcomes, as well as share price movements. The Committee \ntherefore also considers the CEO pay ratio without the LTI impact. When excluding LTI, the pay ratio of the CEO compared to the median UK \nemployee is 51:1, a fall from 57:1 in 2021 as a result of a lower CEO annual bonus award as a percentage of target this year (the ratio excluding \nLTI was 53:1 in 2020, and 51:1 in both 2018 and 2019).\nThe Committee remains mindful of the debate on executive pay and seeks to ensure that when determining the remuneration of the CEO it finds \nthe right balance when rewarding performance in a highly competitive global executive talent market. It believes the median ratio is consistent \nwith the pay and progression policies for UK employees, which ensures our total reward offering is competitive and compelling, and aligned to \nindividual and business performance as set out on page 123.\nRelative importance of spend on pay\nThe table below shows the remuneration paid to all employees in the Group, including the Executive Directors, and expenditure on shareholder \ndistributions through dividends.

For these \ncomponents our work was solely focussed on one \nor more of the following financial statement line \nitems: revenue, accounts receivable, external \nresearch and development expense, taxation and/\nor property, plant and equipment.\n\t> We also identified five shared service centres where \naudit procedures were performed over certain \nshared service functions for transaction processing. \nAudit procedures were performed centrally in \nrelation to various Group functions, including \ngoodwill, intangible assets (excluding software), \ncertain aspects of the pension obligations, certain \ncash and borrowings, taxation, other investments \nand litigation matters, as well as the consolidation.\n\t> The above procedures accounted for 80% of the \nGroup’s revenue and 83% of the Group’s absolute \nprofit before tax.\nKey audit matters\n\t> Recognition and measurement of accruals for \nManaged Care, Medicaid and Medicare Part D \nrebates on US Product Sales (excluding Rare \nDiseases) (Group)\n\t> Impairment assessment of the product, marketing \nand distribution rights and other intangibles (Group)\n\t> Recognition and measurement of legal provisions \nand disclosure of contingent liabilities (Group)\n\t> Recognition, measurement and disclosure of tax \nliabilities for uncertain tax treatments (Group)\n\t> Valuation of defined benefit obligations (in the UK \nand Sweden) (Group)\n\t> Distributable reserves in the Company (Parent)\nMateriality\n\t> Overall Group materiality: $400m (2021: $250m) \nbased on 5% of profit before tax after adding back \nintangible asset impairment charges (Note 10), fair \nvalue movements and discount unwind on \ncontingent consideration (Note 20), the discount \nunwind on the Acerta Pharma share purchase \nliability (Note 3), material legal settlements (Note 21) \nthe unwind of the fair value adjustment to Alexion \ninventories (Note 2) and restructuring charges \nrelating to the Post Alexion Acquisition Group \nReview (Note 2).\n\t> Overall Company materiality: $100m (2021: $100m) \nbased on approximately 0.5% of net assets as \nconstrained by the allocation of overall Group \nmateriality.\n\t> Performance materiality: $300m (2021: $187.5m) \n(Group) and $75m (2021: $75m) (Company).\nThe scope of our audit\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined \nmateriality and assessed the risks of material \nmisstatement in the financial statements.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in the \nauditors’ professional judgement, were of most \nsignificance in the audit of the financial statements \nof the current period and include the most significant \nassessed risks of material misstatement (whether or \nnot due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including \nthose which had the greatest effect on: the overall \naudit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; \nand directing the efforts of the engagement team. \nThese matters, and any comments we make on the \nresults of our procedures thereon, were addressed in \nthe context of our audit of the financial statements as \na whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we \ndo not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nThis is not a complete list of all risks identified by \nour audit.\nDistributable reserves in the Company (Parent) is a \nnew key audit matter this year. The following key \naudit matters from the prior year are no longer \nincluded: Accounting for the acquisition of Alexion \nPharmaceuticals, Inc (Group) as the Alexion purchase \naccounting was concluded in 2021; Accounting for \nsales, grant income and deferred income relating to \nVaxzevria (Group) as Vaxzevria was no longer a focus \narea; and Recognition and measurement of legal \nprovisions and contingent liabilities in the Parent \nCompany (Parent) as the Parent Company legal \nmatters have been resolved. Otherwise, the key \naudit matters below are consistent with last year.\nFinancial Statements / Independent auditors’ report to the members of AstraZeneca PLC\nIndependent auditors’ report to  \nthe members of AstraZeneca PLC"

At the time Product Sales are invoiced, rebates \nand deductions that the Group expects to pay, are estimated. There is significant \nmanagement estimation in determining the accruals in the US. Assumptions \nused to estimate the rebates are monitored and adjusted regularly in light of \ncontractual and legal obligations, historical trends, past experience and \nprojected market conditions.\nThe US Rebates, chargebacks, returns and other revenue accruals liability \n(excluding Rare Diseases) at 31 December 2022 amounted to $3,822m (2021: \n$3,045m), principally consisting of rebates related to Managed Care, Medicaid \nand Medicare Part D. \nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls \nrelating to the recognition and measurement of the accruals for the Managed \nCare, Medicaid and Medicare Part D. We determined that we could rely on these \ncontrols for the purposes of our audit.\nWe: \n\t\n> developed an independent estimate of the Managed Care, Medicaid and \nMedicare Part D accruals using the terms of the specific rebate programmes \nand/or contracts with customers, historical revenue data; market demand and \nmarket conditions in the US; third party information on inventory held by direct \nand indirect customers; and the historical trend of actual rebate claims paid; \n\t\n> compared our independent estimates to the accruals recorded by \nmanagement; \n\t\n> assessed the effect of any adjustments to prior years’ accruals in the current \nyear’s results; and \n\t\n> tested actual payments made and rebate claims processed by the Group, and \nevaluated those claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated \nterms of the Group’s arrangements.\nBased on the procedures performed, we considered the accruals to be \nreasonable.\nWe also evaluated the disclosures in Notes 1 and 20 of the Group financial \nstatements, which we considered appropriate.\nImpairment assessment of the product, marketing and distribution rights \nand other intangibles (Group) \nRefer to the Audit Committee Report, Group Accounting Policies and Note 10 \nin the Group financial statements.\nThe Group has product, marketing and distribution rights and other intangible \nassets (hereafter referred to as the intangible assets) totalling $38,890m at 31 \nDecember 2022 (2021: $42,062m). Those intangible assets under development \nand not available for use are tested annually for impairment and other intangible \nassets are tested when there is an indication of impairment loss or reversal.\nThe recoverability of the carrying value of cash generating units (to which the \nintangible assets belong) depends on future cash flows and/or the outcome of \nresearch and development (‘R&D’) activities including decisions by the Group to \nterminate development. The determination of the recoverable amounts include \nsignificant estimates, which are highly sensitive and depend upon key \nassumptions including the outcome of R&D activities, probability of technical \nand regulatory success, market volume, share and pricing (to derive peak year \nsales), the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and sales erosion \ncurves following patent expiry. Changes in these assumptions could have an \nimpact on the recoverable amount of intangible assets.\nDuring 2022, $241m (2021: $2,067m) of net impairment charges were recorded.\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over \nmanagement’s assessment of the impairment of intangible assets. We \ndetermined that we could rely on these controls for the purposes of our audit.\nFor those assets or cash generating units in the scope of our audit we: \n\t\n> tested management’s process for assessing whether there is an indication \nof impairment and the process for determining the recoverable amount; \n\t\n> tested the completeness and accuracy of the models as well as the underlying \ndata used in the models, which included reconciling the cash flows to the \nBoard approved Group level budgets and forecasts; and\n\t\n> evaluated the significant assumptions used by management in determining \nfuture cash flows, including the probability of technical and regulatory \nsuccess, peak year sales and sales erosion curves. \nIn evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions we:\n\t\n> compared significant assumptions to external data and benchmarks; and \n\t\n> performed a retrospective comparison of forecasted revenues and costs to \nactual past performance.\nWe utilised our in-house valuation experts to assist with the evaluation of the \nprobability of technical and regulatory success.\nBased on the procedures performed, we determined that the net impairment \ncharge of $241m recorded for intangible assets was reasonable. We considered \nthe disclosures in Note 10 of the Group financial statements. We are satisfied \nthat these disclosures are appropriate.\nRecognition and measurement of legal provisions and disclosure of \ncontingent liabilities (Group)\nRefer to the Audit Committee Report, Group Accounting Policies, Notes 21 and \n30 in the Group financial statements.\nThe Group is involved in various legal proceedings, including actual or \nthreatened litigation and actual or potential government investigations relating to \nemployment matters, product liability, commercial disputes, pricing, sales and \nmarketing practices, infringement of IP rights and the validity of certain patents \nand competition laws. As at 31 December 2022 the Group held provisions of \n$161m (2021: $239m) in respect of legal claims and settlements (together, legal \nprovisions) and disclosed the more significant legal proceedings as contingent \nliabilities in Note 30.\nThere is significant judgement by management when assessing the timing and \nlikelihood of loss being incurred and whether a legal provision can be reasonably \nestimated and recorded or a contingent liability disclosed. Management’s \nassessment of the amounts concerned relies heavily on estimates and \nassumptions. \nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls in \nrespect of the recognition and measurement of legal proceedings and related \ndisclosures. We determined that we could rely on these controls for the \npurposes of our audit.\nWe enquired of internal legal counsel and where appropriate external legal \ncounsel. We obtained and evaluated letters of audit inquiry with the Group’s \ninternal and external legal counsel for significant litigation. We have inspected \ncertain external legal documents. We tested the completeness of management’s \nassessment of both the identification of legal proceedings and possible \noutcomes of each significant legal claim. We evaluated the reasonableness of \nmanagement’s assessment regarding whether an adverse outcome is probable \nand estimated reliably.\nWe evaluated management’s judgement regarding the proceedings set out as \ncontingent liabilities within Note 30 and that for one matter management was \nunable to estimate the possible loss or range of possible losses at this stage. \nBased on the procedures performed, for the provisions recorded and contingent \nliabilities disclosed, we considered them to be reasonable.

We \ndetermined that we could rely on these controls for the purposes of our audit.\nWe tested the completeness of management’s assessment of the identification \nof tax liabilities and evaluated the management’s process for estimating the \npossible outcomes of each tax liability. We obtained the status and results of tax \naudits and discussions with the relevant tax authorities. With the assistance of \nour local and international tax specialists, we:\n\t\n> evaluated management’s assessment of the technical merits of tax treatments \n(including where relevant evaluating any advice received from the Group’s \nexternal advisors) and estimates of the amount of tax benefit expected to be \nsustained;\n\t\n> tested the completeness and accuracy of the information used in the \ndetermination of the probability of different outcomes for uncertain tax \ntreatments and the estimation of the liability for those tax treatments; and \n\t\n> evaluated the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to the \noutcome of tax audits and assumptions relating to the most likely amount \nor expected value depending on the resolution of the uncertainty. \nBased on the procedures performed, we considered the tax liabilities to be \nreasonable. We considered the disclosures in Note 30 of the Group financial \nstatements including in respect of the additional liabilities where the possibility \nof additional liabilities falling due is more than remote. We are satisfied that these \ndisclosures are appropriate.\nValuation of defined benefit obligations in the UK and Sweden (Group)\nRefer to the Audit Committee Report, Group Accounting Policies and Note 22 \nin the Group financial statements.\nThe Group has defined benefit obligations of $8,108m at 31 December 2022 \n(2021: $13,018m), which is significant in the context of the overall balance sheet. \nThe Group’s most significant schemes are in the UK and Sweden, which \ncomprise 72% of the Group’s defined benefit obligations.\nThe valuation of pension plan obligations requires significant estimation in \ndetermining appropriate assumptions such as mortality (for the UK scheme \nonly), discount rates and inflation levels (for both the UK and Sweden schemes). \nMovements in these assumptions can have a material impact on the \ndetermination of the defined benefit obligations. Management uses external \nactuaries to assist in determining the assumptions.\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls in \nrespect of the assumptions used and accuracy of the Group’s most significant \ndefined benefit obligations. We determined that we could rely on these controls \nfor the purposes of our audit.\nWe used actuarial experts to assess whether the assumptions used in \ncalculating the defined benefit obligations for the UK and Sweden were \nreasonable. Our actuarial experts assisted in developing an independent \nexpectation of the defined benefit obligations for the UK and Sweden. Our \nexperts evaluated whether the mortality assumptions (UK scheme only) and the \ndiscount rates and inflation rates (for both the UK and Sweden schemes) were: \n\t\n> consistent with the specifics of each plan and where relevant considering \nnational information; \n\t\n> consistent with independently developed estimates; and \n\t\n> in line with other companies’ recent external reporting. \nWe evaluated the calculations prepared by management’s external actuaries \nwhich included testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. \nIn order to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimate, our experts \nalso compared the independent estimate to management’s estimate.\nBased on the procedures performed, we considered management’s key \nassumptions to be within reasonable ranges.\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures in Note 22 of the \nGroup financial statements and considered them to be reasonable.\nFinancial Statements / Independent auditors’ report to the members of AstraZeneca PLC"

Where \nthe work was performed by component auditors, we \ndetermined the level of involvement we needed to have \nin the audit work in these territories to be able to \nconclude whether sufficient appropriate audit \nevidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion \non the Group financial statements as a whole.\nThe Group operates in over 100 countries and the size \nof operations within each territory varies. We identified \n13 reporting components which required a full scope \naudit of their complete financial information, either due \nto their size or risk characteristics. These components \nare the principal operating units in the US (two \ncomponents), UK, Sweden, China (two components), \nJapan, France, Germany, South Korea, Thailand as \nwell as the Company and the AstraZeneca Treasury \nfunction.\nWe also identified a further nine reporting components \nwhich had one or more individual balances that were \nconsidered significant to the Group’s financial \nstatements. For these components our work was \nsolely focussed on the audit of one or more of the \nfollowing financial statement line items: revenue, \naccounts receivable, external research and \ndevelopment expense, taxation and/or property, \nplant and equipment. We also identified five shared \nservice centres where audit procedures were \nperformed over certain shared service functions for \ntransaction processing.\nFinancial statements – Group\nFinancial statements – Company\nOverall materiality\n$400m (2021: $250m).\n$100m (2021: $100m).\nHow we determined it\n5% of profit before tax after adding back intangible asset impairment charges \n(Note 10), fair value movements and discount unwind on contingent consideration \n(Note 20), the discount unwind on the Acerta Pharma share purchase liability \n(Note 3), material legal settlements (Note 21) the unwind of the fair value \nadjustment to Alexion inventories (Note 2) and restructuring charges relating \nto the Post Alexion Acquisition Group Review (Note 2).\nApproximately 0.5% of net assets as constrained \nby the allocation of overall Group materiality.\nRationale for \nbenchmark applied\nThe reported profit of the Group can fluctuate due to intangible asset impairment \ncharges, fair value and discount unwind movements on contingent considerations, \nthe discount unwind on the Acerta Pharma share purchase liability, material legal \nsettlements, the unwind of the fair value adjustment to Alexion inventories and the \nrestructuring costs resulting from the Post Alexion Acquisition Group Review. \nThese amounts are prone to year on year volatility and are not necessarily \nreflective of the operating performance of the Group and as such they have been \nexcluded from the benchmark amount. Our approach and relevant adjustments \nare consistent with the prior year.\nWe have considered the nature of the business of \nAstraZeneca PLC (being a holding company for \ninvestment activities) and have determined that net \nassets are an appropriate basis for the calculation \nof the overall materiality level.\nFor each component in the scope of our Group audit, \nwe allocated a materiality that is less than our overall \nGroup materiality. The range of materiality allocated \nacross components was between $20m and $200m. \nWe use performance materiality to reduce to an \nappropriately low level the probability that the \naggregate of uncorrected and undetected \nmisstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, \nwe use performance materiality in determining the \nscope of our audit and the nature and extent of our \ntesting of account balances, classes of transactions \nand disclosures, for example in determining sample \nsizes. Our performance materiality was 75% (2021: \n75%) of overall materiality, amounting to $300m (2021: \n$187.5m) for the Group financial statements and $75m \n(2021: $75m) for the Company financial statements.\nIn determining the performance materiality, we \nconsidered a number of factors – the history of \nmisstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk \nand the effectiveness of controls – and concluded that \nan amount at the upper end of our normal range was \nappropriate.\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would \nreport to them misstatements identified during our \naudit above $20m (Group audit) (2021: $12.5m) and \n$20m (Company audit) (2021: $12.5m) as well as \nmisstatements below those amounts that, in our view, \nwarranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\nAudit procedures were performed centrally in relation \nto various Group areas, including goodwill, intangible \nassets (excluding software), certain aspects of the \npension obligations, certain cash and borrowings, \ntaxation, other investments and litigation matters, as \nwell as the consolidation. Our Group engagement \nteam’s involvement in the audits of the reporting \ncomponents was performed through a combination of \nin person site visits and virtual meetings and tools and \nincluded regular meetings with component auditors, \nreviews of the component auditors’ planned response \nto significant risks, the review of auditor working \npapers for material reporting components and the \nreview of the work performed by the component \nauditors on the sub-consolidation of Rare Diseases. \nWe attended meetings with local management \nalongside the component auditors for full scope and \nother material components.\nThe impact of climate risk on our audit\nIn planning and executing our audit, we considered \nthe potential impact of climate change on the Group’s \nbusiness and the financial statements. The Group has \nset out its intention – as part of the Ambition Zero \nCarbon programme – to achieve net-zero greenhouse \ngas emissions by maximising energy efficiency, \nshifting to renewable energy sources and investing \nin nature-based removals to compensate for any \nresidual GHG footprint.\nAs a part of our audit we made enquiries of \nmanagement to understand the extent of the potential \nimpact of the physical and transitional climate change \nrisk on the Group financial statements. We also \ndiscussed the climate change initiatives and \ncommitments from Ambition Zero Carbon and other \ninitiatives to reduce CO2 emissions, and the impact \nthese have on the Group including on future cash flow \nforecasts. This included the commitment to develop \nnext-generation respiratory inhalers with near-zero \nglobal warming potential propellants for the pMDI \ninhaled medicines portfolio.\nManagement considers that the impact of climate \nchange does not give rise to a material financial \nstatement impact. With the assistance of our climate \nchange experts, we evaluated management’s risk \nassessment and understood the Group’s governance \nprocesses including the Sustainability Committee. \nWe performed an audit risk assessment of how the \nimpact of the Group’s commitments in respect of \nclimate change including Ambition Zero Carbon may \naffect the financial statements and our audit.\nWe challenged the extent to which climate change \nconsiderations including the expected cash flows from \nthe initiatives and commitments had been reflected, \nwhere appropriate, in management’s impairment \nassessment process, going concern assessment and \nviability assessment. We found that climate change \nimpacts are included within management’s forecasts \nalthough the initiatives and commitments did not have \na material impact including on our key audit matters. \nWe assessed the consistency of other information \ndisclosed in the Annual Report with the Group \nfinancial statements, and with our knowledge \nobtained from the audit.\nMateriality\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our \napplication of materiality. We set certain quantitative \nthresholds for materiality. These, together with \nqualitative considerations, helped us to determine \nthe scope of our audit and the nature, timing and \nextent of our audit procedures on the individual \nfinancial statement line items and disclosures and \nin evaluating the effect of misstatements, both \nindividually and in aggregate on the financial \nstatements as a whole.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined \nmateriality for the financial statements as a whole as \nfollows:\nFinancial Statements / Independent auditors’ report to the members of AstraZeneca PLC"

Our additional responsibilities \nwith respect to the corporate governance statement as \nother information are described in the Reporting on \nother information section of this report.\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, \nwe have concluded that each of the following elements \nof the corporate governance statement is materially \nconsistent with the financial statements and our \nknowledge obtained during the audit, and we have \nnothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\t> the directors’ confirmation that they have carried \nout a robust assessment of the emerging and \nprincipal risks;\n\t> the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe \nthose principal risks, what procedures are in place \nto identify emerging risks and an explanation of how \nthese are being managed or mitigated;\n\t> the directors’ statement in the financial statements \nabout whether they considered it appropriate to \nadopt the going concern basis of accounting in \npreparing them, and their identification of any \nmaterial uncertainties to the Group’s and \nCompany’s ability to continue to do so over a period \nof at least twelve months from the date of approval \nof the financial statements;\n\t> the directors’ explanation as to their assessment of \nthe Group’s and Company’s prospects, the period \nthis assessment covers and why the period is \nappropriate; and\n\t> the directors’ statement as to whether they have a \nreasonable expectation that the Company will be \nable to continue in operation and meet its liabilities \nas they fall due over the period of its assessment, \nincluding any related disclosures drawing attention \nto any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\nOur review of the directors’ statement regarding the \nlonger-term viability of the Group and Company was \nsubstantially less in scope than an audit and only \nconsisted of making inquiries and considering the \ndirectors’ process supporting their statement; \nchecking that the statement is in alignment with the \nrelevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance \nCode; and considering whether the statement is \nconsistent with the financial statements and our \nknowledge and understanding of the Group and \nCompany and their environment obtained in the \ncourse of the audit.\nIn addition, based on the work undertaken as part of \nour audit, we have concluded that each of the following \nelements of the corporate governance statement is \nmaterially consistent with the financial statements and \nour knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\t> the directors’ statement that they consider the \nAnnual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced \nand understandable, and provides the information \nnecessary for the members to assess the Group’s \nand Company’s position, performance, business \nmodel and strategy;\n\t> the section of the Annual Report that describes the \nreview of effectiveness of risk management and \ninternal control systems; and\n\t> the section of the Annual Report describing the \nwork of the Audit Committee.\nWe have nothing to report in respect of our \nresponsibility to report when the directors’ statement \nrelating to the Company’s compliance with the Code \ndoes not properly disclose a departure from a relevant \nprovision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules \nfor review by the auditors.\nIndependent auditors’ report to  \nthe members of AstraZeneca PLC  \ncontinued"

      "text": "137\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nCorporate Governance\nAdditional Information\nStrategic Report\nFinancial Statements\nResponsibilities for the financial statements \nand the audit\nResponsibilities of the directors for the \nfinancial statements\nAs explained more fully in the Preparation of the \nFinancial Statements and Directors’ Responsibilities, \nthe directors are responsible for the preparation of the \nfinancial statements in accordance with the applicable \nframework and for being satisfied that they give a true \nand fair view. The directors are also responsible for \nsuch internal control as they determine is necessary to \nenable the preparation of financial statements that are \nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud \nor error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are \nresponsible for assessing the Group’s and the \nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern, \ndisclosing, as applicable, matters related to going \nconcern and using the going concern basis of \naccounting unless the directors either intend to \nliquidate the Group or the Company or to cease \noperations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the \nfinancial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance \nabout whether the financial statements as a whole are \nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud \nor error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes \nour opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of \nassurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit \nconducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always \ndetect a material misstatement when it exists. \nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are \nconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, \nthey could reasonably be expected to influence the \neconomic decisions of users taken on the basis of \nthese financial statements.\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of \nnon-compliance with laws and regulations. We design \nprocedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined \nabove, to detect material misstatements in respect of \nirregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our \nprocedures are capable of detecting irregularities, \nincluding fraud, is detailed below.\nBased on our understanding of the Group and \nindustry, we identified that the principal risks of \nnon-compliance with laws and regulations related to \npatent protection, product safety (including but not \nlimited to the US Food and Drug Administration \nregulation, the European Medicines Agency, the UK \nMedicines and Healthcare products Regulatory \nAgency, China Food and Drug Administration), anti \nbribery and competition law (including but not limited \nto the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Proceeds of \nCrime Act and the provisions set out by the National \nHealthcare Security Administration in China) and tax \nlegislation, and we considered the extent to which \nnon-compliance might have a material effect on the \nfinancial statements. We also considered those laws \nand regulations that have a direct impact on the \nfinancial statements such as the Companies Act 2006. \nWe evaluated management’s incentives and \nopportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the \nfinancial statements (including the risk of override of \ncontrols), and determined that the principal risks were \nrelated to journal entries to manipulate financial results \nand potential management bias in accounting \nestimates. The Group engagement team shared this \nrisk assessment with the component auditors so that \nthey could include appropriate audit procedures in \nresponse to such risks in their work. Audit procedures \nperformed by the Group engagement team and/or \ncomponent auditors included:\n\t> Evaluation and testing of the design and operating \neffectiveness of management’s controls to prevent \nand detect irregularities;\n\t> Discussions with VP Group Internal Audit, the \nDeputy Chief Compliance Officer, the Head of \nGlobal Investigations and the Group’s General \nCounsel and Deputy General Counsels along with \nother members of Group legal and external counsel \nwhere applicable, including consideration of known \nor suspected instances of non-compliance with \nlaws and regulations and fraud;\n\t> Assessment of matters reported on the Group’s \nwhistleblowing helpline and the results of \nmanagement’s investigation of such matters, with \nthe involvement of PwC Forensic specialists;\n\t> Challenging assumptions made by management \nin its significant accounting estimates, in particular \nin relation to the recognition and measurement of \ncertain rebate accruals in the US (excluding Rare \nDiseases), the impairment of intangible assets \n(excluding goodwill and software development \ncosts), the recognition and measurement of legal \nprovisions and disclosure of contingent liabilities, \nthe recognition and measurement of uncertain tax \ntreatments, and the valuation of the defined benefit \nobligations (see related key audit matters above); \nand\n\t> Identifying and testing the validity of journal entries, \nin particular any journal entries posted with unusual \naccount combinations, and consolidation journals.\nThere are inherent limitations in the audit procedures \ndescribed above. We are less likely to become aware \nof instances of non-compliance with laws and \nregulations that are not closely related to events and \ntransactions reflected in the financial statements. \nAlso, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement \ndue to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one \nresulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate \nconcealment by, for example, forgery or intentional \nmisrepresentations, or through collusion.\nOur audit testing might include testing complete \npopulations of certain transactions and balances, \npossibly using data auditing techniques. However, it \ntypically involves selecting a limited number of items \nfor testing, rather than testing complete populations. \nWe will often seek to target particular items for testing \nbased on their size or risk characteristics. In other \ncases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw \na conclusion about the population from which the \nsample is selected.\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit \nof the financial statements is located on the FRC’s \nwebsite at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. \nThis description forms part of our auditors’ report.\nUse of this report\nThis report, including the opinions, has been \nprepared for and only for the Company’s members \nas a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of \nthe Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. \nWe do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume \nresponsibility for any other purpose or to any other \nperson to whom this report is shown or into whose \nhands it may come, save where expressly agreed by \nour prior consent in writing.\nOther required reporting\nCompanies Act 2006 exception reporting\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 we are required to \nreport to you if, in our opinion:\n\t> we have not obtained all the information and \nexplanations we require for our audit; or\n\t> adequate accounting records have not been kept \nby the Company, or returns adequate for our audit \nhave not been received from branches not visited \nby us; or\n\t> certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration \nspecified by law are not made; or\n\t> the Company financial statements and the part of \nthe Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited \nare not in agreement with the accounting records \nand returns.\nWe have no exceptions to report arising from this \nresponsibility.\nAppointment\nFollowing the recommendation of the Audit \nCommittee, we were appointed by the members on \n27 April 2017 to audit the financial statements for the \nyear ended 31 December 2017 and subsequent \nfinancial periods. The period of total uninterrupted \nengagement is six years, covering the years ended \n31 December 2017 to 31 December 2022.\nOther matter\nAs required by the Financial Conduct Authority \nDisclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 4.1.14R, \nthese financial statements form part of the ESEF-\nprepared annual financial report filed on the National \nStorage Mechanism of the Financial Conduct Authority \nin accordance with the ESEF Regulatory Technical \nStandard (‘ESEF RTS’). This auditors’ report provides \nno assurance over whether the annual financial report \nhas been prepared using the single electronic format \nspecified in the ESEF RTS.\nSarah Quinn (Senior Statutory Auditor)\nfor and on behalf of \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nChartered Accountants and Statutory Auditors\nLondon\n9 February 2023\nFinancial Statements / Independent auditors’ report to the members of AstraZeneca PLC"

      "text": "Group Accounting Policies\nBasis of accounting and preparation \nof financial information\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have \nbeen prepared under the historical cost \nconvention, modified to include revaluation to \nfair value of certain financial instruments as \ndescribed below, in accordance with UK-\nadopted International Accounting Standards \nand with the requirements of the Companies \nAct 2006 as applicable to companies reporting \nunder those standards. The Consolidated \nFinancial Statements also comply fully with \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards \n(IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting \nStandards Board (IASB) and International \nAccounting Standards as adopted by the \nEuropean Union.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are \npresented in US dollars, which is the Company’s \nfunctional currency.\nIn preparing their individual financial statements, \nthe accounting policies of some overseas \nsubsidiaries do not conform with IASB-issued \nIFRSs. Therefore, where appropriate, \nadjustments are made in order to present \nthe Consolidated Financial Statements on a \nconsistent basis.\nBasis for preparation of Financial \nStatements on a going concern basis\nThe Group has considerable financial resources \navailable. As at 31 December 2022, the Group \nhas $11.1bn in financial resources (Cash and \ncash equivalent balances of $6.2bn and \nundrawn committed bank facilities of $4.9bn \navailable until April 2026 with only $5.5bn of \nborrowings due within one year). All facilities \ncontain no financial covenants and were \nundrawn at 31 December 2022. On 2 February \n2023, the Group entered into an additional \n$2.0bn of two-year committed bank facilities.\nThe Group’s revenues are largely derived from \nsales of medicines covered by patents, which \nprovide a relatively high level of resilience \nand predictability to cash inflows, although \ngovernment price interventions in response to \nbudgetary constraints are expected to continue \nto adversely affect revenues in some of our \nsignificant markets. The Group, however, \nanticipates new revenue streams from both \nrecently launched medicines and those in \ndevelopment, and the Group has a wide \ndiversity of customers and suppliers across \ndifferent geographic areas.\nConsequently, the Directors believe that, overall, \nthe Group is well placed to manage its business \nrisks successfully. Accordingly, they continue \nto adopt the going concern basis in preparing \nthe Annual Report and Financial Statements.\nEstimates and judgements\nThe preparation of the Financial Statements in \nconformity with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples requires management to make \nestimates and judgements that affect the \nreported amounts of assets and liabilities at \nthe date of the Financial Statements and the \nreported amounts of revenues and expenses \nduring the reporting period. Actual results \ncould differ from those estimates.\nThe accounting policy descriptions set out the \nareas where judgements and estimates need \nexercising, the most significant of which include \nthe following Key Judgements \n and \nSignificant Estimates \n:\n>\t revenue recognition – see Revenue \nAccounting Policy on page 142 \n \nand Note 1 on page 149 \n>\t expensing of internal development \nexpenses – see Research and \nDevelopment Policy on page 144 \n>\t impairment reviews of Intangible assets \n– see Note 10 on page 161 \n>\t useful economic life of Intangible assets – \nsee Research and Development Policy \non page 144 \n>\t business combinations and Goodwill – see \nBusiness Combinations and Goodwill \nPolicy on page 146 \n and Note 27 \non page 182 \n>\t litigation liabilities – see Litigation and \nEnvironmental Liabilities within Note 30 \non page 192 \n>\t operating segments – see Note 6 on \npage 157 \n>\t employee benefits – see Note 22 on \npage 173 \n>\t taxation – see Note 30 on page 192 \n.\nAstraZeneca has assessed the impact of \nthe uncertainty presented by the COVID-19 \npandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict on \nthe Financial Statements, specifically \nconsidering the impact on key judgements \nand significant estimates along with several \nother areas of increased risk. No material \naccounting impacts relating to COVID-19 or \nthe Russia-Ukraine conflict were recognised \nin the year.\nThe Group will continue to monitor these areas \nof increased judgement, estimation and risk \nfor material changes.\nThe Group has assessed the impact of climate \nrisk on its financial reporting. The impact \nassessment was primarily focused on the \nvaluation and useful lives of intangible assets \nand the identification and valuation of provisions \nand contingent liabilities, as these are judged \nto be the key areas that could be impacted by \nclimate risks. No material accounting impacts \nor changes to judgements or other required \ndisclosures were noted.\n Key Judgements are those judgements \nmade in applying the Group’s accounting \npolicies that have a material effect on the \namounts of assets and liabilities recognised \nin the financial statements.\n A Significant Estimate has a significant \nrisk of material adjustment to the carrying \namounts of assets and liabilities within the \nnext financial year.\nFinancial risk management policies are \ndetailed in Note 28 to the Financial Statements \nfrom page 184.\nAstraZeneca’s management considers the \nfollowing to be the most significant accounting \npolicies in the context of the Group’s operations.\nRevenue\nRevenue comprises Product Sales and \nCollaboration Revenue.\nRevenue excludes inter-company revenues \nand value-added taxes. \nProduct Sales \nProduct Sales represent net invoice value less \nestimated rebates, returns and chargebacks, \nwhich are considered to be variable \nconsideration and include significant estimates. \nSales are recognised when the control of the \ngoods has been transferred to a third party. \nThis is usually when title passes to the customer, \neither on shipment or on receipt of goods by \nthe customer, depending on local trading \nterms. In markets where returns are significant, \nestimates of the quantity and value of goods \nwhich may ultimately be returned are accounted \nfor at the point revenue is recognised. Revenue \nis not recognised in full until it is highly probable \nthat a significant reversal in the amount of \ncumulative revenue recognised will not occur.\nRebates are amounts payable or credited to \na customer, usually based on the quantity or \nvalue of Product Sales to the customer for \nspecific products in a certain period. Product \nsales rebates, which relate to Product Sales \nthat occur over a period of time, are normally \nissued retrospectively.\nAt the time Product Sales are invoiced, rebates \nand deductions that the Group expects to pay \nare estimated based upon assumptions \ndeveloped using contractual terms, historical \nexperience and market related information. \nThe rebates and deductions are recognised \nas variable consideration and recorded as a \nreduction to revenue with an accrual recorded. \nThese rebates typically arise from sales \ncontracts with government payers, third-party \nmanaged care organisations, hospitals, \nlong-term care facilities, group purchasing \norganisations and various state programmes.\n142\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "Our returns accruals are based on actual \nexperience over the preceding 12 months for \nestablished products together with market-\nrelated information such as estimated stock \nlevels at wholesalers and competitor activity \nwhich we receive via third-party information \nservices. For newly launched products, we \nuse rates based on our experience with similar \nproducts or a predetermined percentage. \nWhen a product faces generic competition, \nparticular attention is given to the possible \nlevels of returns and, in cases where the \ncircumstances are such that the level of \nProduct Sales are considered highly probable \nto reverse, revenues are only recognised when \nthe right of return expires, which is generally on \nultimate prescription of the product to patients.\nThe methodology and assumptions used to \nestimate rebates and returns are monitored and \nadjusted regularly in the light of contractual \nand legal obligations, historical trends, past \nexperience and projected market conditions. \nOnce the uncertainty associated with returns \nis resolved, revenue is adjusted accordingly.\nUnder certain collaboration agreements \nwhich include a profit sharing mechanism, \nour recognition of Product Sales depends on \nwhich party acts as principal in sales to the \nend customer. In the cases where AstraZeneca \nacts as principal, we record 100% of sales to \nthe end customer.\nContracts relating to the supply of certain \nVaccines & Immune Therapies medicines \nrelating to the COVID-19 pandemic include \nconditions whereby payments are receivable \nfrom customers in advance of the delivery \nof product. Such amounts are held on the \nbalance sheet as contract liabilities until the \nrelated revenue is recognised, generally upon \nproduct delivery. Certain of these contracts \ncontain further provisions that restrict the use \nof inventory manufactured in specified supply \nchains to specified customers, resulting in an \nenforceable right to payment as the activities \nare performed. Under IFRS 15, such contracts \nrequire revenue to be recognised over time \nusing an appropriate and reasonably \nmeasurable method to measure progress. \nRevenue is recognised on these contracts \nbased on the proportion of product delivered \ncompared to the total contracted volumes.\nCertain arrangements include bill-and-hold \narrangements under which the Group invoices \na customer for a product but retains physical \npossession of the product until it is transferred \nto the customer at a point in time in the future. \nFor these types of arrangements, an \nassessment is made to determine when the \nperformance obligation has been satisfied, \nwhich is when control of the product is \ntransferred to the customer. If the customer \nhas obtained control of the product even though \nthat product remains in the Group’s physical \npossession, the performance obligation to \ntransfer a product has been satisfied and \nProduct Sales are recognised. Control is \nconsidered to have transferred when the \nproduct is segregated as belonging to the \ncustomer, is readily available to be delivered \nto the customer and AstraZeneca is unable to \nsell the product to another customer. \nCollaboration Revenue \nCollaboration Revenue includes income from \ncollaborative arrangements where either the \nGroup has out-licensed (sold) or has in-licenced \n(acquired) certain rights associated with \nproducts, where either AstraZeneca (out-\nlicences) or the collaborator (in-licences) retains \na significant ongoing economic interest in the \nproduct. Significant interest can include \nongoing supply of finished goods, profit \nsharing arrangements or being principal in the \nsales of medicines. These collaborations may \ninclude development, manufacturing and/or \ncommercialisation arrangements with the \ncollaborator. Income from out-licences may \ntake the form of upfront fees, milestones and \nroyalties and income from in-licences may \ncomprise the sharing of profit arising from \nsales made as principal by the collaborator.\n Timing of recognition of clinical and \nregulatory milestones is considered to be \na key judgement. There can be significant \nuncertainty over whether it is highly probable \nthat there would not be a significant reversal \nof revenue in respect of specific milestones \nif these are recognised before they are \ntriggered due to them being subject to the \nactions of third parties. In general, where \nthe triggering of a milestone is subject to the \ndecisions of third parties (e.g. the acceptance \nor approval of a filing by a regulatory \nauthority), the Group does not consider that \nthe threshold for recognition is met until that \ndecision is made.\nWhere Collaboration Revenue arises from \nthe licensing of the Group’s own intellectual \nproperty, the licences we grant are typically \nrights to use intellectual property which do not \nchange during the period of the licence and \ntherefore related non-conditional revenue is \nrecognised at the point the license is granted \nand variable consideration as soon as \nrecognition criteria are met. \nOther performance obligations in the contract \nmight include the supply of product. These \narrangements typically involve the receipt of an \nupfront payment, which the contract attributes \nto the license of the intangible assets, and \nongoing receipts for supply, which the contract \nattributes to the sale of the product we \nmanufacture. In cases where the transaction \nhas two or more components, we account for \nthe delivered item (for example, the transfer \nof title to the intangible asset) as a separate \nunit of account and record revenue on \ndelivery of that component. Where practicable, \nconsideration is allocated to performance \nobligations on the basis of the standalone \nselling price of each performance obligation. \nHowever, where there is a licence of intellectual \nproperty, it is not always possible to establish \na reliable estimate of the standalone selling price \nof the licence as they are unique. Therefore, in \nthese rare situations, the residual approach is \nused to determine the consideration attributable \nto the licence.\nWhere fixed amounts are payable over one \nyear from the effective date of a contract, an \nassessment is made as to whether a significant \nfinancing component exists, and if so, the fair \nvalue of this component is deferred and \nrecognised as financing income over the \nperiod to the expected date of receipt.\nWhere control of a right to use licence for an \nintangible asset passes at the outset of an \narrangement, revenue is recognised at the \npoint in time control is transferred. Where the \nsubstance of a licence arrangement is that of \na right to access rights attributable to an \nintangible asset, revenue is recognised over \ntime, normally on a straight-line basis over the \nlife of the contract.\nWhere the Group provides ongoing development \nservices, revenue in respect of this element is \nrecognised over the duration of those services. \nWhere the arrangement meets the definition of \na licence agreement, sales milestones and \nsales royalties are recognised when achieved \nby applying the royalty exemption under IFRS 15. \nAll other milestones and sales royalties are \nrecognised when considered it is highly \nprobable there will not be a significant reversal \nof cumulative income. The determination \nrequires estimates to be made in relation to \nfuture Product Sales.\nWhere Collaboration Revenue is recorded \nand there is a related Intangible asset that is \nlicensed as part of the arrangement, an \nappropriate amount of that Intangible asset \nis charged to Cost of sales based on an \nallocation of cost or value to the rights that \nhave been licenced.\nThe Group periodically enters into transactions \nwhere it acquires part of the rights to a product \nintangible (either on-market or in-process \nR&D), but for commercial reasons does not \nact as principal in selling the product to the \ncustomer and therefore does not recognise \nincome from the product in the form of \nProduct Sales. This may occur where, for \nexample, a collaboration partner retains the \nright to commercialise in a specific territory, \nand has sufficient local control over that \ncommercialisation to book product sale \nrevenue, while the Group instead receives a \nproportion of the value generated by those \nproduct sales, either in the form of a royalty or \na profit share (alliance revenue).\n143\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nGroup Accounting Policies\nCorporate Governance\nAdditional Information\nFinancial Statements\nStrategic Report"

      "text": "Cost of sales\nCost of sales are recognised as the associated \nrevenue is recognised. Cost of sales include \nmanufacturing costs, royalties payable on \nrevenues recognised, movements in provisions \nfor inventories, inventory write-offs and \nimpairment charges in relation to manufacturing \nassets. Cost of sales also includes co-\ncollaborator sharing of profit arising from \ncollaborations, and foreign exchange gains and \nlosses arising from business trading activities.\nResearch and development\nResearch expenditure is charged to profit and \nloss in the year in which it is incurred.\n Internal development expenditure is \ncapitalised only if it meets the recognition \ncriteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’. This is \nconsidered a key judgement. Where regulatory \nand other uncertainties are such that the \ncriteria are not met, the expenditure is \ncharged to profit and loss and this is almost \ninvariably the case prior to approval of the \ndrug by the relevant regulatory authority. \nWhere, however, recognition criteria are met, \nIntangible assets are capitalised and \namortised on a straight-line basis over their \nuseful economic lives from product launch. \nAt 31 December 2022, no amounts have met \nthe recognition criteria.\nPayments to in-license products and \ncompounds from third parties for new research \nand development projects (in process research \nand development) generally take the form of \nupfront payments, milestones and royalty \npayments. Where payments made to third \nparties represent consideration for future \nresearch and development activities, an \nevaluation is made as to the nature of the \npayments. Such payments are expensed if they \nrepresent compensation for sub-contracted \nresearch and development services not \nresulting in a transfer of intellectual property. \nBy contrast, payments are capitalised if they \nrepresent compensation for the transfer of \nidentifiable intellectual property developed at \nthe risk of the third party. Such payments may \nbe made once development or regulatory \nmilestones are met and may also be made on \nthe basis of sales volumes once a product is \nlaunched. Development and regulatory \nmilestone payments are capitalised as the \nmilestone is triggered. Sales-related payments \nare accrued and capitalised with reference to \nthe latest Group sales forecasts for approved \nindications. Assets capitalised are amortised, \non a straight-line basis, over their useful \neconomic lives from product launch. \n The determination of useful economic \nlife is considered to be a key judgement. \nOn product launch, the Group makes a \njudgement as to the expected useful \neconomic life with reference to the expiry \nof associated patents for the product, \nexpectation around the competitive \nenvironment specific to the product and \nour detailed long-term risk-adjusted sales \nprojections compiled annually across the \nGroup and approved by the Board.\nThe useful economic life can extend beyond \npatent expiry dependent upon the nature \nof the product and the complexity of the \ndevelopment and manufacturing process. \nSignificant sales can often be achieved post \npatent expiration.\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets are stated at cost less \namortisation and impairments. Intangible assets \nrelating to products in development are subject \nto impairment testing annually. All Intangible \nassets are tested for impairment when there \nare indications that the carrying value may \nnot be recoverable. The determination of the \nrecoverable amounts include key estimates \nwhich are highly sensitive to, and depend \nupon, key assumptions as detailed in Note 10 \nto the Financial Statements from page 161.\nImpairment reviews have been carried out on \nall Intangible assets that are in development \n(and not being amortised), all major intangible \nassets acquired during the year and all other \nintangible assets that have had indications \nof impairment during the year. Recoverable \namount is determined as the higher of value \nin use or fair value less costs to sell using a \ndiscounted cash flow calculation, with the \nproducts’ expected cash flows risk-adjusted \nover their estimated remaining useful economic \nlife. Sales forecasts and specific allocated \ncosts (which have both been subject to \nappropriate senior management review and \napproval) are risk-adjusted and discounted \nusing appropriate rates based on our post-tax \nweighted average cost of capital or for fair value \nless costs to sell, a required rate of return for a \nmarket participant. Our weighted average cost \nof capital reflects factors such as our capital \nstructure and our costs of debt and equity.\nAny impairment losses are recognised \nimmediately in Operating profit. Intangible \nassets relating to products which fail during \ndevelopment (or for which development \nceases for other reasons) are also tested for \nimpairment and are written down to their \nrecoverable amount (which is usually nil).\nIf, subsequent to an impairment loss being \nrecognised, development restarts or other \nfacts and circumstances change indicating \nthat the impairment is less or no longer exists, \nthe value of the asset is re-estimated and its \ncarrying value is increased to the recoverable \namount, but not exceeding the original value, \nby recognising an impairment reversal in \nOperating profit.\nGovernment grants\nGovernment grants are recognised in the \nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive \nIncome so as to match with the related \nexpenses that they are intended to compensate. \nWhere grants are received in advance of the \nrelated expenses, they are initially recognised \nin the Consolidated Statement of Financial \nPosition under Trade and other payables as \ndeferred income and released to net off \nagainst the related expenditure when incurred. \nEach contract is assessed to determine \nwhether there are both grant elements and \nsupply of product which need to be separated. \nIn each case, the contracts set out the \nspecified terms for the supply of the product \nand the provisions for funding for certain costs, \nprimarily research and development associated \nwith the IP. It is considered whether there are \nany conditions for the funding to be refunded. \nThe consideration in the contract is allocated \nbetween the grant and supply elements. \nThe standalone selling price for the supply \nof products is determined by reference to \nobserved prices with other customers. \nThe amount allocated as a government grant \nis determined by reference to the specific \nagreed costs and activities identified in the \ncontract as not directly attributable to the \nsupply of product. Government grants are \nrecorded as an offset to the relevant \nexpense in the Consolidated Statement of \nComprehensive Income and are capped to \nmatch the relevant costs incurred.\nJoint arrangements and associates\nThe Group has arrangements over which it \nhas joint control and which qualify as joint \noperations or joint ventures under IFRS 11 \n‘Joint Arrangements’. For joint operations, \nthe Group recognises its share of revenue \nthat it earns from the joint operations and its \nshare of expenses incurred. The Group also \nrecognises the assets associated with the \njoint operations that it controls and the \nliabilities it incurs under the joint arrangement. \nFor joint ventures and associates, the Group \nrecognises its interest in the joint venture or \nassociate as an investment and uses the \nequity method of accounting.\nEmployee benefits\nThe Group accounts for pensions and other \nemployee benefits (principally healthcare) \nunder IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’. In respect \nof defined benefit plans, obligations are \ndetermined using the projected unit credit \nmethod and are discounted to present value \nby reference to market yields on high-quality \ncorporate bonds, while plan assets are \nmeasured at fair value. Given the extent of the \nassumptions used to determine the value of \nscheme assets and scheme liabilities, these \nare considered to be significant estimates. \nThe operating and financing costs of such plans \nare recognised separately in profit; current \nservice costs are spread systematically over \nthe lives of employees and financing costs are \nrecognised in full in the periods in which they \narise. Remeasurements of the net defined \nbenefit pension liability, including actuarial \ngains and losses, are recognised immediately \nin Other comprehensive income.\nGroup Accounting Policies\ncontinued\n144\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nFinancial Statements"

Taxable profit differs from \nreported profit because taxable profit excludes \nitems that are either never taxable or tax \ndeductible or items that are taxable or tax \ndeductible in a different period. The Group’s \ncurrent tax assets and liabilities are calculated \nusing tax rates that have been enacted or \nsubstantively enacted by the reporting date.\nDeferred tax is provided using the balance \nsheet liability method, providing for temporary \ndifferences between the carrying amounts of \nassets and liabilities for financial reporting \npurposes and the amounts used for taxation \npurposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised \nto the extent that there are future taxable \ntemporary differences or it is probable that \nfuture taxable profit will be available against \nwhich the asset can be utilised. This requires \njudgements to be made in respect of the \navailability of future taxable income.\nNo deferred tax asset or liability is recognised \nin respect of temporary differences associated \nwith investments in subsidiaries and branches \nwhere the Group is able to control the timing \nof reversal of the temporary differences and it \nis probable that the temporary differences will \nnot reverse in the foreseeable future. \nThe Group’s Deferred tax assets and liabilities \nare calculated using tax rates that are \nexpected to apply in the period when the \nliability is settled or the asset realised based \non tax rates that have been enacted or \nsubstantively enacted by the reporting date. \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset in \nthe Consolidated Statement of Financial \nPosition if, and only if, the taxable entity has a \nlegally enforceable right to set off current tax \nassets and liabilities, and the Deferred tax \nassets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by \nthe same taxation authority on the same \ntaxable entity.\nLiabilities for uncertain tax positions require \nmanagement to make judgements of potential \nexposures in relation to tax audit issues. Tax \nbenefits are not recognised unless the tax \npositions will probably be accepted by the tax \nauthorities. This is based upon management’s \ninterpretation of applicable laws and regulations \nand the expectation of how the tax authority \nwill resolve the matter. Once considered \nprobable of not being accepted, management \nreviews each material tax benefit and reflects \nthe effect of the uncertainty in determining the \nrelated taxable result. \nLiabilities for uncertain tax positions are \nmeasured using either the most likely amount \nor the expected value amount depending on \nwhich method the entity expects to better \npredict the resolution of the uncertainty.\nFurther details of the estimates and assumptions \nmade in determining our recorded liability for \ntransfer pricing contingencies and other tax \ncontingencies are included in Note 30 to the \nFinancial Statements from page 192.\nShare-based payments\nAll plans have been classified as equity settled \nafter assessment. The grant date fair value of \nthe market-based performance elements of \nemployee share plan awards is calculated using \na modified Monte Carlo model, with other \nelements at market price. In accordance with \nIFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’, the resulting \ncost is recognised in profit on a straight-line \nbasis over the vesting period of the awards. \nThe value of the charge is adjusted to reflect \nexpected and actual levels of awards vesting, \nexcept where the failure to vest is as a result of \nnot meeting a market condition. Cancellations of \nequity instruments are treated as an acceleration \nof the vesting period and any outstanding \ncharge is recognised in profit immediately.\nCash outflows relating to the vesting of share \nplans for our employees are recognised within \noperating activities, as they relate to employee \nremuneration. The cash flows relating to \nreplacement awards issued to employees as \npart of the Alexion acquisition (see Note 27 \nfrom page 182) are classified within investing \nactivities, as they are part of the aggregate \ncash flows arising from obtaining control of \nthe subsidiary.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nThe Group’s policy is to depreciate the \ndifference between the cost of each item of \nProperty, plant and equipment and its residual \nvalue over its estimated useful life on a \nstraight-line basis. Assets under construction \nare not depreciated until the asset is available \nfor use, at which point the asset is transferred \ninto either Land and buildings or Plant and \nequipment, and depreciated over its estimated \nuseful economic life.\nReviews are made annually of the estimated \nremaining lives and residual values of individual \nproductive assets, taking account of commercial \nand technological obsolescence as well as \nnormal wear and tear. It is impractical to \ncalculate average asset lives exactly. However, \nthe useful economic lives range from \napproximately 10 to 50 years for buildings, \nand three to 15 years for plant and equipment. \nAll items of Property, plant and equipment are \ntested for impairment when there are indications \nthat the carrying value may not be recoverable. \nAny impairment losses are recognised \nimmediately in Operating profit.\nLeases\nThe Group’s lease arrangements are principally \nfor property, most notably a portfolio of office \npremises and employee accommodation, and \nfor a global car fleet, utilised primarily by our \nsales and marketing teams.\nThe lease liability and corresponding right-of-\nuse asset arising from a lease are initially \nmeasured on a present value basis. Lease \nliabilities include the net present value of the \nfollowing lease payments:\n>\t fixed payments, less any lease \nincentives receivable\n>\t variable lease payments that depend on an \nindex or a rate, initially measured using the \nindex or rate as at the commencement date\n>\t the exercise price of a purchase option if \nthe Group is reasonably certain to exercise \nthat option\n>\t payments of penalties for terminating the \nlease, if the lease term reflects the Group \nexercising that option, and\n>\t amounts expected to be payable by the \nGroup under residual value guarantees.\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost \ncomprising the following:\n>\t the amount of the initial measurement of \nlease liability\n>\t any lease payments made at or before \nthe commencement date less any lease \nincentives received\n>\t any initial direct costs, and\n>\t restoration costs. \nJudgements made in calculating the lease \nliability include assessing whether arrangements \ncontain a lease and determining the lease term. \nLease terms are negotiated on an individual \nbasis and contain a wide range of different \nterms and conditions. Property leases will often \ninclude an early termination or extension option \nto the lease term. Fleet management policies \nvary by jurisdiction and may include renewal \nof a lease until a measurement threshold, \nsuch as mileage, is reached. Extension and \ntermination options have been considered \nwhen determining the lease term, along with \nall facts and circumstances that may create \nan economic incentive to exercise an extension \noption, or not exercise a termination option. \nExtension periods (or periods after termination \noptions) are only included in the lease term if \nthe lease is reasonably certain to be extended \n(or not terminated).\nThe lease payments are discounted using \nincremental borrowing rates, as in the majority \nof leases held by the Group the interest rate \nimplicit in the lease is not readily identifiable. \nCalculating the discount rate is an estimate \nmade in calculating the lease liability. This rate \nis the rate that the Group would have to pay to \nborrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset \nof similar value to the right-of-use asset in a \nsimilar economic environment with similar \nterms, security and conditions.

When adjustments to lease payments \nbased on an index or rate take effect, the \nlease liability is reassessed and adjusted \nagainst the right-of-use asset.\nLease payments are allocated between \nprincipal and finance cost. The finance cost is \ncharged to the Consolidated Statement of \nComprehensive Income over the lease period \nso as to produce a constant periodic rate of \ninterest on the remaining balance of the \nliability for each period.\nPayments associated with short-term leases \nof Property, plant and equipment and all \nleases of low-value assets are recognised \non a straight-line basis as an expense in the \nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive \nIncome. Short-term leases are leases with a \nlease term of 12 months or less. Low-value \nleases are those where the underlying asset \nvalue, when new, is $5,000 or less and includes \nIT equipment and small items of office furniture.\nContracts may contain both lease and \nnon-lease components. The Group allocates \nthe consideration in the contract to the lease \nand non-lease components based on their \nrelative standalone prices. \nRight-of-use assets are generally depreciated \nover the shorter of the asset’s useful life and \nthe lease term on a straight-line basis. If the \nGroup is reasonably certain to exercise a \npurchase option, the right-of-use asset is \ndepreciated over the underlying asset’s useful \nlife. It is impractical to calculate average asset \nlives exactly. However, the total lives range \nfrom approximately 10 to 50 years for buildings, \nand three to 15 years for motor vehicles and \nother assets.\nThere are no material lease agreements under \nwhich the Group is a lessor.\nBusiness combinations and goodwill\nIn assessing whether an acquired set of \nassets and activities is a business or an asset, \nmanagement will first elect whether to apply \nan optional concentration test to simplify the \nassessment. Where the concentration test is \napplied, the acquisition will be treated as the \nacquisition of an asset if substantially all of \nthe fair value of the gross assets acquired \n(excluding cash and cash equivalents, \ndeferred tax assets, and related goodwill) is \nconcentrated in a single asset or group of \nsimilar identifiable assets. \nWhere the concentration test is not applied, \nor is not met, a further assessment of whether \nthe acquired set of assets and activities is a \nbusiness will be performed.\n The determination of whether an acquired \nset of assets and activities is a business or \nan asset can be judgemental, particularly if \nthe target is not producing outputs. \nManagement uses a number of factors to \nmake this determination, which are primarily \nfocused on whether the acquired set of \nassets and activities include substantive \nprocesses that mean the set is capable of \nbeing managed for the purpose of providing \na return. Key determining factors include the \nstage of development of any assets acquired, \nthe readiness and ability of the acquired set \nto produce outputs and the presence of key \nexperienced employees capable of \nconducting activities required to develop or \nmanufacture the assets. Typically, the \nspecialised nature of many pharmaceutical \nassets and processes is such that until \nassets are substantively ready for production \nand promotion, there are not the required \nprocesses for a set of assets and activities \nto meet the definition of a business in IFRS 3.\nOn the acquisition of a business, fair values \nare attributed to the identifiable assets and \nliabilities. Attributing fair values is a key \njudgement; refer to Note 27 to the Financial \nStatements on page 182 for additional details \nof the 2021 acquisition. Contingent liabilities \nare also recorded at fair value unless the fair \nvalue cannot be measured reliably, in which \ncase the value is subsumed into goodwill. \nWhere fair values of acquired contingent \nliabilities cannot be measured reliably, the \nassumed contingent liability is not recognised \nbut is disclosed in the same manner as other \ncontingent liabilities. Where the Group fully \nacquires, through a business combination, \nassets that were previously held in joint \noperations, the Group has elected not to uplift \nthe book value of the existing interest in the \nasset held in the joint operation to fair value at \nthe date full control is taken. \nWhere not all of the equity of a subsidiary \nis acquired, the non-controlling interest is \nrecognised either at fair value or at the \nnon-controlling interest’s proportionate \nshare of the net assets of the subsidiary, \non a case-by-case basis. Put options over \nnon-controlling interests are recognised as \na financial liability, with a corresponding entry \nin either Retained earnings or against \nnon-controlling interest reserves on a \ncase-by-case basis.\nThe timing and amount of future contingent \nelements of consideration is an estimate. \nContingent consideration, which may include \ndevelopment and launch milestones, revenue \nthreshold milestones and revenue-based \nroyalties, is fair valued at the date of acquisition \nusing decision-tree analysis with key inputs \nincluding probability of success, consideration \nof potential delays and revenue projections \nbased on the Group’s internal forecasts. \nUnsettled amounts of consideration are held \nat fair value within payables with changes in \nfair value recognised immediately in profit.\nGoodwill is the difference between the fair \nvalue of the consideration and the fair value of \nnet assets acquired.\nGoodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised \nand subject to an impairment review, both \nannually and when there is an indication that \nthe carrying value may not be recoverable.\nThe Group’s policy up to and including 1997 \nwas to eliminate Goodwill arising upon \nacquisitions against reserves. Under IFRS 1 \n‘First-time Adoption of International Financial \nReporting Standards’ and IFRS 3 ‘Business \nCombinations’, such Goodwill will remain \neliminated against reserves.\nSubsidiaries\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled, directly \nor indirectly, by AstraZeneca PLC. Control is \nregarded as the exposure or rights to the \nvariable returns of the entity when combined \nwith the power to affect those returns. Control \nis normally evidenced by holding more than 50% \nof the share capital of the company, however \nother agreements may be in place that result \nin control where they give AstraZeneca finance \ndecision-making authority over the relevant \nactivities of the company.\nThe financial results of subsidiaries are \nconsolidated from the date control is obtained \nuntil the date that control ceases.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and \nnet realisable value. The first in, first out or an \naverage method of valuation is used. For \nfinished goods and work in progress, cost \nincludes directly attributable costs and certain \noverhead expenses (including depreciation). \nSelling expenses and certain other overhead \nexpenses (principally central administration \ncosts) are excluded. Net realisable value is \ndetermined as estimated selling price less all \nestimated costs of completion and costs to be \nincurred in selling and distribution.\nWrite-downs of inventory occur in the general \ncourse of business and are recognised in \nCost of sales for launched or approved \nproducts and in Research and development \nexpense for products in development.\nAssets held for sale\nNon-current assets are classified as Assets \nheld for sale when their carrying amount is to be \nrecovered principally through a sale transaction \nand a sale is considered highly probable. \nA sale is considered highly probable only \nwhen the appropriate level of management \nhas committed to the sale.\nGroup Accounting Policies\ncontinued\n146\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nFinancial Statements"

Contingent consideration \npayables are held at fair value within Level 3 of \nthe fair value hierarchy as defined in Note 12.\nFinancial instruments\nThe Group’s financial instruments include Lease \nliabilities, Trade and other receivables and \npayables, liabilities for contingent consideration \nand put options under business combinations, \nand rights and obligations under employee \nbenefit plans which are dealt with in specific \naccounting policies.\nThe Group’s other financial instruments include:\n>\t Cash and cash equivalents\n>\t Fixed deposits\n>\t Other investments\n>\t Bank and other borrowings\n>\t Derivatives.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in \nhand, current balances with banks and similar \ninstitutions, and highly liquid investments \nwith maturities of three months or less when \nacquired. They are readily convertible into \nknown amounts of cash and are held at \namortised cost under the hold to collect \nclassification, where they meet the hold to \ncollect ‘solely payments of principal and \ninterest’ test criteria under IFRS 9. Those not \nmeeting these criteria are held at fair value \nthrough profit and loss. Cash and cash \nequivalents in the Consolidated Statement of \nCash Flows include unsecured bank overdrafts \nat the balance sheet date where balances often \nfluctuate between a cash and overdraft position.\nFixed deposits\nFixed deposits, principally comprising \nfunds held with banks and other financial \ninstitutions, are initially measured at fair \nvalue, plus direct transaction costs, and are \nsubsequently measured at amortised cost \nusing the effective interest rate method at \neach reporting date. Changes in carrying \nvalue are recognised in the Consolidated \nStatement of Comprehensive Income.\nOther investments\nInvestments are classified as fair value through \nprofit or loss (FVPL), unless the Group makes \nan irrevocable election at initial recognition for \ncertain non-current equity investments to \npresent changes in Other comprehensive \nincome (FVOCI). If this election is made, there \nis no subsequent reclassification of fair value \ngains and losses to profit and loss following \nthe derecognition of the investment.\nBank and other borrowings\nThe Group uses derivatives, principally \ninterest rate swaps, to hedge the interest rate \nexposure inherent in a portion of its fixed \ninterest rate debt. In such cases the Group will \neither designate the debt as fair value through \nprofit and loss when certain criteria are met or \nas the hedged item under a fair value hedge.\nIf the debt instrument is designated as fair \nvalue through profit or loss, the debt is initially \nmeasured at fair value (with direct transaction \ncosts being included in profit as an expense) \nand is remeasured to fair value at each reporting \ndate with changes in carrying value being \nrecognised in profit (along with changes in the \nfair value of the related derivative), with the \nexception of changes in the fair value of the debt \ninstrument relating to own credit risk which are \nrecorded in Other comprehensive income in \naccordance with IFRS 9. Such a designation has \nbeen made where this significantly reduces an \naccounting mismatch which would result from \nrecognising gains and losses on different bases.\nIf the debt is designated as the hedged item \nunder a fair value hedge, the debt is initially \nmeasured at fair value (with direct transaction \ncosts being amortised over the life of the debt) \nand is remeasured for fair value changes in \nrespect of the hedged risk at each reporting \ndate with changes in carrying value being \nrecognised in profit (along with changes in the \nfair value of the related derivative).\nIf the debt is designated in a cash flow hedge, \nthe debt is measured at amortised cost (with \ngains or losses taken to profit and direct \ntransaction costs being amortised over the \nlife of the debt). The related derivative is \nremeasured for fair value changes at each \nreporting date with the portion of the gain or \nloss on the derivative that is determined to \nbe an effective hedge recognised in Other \ncomprehensive income. The amounts that \nhave been recognised in Other comprehensive \nincome are reclassified to profit in the same \nperiod that the hedged forecast cash flows \naffect profit. The reclassification adjustment is \nincluded in Finance expense in the Consolidated \nStatement of Comprehensive Income.\nOther interest-bearing loans are initially \nmeasured at fair value (with direct transaction \ncosts being amortised over the life of the loan) \nand are subsequently measured at amortised \ncost using the effective interest rate method at \neach reporting date. Changes in carrying \nvalue are recognised in the Consolidated \nStatement of Comprehensive Income.\nDerivatives\nDerivatives are initially measured at fair value \n(with direct transaction costs being included \nin profit as an expense) and are subsequently \nremeasured to fair value at each reporting \ndate. Changes in carrying value of derivatives \nnot designated in hedging relationships are \nrecognised in profit or loss. \nThe Group has agreements with some bank \ncounterparties whereby the parties agree to \npost cash collateral, for the benefit of the other, \nequivalent to the market valuation of all of the \nderivative positions above a predetermined \nthreshold. Cash collateral received from \ncounterparties is included within current \nInterest-bearing loans and borrowings within the \nConsolidated Statement of Financial Position. \nCash collateral pledged to counterparties is \nrecognised as a financial asset and is included \nin current Other investments within the \nConsolidated Statement of Financial Position. \nIn prior years, cash collateral pledged to \ncounterparties was included in Cash and \ncash equivalents. Cash collateral received is \nincluded in Movement in short-term borrowings \nwithin financing activities in the Consolidated \nCash Flow Statement. Cash collateral paid \nis included in Movements in short-term \ninvestments within investing activities in the \nConsolidated Cash Flow Statement.

Provision is made where an adverse \noutcome is probable and associated costs, \nincluding related legal costs, can be estimated \nreliably. In other cases, appropriate disclosures \nare included. Determining the timing of \nrecognition of when an adverse outcome is \nprobable is considered a key judgement, refer \nto Note 30 to the Financial Statements on \npage 192.\nWhere it is considered that the Group is more \nlikely than not to prevail, or in the extremely \nrare circumstances where the amount of the \nlegal liability cannot be estimated reliably, \nlegal costs involved in defending the claim are \ncharged to the Consolidated Statement of \nComprehensive Income as they are incurred.\nWhere it is considered that the Group has \na valid contract which provides the right to \nreimbursement (from insurance or otherwise) \nof legal costs and/or all or part of any loss \nincurred or for which a provision has been \nestablished, the best estimate of the amount \nexpected to be received is recognised as an \nasset only when it is virtually certain.\nAstraZeneca is exposed to environmental \nliabilities relating to its past operations, \nprincipally in respect of soil and groundwater \nremediation costs. Provisions for these costs \nare made when there is a present obligation \nand where it is probable that expenditure on \nremedial work will be required and a reliable \nestimate can be made of the cost. Provisions \nare discounted at the relevant pre-tax discount \nrate where the effect is material.\nRestructuring\nRestructuring costs are incurred in programmes \nthat are planned and controlled by the Group \nwhich materially change either the scope of \na business undertaken by the Group, or the \nmanner in which that business is conducted.\nA provision for restructuring costs is recognised \nwhen a detailed formal plan is in place and \nhas either been announced to those affected \nor has started to be implemented. The general \nrecognition criteria for provisions must also be \nmet, as described in the Provisions policy.\nImpairment\nThe carrying values of non-financial assets, \nother than Inventories and Deferred tax assets, \nare reviewed at least annually to determine \nwhether there is any indication of impairment. \nFor Goodwill, Intangible assets under \ndevelopment and for any other assets where \nsuch indication exists, the asset’s recoverable \namount is estimated based on the greater of \nits value in use and its fair value less cost to \nsell. In assessing the recoverable amount, the \nestimated future cash flows, adjusted for the \nrisks associated with the probability of success \nspecific to each asset, as well as inflationary \nimpacts, are discounted to their present value \nusing a nominal discount rate that reflects \ncurrent market assessments of the time value \nof money, the general risks affecting the \npharmaceutical industry and other risks \nspecific to each asset. For the purpose of \nimpairment testing, assets are grouped \ntogether into the smallest group of assets that \ngenerates cash inflows from continuing use \nthat are largely independent of the cash flows \nof other assets. Impairment losses are \nrecognised immediately in the Consolidated \nStatement of Comprehensive Income.\nInternational accounting transition\nOn transition to using adopted IFRSs in the \nyear ended 31 December 2005, the Group took \nadvantage of several optional exemptions \navailable in IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards’. \nThe major impacts which are of continuing \nimportance are detailed below:\n>\t Business combinations– IFRS 3 ‘Business \nCombinations’ has been applied from \n1 January 2003, the date of transition, rather \nthan being applied fully retrospectively. \nAs a result, the combination of Astra and \nZeneca is still accounted for as a merger, \nrather than through purchase accounting. \nIf purchase accounting had been adopted, \nZeneca would have been deemed to have \nacquired Astra.\n>\t Cumulative exchange differences– \nthe Group chose to set the cumulative \nexchange difference reserve at \n1 January 2003 to nil.\nApplicable accounting standards \nand interpretations issued but not \nyet adopted\nAt the date of authorisation of these financial \nstatements, certain new accounting standards \nand amendments were in issue relating to the \nfollowing standards and interpretations but \nnot yet adopted by the Group: \n>\t amendments to IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’, \nIAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in \nAccounting Estimates and Errors’, IAS 1 \n‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ \nand IFRS Practice Statement 2 ‘Making \nMateriality Judgements’, effective for \nperiods beginning on or after 1 January \n2023 – endorsed by the UK Endorsement \nBoard (UKEB) on 30 November 2022\n>\t new accounting standard IFRS 17 ‘Insurance \nContracts’, effective for periods beginning \non or after 1 January 2023 – endorsed by \nthe UKEB on 16 May 2022, and\n>\t amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of \nFinancial Statements’ and IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, \neffective for periods beginning on or after \n1 January 2024 – not endorsed by the UKEB.\nThese new standards, amendments and \ninterpretations are not expected to have a \nsignificant impact on the Group’s net results.\nGroup Accounting Policies\ncontinued\n148\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "1 Revenue continued\n Rebates and chargebacks in the US \nThe major market where estimates are seen as significant is the US. When invoicing Product Sales in the US, we estimate the rebates and chargebacks \nwe expect to pay and we consider there to be a significant estimate associated with the rebates for Managed Care, Medicaid and Medicare Part D. \nThe total adjustment in respect of prior year net US Product Sales revenue in 2022 was 1.3% (2021: 1.5%; 2020: 3.5%); this represents the difference \nbetween our prior year estimates for rebates and chargebacks against actual amounts paid for the US business. The most significant of these relate \nto the Medicaid and state programmes with an adjustment in respect of prior year net US Product Sales revenue in 2022 of 0.5% (2021: 0.4%; \n2020: 1.1%) and Managed Care and Medicare of 0.8% (2021: 0.7%; 2020: 1.5%).\nThe adjustment in respect of the prior year net US Product Sales revenue, excluding the Rare Disease therapy area in 2022, was 1.6% (2021: 1.8%), \nwith Medicaid and state programmes of 0.6% (2021: 0.5%) and Managed Care and Medicare of 1.1% (2021: 0.8%).\nThese values demonstrate the level of sensitivity; further meaningful sensitivity is not able to be provided due to the large volume of variables that \ncontribute to the overall rebates, chargebacks, returns and other revenue accruals.\nCollaboration Revenue\n2022\n2021\n2020\n$m\n$m \n$m\nEnhertu: alliance revenue1\n 519\n 193\n 94\nTezspire: alliance revenue1\n 79\n –\n –\nRoxadustat: alliance revenue1\n 5\n 6\n 30\nLynparza/Koselugo (MSD) – regulatory milestones\n 355\n –\n 160\nLynparza/Koselugo (MSD) – sales-related milestones\n –\n 400\n 300\nTralokinumab: sales milestone\n 110\n –\n –\nVaxzevria: royalties\n 76\n 64\n –\nOther royalty income\n 72\n 74\n 62\nNexium: sale of rights\n 62\n 75\n –\nOther Collaboration Revenue\n 75\n 64\n 81\n 1,353\n 876\n 727\n1 Alliance revenue (previously referred to as share of gross profits) comprises income arising from collaborative arrangements, where AstraZeneca is entitled to a share of gross profits but \ndoes not lead on the commercialisation in the territory and so does not recognise Product Sales. Alliance revenue is included within Collaboration Revenue.\nCollaboration Revenue includes some income that does not arise from the satisfaction of performance obligations, in particular profit share entitlements \narising from product sales made by collaborators who have licenced intellectual property to AstraZeneca. $607m of Collaboration Revenue in 2022 \n(2021: $200m; 2020: $128m) relates to such income. Substantially all other Collaboration Revenue relates to performance obligations satisfied in \nprior periods.\n2 Operating profit\nOperating profit includes the following significant items:\nCost of sales\nIn 2022, Cost of sales includes a charge of $3,484m (2021: charge of $2,198m) in relation to the release, in line with sales, of fair value uplift to inventory \nthat was recognised under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ upon the acquisition of Alexion (see Note 27).\nDuring the year no government grants were recognised within Cost of sales (2021: $290m; 2020: $nil). The grants recognised in 2021 related to \nfunding of manufactured Vaxzevria product for the US government, which expired prior to being accepted by the FDA. \nSelling, general and administrative expense\nIn 2022, Selling, general and administrative expense includes a charge of $182m (2021: charge of $42m; 2020: credit of $51m) resulting from changes \nin the fair value of contingent consideration arising from the acquisition of the diabetes alliance from BMS. These adjustments reflect revised estimates \nfor future sales performance for the products acquired and, as a result, revised estimates for future royalties payable.\nIn 2022, Selling, general and administrative costs includes a credit of $49m (2021: charge of $5m; 2020: credit of $143m) resulting from changes in \nthe fair value of contingent consideration arising from the acquisition of Almirall’s respiratory business. These adjustments reflect revised estimates \nfor future sales performance for the products acquired and, as a result, revised estimates for future milestones payable.\nIn 2022, Selling, general and administrative expense also includes a charge of $789m (2021: charge of $48m; 2020: credit of $9m) relating to a number \nof legal proceedings including settlements in various jurisdictions in relation to several marketed products (see Note 30).\nResearch and development expense: Government grants\nDuring the year $113m (2021: $531m; 2020: $222m) of government grants were recognised within Research and development expense. The grants \nrecognised relate to funding for research and development and related expenses for Evusheld of $112m (2021: $222m; 2020: $61m) and Vaxzevria \nof $1m (2021: $309m; 2020: $161m). \nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\ncontinued\n150\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nFinancial Statements"

AstraZeneca received cash proceeds and profit of $776m upon closing, with the profit recorded as \nOther operating income.\nAs part of the total consideration received in respect of the agreement to sell US rights to Synagis in 2019, $210m in total has been received related \nto the rights to participate in the future cash flows from the US profits or losses for nirsevimab. The full amount has been recognised as a financial \nliability as the Group has not fully transferred the risks and rewards of the underlying cash flows arising from nirsevimab to Sobi. This liability is \npresented in Other payables within Non-current liabilities. The associated cash flow is presented within investing activities as the Group has received \nthe cash in exchange for agreeing to transfer future cash flows relating to an intangible asset. In 2021, as a result of the Probability of Technical/\nRegulatory Success unwind, an increase of $114m to the Profit Participation Liability was recorded in Other operating expense.\nRestructuring costs\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of Alexion in 2021, the enlarged Group initiated a comprehensive Post Alexion Acquisition Group Review, aimed \nat integrating systems, structure and processes, optimising the global footprint and prioritising resource allocations and investments. These activities \nare expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2025, with a number of planned activities having commenced in late 2021 and during 2022. \nThe Group has also continued to progress other legacy restructuring programmes.\nDuring 2022, the Group has incurred $717m of restructuring costs, of which $675m resulted from activities that are part of the Post Alexion Acquisition \nGroup Review, bringing the cumulative charges under this programme to $1,705m. Costs in 2022 included $266m within Cost of sales due to the \nrationalisation of our manufacturing capacity and footprint across certain production sites, $152m within Selling, general and administrative expenses \nin relation to the transfer of Alexion’s distribution contracts with third parties to AstraZeneca Group companies, and $83m in Selling, general and \nadministrative expenses related to rationalisation of commercial teams in China.\nTotal restructuring costs in 2022 include impairment reversal of Property, plant and equipment of $4m (2021: charge of $343m; 2020: charge of $7m) \nand impairment reversal of Intangible assets (software development costs) of $17m (2021: charge of $16m; 2020: $nil).\nThe tables below show the costs that have been charged in respect of restructuring programmes by cost category and type.

      "text": "4 Taxation continued\nFactors affecting future tax charges\nAs a Group with worldwide operations, AstraZeneca is subject to several factors that may affect future tax charges, principally the levels and mix \nof profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing regulations, tax rates imposed and tax regime reforms. In 2021, the UK Government enacted \nlegislation to increase the main rate of UK statutory Corporation Tax to 25% effective 1 April 2023. In December 2021, the OECD issued model rules \nfor a new global minimum tax framework (Pillar Two) and in 2022, the UK released draft legislation including the intention to bring these into effect \nfor accounting periods commencing after 31 December 2023. AstraZeneca expects to fall within the global minimum tax framework which requires \ncalculation of a new measure of effective tax rate by legal entity. It is possible that this may result in top-up taxes in some territories in which \nAstraZeneca operates. Whilst the UK released draft legislation that has not been substantively enacted at 31 December 2022, we are continuing \nto review the draft rules, and the IASB’s staff paper and initial consideration, published in November 2022, to understand any potential impacts.\nTax reconciliation to UK statutory rate\nThe table below reconciles the UK statutory tax charge to the Group’s total tax (credit)/charge:\n2022\n2021\n2020\n$m\n$m\n$m\nProfit/(loss) before tax\n 2,501\n (265)\n 3,916\nNotional taxation charge at UK corporation tax rate of 19%\n 475\n (50)\n 744\nDifferences in effective overseas tax rates\n (59)\n 1\n (49)\nDeferred tax (credit)/charge relating to change in tax rates1\n (108)\n 54\n 138\nUnrecognised deferred tax asset2\n 68\n 32\n 3\nItems not deductible for tax purposes\n 90\n 208\n 71\nItems not chargeable for tax purposes\n –\n (163)\n (4)\nIntellectual Property incentive regimes3\n (265)\n –\n (35)\nOther items4\n (941)\n (299)\n (65)\nAdjustments in respect of prior periods5\n (52)\n (163)\n (31)\nTotal tax (credit)/charge for the period\n (792)\n (380)\n 772\n1 The 2022 item relates to the impact of the US state tax rate change and the impact of the difference in the UK current tax and deferred tax rates during 2022. The 2021 item relates to substantive \nenactment of the increase in UK Corporation Tax rate from 19% to 25% effective 1 April 2023 (debit of $12m), the increase in the Dutch Corporate Income Tax rate from 25% to 25.8% effective \n1 January 2022 (debit of $39m) and other (debit of $3m). The 2020 item relates to the increase in the 2020 substantively enacted Dutch Corporate Income Tax rate (debit of $151m) and other (debit \nof $5m). In 2020, it was substantively enacted that the planned reduction in the Dutch Corporate Income Tax rate to 21.7% from 25% effective 1 January 2021 would not take place. In addition, the \nplanned reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 17% was not enacted with the corporation tax rate remaining at 19% (credit of $18m). \n2 The 2022 item relates to the derecognition of previously recognised deferred tax assets. The 2021 item includes a $15m debit arising on derecognition of previously recognised deferred tax assets. \nThe 2020 item includes a $22m credit arising on recognition of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets.\n3 Previously reported within Items not deductible for tax purposes.\n4 Other items in 2022 relate to the aforementioned one-time favourable net adjustment of $876m to deferred taxes arising from an internal reorganisation to integrate the Alexion organisation which \ntook place in 2022 and a credit of $65m relating to the reduction of tax liabilities arising from adjustments on expiry of the relevant statute of limitations. Other items in 2021 relate to a net credit of \n$299m relating to the reduction of tax liabilities arising from updates to estimates of prior period tax liabilities following settlements with tax authorities and on expiry of the relevant statute \nof limitations partially offset by a provision for transfer pricing and other uncertain tax treatments. Other items in 2020 relate to a net credit of $65m relating to the release of tax liabilities \nfollowing the expiry of the relevant statute of limitations partially offset by a provision for transfer pricing and other uncertain tax treatments.\n5 Further details explaining the adjustments in respect of prior periods are set out on page 153.\nAstraZeneca is domiciled in the UK but operates in other countries where the tax rates and laws are different to those in the UK. The impact on \ndifferences in effective overseas tax rates on the Group’s overall tax charge is noted above. Profits arising from our manufacturing operation in \nPuerto Rico are granted special status and are taxed at a reduced rate compared with the normal rate of tax in that territory under a tax incentive \ngrant continuing until 2031. The Group receives tax incentives in relation to Intellectual Property incentives in certain jurisdictions, resulting in a \nreduction to the tax charge in the income statement of $265m in 2022.\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\ncontinued\n154\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nFinancial Statements"

Accrued expenses and other includes the \ndeferred tax on the purchase accounting of inventory.\n4 The income statement movement in 2022 includes the aforementioned net adjustment to deferred taxes of $876m arising on the internal legal entity reorganisation to integrate the Alexion organisation, \nthe majority of which arises on Intangibles, property, plant and equipment.\n5 The Group recognises deferred tax assets to the extent that there are either taxable temporary differences or that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will arise, against which these \ndeductible temporary differences can be utilised. The US includes a net deferred tax asset of $283m and the UK includes a net deferred tax asset of $503m as at 31 December 2022 which include \ntax losses and other deductible temporary differences. The Group has performed an assessment of recovery of deferred tax assets and for these entities, the Group has forecasted future taxable \nprofits and considers that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will arise against which these deductible temporary differences can be utilised. In arriving at these forecasts, the \nGroup has reviewed the Group-level budgets and forecasts and the ability of those entities to generate future income from developing and commercialising products, including local tax laws \nand the scheduling of reversal of deductible temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised on the basis there is sufficient forecast future taxable profits arising from the performance \nof on-market products and pipeline assets, including Imfinzi. For the UK, losses are forecast to be utilised within five years. For the US, recognised deferred taxes on losses and other items are \nforecast to be utilised within 15 years. It is considered that these sources of income are sufficiently predictable or diversified to support a recognition period in excess of five years. A sensitivity \nassessment has been performed which shows that a change in profit of 10% results in an immaterial adjustment to the amount of deferred tax asset recognised. Assessing the availability of \nfuture taxable income to support recognition of deferred tax assets relies upon our Group forecasts and changes in these Group forecasts will impact the recoverability of deferred tax assets. \nTo the extent that there are neither taxable temporary differences nor sufficient taxable profits, no deferred tax asset is recognised and details of unrecognised deferred tax assets are included \nin the table below.\nThe net deferred tax balance, before the offset of balances within countries, consists of:\nIntangibles,\nPension and\nElimination of\nLosses and\nAccrued\nproperty, plant\npost-retirement\nunrealised profit\nUntaxed\ntax credits\nexpenses\nand equipment\nbenefits\non inventory\nreserves\ncarried forward\nand other\nTotal\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\nDeferred tax assets at 31 December 2020\n 1,061\n 690\n 2,286\n –\n 852\n 1,130\n 6,019\nDeferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2020\n (3,688)\n (34)\n (479)\n (801)\n (138)\n (359)\n (5,499)\nNet deferred tax balance at 31 December 2020\n (2,627)\n 656\n 1,807\n (801)\n 714\n 771\n 520\nDeferred tax assets at 31 December 2021\n 1,476\n 574\n 1,910\n –\n 1,571\n 1,735\n 7,266\nDeferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2021\n (6,956)\n (21)\n (49)\n (862)\n (53)\n (1,201)\n (9,142)\nNet deferred tax balance at 31 December 2021\n (5,480)\n 553\n 1,861\n (862)\n 1,518\n 534\n (1,876)\nDeferred tax assets at 31 December 2022\n 1,499\n 276\n 2,048\n –\n 1,274\n 1,614\n 6,711\nDeferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2022\n (5,430)\n (45)\n (24)\n (716)\n (16)\n (161)\n (6,392)\nNet deferred tax balance at 31 December 2022\n (3,931)\n 231\n 2,024\n (716)\n 1,258\n 1,453\n 319\n155\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\nCorporate Governance\nAdditional Information\nFinancial Statements\nStrategic Report"

      "text": "6 Segment information\nThe Group has reviewed its assessment of reportable segments under IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ and concluded that the Group continues to \nhave one reportable segment.\n This determination is considered to be a Key Judgement and this judgement has been taken with reference to the following factors:\n1 The level of integration across the different functions of the Group’s pharmaceutical business:\nAstraZeneca is engaged in a single business activity of pharmaceuticals and the Group does not have multiple operating segments. AstraZeneca’s \npharmaceuticals business consists of the discovery and development of new products, which are then manufactured, marketed and sold. All of these \nfunctional activities take place (and are managed) globally on a highly integrated basis. These individual functional areas are not managed separately.\n2 The identification of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) and the nature and extent of the financial information reviewed by the CODM:\nThe SET, established and chaired by the CEO, is the vehicle through which the CEO exercises the authority delegated to him from the Board for the \nmanagement, development and performance of AstraZeneca as a whole. It is considered that the SET is AstraZeneca’s Chief Operating Decision \nMaking body (as defined by IFRS 8). The operation of the SET is principally driven by the management of the Commercial operations, R&D, \nmanufacturing and supply and enabling functions. All significant operating decisions are undertaken by the SET. While members of the SET have \nresponsibility for implementation of decisions in their respective areas, operating decision making is at SET level as a whole. Where necessary, these \nare implemented through cross-functional sub-committees that consider the Group-wide impact of a new decision. For example, product launch \ndecisions would be initially considered by the SET and, on approval, passed to an appropriate sub team for implementation. The ability of the \nenterprise to develop, produce, deliver and commercialise a wide range of pharmaceutical products are central to the SET decision-making process. \nIn assessing performance, the SET reviews financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole, substantially in the form of, and \non the same basis as, the Group’s IFRS Financial Statements. The high upfront cost of discovering and developing new products, coupled with \nthe relatively insignificant and stable unit cost of production, means that there is not the clear link that exists in many manufacturing businesses \nbetween the revenue generated on an individual product sale and the associated cost and hence margin generated on a product. Consequently, \nthe profitability of individual drugs or classes of drugs is not considered a key measure of performance for the business and is not monitored by \nthe SET. The focus of additional financial information reviewed is at brand sales and gross margin level within specific geographies. Expenditure \nanalysis is completed for the science units, operations and enabling functions; there is no allocation of these centrally managed Group costs to \nthe individual product or brands. The bonus of SET members’ continues to be derived from the Group scorecard outcome as discussed in our \nDirectors’ Remuneration Report.\n3 How resources are allocated:\nResources are allocated on a Group-wide basis according to need. In particular, capital expenditure, in-licensing, and R&D resources are allocated \nbetween activities on merit, based on overall therapeutic considerations and strategy under the aegis of the Group’s Early-Stage Product Committees \nand Late-Stage Product Committees.\nGeographic areas\nThe following table shows information for Total Revenue by geographic area and material countries. The additional tables show the Operating profit \nand Profit before tax made by companies located in that area, together with Non-current assets, Total assets, assets acquired, net operating assets, \nand Property, plant and equipment owned by the same companies.

Where testing \nis required, the recoverable amount of the assets is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss or reversal. Where it is not \npossible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) \nto which it belongs. The Group considers that as the intangible assets are linked to individual products and that product cash flows are considered \nto be largely independent of other product cash flows, the CGU for intangibles is at the product level. Group level budgets and forecasts include \nforecast capital investment and operational impacts related to sustainability projects, as well as inflationary impacts, and form the basis for the \nvalue in use models used for impairment testing.\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\ncontinued\n162\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "An asset’s recoverable amount is determined as the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs to sell or value in use, in both cases using \ndiscounted cash flow calculations where the asset’s expected post-tax cash flows are risk-adjusted over their estimated remaining period of expected \neconomic benefit. Where the value in use approach is used, the post-tax risk-adjusted cash flows are discounted using AstraZeneca’s post-tax \nweighted average cost of capital (7% for 2022, 2021 and 2020), which is a nominal rate. There is no material difference in the approach taken to using \npre-tax cash flows and a pre-tax rate compared to post-tax cash flows and a post-tax rate, as required by IAS 36. Where fair value less costs to sell \nis used to determine recoverable value, the discount rate is assessed with reference to a market participant; this is not usually materially different to \nthe AstraZeneca post-tax weighted average cost of capital rate of 7%. Legacy Alexion assets have been tested for impairment at risk-adjusted post-tax \ndiscount rates ranging between 8.5% to 10.5% as they are integrated into the Group. No impairments have been recognised on these assets.\n The estimates used in calculating the recoverable amount are considered significant estimates, highly sensitive and depend on assumptions \nspecific to the nature of the Group’s activities including:\n>\t outcome of R&D activities\n>\t probability of technical and regulatory success\n>\t market volume, share and pricing (to derive peak year sales)\n>\t amount and timing of projected future cash flows\n>\t sales erosion curves following patent expiry.\nFor assets held at fair value less costs to sell, we make appropriate adjustments to reflect market participant assessments.\nIn 2022, the Group recorded impairment charges of $146m in respect of launched products. Impairment charges recorded against products in \ndevelopment totalled $172m due to decisions made to terminate the related activities.\nIn 2021, the Group recorded impairment charges of $603m in respect of launched products, including Bydureon ($469m, revised carrying amount \nof $50m) under value in use model, roxadustat ($121m, revised carrying amount of $215m) under value in use model and other launched products \ntotalling $13m. \nImpairment charges recorded against products in development in 2021, based on fair value less costs to sell, totalled $1,464m, principally Ardea \n($1,172m) which was fully impaired following the decision to discontinue development of verinurad. The remaining impairments relate to full impairments \nof various products in development, due to either management’s decision to discontinue development as part of a Group-wide portfolio prioritisation \nreview, or due to the outcome of research activities.\nIn 2020, the Group recorded impairment charges of $350m in respect of launched products, including Duaklir ($200m, revised carrying amount of \n$210m) under fair value less costs to sell, Bydureon ($102m, revised carrying amount of $581m) under value in use model, and other launched products \ntotalling $48m. The fair value less costs to sell valuation model for Duaklir was based on discounted cash flows, and was categorised at Level 3 in \nthe fair value hierarchy. Key assumptions in this model were forecast future revenue and costs of production. Impairment charges recorded against \nproducts in development totalled $55m.\nThe Group has performed an assessment on assets which have had impairments recorded in previous periods to determine if any reversals of \nimpairments were required. Impairment reversals of $94m were recorded in 2022, including $77m in respect of products in development. No impairment \nreversals were recorded in 2021. Impairment reversals of $165m were recorded in 2020 in respect of launched products, including FluMist ($147m, \nrevised carrying amount of $300m, driven by expanded vaccination efforts increasing global demand), and other launched products of $18m.\nWhen launched products, such as the ones detailed above, are partially impaired, the carrying values of these assets in future periods are particularly \nsensitive to changes in forecast assumptions, including those assumptions set out above, as the asset is impaired down to its recoverable amount. \nSignificant assets\nCarrying value\nRemaining \namortisation\n$m\nperiod\nC5 franchise (Soliris/Ultomiris) intangible assets arising from the acquisition of Alexion\n 16,040\n5 to 13 years\nIntangible assets arising from the acquisition of Acerta Pharma\n 4,817\n10 years\nStrensiq, Kanuma and Andexxa intangible assets arising from the acquisition of Alexion\n 4,583\n10 to 16 years\nEnhertu intangible assets acquired from Daiichi Sankyo\n 2,960\n11 years\nIntangible asset products in development arising from the acquisition of Alexion1\n 2,760\nNot amortised\nIntangible assets arising from the acquisition of ZS Pharma\n 2,012\n9 years\nOther intangible assets (DS-1062) acquired from Daiichi Sankyo1\n 937\nNot amortised\nIntangible assets arising from the restructuring of a historical joint venture with MSD\n 569\n4 to 7 years\nFarxiga/Forxiga intangible assets acquired from BMS\n 528\n4 years\nIntangible assets arising from the acquisition of Pearl Therapeutics\n 462\n6 to 7 years\nRSV franchise assets arising from the acquisition of MedImmune \n 458\n3 years\nMonalizumab intangible assets acquired from Innate Pharma1\n 350\nNot amortised\n1 Assets in development are not amortised but are tested annually for impairment.\nThe acquisition of intangible assets relating to DS-1062 in 2020 was assessed under the optional concentration test in IFRS 3 and was determined \nto be an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the value of the gross assets acquired was concentrated in a single asset. \n163\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\nCorporate Governance\nAdditional Information\nFinancial Statements\nStrategic Report"

      "text": "19 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings continued\nA gain of $2m was made during the year on the fair value of bonds designated as fair value through profit or loss, due to increased credit risk. A gain \nof $31m has been made on these bonds since designation due to increased credit risk. Under IFRS 9, the Group records the component of fair value \nchanges relating to the component of own credit risk through Other comprehensive income. Changes in credit risk had no material effect on any \nother financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the Group Financial Statements. The change in fair value attributable to changes in \ncredit risk is calculated as the change in fair value not attributable to market risk. The amount payable at maturity on bonds designated at fair value \nthrough profit or loss is $287m.\nThe interest rates used to discount future cash flows for fair value adjustments, where applicable, are based on market swap curves at the reporting \ndate, and were as follows: \n2022\n2021\n2020\nLoans and borrowings\n 4.3% to 4.9%\n 0.1% to 0.6%\n (0.5)% to 0.1%\n20 Trade and other payables\n2022\n2021\n2020\n$m\n$m\n$m\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade payables\n 2,550\n 2,824\n 2,350\nValue-added and payroll taxes and social security\n 468\n 463\n 390\nRebates, chargebacks, returns and other revenue accruals\n 6,078\n 5,298\n 4,772\nClinical trial accruals\n 1,417\n 1,047\n 699\nOther accruals\n 5,551\n 5,649\n 3,905\nCollaboration Revenue contract liabilities\n 12\n 12\n 12\nVaccine contract liabilities\n 169\n 1,003\n 1,616\nDeferred government grant income\n 1\n 67\n 253\nContingent consideration\n 757\n 849\n 647\nAcerta Pharma share purchase liability (Note 26)\n 867\n 920\n –\nOther payables\n 1,170\n 806\n 1,141\nTotal\n 19,040\n 18,938\n 15,785\nNon-current liabilities\nAccruals\n 37\n 25\n 56\nCollaboration Revenue contract liabilities\n 14\n 26\n 38\nContingent consideration\n 1,465\n 2,016\n 2,676\nAcerta Pharma share purchase liability (Note 26)\n 779\n 1,538\n 2,297\nOther payables\n 1,975\n 1,328\n 1,017\nTotal\n 4,270\n 4,933\n 6,084\nIncluded within Rebates, chargebacks, returns and other revenue accruals are contract liabilities of $87m (2021: $99m; 2020: $77m). The revenue \nrecognised in the year for contract liabilities is $86m, comprising $74m relating to other revenue accruals and $12m Collaboration Revenue contract \nliabilities. The major markets with Rebates, chargebacks, returns and other revenue accruals are the US where the liability at 31 December 2022 \namounted to $3,961m (2021: $3,172m; 2020: $3,126m), of which Rare Disease comprises $139m (2021: $127m), and China where the liability at \n31 December 2022 amounted to $579m (2021: $814m; 2020: $740m).\nTrade payables includes $67m (2021: $44m; 2020: $248m) due to suppliers that have signed up to a supply chain financing programme, under which \nthe suppliers can elect on an invoice-by-invoice basis to receive a discounted early payment from the relationship bank rather than being paid in \nline with the agreed payment terms. If the option is taken, the Group’s liability is assigned by the supplier to be due to the relationship bank rather \nthan the supplier. The value of the liability payable by the Group remains unchanged. The Group assesses the arrangement against indicators to \nassess if debts which vendors have sold to the funder under the supplier financing scheme continue to meet the definition of trade payables or \nshould be classified as borrowings. At 31 December 2022, the payables met the criteria of Trade payables. The supply chain financing programme \noperates in the US, UK, Sweden and Germany, and as at 31 December 2022, the programme had 420 suppliers enrolled across these countries.\nVaccine contract liabilities relate to amounts received from customers, primarily government bodies, in advance of supply of product. Substantially \nall of the Vaccine contract liabilities are expected to be recognised as revenue during the next financial year. The revenue recognised in the year \nrelated to Vaccine contract liabilities held at the beginning of the year was $686m.\nDeferred government grant income relates to government grants received or receivable but for which the related expenses have not been incurred.\nIncluded within current Other payables are liabilities to Daiichi Sankyo totalling $100m (2021: $nil; 2020: $146m) resulting from the collaboration \nagreement in relation to Enhertu entered into in March 2019 and $nil (2021: $324m; 2020: $324m) in relation to DS-1062 entered into in July 2020. \nAdditionally, included within non-current Other payables are liabilities totalling $1,125m (2021: $100m; 2020: $100m) as a result of the Enhertu \ncollaboration agreement and $nil (2021: $nil; 2020: $323m) as a result of the DS-1062 collaboration agreement.\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\ncontinued\n170\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "In November 2020, Calquence received marketing approval in the EU, which removed all remaining conditionality in respect of the Acerta Pharma \nput and call options regarding the non-controlling interest; the option was exercised in April 2021 (see Note 26). In October 2019, an amendment \nto the share purchase and option agreement (SPOA) with the sellers of Acerta Pharma (originally entered into in December 2015) came into effect, \nchanging certain terms of the SPOA on both the timing and also reducing the maximum consideration that would be required to be made to acquire \nthe remaining outstanding shares of Acerta Pharma if the options were exercised. The payments will be made in similar annual instalments in \n2022 through to 2024, with the first payment of $920m made in 2022. The changes to the terms are reflected in the assumptions used to calculate \nthe amortised cost of the liability as at 31 December 2022 of $1,646m (2021: $2,458m; 2020: $2,297m). Interest arising from amortising the liability \nis included within Finance Expense (see Note 3).

The divestment resulted in the remaining outstanding Contingent \nconsideration payable of $121m related to these assets being extinguished on the basis that AstraZeneca is no longer obliged to make such payments to Almirall.\nContingent consideration arising from business combinations is fair valued using decision-tree analysis, with key inputs including the probability \nof success, consideration of potential delays and the expected levels of future revenues.\nRevaluations of Contingent consideration are recognised in Selling, general and administrative expense and include an increase of $182m in 2022 \n(2021: an increase of $42m; 2020: a decrease of $51m) based on revised milestone probabilities, and revenue and royalty forecasts, relating to the \nacquisition of BMS’s share of the Global Diabetes Alliance. Discount unwind on the liability is included within Finance expense (see Note 3).\nThe discount rate used for the Contingent consideration balances range from 3% to 9%. The most significant Contingent consideration balance is \nthe Global Diabetes Alliance which is discounted at 8% and is reviewed against comparable benchmarks on a regular basis.\nManagement has identified that reasonably possible changes in certain key assumptions, including the likelihood of achieving successful trial results, \nobtaining regulatory approval, the projected market share of the therapy area and expected pricing for launched products, may cause the calculated \nfair value of the above contingent consideration to vary materially in future years.\nThe contingent consideration balance relating to BMS’s share of Global Diabetes Alliance of $2,124m (2021: $2,544m; 2020: $2,932m) would increase/\ndecrease by $212m with an increase/decrease in sales of 10% as compared with the current estimates.\nThe maximum development and sales milestones payable under outstanding Contingent consideration arrangements arising on business combinations \nare as follows:\nNature of\nMaximum future milestones\nAcquisitions\nYear\ncontingent consideration\n$m\nSpirogen \n2013\nMilestones\n 180\nAmplimmune\n2013\nMilestones\n 150\nAlmirall1\n2014\nMilestones and royalties\n 345\n1 These contingent consideration liabilities have been designated as the hedge instrument in a net investment hedge of foreign currency risk arising on the Group’s underlying US dollar net \ninvestments held in non-US dollar denominated subsidiaries. Exchange differences on the retranslation of the contingent consideration liability are recognised in Other comprehensive \nincome to the extent that the hedge is effective. Any ineffectiveness is taken to profit.\nThe amount of royalties payable under the arrangements is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, given the direct link to future sales and the \nrange of outcomes.

As such, once established, \nthese amounts remain in Provisions until settlement is reached and uncertainty resolved, with no transfer to Trade and other payables prior to payment.\nSeverance provisions arise predominantly in connection with global restructuring initiatives, including the Post Alexion Acquisition Group Review, \nwhich involve rationalisation of the global supply chain, the sales and marketing organisation, IT and business support infrastructure, and R&D. \nIn conjunction with the acquisition of Alexion in 2021, the enlarged Group initiated a comprehensive Post Alexion Acquisition Group Review, aimed \nat integrating systems, structure and processes, optimising the global footprint and prioritising resource allocations and investments. The Group \nhas also continued to progress other legacy restructuring programmes.\nEmployee costs in connection with the initiatives are recognised in severance provisions when a detailed formal plan has been communicated to \nthose employees affected. Final severance costs are often subject to the completion of the requisite consultations on the areas impacted, with the \nmajority of the cost expected to be paid within one year. AstraZeneca endeavours to support employees affected by restructuring initiatives to \nseek alternative roles within the organisation. Where the employee is successful, any severance provisions will be released.\nDetails of the Environmental provisions totalling $131m (2021: $90m; 2020: $100m) and ongoing matters are provided in Note 30. The legal issues are \noften subject to substantial uncertainties with regard to the timing and final amounts of any payments. A significant proportion of the total legal \nprovision relates to matters settled, but not paid, in previous periods.

      "text": "22 Post-retirement and other defined benefit schemes\nBackground\nThis section predominantly covers defined benefit arrangements like post retirement pension and medical plans which make up the vast bulk of the \nGroup’s liabilities. However, it also incorporates other benefits which fall under IAS 19 rules and which require an actuarial valuation, including but \nnot limited to: Lump Sum plans, Long Service Awards and defined contribution pension plans which have some defined benefit characteristics \n(e.g. a minimum guaranteed level of benefit). In total, over 50 plans in 28 countries are covered.\nThe Group and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees. The Group’s policy is to provide defined \ncontribution (DC) orientated pension provision to its employees unless otherwise compelled by local regulation. As a result, many of these retirement \nplans are DC, where the Group contribution and resulting charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees’ pay. However, several \nplans, mainly in the UK, the US and Sweden, are defined benefit (DB), where benefits are based on employees’ length of service and linked to their \nsalary. The major DB plans are largely legacy arrangements as they have been closed to new entrants since 2000, apart from the collectively bargained \nSwedish plan (which is still open to employees born before 1979). During 2010, following consultation with its UK employees’ representatives, the \nGroup introduced a freeze on pensionable pay at 30 June 2010 levels for DB members of the UK Pension Fund. The number of active members in \nthe Fund continues to decline and is now 452 employees. In November 2017, the Group closed the qualified and non-qualified US DB pension plans \nto future accrual (and removed any salary link) from 31 December 2017. \nThe major DB plans are funded through separate, fiduciary-administered assets. The cash funding of the plans, which may from time to time involve \nspecial Group payments, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that the assets are sufficient to meet future \nobligations as and when they fall due. The funding level is monitored by the Group and local fiduciaries, who take into account the strength of the \nGroup’s covenant, local regulation, cash flows, and the solvency and maturity of the pension scheme.\nWith a general improvement in funding solvency over the course of 2022, three of the Group’s defined benefit plans had surplus positions, with three \nother plans close to full funding and therefore to surplus. As a result, the Group reviewed its policy on surplus recognition, paying particular attention \nto the requirements of IFRIC 14 ‘IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’. The Group \nconcluded that in five instances, the surplus would be repayable, while a small surplus in Sweden was derecognised.\nFinancing Principles and Funding Framework\nEighty eight per cent of the Group’s total DB obligations (or 56% of net obligations) at 31 December 2022 are in schemes within the UK, the US and \nSweden. In these countries, the pension obligations are funded in line with the Group’s financing principles, as disclosed in prior years. There were \nno changes to these principles during 2022.\nThe Group has developed a long-term funding framework to implement these principles. This framework targets either full funding on a low-risk \nfunding measure, or buyout with an external insurer as the pension funds mature, with affordable long-term de-risking of investment strategy \nalong the way. Unless local regulation dictates otherwise, this framework determines the cash contributions payable. \nUK\nThe UK Pension Fund represents approximately 59% of the Group’s DB obligations at 31 December 2022. The financing principles are modified in \nlight of the UK regulatory requirements (summarised below) and resulting discussions with the Trustee.\nRole of Trustee and Regulation\nThe UK Pension Fund is governed and administered by a corporate Trustee which is legally separate from the Group. The Trustee Directors are \ncomprised of representatives appointed by both the employer and employees and include an independent professional Trustee Director. The Trustee \nDirectors are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible in particular for investment strategy and the \nday-to-day administration of the benefits. They are also responsible for jointly agreeing with the employer the level of contributions due to the UK \nPension Fund.\nThe UK pensions market is regulated by The Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website, \nwww.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk.\nThe Pension Scheme Act 2021 became effective in the UK from 1 October 2021. A section of this Act places additional legal requirements on \ncompanies who sponsor UK defined benefit pension schemes, to monitor and assess corporate activity, with a focus on the potential impact of \nsuch activity on the ongoing security of these benefits. The Group has developed a framework to ensure it meets its responsibilities under the Act.\nThere have been two UK High Court Rulings relating to Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMP) equalisation in 2018 and 2020. Following the publication \nof guidance around implementation in 2021, the Trustee, with input from the Group, has made significant progress in equalising benefits. Further \ndetails are set out later on in this Note. An estimate of the impact of these changes has already been recognised in 2018 and 2020, and actual \nexperience is in line with the estimates previously recognised.\nFunding requirements\nUK legislation requires that DB pension schemes are funded prudently. On a triennial basis, the Trustee and the Group must agree on a set of \nassumptions used to value the liabilities as a part of an actuarial valuation. Together with the asset valuation, this facilitates the calculation of a \nfunding level and of the contributions required (if any) to ensure the UK Pension Fund is fully funded over an appropriate time period and on a \nsuitably prudent measure. The technical provisions assumptions used to value the liabilities for the triennial actuarial valuation are usually set more \nprudently than the assumptions used to prepare an accounting valuation of the liabilities, which are set under IAS 19 rules to be a ‘best estimate’.\n173\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\nCorporate Governance\nAdditional Information\nFinancial Statements\nStrategic Report"

      "text": "22 Post-retirement and other defined benefit schemes continued\nThe last full actuarial valuation of the UK Pension Fund was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 31 March 2019. It was finalised in June 2020 \nand in early 2021, the Pensions Regulator acknowledged the outcome and no issues were raised. The funding assumptions used in this actuarial \nvaluation were set out in the Group’s 2020 report. The actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2022 is currently in progress, with a likely timescale for \ncompletion during the second quarter of 2023. However, the value of the Fund’s obligations disclosed at 31 December 2022 incorporates data \nfrom this latest actuarial valuation including updated membership information and demographic assumptions.\nAspects of the triennial actuarial valuation are governed by a long-term funding agreement, effective since October 2016 and which sets out a \npath to full funding on a low-risk measure. Under this agreement, if a deficit exists, the Group is required to provide security. A key element of this \nsecurity is to grant a charge in favour of the Trustee over land and buildings on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, required to be effective within \nthree months of the practical completion of the site, or by 30 June 2023 (whichever is earlier). An extension was granted by the Trustee to this \nbackstop date in 2022. This charge is not currently in force. When effective, the charge would only crystallise in the event of the Group’s insolvency. \nThis charge will provide long-term security in respect of future UK Pension Fund contributions and is capped at £350m.\nIn relation to deficit recovery contributions, a lump sum contribution of £39m was made in March 2022, with a further £39m contribution due before \n31 March 2023. In addition, a contribution of £30m was also made in March 2022, which was a final instalment of a separate deferred contribution \nexplained below.\nDuring 2017, the Group provided a letter of credit to the Trustee, to underwrite the deferral of an additional deficit recovery contribution of approximately \n£126m which was due in 2017. This contribution was paid in five instalments (with interest) from March 2018 to March 2022. The letter of credit \nunderwriting these payments reduced in value as each annual payment was made and given all payments have been made, the letter of credit has \nnow expired.\nSubstantial progress was made over 2022 in equalising GMP for members of the UK Pension Fund. The method of equalisation adopted was to \nconvert GMP to simplify the structure and administration of benefits. As at 31 December 2022, a majority of pensioner and dependent members \nhave had their benefits equalised. Further work will be completed over 2023 to address equalisation for the remaining affected members. As part of \nthe GMP equalisation project, a Pension Increase Exchange (“PiE”) option has also been provisionally made available to the majority of pensioner \nmembers, at the Group’s discretion. This option provides the member with a choice to opt for a higher pension right away, but with no (or fewer) \ninflation linked increases in the future. The PIE option element of the project is currently ongoing and if it proceeds, will not conclude until 2023.\nUnder the governing documentation of the UK Pension Fund, any future surplus in the Fund would be returnable to the Group by refund assuming \ngradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the Fund. In particular, the Trustee has no unilateral right to wind up the Fund without Company \nconsent nor does it have the power to unilaterally use surplus to augment benefits prior to wind-up. As such, there are no adjustments required in \nrespect of IFRIC 14 ‘IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’.\nOn current bases, it is expected that ongoing contributions (excluding those in respect of past service deficit contributions) during the year ending \n31 December 2023 for the UK scheme will be approximately $20m.\nLiquidity and liability hedging\nSignificant increases in UK Government bond yields over September and October created liquidity challenges for many UK defined benefit schemes \nwith liability hedging portfolios, who needed to post collateral quickly to meet margin calls on derivative holdings. The Group’s UK Pension Fund \nwas not adversely impacted over this period due to a combination of Group and Trustee oversight and a functioning risk management policy. The \nUK Pension Fund did not require any financial support from the Group, was self-sufficient and operated normally throughout this period. The Fund \nmaintained its investment strategy and funding solvency materially improved over the year. Furthermore, with the UK Pension Fund ahead of its long \nterm plan, this improvement allowed the Trustee, with support from the Group to de-risk investment strategy ahead of plan, reducing long term \ninvestment risk both to the Group and members in an affordable manner.\nUnited States and Sweden\nThe US and Sweden plans account for 13% and 16%, respectively, of the Group’s defined benefit obligations. The US and Sweden pension plans \nare governed by Fiduciary Bodies with responsibility for the investment of the assets. These plans are funded in line with the Group’s financing \nprinciples and local regulations.\nThe US defined benefit pension plans were actuarially revalued at 31 December 2022, when plan obligations were $907m and plan assets were $835m. \nThis includes obligations in respect of the non-qualified plan which is unfunded. The qualified US pension plan is close to fully funded on an IAS 19 \nbasis and has a positive funding balance on the local statutory measure. As such, no contributions are required, and the investment strategy is \nlargely de-risked. During 2022, the Group submitted the legal documentation required to terminate the plan and move to a full buy-out and settlement \nof the liabilities. This process is currently ongoing and if the Group proceeds, it is not expected to complete until midway 2023 at the earliest.\nThe Swedish defined benefit pension plans were actuarially valued at 31 December 2022, when plan obligations were estimated to amount to \n$1,312m and plan assets were $946m. The local Swedish GAAP funding position can influence contribution policy. Over 2022, for the main \npension fund, the Group did not request a reimbursement of benefit payments made throughout the year, which totalled approximately $44m.\nOn current bases, it is expected that ongoing contributions (excluding those in respect of past service deficit contributions) during the year ending \n31 December 2023 for the United States and Sweden will be approximately $55m.\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\ncontinued\n174\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "Other defined benefit plans\nThe Group provides benefit plans other than pensions which have to be reported under IAS 19. These include Lump Sum plans, Long Service Awards \nand defined contribution pension plans which have a guaranteed minimum benefit. However, the largest category of these ‘other’ non-pension plans \nare healthcare benefits.\nIn the US, and to a lesser extent in certain other countries, the Group’s employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life assurance \nbenefits for eligible retired employees. As at 31 December 2022, some 3,393 retired employees and covered dependants currently benefit from \nthese provisions and some 2,339 current employees will be eligible on their retirement. The Group accrues for the present value of such retiree \nobligations over the working life of the employee. In practice, these benefits will be funded with reference to the financing principles.\nIn the US, the Post Retirement Welfare Plan which provides retiree medical benefits has a surplus of $62m. As a result, the investment strategy \nhas been fully de-risked. The Group has concluded that under current legislation, the surplus would be repayable in the future to subsidise other \nmedical benefits offered to employees. As such, there are no adjustments required in respect of IFRIC 14 ‘IAS 19 – The limit on a Defined Benefit \nAsset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’.\nThe cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2022 was $1m (2021: $1m; 2020: $1m). Plan assets were $173m and plan \nobligations were $129m at 31 December 2022. These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement benefits under IAS 19.\nFinancial assumptions\nQualified independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations under IAS 19 for the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group \nto 31 December 2022. The assumptions used may not necessarily be borne out in practice, due to the inherent financial and demographic uncertainty \nassociated with making long-term projections.

These are compared to actual experience and adjusted where sufficient \ndata are available.

      "text": "22 Post-retirement and other defined benefit schemes continued\nRisks associated with the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes\nThe UK defined benefit plan accounts for 59% of the Group’s defined benefit obligations and exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most \nsignificant of which are:\nRisk\nDescription\nMitigation\nVolatile asset \nreturns \nThe Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO) is calculated using a discount rate \nset with reference to AA-rated corporate bond yields; asset returns that \ndiffer from the discount rate will create an element of volatility in the \nsolvency ratio. Approximately 60% of the UK Pension Fund is invested in \ngrowth assets. Although these growth assets are expected to outperform \nAA-rated corporate bonds in the long term, they can lead to volatility and \nmismatching risk in the short term. The allocation to growth assets is \nmonitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the UK Pension Fund’s \nlong-term objectives.\nIn order to mitigate investment risk, the Trustee invests in a suitably \ndiversified range of asset classes, return drivers and investment managers. \nThe investment strategy will evolve to further improve the expected risk/\nreturn profile as opportunities arise. De-risking of the investment strategy \ntook place over 2022, as the Fund moved ahead of its long-term target, with \nexposure to Growth Assets reducing from approximately 72.5% to 61.0%.\nThe Trustee has hedged approximately 93% of unintended non-sterling, \noverseas currency risk within the UK Pension Fund assets.\nChanges in \nbond yields \nA decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the present value placed \non the DBO for accounting purposes.\nThe interest rate hedge of the UK Pension Fund is implemented via holding \ngilts (and gilt repurchase agreements or “gilt repo”) of appropriate duration, \nset to target a hedge ratio of approximately 100% of total assets. This hedge \nprotects to a large degree against falls in long-term interest rates and the \nUK Pension Fund is approximately 98% hedged as a percentage of assets \nat the end of 2022. Furthermore, over 2022, the liability hedging benchmark \nwas moved to a 100% gilt-based hedging strategy to reduce funding basis \nrisk and almost all net swap exposure was removed. Nonetheless, there \nremain differences in the bonds and instruments held by the UK Pension \nFund to hedge interest rate risk on the statutory and long-term funding \nbasis (gilts and gilt repo) and the bonds analysed to set the DBO discount \nrate on an accounting basis (AA corporate bonds). As such, there remains \nsome mismatching risk (albeit less than in previous years) on an accounting \nbasis should yields on gilts diverge compared to AA corporate bonds.\nInflation risk \nThe majority of the DBO is indexed in line with price inflation (mainly \ninflation as measured by the UK Retail Price Index (RPI) but also for some \nmembers a component of pensions is indexed by the UK Consumer Price \nIndex (CPI)) and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although, in \nmost cases, this is capped at an annual increase of 5%). It was confirmed \nin November 2020 the intention to align RPI with Consumer Price Index \nincluding Housing (CPIH) from 2030. Other things being equal, this will \nlead to lower liability valuations.\nThe UK Pension Fund holds RPI index-linked gilts and gilt repo. As with \nthe interest rate hedge, the liability benchmark was changed over 2022 to \nfacilitate hedging solely with gilts rather than the previous mix of gilts and \nswaps. The inflation hedge of the UK Pension Fund protects to some degree \nagainst higher-than-expected inflation increases on the DBO (approximately \n93% hedged as a percentage of assets at the end of 2022). There is a \nframework in place to gradually increase the level of inflation hedging to \n100% of assets over time.\nLife \nexpectancy \nThe majority of the UK Pension Fund’s obligations are to provide benefits \nfor the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an \nincrease in the liabilities.\nThe UK Pension Fund entered into a longevity swap during 2013 which \nprovides hedging against the longevity risk of increasing life expectancy \nover the next 75 years for around 10,000 of the UK Pension Fund’s current \npensioners and covers $1.9bn of the UK Pension Fund’s liabilities. \nA one-year increase in life expectancy would result in a $191m increase in \npension fund obligations, which would be partially offset by a $103m \nincrease in the value of the longevity swap and hence the pension fund \nassets. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term mortality \nassumptions is not yet known. The Group will conduct a mortality review \nonce robust data is available.\nOther risks\nThere are a number of other risks of administering the UK Pension Fund which the Trustee manages with Group input. Some of the major risks \ninclude counterparty risks from using derivatives and collateral management risk (mitigated by using a specialist investment manager to oversee a \ndiversified range of counterparties of high standing, ensuring positions are collateralised daily and having a robust collateral management policy). \nFurthermore, there are operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits) and legislative risks (such as the pensions regulator introducing \nnew legislation). These are mitigated so far as possible via the governance structure in place which oversees and administers the pension funds.\nThe Group’s pension plans in the US and Sweden also manage these key risks, where they are relevant, in a similar way, with the local fiduciary \nbodies investing in a diversified manner and employing a framework to hedge interest rate risk.\nLocal fiduciary boards are aware of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks as they pertain to investment policy, and where local regulation \nallows, have policies in place to monitor and manage such risks and comply with local legislation and disclosure requirements.\nAssets and obligations of defined benefit schemes\nThe assets and obligations of the defined benefit schemes operated by the Group at 31 December 2022, as calculated in accordance with IAS 19, \nare shown below. The fair values of the schemes’ assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change \nbefore they are realised. The present value of the schemes’ obligations is derived from cash flow projections over long periods and is therefore \ninherently uncertain.\nThere has been a material fall in both asset and liability valuations over 2022, predominantly due to significant increases in long-term global bond \nyields. This had the impact of lowering liability and asset valuations.\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\ncontinued\n176\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nFinancial Statements"

The put option gave rise to a liability (see Note 20). The ability of the parties to exercise their respective put and call options, as well as \nthe timing and amount of exercise, was dependent on certain conditions, the last of which was based on regulatory outcomes of Calquence in the EU. \nIn November 2020, Calquence received marketing approval in the EU, which removed all remaining conditionality in respect of the options. From \nNovember 2020, the minority shareholders were considered to have no further substantive variability in risk and reward related to their shares as it \nwas considered highly likely that one of the options would be exercised, and the price of the options was fixed. Therefore, from November 2020, no \nfurther amounts of the consolidated AstraZeneca result were attributed to the minority shareholders of Acerta Pharma. The Non-controlling interests \nreserve relating to the minority shareholders of Acerta Pharma, totalling $1,401m, was reclassified into Retained earnings (see Consolidated Statement \nof Changes in Equity) in 2020. AstraZeneca exercised its option to acquire the remaining 45% of shares in Acerta Pharma in April 2021.\nAs part of the acquisition of Alexion in July 2021, a pre-existing non-controlling interest in Caelum Biosciences was recognised (Note 27). This was \nvalued at $150m, the agreed-upon exercise price for the exclusive option to acquire the remaining equity. The option was exercised on 28 September \n2021 and the acquisition of Caelum Biosciences closed shortly thereafter on 5 October 2021.\n181\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\nCorporate Governance\nAdditional Information\nFinancial Statements\nStrategic Report"

      "text": "27 Acquisition of business operations\nAcquisitions of business operations in 2022\nOn 16 November 2022, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued shares of LogicBio Therapeutics, Inc. (LogicBio) based in \nLexington, MA, US. LogicBio is a clinical-stage genetic medicine company pioneering genome editing and gene delivery platforms to address rare \nand serious diseases from infancy through adulthood. The total consideration was $72m. Cash of $68m was paid on the completion date, with $4m \nof outstanding options, which will be settled in cash, recorded in current Trade and other payables. Goodwill of $15m, assets of $82m, including $46m \nof intangible assets, and liabilities of $25m were recognised on acquisition. LogicBio’s results have been consolidated into the Group’s results from \n16 November 2022.\nAcquisitions of business operations in 2021\nOn 21 July 2021, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued shares of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Alexion), based in Boston, MA, \nUS. Alexion is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on serving patients and families affected by rare diseases and devastating conditions \nthrough the discovery, development and commercialisation of life-changing medicines.\nAt closing, Alexion shareholders received 2.1243 AstraZeneca American Depository Shares (ADSs) and $60 in cash for each of their Alexion shares. \nUnvested Alexion employee share awards were converted to equivalent AstraZeneca share awards. The fair value of the purchase consideration \nwas $41,058m, comprising AstraZeneca ADSs of $27,196m, cash of $13,349m and replacement employee share awards of $513m.\nThe Group funded the cash element of the acquisition with $8bn of new long-term debt, issued in May and June 2021, $4bn of term loans drawn in \nJuly 2021 under the $17.5bn committed bank facilities entered into in December 2020 to secure the acquisition financing, and existing cash balances. \nThe Group cancelled the remaining $13.5bn of the facilities in June, July and October 2021. Loans and borrowings of $2.3bn acquired with Alexion \nwere repaid in full shortly following completion of the acquisition. \nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business \nCombinations’ and consequently the Alexion assets acquired, and liabilities assumed were recorded by AstraZeneca at fair value, with the excess \nof the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities being recognised as goodwill. \n As part of the Alexion acquisition in 2021, we identified the assets (comprising principally launched products and IPR&D post pre-clinical stage) \nand liabilities acquired. Attributing fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of business combinations is considered to be a \nkey judgement. The purchase price allocation was performed with assistance from an independent valuer to advise on the valuation techniques \nand key assumptions in the valuation, in particular in respect of the valuation of the intangible assets and inventory. \nThe fair values assigned to the Alexion business combination in 2021 were:\nFair value\n$m\nNon-current assets\nProperty, plant and equipment\n 1,135\nRight-of-use assets\n 263\nIntangible assets\n 26,855\nOther non-current assets\n 301\n 28,554\nCurrent assets\nInventories\n 6,769\nTrade and other receivables\n 2,096\nIntangible assets\n 100\nCash and cash equivalents\n 4,086\n 13,051\nCurrent liabilities\nInterest-bearing loans and borrowings\n (2,336)\nTrade and other payables\n (1,192)\nOther current liabilities\n (40)\n (3,568)\nNon-current liabilities\nLease liabilities\n (228)\nDeferred tax liabilities\n (4,191)\nOther non-current liabilities\n (697)\n (5,116)\nTotal net assets acquired\n 32,921\nLess: non-controlling interests\n (150)\nGoodwill\n 8,287\nTotal fair value of consideration\n 41,058\nLess: fair value of equity consideration\n (27,196)\nLess: fair value of replacement employee share awards\n (513)\nLess: cash and cash equivalents acquired\n (4,086)\nNet cash outflow\n 9,263\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\ncontinued\n182\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nFinancial Statements"

These were fair valued using the multi-period excess earnings method, which uses a number of estimates \nregarding the amount and timing of future cash flows. The key assumptions in the cash flows are PTRS, peak year sales and revenue erosion curves. \nIn accordance with the Group’s policy on impairment assessments as set out on page 148, the assets were assessed for impairment in the final \nquarter of 2022 and 2021. Future milestones have been included in the valuation of the intangible assets (as a deduction of cash flows). \nThe fair value of inventory, which includes raw materials, work in progress and finished goods related to the launched products was estimated at \n$6,769m, an uplift of $5,635m on the carrying value prior to the acquisition. The fair value adjustment relates only to work in progress and finished \ngoods and was calculated as the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell the inventory, associated margins on these activities and \nholding costs. The vast majority of the fair value uplift has been unwound by 31 December 2022, with the unwind of the remaining inventory fair value \nuplift expected in 2023.\nProperty, plant and equipment principally comprises the manufacturing facilities in Dublin and Athlone, Ireland and was fair valued using a cost \napproach. The estimated fair value of $1,135m represents an uplift of $111m over carrying value. \nThe estimated fair value of contingent liabilities was $76m, relating to various claims and disputes in each case where there is a possible, but not \nprobable, future financial exposure, and involve an assessment of the likelihood of a number of scenarios in relation to those matters. This amount \nhas been included within other non-current liabilities of $697m.\nThe estimated fair value of trade and other receivables was $2,096m, which approximated the contractual cash flows.\nThe net deferred tax position reflected an adjustment of $5,215m related to the deferred tax impact of the fair value uplifts on intangible assets, \ninventories, property, plant and equipment and contingent liabilities as described above.\nGoodwill amounting to $8,287m was recognised on acquisition and is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually could not be quantified. \nMost significant among these is the premium attributable to a pre-existing, well-positioned business in the innovation-intensive, high-growth rare \ndiseases market with a highly skilled workforce and established reputation. Other important elements include the potential unidentified products that \nfuture research and development may yield and the core technological capabilities and knowledge base of the company. Goodwill is not expected \nto be deductible for tax purposes. \nNon-controlling interests reflect Alexion’s pre-existing minority equity interest in Caelum Biosciences and have been valued at $150m, the agreed-\nupon exercise price for the exclusive option to acquire the remaining equity. The option was exercised on 28 September 2021 and the acquisition \nof Caelum Biosciences closed shortly thereafter on 5 October 2021 (Note 26).\nAlexion’s results have been consolidated into the Group’s results from 21 July 2021. For the period from acquisition to 31 December 2021, before \nreflecting the fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition, Alexion’s Total Revenues were $3,071m and Profit after tax was $889m. If the acquisition \nhad taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred (1 January 2021), on a pro forma basis, after reflecting \nthe fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition, the Total Revenue of the combined Group for the year ended 31 December 2021 would have \nbeen $41,132m and the Loss after tax would have been $1,152m. This pro forma information does not purport to represent the results of the combined \nGroup that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2021 and should not be taken to be representative of \nfuture results.\nTotal acquisition-related costs of $4m (2021: $171m) have been incurred by the Group, which include advisory, legal and other professional fees. \nThese costs are presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income within Selling, general and administrative expense.\nThe terms of the acquisition include a retention bonus plan for legacy Alexion employees whereby up to $50m may be used for retention bonus awards \nto employees at the level of Vice President or below. These bonuses vested and were paid six months after the acquisition, or earlier. In 2022, a cost \nof $3m (2021: $24m) has been recorded in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\nUpon completion of the acquisition, all unvested Alexion employee share awards were converted into AstraZeneca restricted stock awards that \ncontinue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied in the corresponding Alexion awards immediately prior to \ncompletion. Alexion Performance Stock Plan (PSU) awards that included performance-based vesting conditions were converted using the greater \nof the original target level and Alexion’s assessment of the level of achievement immediately prior to completion (subject to a limit of 175 per cent. \nfor the awards granted in 2019 and a limit of 150 per cent. for the awards granted in 2020). In the year, a cost of $257m (2021: $257m) has been \nrecorded in the Statement of Comprehensive Income ($9m (2021: $9m)) in Cost of sales, $92m (2021: $73m) in Research and development expense \nand $156m (2021: $175m) in Selling, general and administrative expense). Payments made to the Employee Benefit Trust upon vesting of share \nawards recognised as part of the consideration for the acquisition of Alexion are recognised within investing activities in the Group’s Statement of \nCash Flows as the cash payment relates to the settlement of the obligation that arose on the acquisition of Alexion that was included as part of the \nconsideration for the acquisition.\nThere were no acquisitions of business operations in 2020.\n183\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\nCorporate Governance\nAdditional Information\nFinancial Statements\nStrategic Report"

      "text": "28 Financial risk management objectives and policies\nThe Group’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, loans and other borrowings, lease liabilities, current \nand non-current investments, cash and short-term deposits. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Group’s funding and \nliquidity requirements. The Group has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from \nits operations.\nThe principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency and credit. Each of these is managed \nin accordance with Board-approved policies. These policies, together with the Group’s approach to capital management, are set out below.\nCapital management\nThe capital structure of the Group consists of Shareholders’ equity (Note 24), Debt (Note 19), Other current investments (Note 12) and Cash (Note 17). \nFor the foreseeable future, the Board will maintain a capital structure that supports the Group’s strategic objectives through:\n>\t managing funding and liquidity risk\n>\t optimising shareholder return\n>\t maintaining a strong, investment-grade credit rating.\nThe Group utilises factoring arrangements for selected trade receivables. These factoring arrangements qualify for full derecognition of the associated \ntrade receivables under IFRS 9. Amounts due on invoices that have not been factored at year end, from customers that are subject to factoring \narrangements are disclosed in Note 16.\nFunding and liquidity risk are reviewed regularly by the Board and managed in accordance with policies described below.\nThe Board regularly reviews its shareholders’ distribution policy, which comprises a regular cash dividend and potentially a share repurchase \ncomponent. No share repurchases have been made since 2012.\nThe Group’s net debt position (loans and borrowings net of Cash and cash equivalents, Other investments and Derivative financial instruments) has \ndecreased by $1,399m from a net debt position of $24,322m at the beginning of the year to a net debt position of $22,923m at 31 December 2022. \nGross debt reduced from $30,781m to $29,232m, principally due to the repayment of the $1,000m 2.75% bond and a $250m floating rate note.\nLiquidity risk\nThe Board reviews the Group’s ongoing liquidity risks annually as part of the planning process and on an ad hoc basis. The Board considers \nshort-term requirements against available sources of funding, taking into account forecast cash flows. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining \naccess to a number of sources of funding which are sufficient to meet anticipated funding requirements. Specifically, the Group uses US and \nEuropean commercial paper, bank loans, committed bank facilities and cash resources to manage short-term liquidity and manages long-term \nliquidity by raising funds through the capital markets. At 31 December 2022, the Group was assigned short-term credit ratings of P-2 by Moody’s \nand A-1 by Standard and Poor’s. The Group’s long-term credit rating was A3 Stable outlook by Moody’s and A Stable outlook by Standard and Poor’s.\nIn addition to Cash and cash equivalents of $6,166m, short-term fixed income investments of $13m, fixed deposits of $64m, less overdrafts of $183m \nat 31 December 2022, the Group has committed bank facilities of $4,875m available to manage liquidity. These committed bank facilities have no \nfinancial covenants and mature in April 2026. The Group regularly monitors the credit standing of the banks providing the facilities and currently does \nnot anticipate any issue with drawing on the committed facilities should this be necessary. Advances under these facilities currently bear an interest \nrate per annum based on US dollar LIBOR (or other relevant benchmark rate) plus a margin. The facilities contain arrangements to switch to alternative \nrisk free rate benchmarks before June 2023.\nAt 31 December 2022, the Group has $3,068m outstanding from debt issued under a Euro Medium Term Note programme and $20,651m under an \nSEC-registered programme. The funds made available under these facility agreements may be used for the general corporate purposes of the Group. \nThe maturity profile of the anticipated future contractual cash flows including interest in relation to the Group’s financial liabilities, on an undiscounted \nbasis and which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value, is as follows:\nBank\nTotal\nDerivative\nDerivative\nTotal\noverdrafts\nTrade non-derivative\nfinancial\nfinancial\nderivative\nand other Bonds and\nLease\nand other\nfinancial\ninstruments\ninstruments\nfinancial\nloans bank loans\nliability\npayables\ninstruments\nreceivable\npayable\ninstruments\nTotal\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\nWithin one year\n 667\n 2,136\n 207\n 15,812\n 18,822\n (9,719)\n 9,620\n (99)\n 18,723\nIn one to two years\n –\n 1,839\n 168\n 2,584\n 4,591\n (60)\n 67\n 7\n 4,598\nIn two to three years\n –\n 2,101\n 120\n 1,658\n 3,879\n (59)\n 67\n 8\n 3,887\nIn three to four years\n –\n 1,617\n 82\n 1,728\n 3,427\n (1,151)\n 1,080\n (71)\n 3,356\nIn four to five years\n –\n 2,502\n 53\n 722\n 3,277\n (36)\n 40\n 4\n 3,281\nIn more than five years\n –\n 16,921\n 108\n 1,435\n 18,464\n (1,707)\n 1,652\n (55)\n 18,409\n 667\n 27,116\n 738\n 23,939\n 52,460\n (12,732)\n 12,526\n (206)\n 52,254\nEffect of interest\n –\n (7,974)\n –\n –\n (7,974)\n 379\n (405)\n (26)\n (8,000)\nEffect of discounting, fair values and issue costs\n (1)\n (109)\n (57)\n (2,070)\n (2,237)\n (70)\n 24\n (46)\n (2,283)\n31 December 2020\n 666\n 19,033\n 681\n 21,869\n 42,249\n (12,423)\n 12,145\n (278)\n 41,971\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\ncontinued\n184\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nFinancial Statements"

Other than that, it is not expected that the cash flows in the maturity profile could occur significantly earlier or at significantly \ndifferent amounts, with the exception of $2,222m of contingent consideration held within Trade and other payables (see Note 20).\nMarket risk\nInterest rate risk\nThe Group maintains a Board-approved mix of fixed and floating rate debt and uses underlying debt, interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements \nto manage this mix.\nAt 31 December 2022, interest rate swaps with a notional value of $288m are fair valued through profit or loss and this has effectively converted the \n7% guaranteed debentures payable in 2023 to floating rates. No new interest rate swaps were entered into during 2022. \nThe majority of surplus cash is currently invested in US dollar liquidity funds and investment-grade fixed income securities.\nThe interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments are set out below.

As a consequence, the Group results are presented in US dollars and exposures are managed \nagainst US dollars accordingly.\nTranslational\nApproximately 61% of Group external sales in 2022 were denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, while a significant proportion of \nmanufacturing, and research and development costs were denominated in pounds sterling and Swedish krona. Surplus cash generated by business \nunits is substantially converted to, and held centrally in, US dollars. As a result, operating profit and total cash flow in US dollars will be affected \nby movements in exchange rates.\nThis currency exposure is managed centrally, based on forecast cash flows. The impact of movements in exchange rates is mitigated significantly \nby the correlations which exist between the major currencies to which the Group is exposed and the US dollar. Monitoring of currency exposures \nand correlations is undertaken on a regular basis and hedging is subject to pre-execution approval.\nAs at 31 December 2022, before the impact of derivatives, 2% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in pounds sterling and \n9% were denominated in euros. Where there is non-US dollar debt and an underlying net investment of that amount in the same currency, the Group \napplies net investment hedging. Exchange differences on the retranslation of debt designated as net investment hedges are recognised in Other \ncomprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective. Any ineffectiveness is taken to profit. For details of non-US dollar debt in a \ndesignated hedging relationship please see the Hedge accounting section within this Note 28 from page 188.\nThe Group holds cross-currency swaps to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Fair value movements on the revaluation \nof the cross-currency swaps are recognised in Other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective, with any ineffectiveness taken \nto profit.\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group operates in three countries designated as hyperinflationary, being Argentina, Venezuela and Turkey. The foreign \nexchange risk of these markets has been assessed and deemed to be immaterial.\nTransactional\nThe Group aims to hedge all its forecasted major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three \nmonths. Where practicable, these are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts. In addition, external dividend payments in pounds sterling \nto UK shareholders and in Swedish krona to Swedish shareholders are fully hedged from announcement date to payment date. Foreign exchange \ngains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are taken to profit or to Other comprehensive income if the contract is \nin a designated cashflow hedge.\nSensitivity analysis\nThe sensitivity analysis set out below summarises the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market \nrates and prices. The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year \nperiod. Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date. For long-term debt, an \nincrease in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.\nThe sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2022, \nwith all other variables held constant. Based on the composition of our long-term debt portfolio and cash reserves as at 31 December 2022, a 1% \nincrease in interest rates would result in an additional $52m in interest expense on the debt and an additional $59m interest income on the cash \nreserves. The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at \n31 December 2022, with all other variables held constant. The +10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies \nand the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening of the US dollar.\nEach incremental 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have approximately the same effect as the initial 10% detailed in the \ntable below and each incremental 1% change in interest rates would have approximately the same effect as the 1% detailed in the table below.\nInterest rates\nExchange rates\n31 December 2020\n+1%\n-1%\n+10%\n-10%\nIncrease/(decrease) in fair value of financial instruments ($m)\n 1,696\n (1,758)\n 114\n (132)\nImpact on profit: (loss)/gain ($m)\n –\n –\n (57)\n 74\nImpact on equity: gain/(loss) ($m)\n –\n –\n 171\n (206)\nInterest rates\nExchange rates\n31 December 2021\n+1%\n-1%\n+10%\n-10%\nIncrease/(decrease) in fair value of financial instruments ($m)\n 1,978\n (2,106)\n 82\n (85)\nImpact on profit: gain/(loss) ($m)\n –\n –\n 24\n (9)\nImpact on equity: gain/(loss) ($m)\n –\n –\n 58\n (76)\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\ncontinued\n186\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nFinancial Statements"

The Group \nis also exposed in its Net asset position to its own credit risk in respect of the 2023 debentures which are accounted for at fair value through profit \nor loss. Under IFRS 9, the effect of the losses and gains arising from own credit risk on the fair value of bonds designated at fair value through profit \nor loss are recorded in Other comprehensive income.\nFinancial counterparty credit risk\nThe majority of the AstraZeneca Group’s cash is centralised within the Group treasury entity and is subject to counterparty risk on the principal \ninvested. The level of the Group’s cash investments and hence credit risk will depend on the cash flow generated by the Group and the timing of \nthe use of that cash. The credit risk is mitigated through a policy of prioritising security and liquidity over return and, as such, cash is only invested \nin high credit-quality investments. Counterparty limits are set according to the assessed risk of each counterparty and exposures are monitored \nagainst these limits on a regular basis.\nThe Group’s principal financial counterparty credit risks at 31 December 2022 were as follows:\nCurrent assets\n2022\n2021\n2020\n$m\n$m \n$m\nCash at bank and in hand\n 1,411\n 1,461\n 1,182\nMoney market liquidity funds\n 4,486\n 4,772\n 6,602\nOther short-term cash equivalents\n 269\n 96\n 48\nTotal Cash and cash equivalents (Note 17)\n 6,166\n 6,329\n 7,832\nFixed income securities at fair value through profit and loss (Note 12)\n 13\n 16\n 118\nCash collateral pledged to counterparties (Note 12)\n 162\n –\n –\nFixed deposits (Note 12)\n 64\n 53\n 42\nTotal derivative financial instruments (Note 13)\n 87\n 83\n 142\nCurrent assets subject to credit risk\n 6,492\n 6,481\n 8,134\nNon-current assets\n2022\n2021\n2020\n$m\n$m \n$m\nDerivative financial instruments (Note 13)\n 74\n 102\n 171\nNon-current assets subject to credit risk\n 74\n 102\n 171\nThe majority of the Group’s cash is invested in US dollar AAA rated money market liquidity funds. The money market liquidity fund portfolios are \nmanaged by five external third-party fund managers to maintain an AAA rating. The Group’s investments represent no more than 10% of each \noverall fund value. There were no other significant concentrations of financial credit risk at the reporting date.\nAll financial derivatives are transacted with commercial banks, in line with standard market practice. The Group has agreements with some bank \ncounterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral, for the benefit of the other, equivalent to the market valuation of the derivative \npositions above a predetermined threshold. The carrying value of such cash collateral held by the Group at 31 December 2022 was $89m (2021: $93m; \n2020: $288m) and the carrying value of such cash collateral posted by the Group at 31 December 2022 was $162m (2021: $47m; 2020: $11m).\nThe impairment provision for other financial assets at 31 December 2022 was immaterial.\nTrade receivables\nTrade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the \ncustomer. The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, \nand the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world. Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by \nthe use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance. The Group applies the expected credit loss approach to establish an \nallowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of Trade receivables.\nThe Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all Trade \nreceivables. To measure expected credit losses, Trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit characteristics and the days past due.\nThe expected loss rates are based on payment profiles over a period of 36 months before 31 December 2022, 31 December 2021 or 31 December \n2020 respectively and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current \nand forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customer to settle the receivables.\nOn that basis, the loss allowance was determined as follows:\n0-90 days\n90-180 days\nOver 180 days\n31 December 2020\nCurrent\npast due\npast due\npast due\nTotal\nExpected loss rate\n0.1%\n 1.6%\n 19.4%\n 60.6%\nGross carrying amount ($m)\n 3,659\n 124\n 21\n 25\n 3,829\nLoss allowance ($m)\n 2\n 2\n 4\n 15\n 23\n187\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\nCorporate Governance\nAdditional Information\nFinancial Statements\nStrategic Report"

The income statement credit or charge is recorded \nin Operating profit.\nHedge accounting\nThe Group uses foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and swaps, currency options, interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest \nrate swaps for the purpose of hedging its foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Group may designate certain financial instruments as fair value \nhedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges in accordance with IFRS 9. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge \nrelationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item \nand hedging instrument. Sources of hedge effectiveness will depend on the hedge relationship designation but may include:\n>\t a significant change in the credit risk of either party to the hedging relationship\n>\t a timing mismatch between the hedging instrument and the hedged item\n>\t movements in foreign currency basis spread for derivatives in a fair value hedge\n>\t a significant change in the value of the foreign currency denominated net assets of the Group in a net investment hedge.\nThe hedge ratio for each designation will be established by comparing the quantity of the hedging instrument and the quantity of the hedged item to \ndetermine their relative weighting; for all of the Group’s existing hedge relationships the hedge ratio has been determined as 1:1. Designated hedges \nare expected to be effective and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on profit is not expected to be material. The accounting treatment for fair \nvalue hedges and debt designated as fair value through profit or loss is disclosed in the Group Accounting Policies section from page 142.\nThe following table represents the Group’s continuing designated hedge relationships under IFRS 9.\n2020\nOther comprehensive income\nFair value\nloss\nOpening\nFair value\nrecycled\nClosing\nNominal\nbalance\n(gain)/loss\nto the\nbalance\nAverage\namounts\nCarrying\n1 January\ndeferred\nIncome\n31 December\nAverage\nAverage\npay\nin local\nvalue\n2020\nto OCI\nstatement\n2020\nmaturity\nUSD FX\ninterest\ncurrency\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\nyear\nrate\nrate\nFair value hedge – foreign currency and interest rate risk1\nUSD LIBOR \n+ 1.27%\nCross currency interest rate swap – Euro bond\nEUR 300m\n 43\n –\n –\n –\n –\n2021\n 1.09\nCash flow hedges – foreign currency and interest rate risk2, 4, 5\nCross currency interest rate swaps – Euro bonds\nEUR 2,200m\n 150\n (30)\n (163)\n 239\n 46\n2025\n 1.14\nUSD 2.69%\nFX Forwards − short term FX risk\nUSD 618m\n 5\n –\n (20)\n 15\n (5)\n2021\n –\n –\nNet investment hedge – foreign exchange risk3, 4\nTransactions matured pre-2020\n –\n (565)\n –\n –\n (565)\n –\n –\n –\nCross currency interest rate swap – JPY investment\nJPY 58.5bn\n 19\n (4)\n (15)\n –\n (19)\n2029  108.03\nJPY 1.53%\nCross currency interest rate swap – CNY investment\nCNY 458m\n (2)\n 1\n 1\n –\n 2\n2026\n 6.68\nCNY 4.80%\nForeign currency borrowing – GBP investment\nGBP 350m\n (475)\n (251)\n 18\n –\n (233)\n2031\nn/a\nGBP 5.75%\nForeign currency borrowing – EUR investment6\nEUR 450m\n (548)\n 34\n 51\n –\n 85\n2021\nn/a\nEUR 0.88%\nContingent consideration liabilities and Acerta Pharma \nput option liability – AZUK and AZAB USD investments\nUSD 5,252m\n (5,252)\n 2,053\n (642)\n –\n 1,411\n–\n –\n –\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\ncontinued\n188\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nFinancial Statements"

Payments made to the Employee Benefit \nTrust upon vesting of share awards are recognised within operating cash flows, reflecting the substance of the arrangement in place between the \ngroup and the Trust. The plans are equity settled.\nThe Directors believe that, together with the basic salary system, the Group’s employee incentive schemes provide competitive and market-related \npackages to motivate employees. They should also align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, as a whole, through long-term share \nownership in the Company. The Group’s current US, UK and Swedish schemes are described below, other arrangements apply elsewhere.\nBonus and share plans\nUS \nIn the US, there are two all-employee short-term or annual performance bonus plans in operation to differentiate and reward strong individual \nperformance. Annual bonuses are paid in cash. There is also one senior staff long-term incentive scheme, under which 190 participants may be eligible \nfor awards granted as AstraZeneca ADRs. AstraZeneca ADRs necessary to satisfy the awards are purchased in the market or funded via a share \ntrust. The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan operate in respect of relevant employees in the US.\nUK\nThe AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan \nEmployees of participating AstraZeneca UK companies are invited to participate in this bonus plan, which rewards strong individual performance. \nBonuses are paid in cash.\nThe AstraZeneca UK All-Employee Share Plan \nThe Company offers UK employees the opportunity to buy Partnership Shares (Ordinary Shares). Employees may invest up to £150 a month to \npurchase Partnership Shares in the Company at the current market value. In 2010, the Company introduced a Matching Share element, the first award \nof which was made in 2011. Currently one Matching Share is awarded for every four Partnership Shares purchased. Partnership Shares and Matching \nShares are held in the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)-approved All-Employee Share Plan. At the Company’s AGM in 2002, shareholders approved \nthe issue of new shares for the purposes of the All-Employee Share Plan.\nSweden \nIn Sweden, an all-employee performance bonus plan is in operation, which rewards strong individual performance. Bonuses are paid 50% into a \nfund investing in AstraZeneca equities and 50% in cash. The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme, the AstraZeneca Performance Share \nPlan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan all operate in respect of relevant AstraZeneca employees in Sweden.\nOther bonus and share plans that operate across the Group are described below.\nThe AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme \nThis scheme is a performance bonus scheme for Directors and senior employees who do not participate in the AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus \nPlan. Annual bonuses are paid in cash and reflect both corporate and individual performance measures. The Remuneration Committee has discretion \nto reduce or withhold bonuses if business performance falls sufficiently short of expectations in any year such as to make the payment of \nbonuses inappropriate. \nThe AstraZeneca Deferred Bonus Plan \nThis plan was introduced in 2006 and is used to defer a portion of the bonus earned under the AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme into \nOrdinary Shares in the Company for a period of three years. The plan currently operates only in respect of Executive Directors and members of \nthe SET (with awards granted as AstraZeneca ADRs for members of SET employed within the US). Awards of shares under this plan are typically \nmade in March each year, the first award having been made in February 2006.\nThe AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan \nThis plan was approved by shareholders in 2020 for a period of 10 years (subsequently amended by approval of shareholders in 2021) and replaces \nthe 2014 AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan. Generally, awards can be granted at any time, but not during a closed period of the Company. The \nfirst grant of Performance Share Plan awards was made in May 2014 under the 2014 AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan. Awards granted under \nthe plan vest after three years, or in the case of Executive Directors and members of the SET, after an additional two-year holding period, and is \nsubject to the achievement of performance conditions. For awards granted to all participants in 2022, vesting is subject to a combination of measures \nfocused on science and innovation, revenue growth, financial performance and carbon reduction. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility \nfor agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated, including agreeing performance \ntargets and which employees should be invited to participate. \nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\ncontinued\n29 Employee costs and share plans for employees continued\n190\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nFinancial Statements"

      "text": "The AstraZeneca Investment Plan \nThis plan was introduced in 2010 and approved by shareholders at the 2010 AGM. The final grant of awards under this plan took place in March 2016. \nAwards granted under the plan vest after eight years and are subject to performance conditions measured over a period of four years. \nThe AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan \nThis plan was introduced in 2010. This plan provides for the grant of restricted stock unit (RSU) awards to selected below SET-level employees and \nis used in conjunction with the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan to provide a mix of RSUs and performance shares. Awards typically vest on the \nthird anniversary of the date of grant and are contingent on continued employment with the Company. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility \nfor agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated. \nThe AstraZeneca Restricted Share Plan \nThis plan was introduced in 2008 and provides for the grant of restricted share awards to key employees, excluding Executive Directors. Awards are \nmade on an ad hoc basis with variable vesting dates. The plan has been used four times in 2022 to make awards to 112 employees. The Remuneration \nCommittee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated. \nThe AstraZeneca Extended Incentive Plan \nThis plan was introduced in 2018 and provides for the grant of awards to key employees, excluding Executive Directors. Awards are made on an \nad hoc basis and 50% of the award will normally vest on the fifth anniversary of grant, with the balance vesting on the tenth anniversary of grant. \nThe award can be subject to the achievement of performance conditions. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards \nunder the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated, including agreeing performance targets (if any) and which \nemployees should be invited to participate.\nDetails of share options outstanding during the year for the main share plans are shown below.\nThe AstraZeneca \nPerformance Share Plan\nThe AstraZeneca \nGlobal Restricted Stock Plan\nThe AstraZeneca \n Restricted Share Plan \nThe AstraZeneca \n Extended Incentive Plan \nOrdinary \nShares\nADR \nShares\nOrdinary \nShares\nADR \nShares1\nOrdinary \nShares\nADR \nShares\nOrdinary \nShares\nADR \nShares\n’000\n’000\n’000\n’000\n’000\n’000\n’000\n’000\nOutstanding at 1 January 2020\n 2,859\n 5,206\n 1,328\n 9,770\n 176\n 649\n 282\n 65\nGranted\n 932\n 1,767\n 689\n 3,671\n 80\n 295\n 18\n –\nForfeited\n (191)\n (478)\n (113)\n (1,077)\n (6)\n (79)\n –\n –\nCancelled\n (3)\n –\n –\n (9)\n –\n –\n –\n –\nExercised\n (552)\n (1,704)\n (278)\n (3,180)\n (89)\n (359)\n –\n –\nOutstanding at 31 December 2020\n 3,045\n 4,791\n 1,626\n 9,175\n 161\n 506\n 300\n 65\nGranted\n 1,275\n 2,082\n 902\n 4,509\n 139\n 481\n –\n 175\nForfeited\n (220)\n (494)\n (158)\n (1,254)\n (18)\n (42)\n (18)\n (45)\nCancelled\n (9)\n –\n (1)\n (8)\n –\n –\n –\n –\nExercised\n (632)\n (1,201)\n (341)\n (2,881)\n (27)\n (182)\n –\n –\nOutstanding at 31 December 2021\n 3,459\n 5,178\n 2,028\n 9,541\n 255\n 763\n 282\n 195\nGranted\n 1,059\n 2,339\n 1,237\n 6,478\n 75\n 216\n –\n –\nForfeited\n (132)\n (570)\n (190)\n (1,627)\n (25)\n (136)\n (23)\n –\nCancelled\n –\n –\n –\n (3)\n –\n –\n –\n –\nExercised\n (756)\n (1,223)\n (606)\n (2,706)\n (72)\n (165)\n –\n –\nOutstanding at 31 December 2022\n 3,630\n 5,724\n 2,469\n 11,683\n 233\n 678\n 259\n 195\n1 Shares issued to Alexion employees under the GRSP are covered under the Alexion employee share award below.\nThe AstraZeneca \nPerformance Share Plan\nThe AstraZeneca \nGlobal Restricted Stock Plan\nThe AstraZeneca \n Restricted Share Plan \nThe AstraZeneca \n Extended Incentive Plan \nWAFV1\nWAFV\nWAFV\nWAFV\nWAFV\nWAFV\nWAFV\nWAFV\npence\n$\npence\n$\npence\n$\npence\n$\nWAFV of 2020 grants\n6664\n 43.24\n7408\n 47.71\n7931\n 52.92\n8386\n –\nWAFV of 2021 grants\n6012\n 41.56\n6893\n 47.75\n7415\n 53.96\n –\n 56.83\nWAFV of 2022 grants\n8328\n 55.73\n9167\n 61.21\n9894\n 63.35\n –\n –\n1 Weighted average fair value.\nAlexion employee share award plan\nAt acquisition in 2021, Alexion employee share awards were converted into AstraZeneca restricted stock awards that continue to have, and shall be \nsubject to, the same terms and conditions as applied in the corresponding Alexion awards immediately prior to completion.

During 2022, Alexion employees had the option to defer awards due to vest in July 2022 until February 2023 when they would also \nreceive an additional vest equivalent to 15% of the shares deferred. As a result, 1,780,000 shares were deferred, resulting in an additional 267,000 \nADR shares being issued under the Global Restricted Stock Plan, under original Alexion terms and conditions, with a grant date fair value of $65.62.\nThe weighted average fair value for awards granted under the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan is primarily based on the market price at the point \nof grant adjusted for the market-based performance elements which are valued using a modified version of the Monte Carlo method.

Such collaborations may \nrequire the Group to make payments on achievement of stages of development, launch or revenue milestones, although the Group generally has \nthe right to terminate these agreements at no cost. The Group recognises research and development milestones as an intangible asset once it is \ncommitted to payment, which is generally when the Group reaches set trigger points in the development cycle. Revenue-related milestones are \nrecognised as intangible assets on product launch at a value based on the Group’s long-term revenue forecasts for the related product. The table \nbelow indicates potential development and revenue-related payments that the Group may be required to make under such collaborations.\nYears 5\nTotal\nUnder 1 year\nYears 1 and 2\nYears 3 and 4\nand greater\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\nFuture potential research and development milestone payments\n 11,729\n 1,320\n 2,662\n 2,698\n 5,049\nFuture potential revenue milestone payments\n 17,499\n 65\n 368\n 1,859\n 15,207\nThe table includes all potential payments for achievement of milestones under ongoing research and development arrangements. Revenue-related \nmilestone payments represent the maximum possible amount payable on achievement of specified levels of revenue as set out in individual contract \nagreements, but exclude variable payments that are based on unit sales (e.g. royalty-type payments) which are expensed as the associated sale is \nrecognised. The table excludes any payments already capitalised in the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.\nThe future payments we disclose represent contracted payments and, as such, are not discounted and are not risk-adjusted. As detailed in the Risk \nsection from page 56, the development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex and risky process that may fail at any stage in the \ndevelopment process due to a number of factors (including items such as failure to obtain regulatory approval, unfavourable data from key studies, \nadverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns). The timing of the payments is based on the Group’s current best \nestimate of achievement of the relevant milestone.\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\ncontinued\nEnvironmental costs and liabilities\nThe Group’s expenditure on environmental \nprotection, including both capital and revenue \nitems, relates to costs that are necessary for \nimplementing internal systems and programmes, \nand meeting legal and regulatory requirements \nfor processes and products. This includes \ninvestment to conserve natural resources and \notherwise minimise the impact of our activities \non the environment.\nThey are an integral part of normal ongoing \nexpenditure for carrying out the Group’s \nresearch, manufacturing and commercial \noperations and are not separated from overall \noperating and development costs. There are \nno known changes in legal, regulatory or other \nrequirements resulting in material changes to \nthe levels of expenditure for 2020, 2021 or 2022.\nIn addition to expenditure for meeting current \nand foreseen environmental protection \nrequirements, the Group incurs costs in \ninvestigating and cleaning up legacy land and \ngroundwater contamination. In particular, \nAstraZeneca has environmental liabilities at \nsome currently or formerly owned, leased and \nthird-party sites.\nIn the US, Zeneca Inc., and/or its indemnitees, \nhave been named as potentially responsible \nparties (PRPs) or defendants at a number of \nsites where Zeneca Inc. is likely to incur future \nenvironmental investigation, remediation, \noperation and maintenance costs under federal, \nstate, statutory or common law environmental \nliability allocation schemes (together, US \nEnvironmental Consequences). Similarly, \nStauffer Management Company LLC (SMC), \nwhich was established in 1987 to own and \nmanage certain assets of Stauffer Chemical \nCompany acquired that year, and/or its \nindemnitees, have been named as PRPs or \ndefendants at a number of sites where SMC is \nlikely to incur US Environmental Consequences.\nAstraZeneca has also given indemnities to third \nparties for a number of sites outside the US. \nThese environmental liabilities arise from legacy \noperations that are not currently part of the \nGroup’s business and, at most of these sites, \nremediation, where required, is either completed \nor in progress. AstraZeneca has made \nprovisions for the estimated costs of future \nenvironmental investigation, remediation, \noperation and maintenance activity beyond \nnormal ongoing expenditure for maintaining the \nGroup’s R&D and manufacturing capacity and \nproduct ranges, where a present obligation \nexists, it is probable that such costs will be \nincurred and they can be estimated reliably. With \nrespect to such estimated future costs, there \nwere provisions at 31 December 2022 in the \naggregate of $131m (2021: $90m; 2020: $100m), \nmainly relating to the US. Where we are jointly \nliable or otherwise have cost-sharing \nagreements with third parties, we reflect only \nour share of the obligation. Where the liability is \ninsured in part or in whole by insurance or other \narrangements for reimbursement, an asset is \nrecognised to the extent that this recovery is \nvirtually certain.\nIt is possible that AstraZeneca could incur \nfuture environmental costs beyond the extent \nof our current provisions. The extent of such \npossible additional costs is inherently difficult \nto estimate due to a number of factors, including: \n(i) the nature and extent of claims that may be \nasserted in the future; (ii) whether AstraZeneca \nhas or will have any legal obligation with respect \nto asserted or unasserted claims; (iii) the type of \nremedial action, if any, that may be selected at \nsites where the remedy is presently not known; \n(iv) the potential for recoveries from or allocation \nof liability to third parties; and (v) the length of \ntime that the environmental investigation, \nremediation and liability allocation process can \ntake. As per our accounting policy on page \n148, provisions for these costs are made when \nthere is a present obligation and where it is \nprobable that expenditure on remedial work will \nbe required and a reliable estimate can be made \nof the cost. Notwithstanding and subject to the \nforegoing, we estimate the potential additional \nloss for future environmental investigation, \nremediation, remedial operation and \nmaintenance activity above and beyond our \nprovisions to be, in aggregate, between $113m \nand $188m (2021: $99m and $165m; 2020: $95m \nand $158m) which relates mainly to the US.\nLegal proceedings\nAstraZeneca is involved in various legal \nproceedings considered typical to its business, \nincluding actual or threatened litigation and \nactual or potential government investigations \nrelating to employment matters, product liability, \ncommercial disputes, pricing, sales and \n192\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nFinancial Statements"

This \nposition could of course change over time, not \nleast because of the factors referred to above.\nIn cases that have been settled or adjudicated, \nor where quantifiable fines and penalties have \nbeen assessed and which are not subject to \nappeal (or other similar forms of relief), or where \na loss is probable and we are able to make a \nreasonable estimate of the loss, we indicate \nthe loss absorbed or make a provision for our \nbest estimate of the expected loss.\nWhere it is considered that the Group is more \nlikely than not to prevail, legal costs involved \nin defending the claim are charged to profit as \nthey are incurred.\nWhere it is considered that the Group has \na valid contract which provides the right to \nreimbursement (from insurance or otherwise) \nof legal costs and/or all or part of any loss \nincurred or for which a provision has been \nestablished, and we consider recovery to \nbe virtually certain, the best estimate of the \namount expected to be received is recognised \nas an asset.\n Assessments as to whether or not to \nrecognise provisions or assets, and of the \namounts concerned, usually involve a series of \ncomplex judgements about future events and \ncan rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. \nAstraZeneca believes that the provisions \nrecorded are adequate based on currently \navailable information and that the insurance \nrecoveries recorded will be received. However, \ngiven the inherent uncertainties involved in \nassessing the outcomes of these cases, and \nin estimating the amount of the potential losses \nand the associated insurance recoveries, we \ncould in the future incur judgments or insurance \nsettlements that could have a material adverse \neffect on our results in any particular period.\nIP claims include challenges to the Group’s \npatents on various products or processes and \nassertions of non-infringement of patents. \nA loss in any of these cases could result in loss \nof patent protection on the related product. \nThe consequences of any such loss could be \na significant decrease in Product Sales, which \ncould have a material adverse effect on our \nresults. The lawsuits filed by AstraZeneca for \npatent infringement against companies that \nhave filed abbreviated new drug applications \n(ANDAs) in the US, seeking to market generic \nforms of products sold by the Group prior to the \nexpiry of the applicable patents covering these \nproducts, typically also involve allegations of \nnon-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability \nof these patents by the ANDA filers. In the event \nthat the Group is unsuccessful in these actions \nor the statutory 30-month stay expires before \na ruling is obtained, the ANDA filers involved \nwill also have the ability, subject to FDA \napproval, to introduce generic versions of the \nproduct concerned.\nAstraZeneca has full confidence in, and will \nvigorously defend and enforce, its IP.\nOver the course of the past several years, \nincluding in 2022, a significant number of \ncommercial litigation claims in which \nAstraZeneca is involved have been resolved, \nparticularly in the US, thereby reducing potential \ncontingent liability exposure arising from such \nlitigation. Similarly, in part due to patent litigation \nand settlement developments, greater certainty \nhas been achieved regarding possible generic \nentry dates with respect to some of our patented \nproducts. At the same time, like other \ncompanies in the pharmaceutical sector and \nother industries, AstraZeneca continues to be \nsubject to government investigations around \nthe world.\nPatent litigation\nLegal proceedings brought against AstraZeneca \nconsidered to be contingent liabilities\nEnhertu\nUS patent proceedings\nIn October 2020, Seagen Inc. (Seagen) filed a \ncomplaint against Daiichi Sankyo Company, \nLimited in the US District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Texas alleging that Enhertu infringes \nUS Patent No. 10,808,039 (the ‘039 patent). \nAstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP co-\ncommercialises Enhertu with Daiichi Sankyo, \nInc. in the US. After trial in April 2022, the jury \nfound that the patent was infringed and \nawarded Seagen $41.82m in past damages. \nIn July 2022, the District Court entered final \njudgment and declined to enhance damages \non the basis of willfulness. The parties await \nconsideration of post-trial motions.\nIn December 2020 and January 2021, \nAstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. filed \npost-grant review (PGR) petitions with the US \nPatent and Trademark Office (USPTO) alleging, \ninter alia, that the Seagen patent is invalid for \nlack of written description and enablement. \nThe USPTO initially declined to institute the \nPGRs, but, in April 2022, the USPTO granted \nthe rehearing requests, instituting both PGR \npetitions. Seagen subsequently disclaimed all \npatent claims at issue in one of the PGR \nproceedings. In July 2022, the USPTO reversed \nits institution decision and declined to institute \nthe other PGR petition. AstraZeneca and Daiichi \nSankyo, Inc. have requested reconsideration of \nthe decision not to institute review of the patent.\nImfinzi \nUS patent proceedings \nIn March 2022, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and \nE.R.

The vast \nmajority of those lawsuits relate to allegations \nof kidney injuries. In May 2017, counsel for a \ngroup of such plaintiffs claiming that they have \nbeen diagnosed with kidney injuries filed a \nmotion with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict \nLitigation (JPML) seeking the transfer of any \ncurrently pending federal court cases as well \nas any similar, subsequently filed cases to \na coordinated and consolidated pre-trial \nmultidistrict litigation (MDL) proceeding. In \nAugust 2017, the JPML granted the motion and \nconsolidated the pending federal court cases \nin an MDL proceeding in District Court in New \nJersey for pre-trial purposes.

      "text": "Other\nUS 340B litigations and proceedings \nUS proceedings \nAstraZeneca is involved in several matters \nrelating to its contract pharmacy recognition \npolicy under the 340B Drug Pricing Program in \nthe US. AstraZeneca has sought to intervene in \nthree lawsuits against several US government \nagencies and their officials relating to the \nappropriate interpretation of the governing \nstatute for the 340B Drug Pricing Program. \nTwo of the three cases are currently stayed \npending further proceedings and the third \ncase has been dismissed. \nAdministrative Dispute Resolution proceedings \nhave also been initiated against AstraZeneca \nbefore the US Health Resources and \nServices Administration. \nAs previously disclosed, in January 2021, \nAstraZeneca filed a separate lawsuit in the \nUS District Court for the District of Delaware \nalleging that an Advisory Opinion issued by \nthe Department of Health and Human Services \nviolates the Administrative Procedure Act. \nIn June 2021, the District Court found in favour \nof AstraZeneca, invalidating the Advisory \nOpinion. Prior to the District Court’s ruling, \nhowever, in May 2021, the US government \nissued new and separate letters to AstraZeneca \n(and other companies) asserting that our \ncontract pharmacy policy violates the 340B \nstatute. AstraZeneca amended the complaint to \ninclude allegations challenging the letter sent in \nMay, and in February 2022, the District Court \nruled in favour of AstraZeneca invalidating those \nletters sent by the US Government. In January \n2023, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District \nCourt decision in AstraZeneca’s favour.\nIn September 2021, AstraZeneca was served \nwith a class-action antitrust complaint filed in \nthe US District Court for the Western District of \nNew York (the District Court) by Mosaic Health \nalleging a conspiracy to restrict access to \n340B discounts in the diabetes market through \ncontract pharmacies. In September 2022, the \nDistrict Court granted Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss the Complaint. Plaintiffs are now \nseeking leave to amend their complaint.\nAdditional government inquiries\nAs is true for most, if not all, major prescription \npharmaceutical companies, AstraZeneca is \ncurrently involved in multiple inquiries into drug \nmarketing and pricing practices. In addition to \nthe investigations described above, various \nlaw enforcement offices have, from time to \ntime, requested information from the Group. \nThere have been no material developments in \nthose matters.\nTax\nAstraZeneca considers whether it is probable \nthat a taxation authority will accept an uncertain \ntax treatment. If it is concluded that it is not \nprobable that the taxation authority will accept \nan uncertain tax treatment, where tax exposures \ncan be quantified, a tax liability is recognised \nbased on either the most likely amount method or \nthe expected value method depending on which \nmethod management expects to better predict \nthe resolution of the uncertainty. Tax liabilities \nfor uncertain tax treatments can be built up over \na long period of time but the resolution of such \ntax exposures usually occurs at a point in time, \nand given the inherent uncertainties in assessing \nthe outcomes of these exposures (which \nsometimes can be binary in nature), we could, in \nfuture periods, experience adjustments to the \nliabilities recognised in respect of uncertain tax \ntreatments that have a material positive or \nnegative effect on our results in any particular \nperiod. Details of the movements in relation to \nmaterial uncertain tax treatments are \ndiscussed below.\n AstraZeneca faces a number of audits \nand reviews in jurisdictions around the world \nand, in some cases, is in dispute with the tax \nauthorities. The issues under discussion are \noften complex and can require many years to \nresolve. Tax liabilities recognised for uncertain \ntax treatments require management to make \nkey judgements with respect to the outcome \nof current and potential future tax audits, and \nactual results could vary from these estimates.\nThe total net tax liability recognised in the Group \nFinancial Statements in respect of uncertain \ntax positions is $830m (2021: $768m; 2020: \n$1,014m). The net tax liability consists of $632m \n(2021: $702m; 2020: $852m) included within \nincome tax payable, $20m (2021: $17m; 2020: \n$nil) included within deferred tax liability and \n$291m (2021: $(33)m; 2020: $76m) included \nwithin deferred tax asset, partially offset by \n$113m (2021: additional $82m; 2020: additional \n$86m) included within income tax receivable.\nTransfer pricing\nThe net tax liability included in the Group \nFinancial Statements to cover the worldwide \nexposure to uncertain tax treatments is $260m \n(2021: $77m; 2020: $287m). These matters can \nbe complex and judgemental. The liability \nincludes uncertain tax treatments which are \nestimated using the expected value method and \ndepend on AstraZeneca’s assessment of the \nlikelihood of the approach taken by the tax \nauthorities and could change in the future to \nreflect progress in tax authority reviews, the \nextent that any tax authority challenge is \nconcluded, or matters lapse including following \nexpiry of the relevant statutes of limitation \nresulting in a reduction in the tax charge in \nfuture periods. \nFor transfer pricing matters, including items \nunder tax audit, AstraZeneca estimates the \npotential for additional tax liabilities above the \namount provided where the possibility of the \nadditional liabilities falling due is more than \nremote, to be up to $245m (2021: $48m; 2020: \n$251m) including associated interest.\nThere were no uncertain tax treatments \nrelating to transfer pricing which give rise to \npotential for additional tax liabilities where the \npossibility of the additional liabilities falling \ndue is more than remote.\nManagement believes that it is unlikely that these \nadditional liabilities will arise. It is possible that \nsome of these contingencies may change in the \nfuture to reflect progress in tax authority reviews, \nto the extent that any tax authority challenge is \nconcluded, or matters lapse including following \nexpiry of the relevant statutes of limitation \nresulting in a reduction in the tax charge in \nfuture periods. Management continues to \nbelieve that AstraZeneca’s positions on all its \ntransfer pricing positions, audits and disputes \nare robust, and that AstraZeneca has recognised \nappropriate tax balances, including \nconsideration of whether corresponding relief \nwill be available under Mutual Agreement \nprocedures or unilaterally.\nThe increase in the net tax liability for uncertain \ntax positions relating to transfer pricing of $183m \ncompared with 2021 is mainly as a result of an \nincrease of tax liabilities arising from updates \nto estimates of prior period tax liabilities \nfollowing progression of tax authority reviews.\nOther uncertain tax treatments\nIncluded in the net tax liability is $570m (2021: \n$691m; 2020: $727m) relating to a number of \nother uncertain tax treatments. The decrease \nof $121m in the net tax liability relating to the \nother uncertain tax treatments mainly relates to \nreleases of tax liabilities following the expiry of \nthe relevant statute of limitations and exchange \nrate effects. The majority of the liability relates \nto tax liabilities in respect of uncertain tax \ntreatments which are estimated using the \nexpected value method and depend on \nAstraZeneca’s assessment of the likelihood of \nthe approach taken by the tax authorities and \ncould change in the future to reflect progress \nin tax authority reviews, the extent that any \ntax authority challenge is concluded, or \nmatters lapse including following expiry of the \nrelevant statutes of limitation resulting in a \nreduction in the tax charge in future periods.\nFor these other tax liabilities in respect of \nuncertain tax treatments, AstraZeneca \nestimates the potential for additional liabilities \nabove the amount provided where the \npossibility of the additional liabilities falling \ndue is more than remote, to be up to $209m \n(2021: $273m; 2020: $293m) including \n197\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\nCorporate Governance\nAdditional Information\nFinancial Statements\nStrategic Report"

On 23 January 2023, AstraZeneca initiated a tender offer to acquire all of CinCor’s outstanding shares for a price of $26 per share in \ncash at closing, plus a non-tradable contingent value right of $10 per share in cash payable upon a specified regulatory submission of a baxdrostat \nproduct. Combined, the upfront and maximum potential contingent value payments represent, if achieved, a transaction value of approximately $1.8bn. \nAs part of the transaction, AstraZeneca will acquire the cash and marketable securities on CinCor’s balance sheet, which totalled approximately \n$522m as of 30 September 2022.

This includes an initial payment of $200m on deal closing, and \na further up to $120m in both contingent milestones-based and non-contingent consideration.\nOn 30 January 2023, AstraZeneca completed the sale of its West Chester site in Ohio, US, to National Resilience, Inc.

When making a distribution to shareholders, the Directors determine profits available for distribution by reference to guidance on realised and distributable profits under the Companies \nAct 2006 issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland in April 2017. The profits of the Company have been \nreceived in the form of receivables due from subsidiaries. The availability of distributable reserves in the Company is dependent on those receivables meeting the definition of qualifying \nconsideration within the guidance, and in particular on the ability of subsidiaries to settle those receivables within a reasonable period of time. The Directors consider that, based on the \nnature of these receivables and the available cash resources of the Group and other accessible sources of funds, at 31 December 2022, all (31 December 2021: all) of the Company’s profit and \nloss reserves were available for distribution.\n205\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nCompany Statement of Changes in Equity\nCorporate Governance\nAdditional Information\nFinancial Statements\nStrategic Report"

      "text": "Company Accounting Policies\nBasis of presentation of \nfinancial information\nThese financial statements were prepared \nin accordance with FRS 101 ‘Reduced \nDisclosure Framework’.\nIn preparing these financial statements, the \nCompany applied the recognition, measurement \nand disclosure requirements of International \nFinancial Reporting Standards as adopted by \nthe UK (UK-adopted International Accounting \nStandards), but made amendments where \nnecessary in order to comply with the \nCompanies Act 2006 and to take advantage \nof FRS 101 disclosure exemptions. \nIn these financial statements, the Company has \napplied the exemptions available under FRS 101 \nin respect of the following disclosures:\n>\t Statement of Cash Flows and related notes\n>\t disclosures in respect of transactions with \nwholly owned subsidiaries\n>\t disclosures in respect of \ncapital management\n>\t the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs\n>\t disclosures in respect of the compensation \nof Key Management Personnel.\nAs the Group Financial Statements (presented \non pages 138 to 203) include the equivalent \ndisclosures, the Company has also taken the \nexemptions under FRS 101 available in respect \nof the following disclosures:\n>\t IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ in respect \nof Group settled share-based payments\n>\t certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 \n‘Fair Value Measurement’ and the \ndisclosures required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial \nInstruments: Disclosures’.\nNo individual profit and loss account is \nprepared as provided by section 408 of the \nCompanies Act 2006.\nBasis of accounting\nThe Company Financial Statements are \nprepared under the historical cost convention \nand on a going concern basis, in accordance \nwith the Companies Act 2006.\nThe following paragraphs describe the main \naccounting policies, which have been \napplied consistently.\nEstimates and judgements\nThe preparation of the Company Financial \nStatements in conformity with generally \naccepted accounting principles requires \nmanagement to make estimates and \njudgements that affect the reported amounts \nof assets and liabilities at the date of the \nFinancial Statements and the reported \namounts of revenues and expenses during \nthe reporting period. Actual results could \ndiffer from those estimates. There are no key \njudgements or significant estimates.\nForeign currencies\nForeign currency transactions, being \ntransactions denominated in a currency other \nthan the Company’s functional currency, are \ntranslated into US dollars at average rates for \nthe relevant monthly accounting periods, \nwhich approximate to actual rates. \nMonetary assets and liabilities arising from \nforeign currency transactions are retranslated \nat exchange rates prevailing at the reporting \ndate. Exchange gains and losses on loans and \non short-term foreign currency borrowings \nand deposits are included within Finance \nexpense. Exchange differences on all other \nforeign currency transactions are recognised \nin Operating profit.\nNon-monetary items arising from foreign \ncurrency transactions are not retranslated in \nthe Company’s accounting records.\nTaxation\nThe current tax payable is based on taxable \nprofit for the year. Taxable profit differs from \nreported profit because taxable profit excludes \nitems that are either never taxable or tax \ndeductible or items that are taxable or tax \ndeductible in a different period. The Company’s \ncurrent tax assets and liabilities are calculated \nusing tax rates that have been enacted or \nsubstantively enacted by the reporting date.\nDeferred tax is provided using the balance \nsheet liability method, providing for temporary \ndifferences between the carrying amounts of \nassets and liabilities for financial reporting \npurposes and the amounts used for taxation \npurposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised \nto the extent that there are future taxable \ntemporary differences or it is probable that \nfuture taxable profit will be available against \nwhich the asset can be utilised. This requires \njudgements to be made in respect of the \navailability of future taxable income.\nNo deferred tax asset or liability is recognised \nin respect of temporary differences associated \nwith investments in subsidiaries and branches \nwhere the Company is able to control the \ntiming of reversal of the temporary differences \nand it is probable that the temporary differences \nwill not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nThe Company’s deferred tax assets and \nliabilities are calculated using tax rates that \nare expected to apply in the period when the \nliability is settled or the asset realised based \non tax rates that have been enacted or \nsubstantively enacted by the reporting date.\nLiabilities for uncertain tax positions require \nmanagement to make judgements of potential \nexposures in relation to tax audit issues. Tax \nbenefits are not recognised unless the tax \npositions will probably be accepted by the tax \nauthorities. This is based upon management‘s \ninterpretation of applicable laws and regulations \nand the expectation of how the tax authority \nwill resolve the matter. Once considered \nprobable of not being accepted, management \nreviews each material tax benefit and reflects \nthe effect of the uncertainty in determining the \nrelated taxable result. \nLiabilities for uncertain tax positions are \nmeasured using either the most likely amount \nor the expected value amount depending on \nwhich method the Company expects to better \npredict the resolution of the uncertainty. \nInvestments\nFixed asset investments, including investments \nin subsidiaries, are stated at cost and reviewed \nfor impairment if there are indications that the \ncarrying value may not be recoverable.\nDebtors\nAmounts owed by Group undertakings are \nrecognised initially at fair value. Subsequent \nto initial recognition they are measured at \namortised cost using the effective interest \nmethod, less any impairment losses.\nThe recoverability of these balances has been \nassessed in accordance with IFRS 9 and no \nimpairment has been identified. The amounts \nowed by Group undertakings are considered \nto have low credit risk, due to timely payment \nof interest and settlement of principal amount \non agreed due dates, limiting the loss allowance \nto 12-month expected credit losses. \n206\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nFinancial Statements"

Subsequent \nto initial recognition they are re-measured at \neither amortised cost using the effective \ninterest rate method or at fair value using an \nexpected credit loss model.\nFinancial instruments\nInterest-bearing loans are initially measured at \nfair value (with direct transaction costs being \namortised over the life of the loan) and are \nsubsequently measured at amortised cost \nusing the effective rate method at each reporting \ndate. Changes in carrying value are recognised \nin profit.\nShare-based payments\nThe issuance by the Company to employees \nof its subsidiaries of a grant of awards over \nthe Company’s shares, represents additional \ncapital contributions by the Company to its \nsubsidiaries. An additional investment in \nsubsidiaries results in a corresponding increase \nin shareholders’ equity.

This has led to \nchanges in the data from previous years. The majority of adjustments made are not material individually, except for (i) Scope 3 \ncategory 1 purchased goods and services (methodology update to transition relevant procurement spend categories from a \nspend based emissions database to product life cycle assessment (LCA) data, thereby improving accuracy; Additional small \nimprovements have been made to spend based methodology emission factors in this category; (ii) Scope 3 Category 9 \ndownstream transportation and distribution (methodology update to use production data and updated assumptions to account \nfor the footprint associated with patient travel). High uncertainty of this category means further review is ongoing to improve \nthe methodology; (iii) Scope 3 Category 12 end of life treatment of sold products (methodology update to transition from spend \nbased approach to emissions calculated using production and LCA data).\n2\t \u0007Included in this section are GHGs from direct fuel combustion, process and engineering emissions at our sites and from fuel \nuse in our vehicle fleet. \n3\t \u0007GHGs from imported electricity are calculated using the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance (January 2015) requiring dual \nreporting using two emissions factors for each site – Market-based and Location-based. Our corporate emissions reporting \nand targets follow the Market-based approach. We have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting \nStandard (revised edition). Emission factors for electricity have been derived from the International Energy Agency, USEPA \neGRID, US Green-e and the Association of Issuing Bodies databases and for all other fuels and emission sources from the \n2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.\n4\t \u0007The aggregate of: (i) the annual quantity of energy consumed from activities for which the Company is responsible, including \nthe combustion of fuel at a facility or the operation of any facility and (ii) the annual quantity of energy consumed resulting \nfrom the purchase of electricity, heat, steam or cooling by the Company for its own use.\n5\t \u0007Under the Companies (Directors’ Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018, \nthe Company needs to disclose what proportion of this figure relates to energy use in the UK and offshore area. For 2022, \nthe proportion of total global energy and emissions originating from AstraZeneca’s UK and offshore area footprint were as \nfollows: energy use 371 GWh (21%); Scope 1 site energy and road fleet emissions 60 ktCO2e (24%); Scope 2 site imported \nenergy emissions using Market-based accounting 0 ktCO2e (0%); Scope 2 site imported energy emissions using Location-\nbased accounting 12 ktCO2e (6%). In the period covered by the report AstraZeneca has installed LED lighting, implemented \ncooling tower improvements on the combined heat and power plant, and maintained ISO50001 at its Macclesfield, UK, \nmanufacturing facility.\n  \u0007For more information, see Environmental protection from page 50. \n  \u0007For more information, see our Sustainability Report on our website, www.astrazeneca.com/sustainability.\n218\nAstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2022\nAdditional Information\nSustainability  \nsupplementary information"
