When we do the right things, we get closer and closer to becoming the company we \nare striving to be.\nThe past three years have been a com-\nmercial and mental roller coaster, with \nthe pandemic, climate change, war, and \nboth economic and energy turbulence. \nBut at Duni Group, we have managed to \nmaintain our energy and motivation.\nThis is rooted in a desire to make a differ-\nence.

When the restrictions \nwere then eased in the spring, the industry \nsaw a strong upswing. People wanted to \nmeet, eat and travel again. Festivals, par-\nties and weddings could finally take place. \nThe third quarter, which was the first full \nquarter that was not affected by any \nrestrictions, saw a sales increase of 26.2%, \nand we delivered an operating income \nfigure that was historically strong.\nThe Duni business area grew by 50.4% \nduring the year, and had a 43.9% increase \nin sales at fixed exchange rates during \nthe year compared with 2021. This is \npartly due to eased restrictions, partly \nto price increases. The BioPak business \narea increased by 23.9% compared with \n2021, as a result of price increases and \nsome growth. Together, this had a direct \nimpact on the Group’s operating income, \nwhich amounted to SEK 450 million (279).\nGroup sales for the year totaled SEK \n6,976 million (5,061) in 2022, which cor-\nresponds to a sales increase of 37.8%. \nAdjusted for exchange rate fluctuations, \nnet sales increased by 30.9%.\nExternal factors still a concern\nWhen the pandemic released its grip, we \nhad already entered a new crisis, the war \nin Ukraine, which brought inflation and \nrising costs of energy and raw materials. \nThe consequences of the geopolitical \nsituation remain uncertain, for example \nhow the purchasing behavior of end \nconsumers will be affected. \nEnergy is the biggest concern, both price \nand supply. We implemented several price \nincreases in 2022 to compensate for \nincreased costs. Our paper mill in Skåpa-\nfors switched to BioLPG in 2021, but now \nthe supply is threatened by the war in \nUkraine.\nLooking on the bright side, restaurants \nare open. During the pandemic, our \nmarket practically disappeared, but we \ncoped relatively well anyway. The key \ngoing forward as an organization is to be \nadaptable. We are prioritizing precisely \nthis and training our managers to lead in \ntimes of uncertainty and change.\nStrategy communicated and embed-\nded in the organization\nOur operations in 2022 were dominated \nby external factors, but at the same time \nwe worked consciously to embed our \nupdated strategy to be a sustainability \nleader in the industry. We took a big step \nduring the year and learned a great deal.\nWe created new Group-wide leadership \ntraining courses focusing on sustainability \nand our values. The organizational step of \nmoving the sustainability department to \nPeople & Culture has contributed to \nmaking sustainability a natural element of \nthe organization’s day-to-day operations.\nWe have also continued to communicate \nthe importance of inclusion, diversity and, \nequality in the organization, for example, \nin recruitment. In autumn 2021, a Diversity \n& Inclusion Board was created to continue \nworking on this.\nMuch work remains to ensure that every­­\none takes the strategy fully onboard. As \npart of this, we have moved towards a \nmore integrated, network-based organi-\nzation that provides work methods and \ntools to help us realize the different parts \nof the strategy. During the year, we also \nset up a Program Management Office \n(PMO) service to coordinate our various \nprojects across departmental boundaries. \nCollaboration drives development \nin the industry\nOur market is the HoReCa market. We \nbelieve in this industry. We have relation-\nships here, knowledge and reach that \nwe can contribute to the collaborations \nthat are so important for us to be able to \ndrive sustainable development in our \nindustry.\nIn 2021, we took important steps in the area \nof circularity through investments in \nbusiness startups focused on reuse and \ndeposit systems. We extended these \ncollaborations during the past year. The \nBioPak business area is increasingly \nfocusing on system solutions for reuse \nand circularity. At the same time, the Duni \nbusiness area is starting to offer more \nsolutions for the restaurant, not just for the \nset table, but also digital services. \nDuni Group wants to be part of the \nHoReCa market’s future, as a sustainability \nexpert, as a business partner and as a \nsupplier of sustainable solutions. This is \nwhere our internal culture of innovation \nplays a key role. We strive to provide  \nknowledge and the most durable solu-\ntion for every customer – single-use, \nmulti-use or maybe totally different solu-\ntions. One shining example of such a \nsustainable innovation solution is the \nprototype that Duni Group developed in \n2022 to match restaurants and job seek-\ners, to satisfy the pressing need for staff \nin the restaurant industry.\nDuni Group 2022 / CEO’s Comments\nMajor steps forward  \ndespite external challenges\nDespite difficult external factors, we translated our updated strategy from words into action in 2022. ­ \nOur sustainability initiatives and values give the business a purpose and help us on our way to becoming ­ \nthe industry’s sustainability leader."

We see an \nopportunity to expand in the Asia-Pacific \nregion and in additional markets, and are \ndelighted to be able to work with a local \npartner who – just like us – sees the \npotential in sustainable business con-\ncepts. BioPak offers sustainable packag-\ning solutions for the take-away industry.\nKey sustainability milestones\nIt is extremely pleasing to see how dif-\nferent departments are integrating our \nsustainability initiatives into their opera-\ntions. We are approaching our net zero \ntarget according to Scope 1 and 2, by \nsuch means as replacing energy sources \nand installing solar panels at our plant in \nBramsche, Germany. We will also be doing \nthis in Bangkok, Thailand. During the year, \nthe paper mill in Skåpafors only used elec-\ntricity labeled “Good Environmental \nChoice Wind”.\nBy standardizing the sizes of external \npackaging, we streamlined the logistics \nchain, resulting in reduced climate impact. \nWe have also run a project to measure \nour climate impact in our value chain \n(Scope 3). One great new initiative is our \nappointment of 17 Sustainability Leaders, \nwho will be supporting and motivating \nthe local organization to produce even \nbetter sustainability work.\nWe have also committed to the Science \nBased Targets initiative, to secure con-\ntinued efforts to reduce our greenhouse \ngas emissions. In 2022, we were the first \nin the industry to report our climate \nimpact in our quarterly reports. This year’s \nreport is also our first to report in accor-\ndance with the principles set out by the GRI \n(Global Reporting Initiative), which facili-\ntates communication around our ESG \nagenda. It is becoming increasingly import-\nant to have transparency on these issues, \nnot least towards investors.\nDuring the year, the Group’s head office \nalso moved to new premises in Malmö.  \nIn Germany, we invested in a new staff \ncanteen. These kinds of activities are \nimportant to show employees that we \nstand by our values, and that the strategy \nmeans a review of the business.\nConfidence in the future\nWhen I took over as CEO and Group CEO \nof Duni Group in January 2021, my mission \nwas to guide the company to the next \ndecade. Despite the global turbulence in \n2022, I feel that we took significant steps \non that journey.\nOur strategy sets a challenging agenda. \nIt will take a lot of hard work to become \nthe industry’s obvious sustainability leader. \nOf course, there are lots of concerns in \nthe world around us, but I feel reassured \nby how well we coped with the pandemic, \nand that we have performed well in his-\ntorical terms during crises, such as the \nfinancial crisis in 2008.\nI am extremely proud of how Duni Group \nhas dealt with the last few years. Together, \nwe have battled and performed amazingly \nwell. I would really like to thank our \nemployees and managers who, with their \ncommitment, energy and pride, are driv-\ning our development forward.

Our strong focus on sustainable \nsolutions, innovation and collaborations \ngives the organization a clear direction.\nThe reorganization that took place in \n2021 has worked well. We created two \nbusiness areas, Duni and BioPak, and inte-\ngrated the paper mill in Skåpafors in the \nDuni business area, which increased col-\nlaboration between the factory and the \ncommercial operation. The BioPak busi-\nness area has a different business model, \nwith expertise in procuring and develop-\ning external production.\nThe Board’s work during the year\nOne main task for the Board in 2022 was \nto maintain the company’s strategic focus, \nbut also in the short term to deal with all \nthe turbulence that arose during the year. \nAs an example, resources for innovation \nhave increased significantly, while at the \nsame time we have compensated for \nhistorically high cost increases. For the \nBoard and management, it has been \nimportant to manage the short-term \nchallenges without compromising the \nlong-term strategy. We worked hard to \ncompensate for cost increases in raw \nmaterials, distribution and energy, and \nhad a close, ongoing dialog with man-\nagement on our short-term priorities.\nDuring the year, we also evaluated various \nalternatives to optimize the long-term \nvalue of the Group’s subsidiary BioPak \nPty Ltd. In December, we welcomed \nAustralia-based private equity firm Five \nV Capital as a minority shareholder in \nthe company to accelerate the growth \nagenda of BioPak Pty Ltd. This collabora-\ntion represents a significant opportunity \nto add value to Duni Group. \nOur collaboration with management was \ndynamic and worked very well. It was once \nmore possible for the annual strategy \nreview, in which the Board of Directors \nand management \nmeet for two days, to \ntake place in person.  \nAn uncertain market\nThe consequences \nof what is now hap-\npening in the world \naround us are difficult \nto assess. Personal \nfinances are coming \nunder pressure and new, stricter priori-\nties will be necessary for most people. \nFrom this perspective, restaurant visits \nand hotel stays can be regarded as \nunnecessary expenses. But we also know \nthat after the pandemic, people are \nextremely tired of not being able to \nsocialize in a normal way. In previous \neconomic downturns, the need to \nsocialize over a meal, at home or in a \nrestaurant, has been given relatively \nhigh priority.\nImportant to be bold\nUncertainty about future laws and regu-\nlations in Europe is also making the situa-\ntion difficult to navigate. One example is \nraw materials, where the use of wood fiber \ncame into focus. In this respect, however, \nthe Group is leading the way and we are \nconstantly evaluating new materials, \nproducts and systems.\nThis also applies to new business models, \nwhere a number of new and interesting \ninitiatives have been initiated. With the aim \nof offering the most sustainable option for \nevery consumption occasion, we create \nthe conditions for totally new business.  \n“\u0007Duni Group is firmly underpinned \nby its strategy. Our strong focus on \nsustainable solutions, innovation \nand collaborations gives the \norganization a clear direction.”\nThomas Gustafsson took office as Chairman of the Board following the AGM in May \n2020. He has long-standing experience from Duni Group, as a Board member from \n2009 to 2012, and as CEO and Group CEO from 2012 to 2017."

Our new strategy \nalso means that we are increasingly \nlooking at totally new business areas \nand business models in order to realize \nour vision for the future. \nOur success is based on being able to bal-\nance these two sides of the business: per-\nform and transform. For example, it’s \nabout how we should organize our-\nselves and what skills we need in the \nshort and long term.\nIn 2022, we divided our business into \neleven portfolios. This provides clear own-\nership, increases transparency and \nmakes it easier to get the all-important \nbalance between innovation and risk \nright. For example, it is important that \nwe are bold when making investments \nand starting collaborations at an early \nstage, as we did in 2021 with the com-\npanies Relevo, Bûmerang and &Repeat. \nSince April, our newly established Port­\nfolio Governance Board has been meet-\ning every month. This is where company \nmanagement and various key people go \nthrough our portfolios and check them \nagainst our overall annual plan.\nA hundred or more initiatives drive \ndevelopment\nIn 2022, we ran more than one hundred \ndifferent initiatives covering all parts of \nthe strategy, although many of these are \nparts of larger programs. \nFor example, twenty or so initiatives from \nthe entire organization are gathered within \nthe framework of the Becoming Circular \nat Scale program, which is driving the \ndevelopment of circular solutions. In some \nof the initiatives, we look at a completely \nnew business model and completely \nnew materials. \nThe Going Net Zero program also includes \ntwenty or so initiatives throughout the \norganization to reduce our carbon dioxide \nemissions. In this area, we achieved the \nemissions targets for Scopes 1 and 2 in \n2022, for example by switching to renew­\nable electricity in our production. The Duni \nbusiness area, which focuses on products \nfor the set table, also continued the con-\nverting of its product range to more \nsustainable alternatives, including by \nswitching to bio-based binders. \nSolutions that create customer \nbenefit\nA third example, with a clear focus on the \narea of transformation, is New Business \nExploration, where an exciting innovation \nproject for staffing in the restaurant \nindustry was launched in 2022. This will \nbe launched commercially in 2023.\nAs part of efforts to further improve our \ncustomer experience and add digital \nalternatives to the sales model, during \nthe year we continued the rollout of our \nsystems and models for Customer Expe-\nrience. We are now operating in all \nmajor markets in Central Europe. \n“\u0007We have strengthened our corporate governance to \nmanage the all-important balance between perform and \ntransform.

In 2021, Duni \nGroup invested in the German startup company Relevo \nGmbH, which aims to use its digital platform to create an \nefficient system for the reuse of take-away containers. \n“We actively participate and support their development \nthrough both strategic and operational activities. Depend-\ning on the needs and skills required, we try to mobilize \nthe right resources. At the same time, Relevo must lead \nthe way and follow their vision. Our role is to provide \nsupport with experience, competence and networks,” \nsays Franck Bancarel, Mergers and Acquisitions Director.\nThe collaboration has already produced tangible results. \nFor example, Relevo has developed an offering espe-\ncially for wholesalers and has been successful in dis-\ncussions with a number of major key customers. \n“We have a strong belief in Relevo’s solution. For Duni \nGroup, this collaboration means that we can learn from \na young and flexible company, as well as increasing our \ncompetitiveness in a fast-growing sector,” says Franck.\nCollaboration on \nreuse bears fruit\n17\nFranck Bancarel, Mergers and  \nAcquisitions Director\nNew ways of working are crucial\n“The solution is all about social sustain-\nability and, let’s be very clear about this, \nDuni Group’s future is based on the fact \nthat there is a HoReCa industry that is \nboth sustainable and a place where people \nwant to work.

These cross-­\nfertilizations have taught the Group to be \nmore agile. For example, a more agile way \nof working has been introduced, with \n“New Business Demo” in particular being \nappreciated within the organization.  \n“Every month the innovation department \npresents exactly where we are, our prob-\nlems, what went well and if we need \nhelp.

We have coped better \nwith the pandemic than many competi-\ntors, and our focus on sustainability and \ninnovation will keep us at the forefront. \nOur two complementary product ranges \ngive us clear competitive advantages. \nThe Duni business area is the market \nleader in Europe, and its reach means \nthat there are relatively few global com-\npetitors. Companies in areas such as tis-\nsue cannot compete with the quality and \ndesign of the Duni range. Many of them \nare smaller, local or regional. \nThe BioPak business is the market leader in \nthe Asia-Pacific region and is continuously \nstrengthening its position in Europe. \nThere are several competitors, and com-\npetition is intensifying with startup com-\npanies offering environmentally-sound \nand circular solutions. These may, how-\never, also become valuable business \npartners. To maintain our position in the \ntake-away segment, it is important to \nmaintain a high pace of innovation.\nExternal environment\nExternal threats\nWhen the pandemic loosened its grip in \nthe second quarter, the HoReCa sector \nand the experience industry saw a strong \nupturn. But the war in Ukraine created new \nconcerns in the global market. Inflation \nhas driven up the prices of energy, raw \nmaterials and transport. How this will \nultimately affect price increases and \nconsumption by end customers is uncer-\ntain, but it is a concern. \nThe shortage of transport containers in \n2021 has to some extent persisted, and \nthe supply chain from Asia has not fully \nrecovered. There have still been Covid-19 \nlockdowns in China that have affected \npurchases by the BioPak business area.\nNew laws and political decisions\nThe EU’s single-use plastics directive \n(SUPD), with a phasing out of plastics \nand a ban on expanded polystyrene (EPS) \nand the accompanying product labeling, \nis putting a lot of pressure on manufactur-\ners and suppliers.\nThrough its European Green Deal, the EU \naims to achieve a circular economy and \nbecome climate-neutral by 2050. This \nmeans that material selection and circular \nend-of-life solutions will be absolutely \ncrucial. These issues are best solved \nthrough various collaborations on new \nbusiness models and the reuse of products.\nThe value chain for single-use items will \ncontinue to be heavily impacted by the \nEU, as well as by changes in national leg-\nislation. For example, both France and \nGermany introduced requirements for \nreusable alternatives in certain applica-\ntions in January 2023. It is also uncertain \nhow the EU’s forest strategy for 2030 \nwill affect the availability of wood fiber.\nTrends, attitudes, values\nCircular models and digitalization are cur-\nrently the two most important macro-\ntrends. The first is being driven by new \nlaws and growing opinion. The relevance \nof single-use items is threatened, but \nafter the pandemic there is a very strong \ndesire to meet around food and drink, \nwhich is driving both the number of \nrestaurant bookings and sales of take-\naway products. \nOther effects of the pandemic are that it \nhas become more common to socialize \nin the home, with increased sales of the \nDuni business area’s products in the retail \nsector. Many people are continuing to work \nfrom home, especially in the Nordic region, \nand digital meetings continue to replace \nbusiness travel, which is having an impact \non the HoReCa sector.\nDigitalization made a major breakthrough \nin the HoReCa industry in 2020 and now \ncovers the entire value chain, from pur-\nchasing, customer interaction and deliv-\neries, to evaluations and service. Digital \ncustomer-specific, brand-building solu-\ntions continue to be important.\nIn 2022, the strong demand for hygienic \nsolutions seen during the pandemic has \nleveled out and not had the broad impact \nthat many predicted. \nTechnical development\nThe phasing out of plastics is driving the \ndevelopment of alternative, mostly fiber-\nbased solutions. Replacing the product \nbenefits of plastic will require several dif-\nferent materials to meet different needs, \nsuch as for fatty foods or soups.\nIn 2021, the Group was the first to intro-\nduce renewable binders in fiber-based \nproducts. The Duni business area con-\ntinued to work on converting to these \nmore sustainable napkins and table cov-\ners in 2022. \nGrowth opportunities\nWe have competitive, climate-smart \nproducts for the growing take-away sector, \nas well as a wide range of more sustain-\nable solutions for “sit-down” restaurants \nand the home. The strong environmental \ntrend means that many customers are \nwilling to pay more for sustainable solu-\ntions, especially if they are easy to use, \nand are clear and credible when it comes \nto their environmental benefits.\nWe continue to strengthen our offering in \nthe area of e-commerce and other digital \nservices. Our strong focus on innovation, \ncollaboration and investment in startups \nmeans that we can expand in the area of \ntake-away, for example with reusable \nproducts.\nThe changes in demand in various cus-\ntomer segment generate additional \nsales through the opportunity to offer \nDuni and BioPak products to the same \ncustomer. We are working actively to create \na platform that clarifies our brands and \nfacilitates this.\nGeographically, Asia is a growing market \nwith increasing demand for environmen-\ntally adapted packaging solutions, and as \nthe world’s largest full-service market, \ndemand is rising for products such as \ntable covers and napkins. But Europe \nremains our largest market, and logistics \ncosts combined with price pressure from \nlocal producers may slow down expan-\nsion in Asia."

Furthermore, the \nwar in Ukraine drove up electricity prices, \nforcing us to implement a number of price \nincreases,” says Linus Lemark, Executive \nVice President, Business Area BioPak.\nActivities in two main areas\nWe focused on two main areas in 2022. \nThe first was efficiency improvements \nand productivity increases in the facto-\nries which, combined with gains from \nnegotiations with our suppliers, drasti-\ncally reduced our costs. The second was \nto increase the relevance of our offering \nand brand. For example, we continued to \nconvert our core range into more sus-\ntainable products.

The goal is to \nreduce the use of virgin raw materials. \n“One very important activity for us is to \nlook at how we can use recycled fibers \nin our products and packaging solutions. \nThis would drastically reduce our fairly large \nenvironmental impact in production,” \nexplains Hanna Banica, Marketing Director, \nBusiness Area Duni. “We’re also investi-\ngating how we can design our products in \na holistic flow, such as home composting.”\nKey breakthroughs\nThe business area had two major break-\nthroughs back in 2021. Two employees \nat the factory in Bramsche, Germany, \nsucceeded in producing a fossil-free \nbinder based on potato starch, which \nresulted in the material BioDunicel® and \nenvironmentally adapted placemats. \nIn addition, a series of more sustainable \npremium napkins, BioDunisoft®, was \nlaunched with a pioneering, fossil-free \nbinder made from materials including \nlemon peels and corn. Both ranges are \nfossil-free, but are also compostable. The \nproducts are supplied in new fiber-based \npackaging in which all plastic has been \nreplaced with paper or cardboard.\nSustainable relaunch of big sellers\nThis provides a good foundation for the \nbusiness area, and the converting of the \nrange is continuing quickly. Among other \nthings, work was underway to prepare \nthe launch of BioDunisoft® Unicolours in \nJanuary 2023.  \n“It’s full speed ahead for BioDunisoft®, and \nafter the turn of the year we’ll be launching \nour Unicolours single-colored napkins in \n24 different colors. This is a large part of \nour portfolio that’s being re-launched and \nswitched over to bio-based materials. \nIt’s a huge step,” says Hanna.\nExploring the market for sustainable \ntable covers\nBioDunicel® bio-based table covers are \nbeing given a more cautious launch. We \nhave conducted market studies, as there \nis a noticeable difference in quality when \nswitching from the latex-based to the bio-\nbased binder in the table covers. \n“We’ve heard customers comment that \nthey’re experiencing a difference. So we’ve \nchosen a calmer introduction to the \nmarket. We’ll be launching a pilot in 2023, \nin which we’ll launch a number of Bio-\nDunicel® articles to see how they’re \nreceived on the market. Based on this \nlaunch, we’ll decide on a full converting \nor whether more product development \nis needed,” explains Hanna.\nSustainable Goodfoodmood® crucial \nto the offering\nIn the new strategy, sustainability runs \nthrough all of the Group’s operations. ­At \nthe same time, Hanna believes that we \nmust not lose sight of the fact that the \nDuni brand must also be synonymous \nwith solutions where people meet and \nenjoy pleasant moments together \naround food and drink.\n“Of course, we’ll do it in a sustainable \nway, and that will be demanded of us to \nsurvive and be relevant in the market. \nBut Duni must also inspire, we must \nstand for Goodfoodmood®. It’s about \nthe colors, the design and the atmo-\nsphere we create with our products.”\nDuni Group 2022 / Business Area Duni\nLife cycle analyses speak \nfor themselves\nBioDunisoft® generates 19.1% \nlower CO2 emissions than \nstandard Dunisoft®. This means \nthat a complete transition to \nBioDunisoft® would result in a \nreduction of 3,137 tonnes of \nCO2e, which is equivalent to \ndriving 18.29 million km in a \nnormal car.\nBioDunicel®, for its part, gene­\nrates 28% lower CO2 emissions \nthan conventional Dunicel® \nmaterial. A 100% transition to \nBioDunicel® would mean a \nreduction of 3,084 tonnes of \nCO2e. That is the equivalent \nof 17.98 million kilometers in \na normal car.\nThe audited LCA report is avail-\nable on Duni Group’s website.\n“\u0007This is a large part of our \nportfolio that’s being re-\nlaunched and switched \nover to bio-based materials.”\n     \u0007Hanna Banica, Marketing Director, Business Area Duni"

And demand \nfor sustainable packaging is increasing. The BioPak business area has alternatives to plastic packaging, which \nconsumers are demanding. We also have circular alternatives in both multi-use and single-use solutions, \nand are well positioned for the future in these areas.\nThe BioPak business area coped well \nwith the pandemic. Demand for food \npackaging solutions skyrocketed, as \ntake-away and home delivery of food \nwere two strong trends. \n“There’s still good demand, but the \nproduct mix has changed somewhat, and \ncups and glasses have recovered, while \nfood packaging has stabilized at a higher \nlevel than before the pandemic. The market \ncontinues to see stable growth with a \nfocus on sustainability,” says Nicklas \nBengtsson, who took over as EVP of the \nbusiness area in autumn 2022.\nSustainability and convenience are two \nunderpinning drivers for the take-away \nsector. Even after the pandemic, many \npeople are working from home several \ndays a week, and home delivery or take-\naway are useful options.\nMaintaining quality for ready meals\nThe growing demand for take-away and \nready meals has also broadened the sec-\ntor. More and more retailers are now selling \nready meals, in competition with tradi-\ntional restaurants. This makes it easier for \nconsumers, who can buy ready meals at \nthe same time as other food items. \nThe business area’s Duniform® packaging \nconcept is an excellent alternative for \nready meals and can extend shelf life \nwhile maintaining quality, which contrib-\nutes to reduced food waste. \nSealable Duniform® Forum trays were \nlaunched in 2022. Manufactured from \nFSC®-certified cardboard, they contain \n85% less plastic than traditional trays. \nSeeking producers closer to customers\nThe difficulties experienced during the \npandemic of producing and transporting \nproducts from Asia led the business area to \nstart looking for European subcontractors \nin 2021. This transition continued in 2022.\n“Although the supply of transport containers \nis better and prices are becoming normal-\nized at a higher level, there are still long \ndelivery times from Asia. But some \nmaterials cannot yet be produced in \nEurope and must continue to be produced \nin Asia. Producing outside Europe is some­\ntimes a requirement from customers \nfrom a price perspective. With more pro-\nduction in Europe, the risk is reduced \nand planning is easier. It will take time to \nstrike the right balance, but we strongly \nbelieve that this is the right way forward,” \nexplains Nicklas.\nEven though there are many benefits to this \ntransition, we must also be competitive. \nFor many of our customers, price remains \nthe deciding purchase factor. There is also \nexpertise in Asia and materials of interest.\nThree key success factors\n2022 was strongly characterized by external \nfactors that created tremendous uncer-\ntainty and affected all industries. Increas-\ning prices for transport, energy and raw \nmaterials naturally have consequences. \nHigher costs must be passed on to the end \nconsumer. In this respect, our commer-\ncial organization has shown fine judgment.\n \n“Our success is based on three main \ncomponents. We always create our own \ndesign, we must always be premium and \nwe must be the most sustainable supplier. \nI find it very difficult to see how a competitor \ncan match us here with our wide prod-\nuct range. Customers know they can rely \non us, and if they want the best, we’re there \nfor them,” continues Nicklas.\n“\u0007Customers know they can \ntrust us, and if they want the \nbest, we’re there for them.”\n    \u0007Nicklas Bengtsson, Executive Vice President, Business ­ \nArea BioPak"

In 2021, the EU’s single-use plas-\ntics directive (SUPD) came into force, \nwhich bans the sale of certain single-­\nuse plastic items.\nReplacing plastic a complex process\nWhile legal requirements are intensifying \nand opinion against plastic is strength-\nening, it is a complex area. Finding sus-\ntainable and hygienic alternatives with the \nproduct benefits of plastic in food pack-\naging applications is a challenge. Manu-\nfacturers and suppliers easily get caught \nup between different laws, which on the \none hand concern the environment/cli-\nmate and on the other hand food con-\ntact and food safety.\n“Price and function make some plastic \nproducts difficult or almost impossible \nto replace. In some parts of our range, \nplastic is still the best option to preserve \nthe quality of the food and keep it fresh \nfor longer. If you also want to be able to ­ \nsee the food in the packaging, it’s usually \ndifficult with fiber-based alternatives that \naren’t as transparent,” says Tomasz \nDoweyko, Marketing Director for Business \nArea BioPak.\nSeveral new sustainable product \nranges\nBut Duni Group fully supports SUPD and \nbegan to switch the product range in good \ntime before the directive came into force. \nOur updated strategic focus on sustain-\nability and circular solutions reinforces \nthe incentive, and work continued in \n2022 with new launches. New products \ninclude sustainable products in the pop-\nular Duniform® sealing concept. \n“For example, we’ve developed several \nfiber-based product ranges that can replace \nour plastic solutions in the Duniform® \nrange. We’re continuing to work on this \ntransition, so that in due course we’ll be \nable to offer alternatives to all fossil-­based \nplastic in our range,” says Tomasz.\nMany options and materials – and \npossibilities\nThe business area’s sustainable Duni-\nform® products are made from bio-based \nor recycled raw materials and are carbon \nneutral through compensation. They \nreduce the plastic content by up to 90%. \nThere are a number of different alterna-\ntives and materials.\nFor example, there are sealable trays \nmade of renewable and compostable \nbagasse (sugarcane fiber)with a thin \nPBAT/PLA coating. The Duniform® range \nof “Menu  Fiber” cellulose meal molds is \nmanufactured in Europe and consists of \nwood fibers with a bio-based PBS/PLA \ncoating.  They are suitable for both hot \nand chilled food and are compostable in \nindustrial environments.\nThe Duniform® Forum range is made from \nFSC®-certified cardboard with a removable \nPE coating, and consists of 85% less \nplastic than conventional alternatives. \nAll Duniform® CPET trays are made from \n100% recycled PET material. Different \nsealing options are available to meet \ndifferent customer needs, from fiber-\nbased or clear lids to different sealing films.\nKeeping a close eye on legislation\n“We’re constantly looking at any legisla-\ntion or regulations that the EU, as well as \nindividual member states, are looking at – \nrelated to packaging in general, but above \nall in terms of plastic. We’re continuously \nmonitoring this area so that we can stay \none step ahead. We need to know what’s \naround the corner, so that we can develop \nand adapt our range ahead of future \nchanges,” says Tomasz.\nDuniform® – a tried and \ntested concept just got \nmore sustainable \nThe Duniform® sealing con-\ncept has simplified the sealing \nof packaging solutions and \nkept them clean, fresh and \nleak-proof for 40 years. It pro-\nvides safer transport of vari-\nous food products and makes \nhandling easier. It can also \nreduce food waste, which can \nhelp reduce climate impact. \nThe Duniform® concept is con-\ntinuously evolving to be even \nbetter and to meet today’s \nhigh demands for sustainabil-\nity. The Duniform® range \nincludes sealing machines, \ntrays, sealing films, transport \nsolutions, and service and \nsupport.\n\u0007“We’re continuing this \ntransition to offer alternatives \nto all fossil-­based plastic in \nour range.”\n\u0007Tomasz Doweyko, Marketing Director for the Business Area BioPak"

The business has employees in 21 countries, \nwith production in Sweden, Germany, Poland, Thailand and New Zealand. Each country has unique challenges \nand risks, with local regulations and laws that must be followed. \nDuni Group 2022 / Risks and risk management\nRisks and risk management\nGroup Management reports risk issues on an ongoing basis to \nthe Board of Directors, which has ultimate responsibility for the \ncompany’s risk management. This may include, for example, \nfinancial status, compliance with the Group’s financial policy, \nand external changes globally. By identifying, mapping and plan-\nning the Group’s risks, the management team is supported in \nmaking strategic decisions.\nUnderpinning operational risk management, which is man-\naged at all levels of the organization, is the Group’s Code of \nBusiness Conduct and a number of key policies. This aims to \nincrease the risk awareness of the whole organization, among \nboth operational decision-makers and the Board.  The goal of \nrisk management is not necessarily to eliminate a risk, but to \nidentify, control and balance various initiatives against the \nGroup’s financial and sustainability goals. The identification and \nhandling of local complaints is the responsibility of the local \nmanagement teams.\nBusiness risks \nThe business risks are divided into:\n• strategic and external risks\n• operational risks\n• sustainability risks \nThese risks may affect the company’s business model \nand long-term strategic planning, and may have a \nnegative impact on the financial results or the Group’s \nreputation.\nSome of the business risks are due to external factors \nassociated with the world at large that are difficult \nto influence. In 2022, some of these risks were related \nto the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the sharp \nrise in inflation and the war in Ukraine. \nRisks associated with internal factors can largely be \ncontrolled by the company itself. Sustainability risks \ninclude environmental, human rights and corruption \nrisks. This also includes risks such as not being able \nto keep up with external requirements regarding mate-\nrial development, reporting or legal requirements.\nFinancial risks\nThe central finance department is responsible for \nprioritizing and managing financial risks such as \nforeign exchange, interest rate, liquidity and credit \nrisks. The financial policy focuses on the unpredict-\nability of the financial markets and is reviewed and \napproved annually by the Board of Directors. \nAll legal entities in the Group report their income state-\nment and balance sheet every month in accordance \nwith internal reporting requirements and accounting \nrules. Controllers for the operational activities examine \nand analyze the financial information in each area of \nresponsibility as an element of quality control. Duni \nGroup works systematically with a range of control \nactivities such as analytical reviews, spot checks, \naudits and reconciliations. \nRisks that might cause errors in the company’s financial \nreporting are analyzed and assessed. The company \nevaluates and makes decisions every year on which \nrisks are significant to consider in order to ensure \ngood internal control in financial reporting."

These include changes in legisla-\ntion, violations of legislation within the \norganization, deficiencies in agreements or \nlegal challenges locally that might have \nnegative legal and financial consequences \nfor the company. Duni Group operates in \nmany countries, and the varying legal \nrequirements between countries can pose a \nrisk. \nThere is a focus on legal changes and thereby legal compliance \nwithin all of the business’s functions and countries. One issue \nthat the business must continuously monitor is legal changes to \nregulate the use of single-use products, especially plastics, but \nalso other materials. We monitor the EU’s review of laws relating \nto the forest industry’s environmental impact, which may \ninvolve changes to our business operations. \nTo ensure good legal compliance, Duni Group works closely with \nexternal experts and advisors. In addition to this, the business is \ngoverned by Duni Group’s Code of Business Conduct and asso-\nciated policies and directives, which help the organization to do \nthe right thing.   \nSupplier dependency\nDuni Group is dependent on external suppli-\ners in order to be able to manufacture, sell \nand deliver products. Should a key supplier \nsuffer disruption, this could in turn cause \ndisruption in parts of the Group’s opera-\ntions.\nFor business area Duni, this dependence \nrelates primarily to the raw materials used ­ \nin the production of tissue materials. For \nbusiness area BioPak, dependence relates \nto key suppliers in Asia and Europe.\nFor raw materials, the risk is managed by reducing dependence \nand spreading it as far as possible. As there are few suppliers of \ncertain input materials, the company needs to accept some risk \nand instead work with supplier planning and evaluation of any \nimpact in continuity plans.\nIn order to manage the risk in connection with the purchasing ­ \nof traded goods, we work with supplier planning and evaluate \ngeographical distribution and choice of materials. \nCustomer dependency\nDuni Group sell to the retail sector, e-com-\nmerce, end customers and to a large extent \nthrough wholesalers. If wholesalers are ­ \nnot successful in their sales, earnings are \nadversely affected. \nDuni Group’s ten largest customers account for around 20% of \ntotal net sales. Great emphasis is placed on long-term customer \nrelationships and on constantly creating good relationships with \nnew customers. \nAs the customer structure largely consists of wholesalers, \nbehind which a large number of restaurants and hotels are end \ncustomers, individual customer dependence on end customers \nis not significant.\nCompetition\nDuni Group is exposed to competition from \nother companies in the industry, especially \nin the German market, where local actors \nare playing an increasingly prominent role. \nDuni Group constantly focuses on reaching out to the market in \nan attractive way and on meeting the needs of customers and \nconsumers. The innovation department is working to develop \nthe current offering and create eco-smart solutions that are in \nline with changing demands and legislation. Investing in innova-\ntion is necessary for our competitiveness. \nExternal risks\nDuring the year, Duni Group was exposed to \nexternal risks, the direct cause of which is \nbeyond the Group’s control. One example is \nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine, which led to a \nchange in the geopolitical situation. Another \nis the sharp rise in inflation, which has \naffected costs in general, not least related to \nraw materials, transport and energy. The \nCovid-19 pandemic had a major impact on \nDuni Group, and despite the fact that restric-\ntions have now been lifted to a large extent, \nthere remains uncertainty about the more \nlong-term effects of the pandemic, such as \nbehavioral patterns regarding business travel, \nevents and other market conditions. \nDuring the year, Duni Group closely monitored developments in \nUkraine and followed all sanctions imposed. The operation in \nRussia, a sales office with around 20 employees, was divested, \nand Duni Group now has no operations in either Russia or \nUkraine. No input materials and no imports come from these \ntwo countries.\nIn order to manage cost increases, the production has intro-\nduced efficiency improvement programs, which has resulted in \nlower fixed costs per ton produced. The Group has also worked \nproactively on price adjustments to mitigate the negative \neffects of higher costs. \nBusiness risks\nDuni Group 2022 / Risks and risk management\nlow\t\nmedium\t\nhigh \t\nextreme"

Disruption at the paper mill \nwill, depending on the level of damage, also \ncause disruption at the converting units. In \nconverting, there are risks that could mean \nthat the company would ultimately be unable \nto deliver products to end customers. Disrup-\ntion in production can be caused by fire, \nmachine breakdown, handling errors, \nresource shortages, IT breakdown or other \nkinds of damage. \nThe Group works actively with preventive measures, not least in \nterms of fire safety, where training and checks take place on an \nongoing basis. Each facility works continuously with the mainte-\nnance of plant and machinery, and guarantees good order. The pre-\nventive measures are balanced with the insurance cover that exists \nwithin the Group. The majority of the production facilities are \ninspected annually by external risk engineers.\nEach production facility has a continuity plan that describes not \nonly the impact on the Group in the event of disruption, but also \nhow the Group can best reduce the impact, limit the total down-\ntime and ensure good continuity.\nDisruption in the  \nlogistics chain \nDisruption in the logistics chain can occur \nboth internally and externally. An interrup-\ntion at a logistics partner may be caused by \na cyber attack, bankruptcy or some other \nevent. An internal interruption may be due \nto fire, lack of personnel, machine break-\ndown or similar. \nThe risk for the company is partly to be unable \nto secure delivery of tissue and airlaid from our \npaper mill in Skåpafors to the converting units \nin Europe. There is also a risk regarding busi-\nness area BioPak and challenges that may \narise with deliveries from Europe and Asia. \nUltimately, the company risks not being \nable to secure delivery to the end customer.\nThe company’s logistics department places great emphasis on \npreventive measures to reduce the impact in the event of an \nexternal interruption. Efficient processes are implemented to \nreplace transport providers. The risk is also mitigated through \ngood and flexible collaboration with logistics partners, which \nmeans that the company can plan and be well prepared. \nTo manage the internal risk, focus is on fire prevention work \nthrough training and checks, maintenance of machines etc.  \nin the warehouses and preventive planning in the event of  \ndisruption.\nEmployee risks  \nIn order to meet set goals, Duni Group is \ndependent on being able to recruit and \nretain motivated employees. There is \ntherefore a strong focus on employee risks \nrelated to succession, discrimination, occu-\npational health and safety, and skills. \nSuccession planning is undertaken every year in the management \nteam, to ensure retention of the right competence. To guarantee \nan organization with healthy employees, there is an annual cycle \nof employee and focus discussions, skills development, internal \ntraining, systematic work with health and safety, etc. New for \n2022 is that employees’ well-being is checked every month \nusing a pulse survey. The Group also has an established whistle­\nblower function that employees can use if necessary.\nDuni Group focuses on having an attractive corporate culture \nwith clear values and a balance between private life and work to \nmake the company known as an attractive employer. \nProduct safety \nRequirements related to product safety are \nparticularly strict for products that come \ninto contact with food. In addition, legal \nchanges related to the Group’s product \nrange occur at a rapid pace, at both local \nand global levels. If we do not succeed in \nkeeping up to date with these require-\nments, there is a risk that trust in our brands \nwill diminish.  \nWithin the Group, product safety is ensured in connection with \nin-house production and converting, as well as in relation to prod-\nucts purchased externally. This also includes the business’s LED \nproduct range, which requires a great deal of focus. The company \ntests the products together with external experts and trains sup-\npliers to produce using materials that meet the requirements.  \nA new parliamentary decision in Sweden makes it possible for \ngovernment agencies to check businesses that manufacture, refine \nor distribute contact materials. For the Group, this means a con-\ntinuous focus on regulatory compliance. \nIT (information and \nsecurity)\nDisruptions to critical IT systems can seriously \naffect operations in different ways. Cyber \nrisks such as ransomware, phishing, infor-\nmation leakage, and other forms of online \nfraud are an increasing threat that requires \ngreat vigilance. \nIn order to minimize external threats and their impact, the Group \ninvests continuously in appropriate technology. We monitor devel-\nopments in this area closely, in order to best protect critical infor-\nmation and ensure stable IT operations. The Board’s Audit Com-\nmittee has cyber security as an additional focus area and reported \non this at all meetings in 2022.\nDuni Group 2022 / Risks and risk management\nlow\t\nmedium\t\nhigh \t\nextreme"

This can mean that risks of, \nfor example, child labor, slavery, discrimina-\ntion, or unsafe workplaces are not detected \nin time and workers in our value chain are \nmistreated. \nThis may mean that workers’ human rights \nare not respected and that they suffer, with-\nout any opportunity to influence their work \nsituation.\nDuni Group’s codes of business conduct and supplementary \npolicy documents apply to all employees, Board members and \nexecutives (incl. Group Management), suppliers and business \npartners. Compliance in the supply chain is followed up through \naudits. \nIn 2022, Duni Group identified the risks in the value chain that \nare deemed to have the most serious consequences for human \nrights (salient human rights). This is a continuous process that \nmust be evaluated and revised as necessary. It is done to reduce \nthe risk of involuntarily contributing to human rights violations. \nCorruption  \nCorruption poses a threat to sustainable \neconomic and social development around \nthe world, and to varying degrees it exists \nglobally. Duni Group operates in many \ncountries and, like many other companies, \nruns the risk of involvement in corrupt and \nunethical behavior, fraud, and irregularities \nin sales, purchasing, and production.   \nDuni Group holds internal training courses in the company’s \nCode of Business conduct. These are supplemented by detailed \npolicy documents. All of the Group’s employees, Board mem-\nbers, executives (incl. Group Management), suppliers and busi-\nness partners undertake to comply with these policies. \nThe Group strives for a business-ethical approach throughout its \nvalue chain. \nCertifications  \nDuni Group has a number of sustainability-­\nrelated certifications, such as the Forest \nStewardship Council® (FSC®) and OK Com-\npost. Risk factors, such as the changing of \ncriterias, or the value chain not complying \nwith the requirements, can contribute to a \npossible loss of the certifications. \nPart of our sustainability work is devoted to living up to and \nmaintaining our certifications. It is extremely important to have \ngood internal control and to work actively on auditing both our \nown operations and the entire value chain. A number of policies \nhave been updated and developed to govern the annual audit \nwork. The company also works closely and proactively with \nexternal experts in the various areas, in order to stay one step \nahead. \nRenewable energy  \nDuni Group’s strategy is to have a net zero \nclimate impact for Scope 1 & 2 by 2030. One \nstep is to use renewable energy in production. \nA lack of renewable energy could have a neg-\native impact on the environment and thereby \nalso the company’s strategy. \nClear key performance indicators (KPIs) are set in production. \nWork is also continuously under way to examine various solu-\ntions for energy reduction and switching to renewable energy in \norder to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.

      "text": "41\nDuni Group 2022 / Risks and risk management\nArea\nDescription\nAction\nRisk of errors in \nfinancial reporting   \nThere are risks to financial reporting, partly \nthrough handling errors or system errors, \nwhich affect access to relevant IT systems, \nand partly a lack of resources or other factors. \nThere are a number of mitigating measures to manage the risk, \nincluding good internal control, clear reporting schedules, a broad \ncontroller function, continuous system backups, and system priority \nat IT. \nA more detailed description of the Group’s work on internal control \ncan be found in the Directors’ Report. \nCurrency risk \nDuni Group operates internationally and is \nexposed to currency risks which arise from \nvarious currency exposures. Transaction \nexposure arises through purchases and sales \nin a currency other than the functional currency. \nTranslation exposure arises when the subsid-\niaries’ balance sheets and income statements \nare translated into SEK. Translation from each \ncompany’s functional currency into SEK has \na major impact on the Group’s reported rev-\nenue and income.\nDuni Group manages currency exposure, which is divided into\ntranslation exposure and transaction exposure, by concentrating \nexposure to a small number of Group companies and through a \nfinancial policy adopted by the Board of Directors. We have \ngood internal measures to minimize currency risk, but its impact \nis also driven by external factors that are difficult for us to con-\ntrol.  For more information, see Note 33.\nCapital risk \nCapital risk comprises refinancing and liquidity \nrisks. These risks arise if the company cannot \nmeet payment obligations due to a liquidity \nshortage or difficulties in obtaining credit \nfrom external sources. \nThe risk is managed by Group Treasury, which ensures that\nsufficient cash and cash equivalents are available with the aid of \navailable financing through agreed credit facilities. Continuous work \nis carried out on liquidity forecasts in both the short and long \nterm, as well as various activities to secure a good cash flow.\nFocus activities related to, e.g., cash flow and inventories. Work \non short-term and long-term liquidity forecasts are other import-\nant control mechanisms. \nInterest rate risk  \nThere is an interest rate risk within Duni Group. \nExposure arises when all borrowing is at \nvariable interest rates. \nThe Parent Company’s internal lending and \nborrowing also takes place at variable rates.\nIn order to manage interest rate risk and protect the Group’s interest \nexpenses against abnormal levels, as all borrowing is at variable \ninterest rates, primarily in EURIBOR, part of the interest rate risk \nis hedged at fixed interest rates through interest rate swaps. \nThese are solely for financially hedging risks, not speculative \npurposes.\nCredit risk \nCredit risk is managed at Group level and \napplies if a counterparty is unable to fulfill \nits commitment and causes a loss. Financial \ntransactions also give rise to credit risks.\nThe credit risk associated with accounts receivable is managed by \nsuch means as external credit checks on customers. During the \nyear, bad debt losses did not deviate significantly from normal. \nThere is, however, constant uncertainty in the market, which is \nfollowed up and handled in accordance with a set regulatory \nframework.\nTaxes  \nDuni Group works actively to ensure com-\npliance with laws related to areas including \ntax issues. If, for any reason, the company \ndoes not comply with local tax laws or regu-\nlations imposed by the OECD, this may \nhave negative consequences for the Group. \nThe company’s financial manual describes the basic approach \nand management of tax issues. External experts are also used \ncontinuously to best interpret and assess tax-related issues. \nPrice risk  \nThe Group is generally exposed to price \nrisks, and in 2022 there was high inflation \nand rising prices at many levels. \nBusiness area Duni’s production and convert-\ning units in Europe are particularly vulnerable \nto energy price risks with their energy-­\nintensive operations, especially gas and \nelectricity. The business area also has price \nrisks with regard to the pulp used in the \nmanufacturing of tissue and airlaid. \nOur production units work actively on energy efficiency and focus \non striking a good balance between contracted volume and spot \nprice volume. In order to reduce dependence on electricity, work \nis under way to guide the energy mix more towards biofuel.\nRegarding pulp prices, an investigation is under way into alternative \ntypes of fiber that will reduce and spread the risk better. Pulp prices \nare strongly affected by the trend in USD against EUR and SEK. \nTo compensate for price increases in general, the Group has \nworked actively on price adjustments during the year.\nFinancial risks\nlow\t\nmedium\t\nhigh \t\nextreme"

Duni Group \nchooses to be proactive in this area, and \nour three sustainability initiatives help us \nfocus on the right things (see below).\nImportant to have reporting and \npolicies\nOwners and investors are some of a com-\npany’s most important stakeholders. ESG \n(Environment, Social & Governance) \naspects are assuming ever greater signifi-\ncance when they assess a company’s \nfuture prospects and attractiveness as an \ninvestment opportunity. There are differ-\nent sources to determine a company’s \nperformance, from established platforms \nsuch as GRI (Global Reporting Initiative), \nUNGC (UN Global Compact) and Eco-\nVadis, to legislation and investors’ own \nmodels. One common denominator is \nthat they all link financial with environ-\nmental and social aspects in accordance \nwith the Triple Bottom Line model.\nWhen we updated our policies and gov-\nerning documentation in 2022, we there­\nfore structured them in accordance with \nTriple Bottom Line and ESG: environ-\nment, social and governance. This gives \nus a head start prior to future changes \nand requirements. By reporting in accor-\ndance with the GRI, we are also taking a \nstep forward in how we structure our \nsustainability work.\nThe EU’s view of single-use products is \nthe big issue facing our industry. The \nplastics directive from 2019 focused on \nsingle-use plastic products. Work under \nway on a new packaging regulation is \nputting more and more emphasis on \nrecycled materials, but above all on \nmulti-use packaging. \nDifferent sustainable solutions \nfor different occasions\nDuni Group is working intensively to \ndevelop efficient, sustainable solutions for \nreuse. The number of times a packaging \nitem can be reused is crucial, and in order \nfor it to be counted as sustainable, return \nrates significantly above 95% are required. \nThe important thing for us is to make it \neasier for consumers and restaurants to \ndo the right thing. And it is not possible \nto say in advance whether a single-use \nsolution or a multi-use solution is more \nsustainable. Duni Group can offer good \nsingle-use products with a high share ­ \nof renewable materials that fit into col-\nlection and recycling systems, and viable \nmulti-use products that suit both the \nrestaurant industry and consumers.\nIn this way, we want to ensure that we are \nthe industry’s trusted sustainability \nleader and a good partner for our cus-\ntomers.

To be effective in our efforts, we must \nbe aware of what we are influencing, but also what \naffects us in a number of areas.\nBackground\nIn 2022, we began our work on an updated materiality assessment. \nBased on an initial document analysis and qualitative interviews \nwith more than thirty stakeholders*, we compiled a so-called double \nmateriality assessment. This means that the content in the matrix \nwe created not only relate to our own impact, but also to our big-\ngest future risks and opportunities.\nLike the rest of our Sustainability Report, the materiality assessment \nis based on the standards defined by the Global Reporting Initiative \n(GRI), where we follow the procedures in GRI 3.\nWe began by carefully reviewing topics reported by, among others, \ncomparable companies and relevant non-governmental organizations. \nThese topics were then tested in a survey conducted with our stake­\nholder groups (e.g. customers, suppliers, government agencies, \nemployees and the Board), in which we asked open questions in semi-­\nstructured interviews. These interviews revealed other relevant topics, \nwhich we analyzed in order to identify key themes. We then followed \nthe GRI’s explanation of “significance” to determine our most import-\nant positive and negative impact areas. The GRI has topic-specific \nstandards for each of these areas. Page 45 has a description of how \nwe interpret and manage our impact in seven prioritized areas.\nSummary and matrix\nThe matrix we have compiled shows our material topics based on \ntheir importance. According to the GRI, this is determined by:\n• Scale – good/bad impact\n• Scope – how widespread the impact is\n• Irremediability – whether it can be mitigated\n• Likelihood – probability\nWe combined scale, scope and irremediability to determine how \npositive or negative the impact is or can be. Likelihood was used to \ncompare actual, existing topics and potential impact. These were \nused in two axes in a chart to illustrate the result.\nThe further to the left or right from the center a topic is in the matrix, the \nmore negative or positive it is. The actual impact is placed towards the \ntop, the greater the impact, while any impact is more likely the closer to \nthe bottom (Potential) it is. A topic that is close to the center of the axes is \neither not considered to be particularly significant or is not very likely \nto have a major impact. It is neither particularly negative nor positive. The \ngray/green circles from the center distinguish the topics that are most \nimportant for us to understand and where we need to report and act.\nThe ultimate climate goal for Duni Group is to \nachieve net zero emissions throughout the \nvalue chain. \n“In 2022, we started reporting our scope 1 \nand 2 impact on a quarterly basis. In addition, \nwork began on setting up the methodological \nframework for collecting data and calculating \nthe indirect emissions – scope 3 – which is \nnecessary to set up Science Based Targets,” \nexplains Kairit Kuusik, Climate Specialist, who \nwas appointed in 2022.\nWorking with Science Based Targets is extremely \nimportant in Duni Group’s efforts to be the \nindustry’s sustainability leader. It also future-\nproofs the company against new rules and \nincreases credibility and transparency, both \ninternally and externally.\n“The Scope 3 mapping process has given us a \nmuch deeper insight into how our waste, the \nmaterials we use, transportation and other \nvalue chain activities all affect our full green-\nhouse gas inventory,” says Kairit. \nScope 3 comprises 15 different categories. \nAn initial screening identified five main cate-\ngories: purchased goods and services, \nupstream and downstream transport and \ndistribution, waste generation and end-of-life \ntreatment of sold products. \n“These are our prioritized categories, but we \ninclude most of them in our analysis to create \na baseline for future decisions,” says Kairit. \nKairit Kuusik,  \nClimate Specialist\n  The path to net \nzero throughout  \nthe value chain\n* Business partners, civil society, employees, customers, investors, NGOs, government agencies"

      "text": "45\nSustainability Report 2022 / Sustainability and social responsibility\nMaterial topics\nEnd-of-life performance\nMany of our products have a short useful life and it is \noften difficult to monitor what happens when the end \nconsumer has used them. In addition, legislation \n(especially in the EU) is increasingly focused on topics \nsuch as littering, extended producer responsibility \nand recyclability. This category is part of our strate-\ngy’s sustainability initiative “Becoming Circular at \nScale”, as waste management solutions such as recy-\ncling and reuse can help close the material flow’s \ncycle. It is therefore absolutely crucial that we \naddress the problems and challenges of preventing \nand collecting waste. This will make it easier for us \nto comply with the proposed Packaging and Pack-\naging Waste Regulation (PPWR) from the EU.\nPlastics’ poor reputation\nOne important theme in the sustainability debate \nis the phasing out of single-use products made of \nplastic, and the questioning of how essential and \nviable some of our industry’s products really are. \nSome customer groups will always want to have \nsingle-use articles and packaging of the highest \nquality, but we must always consider the link between \nthis theme and our portfolio and our brand reputation. \nThis is why we are developing multi-use solutions \nwhile continuing to improve the sustainability per-\nformance of our products and packaging. The phase-­\nout of virgin fossil plastic is part of our “Becoming \nCircular at Scale” initiative, and the goal is a 50% \nreduction between 2019 and 2025. In 2022, we had \nreduced this by 25%.\nIncreasing regulation\nAlmost everyone interviewed for our materiality \nanalysis mentioned that legislation is increasingly \nfocused on sustainability issues, especially in Europe. \nThis important topic therefore incorporates the growing \nset of regulations in areas such as reuse, recycled \ncontent, single-use articles, plastic, litter, waste man-\nagement, forestry and packaging solutions. It is essen-\ntial for us to stay one step ahead of legal require-\nments, as they are expected to have  a profound \nimpact on many companies, including our suppliers \nand partners. A broad base of legislation  is having \nan impact, and we are continuously monitoring, for \nexample, the EU’s Plastics Directive, the Timber \nRegulation and producer legislation. We have also \nupdated our policies based on collaborations and \nfeedback from stakeholder dialogs.\nLeadership ambition\nWe are in a good position to drive our sector towards \nincreased sustainability. But it requires us to go beyond \nthe legal requirements if we are to be a true leader, \nand that we communicate more. We have an oppor-\ntunity to tell our story to strengthen our position. \nThis topic is crucial, as it reflects the strategy’s sus-\ntainability initiative “Living the Change”. Sustainability \nis at the heart of Duni Group’s identity, so it is essential \nthat we continue to share our progress to inspire \nothers. We have online training courses and have \nalso appointed 17 Sustainability Leaders in the \norganization. Our KPI for EcoVadis score fits in here, \nas we are aiming for a platinum level by 2025 (top \n1%), we boosted our gold level by 4 points in 2022, \nand are in the top 3% group.\nClimate change\nAll companies contribute to climate change through \ntheir activities. Consequently, this topic is extremely \nimportant as a fundemental focus. At Duni Group, ­ \nwe work to measure and reduce not only our direct \nemissions, but also indirect emissions throughout our \nsupply chain (and communicate quarterly to our key \nstakeholders). The first step is to measure our Scope 3 \nemissions (in addition to Scopes 1 and 2), a complex \ntask that we started in 2022. The topic of “Climate \nchange” is still negative in the matrix  and is particularly \nimportant due to its scale and the fact that the impact \ncannot be repaired. We are continuing to work on \nreducing our emissions in order to achieve our stra-\ntegic goal of “Going Net Zero”. Our KPI here is the \ncarbon intensity for Scopes 1 and 2, which is set at \nan index of 40 in 2025 (2019 base year), and we \nreached this level already in 2022.\nEmployee well-being\nThis topic includes themes such as occupational \nhealth and safety, skills development and employee \nwell-being. It also includes the positive influence we \nhave as a major employer in many regions. Many \nreporting standards (including GRI) have a strong focus \non employment. To work in line with best practice, \nit is essential for us to report on these topics. We \nhave a firmly rooted reputation as a good employer, \nand it is important that we practice what we preach \n(“Living the change”) to realize our strategic goals \nfor 2030. We have updated policies for the Code of \nConduct, human rights and whistleblowing. Our \nsuppliers are covered by our Code of Conduct policies, \nwhich comply with ILO standards and UNGC principles. \nInternal systems for gender equality and inclusion \nsupport employees and managers in their work.\nSupply chain management \nManagement of our supply chain includes global trends, \nsuch as problems caused by the pandemic and a \nshift towards local production. It also includes how \nwe interact with our suppliers and address any \nissues upstream in the value chain, such as human \nrights or labor law. Our suppliers feel that we are an \nengaged, interested partner and we try to help them \nimprove their business and reduce deficiencies in \ncompliance with regulations. We work constantly \nto improve environmental and social sustainability \nin our supply chain with ongoing audits, and there \nare still areas for improvement even further upstream \nin the chain. Our Business Partner Code of Conduct \nand our new supplier manual for partners govern \nsocial aspects for all suppliers, and we have broad-\nened the base of suppliers that we audit on an \nongoing basis.\n Plastics’ poor reputation\n  Regulations\n Brand reputation\n \u0007Food contact of  \nrecycled content\n \u0007Biodiversity\n \u0007 Inside-out influence\n \u0007 Both ways influence\n \u0007 Outside influence\n \u0007Energy use\n \u0007Adaptability\n \u0007Innovations\n  \u0007Leadership ambition\n \u0007Production efficiency\n \u0007Choice of materials\n \u0007Employee well-being\n \u0007End-of-life performance\n \u0007Climate change\n  \u0007Logistics\n \u0007External stakeholders’ \nengagement\n \u0007Anti-corruption  \n& ethics\n \u0007Consumption  \npatterns\n \u0007Single-use poor  \nreputation\n3\n4\n2\n1\nActual\nPotential\nNegative\nPositive\n \u0007Water\n \u0007Pollution\n \u0007Production waste\n \u0007Supply chain  \nmanagement"

Duni Group strives to choose environmentally efficient \nmaterials and energy sources in production and to offer relevant end-of-life solutions for our products.\nGoal 15: Life on land\nWe must protect, restore and sustainably use ecosystems and safeguard biodiversity. Paper fiber from forests is becoming an increasingly important raw \nmaterial for Duni Group. We prioritize FSC®-certified raw materials from responsibly managed forests, but also look for environmentally sound alternatives.\nAll parts of the life \ncycle are important\nA hugely important, but complex goal for the Group’s sustainability work is to switch to a circular business \nmodel in which all phases of the product life cycle are important.\nTo achieve truly sustainable solutions, the \nentire life cycle of a product must be \nconsidered in a circular system. The EU \nis an engine in the development towards \ncircularity, for example through its green \ndeal for a sustainable future (European \nGreen Deal). Duni Group collects waste in \nconverting and sends it back to Rexcell for \nreprocessing into new tissue products.\nBoth EU and local legislation are increas-\ning the pressure on our industry. \nThrough its 2019 plastic directive, the \nEU is steering the industry away from \nsingle-use products made of plastic. \nTheir upcoming packaging regulation \nwill increase the focus on multi-use \npackaging solutions and recycled plastic \nraw materials, which will have a major \nimpact on the industry.\nIt begins with the choice of materials \nand design\nOne fundamental problem is that our \nindustry generates too much waste, mainly \nplastic. Two areas will be key: single-use \nsolutions for food and drink, as well as \npackaging and products made from recycled \nmaterials. This puts a focus on the choice \nof material. Even in the design phase, we \nmust ensure that products and packaging \ncan be recycled or reused. \nThere is considerable uncertainty in this \narea. In general, there is a lack of effi-\ncient return flows for many materials, \nand big differences between countries. \nThere are also other regulations, such ­as \nthose for food safety, that slow down \nthe process for recycled materials. \nDifferent solutions will be needed\nThis issue can be solved, but cross-func-\ntional collaboration is crucial. The Group \ninvested in two exciting startups in the \nfield of reuse in 2021, German company \nRelevo and Spanish company Bûmerang. \nThese collaborations have been further \ndeveloped in 2022.\nIn the complex landscape in which we \nand our customers are now moving, \nthere is rarely one single best circular \nsolution. Single-use or multi-use alterna-\ntives, or other solutions, can all be best, \ndepending on the customer and geogra-\nphy. The system perspective is key.

Duni \nGroup made several important improvements in 2022.\nOne important goal for the Group is to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. This \nincludes both our own operations (GHG \nProtocol Scopes 1 and 2) and, in the long \nterm, our entire value chain (Scope 3). In \n2022, we carried out several activities that \nbring us closer to our goal of net zero \ncarbon dioxide emissions by 2030 for \nScopes 1 and 2. \nIt is important for us to be transparent \nand to communicate our results. So in \n2022, we began reporting carbon diox-\nide emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) in our \nquarterly reports. Once more, we were \nthe first in our industry. \nPowerful initiatives in in-house  \nproduction\nWithin the framework of Scopes 1 and 2, we \nare working to reduce our own emissions, \nfor example by only using renewable \nenergy. In 2022, solar panels were \ninstalled at the Group’s converting plant \nin Bramsche, Germany, and the sales \noffice in Breda, the Netherlands. We also \ntook a decision to do this at the factory \nin Bangkok, Thailand. Throughout the \nyear, our paper mill in Skåpafors received \nelectricity from “Good Environmental \nChoice Wind”. \nA major breakthrough in 2021 was that \nRexcell – as far as we know – was the first \npaper mill in the world to start switching \nto BioLPG in production. Unfortunately, \nthe geopolitical situation has reduced the \navailability of bio-based gas, which has \nmade this work difficult, and alternative \nsolutions are being assessed. \nSetting research-based targets\nTo measure our Scope 3 impact, we launched \na project that drills down into 15 different \ncategories of climate impact. This major \ntask is being led by our climate expert \nwho was appointed during the year.\nThis forms the basis for setting research-\nbased targets in accordance with the \n­Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). \nOverall, this will not only facilitate our \nefforts to eliminate carbon dioxide emis-\nsions, but will also contribute to our cli-\nmate work being examined by external \nexperts and will make it more transparent.\n* Direct emissions from own installations and vehicles\n** \u0007Indirect emissions from purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling for own use\n*** Direct and indirect emissions from the entire value chain"

During \nthe first year of the strategy, a lot of \nresources were therefore devoted to \ndisseminating and securing an under-\nstanding of what we want to achieve. \nPlatforms, tools and information were \ndeveloped to give employees throughout \nthe organization increased knowledge \nand confidence when talking about sus-\ntianability aspects with customers and \nsuppliers.\nTraining courses make the organi-\nzation stronger\nSeminars were organized with manage-\nment on the UN Sustainable Development \nGoals. We appointed 17 Sustainability \nLeaders, who will become ambassadors \nand support colleagues in their part of the \norganization.  \nWe created several different leadership \ntraining courses, and during the autumn \nwe launched a number of digital courses, \ne-learning programs, including some \nabout our Code of Conduct and our \nupdated policies. \nAn increasingly active voice in \nsustainability\n“Living the Change” includes both how we \nare as an employer and how we work with \nour suppliers and partners. But one \nimportant aspect of this social sustainability \nis that we must also be more visible in \nrelevant contexts and build two-way \ncommunication with key stakeholders. \nWe want to be involved and have an influ-\nence, but based on knowledge and skills, \nnot opinions. We made strong progress \nin this respect in 2022. \nInterest in what Duni Group has to say is \nincreasing, and we are being invited \nincreas­ingly often to conferences, pre-\nsentations and trade shows. In 2022, \nour participation included involvement \nin a project for standardization in the \narea of sustainable innovation, discus-\nsions with the Swedish Environmental \nProtection Agency about plastic and the \nwork of the Advisory Group for Circular \nEconomy. We also organized a round \ntable discussion at the Almedalen \npolitcal week. During the year, we also \nhad visits from government agencies \nand politicians."

They play an important \nrole in embedding the strategy’s sustainability focus, so that it becomes an integral feature of employees’ daily activities. In 2022, all \nSustainability Leaders completed the online course “Driving Business Towards the Sustainable Development Goals”. We meet three \nof them here: Ewa, Michael and Stephanie.\nEwa Polakowska, Sustainability \nAccounting Manager,  \nPoznan, Poland\n“I’m glad that sustainability is a key \ncomponent of the Group’s updated \nstrategy, because it’s so important \nto me.

They also \nmake it easier for our employees to live in line with our sustainability goals.\n \nTransparency is now becoming increasingly \nimportant when companies communicate \nand report on their sustainability work, \nand this information is requested by \nmany stake­holders, including investors \nand banks.\nIn 2022, a lot of effort was put into updating \nand supplementing the Group’s policies. \nOne key reason is our strategy, which \npartly sets out a new direction towards \n2030. Policies help our managers and \nemployees to act in accordance with our \nsustainability initiative, “Living the Change” \n(practicing what we preach, see page 52).\nMore and more legal changes also mean \nthat we need to update our policies, and \nalso create new ones. Economic sanctions \nis one example of this, and after the inva-\nsion in Ukraine, it became even more \nimportant to know who we are doing \nbusiness with.\nAs other companies in our value chain \nprioritize their sustainability work, there \nare also stricter requirements for us to \nreport what we are doing. A growing \nnumber of customers, as well as suppliers, \nmake these demands of us, for example \nhow we work with GDPR (the General \nData Protection Regulation).\nESG structure creates an overview\nDuni Group reports its sustainability work \nin accordance with the GRI standard. We \nmust therefore be able to show that the \nGroup has policies implemented in the \norganization and that we act in accor-\ndance with them. \nIn 2022, we supplemented our policy \nportfolio with elements that were missing \nfrom reporting in accordance with GRI. \nWe have chosen to structure our policies \nin accordance with ESG (Environment – \nSocial – Governance), which facilitates the \nanalysis of companies from a non-finan-\ncial perspective. We therefore now have \nenvironmental, social and corporate gov-\nernance policies. \nA clear structure makes it easier to explain \nwhy we need a policy for a specific area. \nOne step in making the information more \neasily accessible was the publication of a \ncompletely revised Duni Group Policy \nBook in autumn 2022. Some parts are \nnew and others have been revised to \ncomply with new laws and guidelines. \nMust be easy to do the right thing\nAll policies have been approved by the \nBoard of Directors and apply to all employees \nin Duni Group. The collection of policies \nalso includes Directives (approved by the \nCEO), Guidelines (approved by the CEO \nor person responsible for the function) \nand Processes and Procedures (approved \nat local team level). This collection will be \nreviewed at least once a year.\nThe policies have been published on the \nGroup’s intranet, and selected policies are \npublished on the Group’s website. To dis-\nseminate knowledge internally within the \norganization and make it easy to absorb, a \nnumber of digital courses were created, \ne-learning courses, which explain our \npolicies – why and how to act in line with \nthem. Some digital courses are aimed at \nthe entire organization.\nOne clear objective of our policy work is \nthat it must be easy to do the right thing \nwhen working within Duni Group. We want \nto do all we can to prevent unethical be­havior \nthroughout the organization. Everyone \nshould be able to easily find which stan-\ndards apply within Duni Group and how \nthey are expected to relate to a number \nof important areas.\nSustainability Report 2022 / Sustainability and social responsibility\nDuni Group’s policies\nGeneral\n• Code of Business Conduct\n• Business Partner Code of Conduct\nEnvironment\n• Environmental Policy\nSocial\n• Human Rights Policy\n• Whistleblower Policy\nGovernance\n•  \u0007Working Procedures for the Board of \nDirectors \n• \u0007Instruction for the Compensation \nCommittee \n• Audit Committee Charter\n• \u0007Financial Policy\n• \u0007Communications and IR Policy\n• \u0007Insider Policy\n• \u0007Anti-Corruption Policy\n• \u0007Anti-Money Laundering Policy (AML)\n• \u0007Trade Sanctions Policy\n• \u0007GDPR Policy\nDuni Group’s directives\nGeneral\n• Policy Governance Document \nEnvironment\n• \u0007General Requirements for  \nSuppliers of FG and RM\n• Wood Sourcing Directive\n• Global Travel Directive\nSocial\n• \u0007Diversity, Inclusion and Equality \nDirective\n• Social Media Directive\n• Work Environment Directive\n• Global Health and Safety Directive\nGovernance\n• \u0007Conflict of Interest Directive\n• \u0007Modern Slavery and Human  \nTrafficking Directive\n• Capital Expenditure Directive\n• Signature Authorization Directive\nSource: Duni Group Policy Book, 2022"

      "text": "56\nSustainability Report 2022 / Sustainability and social responsibility\nThe Code of Conduct \nshall govern our actions\nDuni Group’s Code of Business Conduct sets out how the Group’s employees – as well as our suppliers \nand other partners – should act in a business context.\nThe Group’s Code of Business Conduct \nis there to provide guidance on how we \nact in all business contexts. It covers our \nown internal operations, as well as how \nwe act towards others in our value chain \nand society at large. But it also covers \nhow we expect our suppliers to act. In \n2022, we revised our internal Code of \nBusiness Conduct.\nThe Code of Business Conduct  has an \nobvious link to our policies and direc-\ntives, and is a compressed reference \ndocument for several of our policies. \nThis is then supplemented with more \ndetailed documents in a number of dif-\nferent areas. \nLaws govern the area of business \nethics\nWork on business ethics is driven by legal \nrequirements, so we must always ensure \nthat we meet the requirements placed \non us as a company in the geographical \nmarkets where we operate. As a publicly \nlisted company, we also need to be able \nto show that we meet the requirements \nof investors and institutions. In addition, \nwe want to ensure that our suppliers’ \npersonnel have a safe work environment, \nas well as healthy working conditions and \nworking hours, and that forced labor and \nchild labor are avoided. \nThe Group has signed the UN Global \nCompact and is committed to working in \naccordance with the UN’s ten principles \nfor the environment, human rights, anti-­\ncorruption and labor law, which will \nbecome increasingly important in the \nfuture. In 2022, the EU presented a draft \nversion of its upcoming mandatory \n­Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence \nDirective, which focuses on human \nrights and environmental issues. Due \n­diligence involves, among other things, \nrequirements for structured work to \nidentify weaknesses and to communi-\ncate about work undertaken in this area. \nMany companies view this as a major \nchallenge, but for Duni Group this is \nsomething we have been doing for many \nyears, even though it is now becoming \nmore formalized through legislation.\nConducting continuous audits\nFor many years, we have conducted audits \nof our suppliers according to our Code \nof Business Conduct. We have a plan \nthat we follow, in which we prioritize the \nmost important suppliers and those \nwhere we see the greatest risks. These \nexternal audits are conducted by external \nexperts or by our internal auditors.\nDue to Covid-19, there were also lock-\ndowns in 2022, especially in China, \nwhich affected our audit work. Despite \nthis, we have been able to audit our \n­Chinese suppliers according to plan, ­ \nand we have also audited our suppliers \nin Taiwan for the first time since 2019. \nWe have also been able to recommence \naudits of our suppliers in Europe.\nAn ongoing task\nWe have updated the Code of Business \nConduct for our business partners, and \nwe now request that it is also complied \nwith by our business partners’ direct sup-\npliers, i.e. Duni Group’s so-called Tier 2 \nsuppliers. At the same time, we have \nstarted work on updating our general \nrequirements for suppliers of raw materi-\nals and finished goods, which, combined \nwith the Code of Business Conduct, form \nthe basis of our audits. Deviations identi-\nfied are managed through an agreed \naction plan with the supplier.\nThere are now increasing demands to \ncapture complaints and irregularities in  \nall parts of an organization’s operations. \nThese demands can come from both our \nown employees and external stakeholders. \nDuni Group’s external website contains the \nGroup’s whistleblower policy, as well as \ninformation and a whistleblower function \non the intranet. Whistleblowers can report \na case via web form, by phone or by letter.  \nResponsibility for these so-called “griev-\nance mechanisms” lies with the local man-\nagement team and, we will probably be \nstandardizing this further soon.\nGoal 8: Decent work and economic growth\nSustainable economic growth requires safe and decent employment and fair working conditions, as well as inclusion and diversity. Duni \nGroup advocates transformative leadership to improve working conditions both within the Group and at our suppliers."

Based on our sustainability \nstrategy, we set a goal to achieve a carbon \nintensity index of 40 by 2025, using 2019 \nas the base year.  During our quarterly \nreporting this year, we have seen signifi-\ncant reductions in our Scope 2 emissions, \nmainly due to the switch to renewable \nelectricity in all our European factories.\nWe can now see that we have reached \nindex 37 for 2022, largely thanks to the \nsignificantly increased production volumes \nfrom the market’s recovery after the pan-\ndemic. The next step is to switch from \nLPG to renewable fuels in our paper mill \nin Sweden, as this is the largest remaining \nsource of emissions in our operations. \nReporting includes CO2, CH4 and N2O.\nScope 3\nIn the summer of 2022, we began work on \ndata collection of Duni Group’s Scope 3 \nemissions. Scope 3 includes all of Duni’s \nindirect upstream and downstream emis-\nsions in the value chain. There are 15 data \ncategories in Scope 3, twelve of which are \nmaterial to us and are therefore included \nin the compilation. The three excluded \nare upstream and downstream leased \nassets (included in Scopes 1 and 2) and \nfranchise operations (not relevant). The \nbase year for the calculation is 2019, which \nwas the last full year without any impact \nfrom the pandemic. In most cases, primary \ndata is used, although it is supplemented \nwith assumptions where data is not avail-\nable. For purchased services in category 1, \nspend-based data is used. Translation into \nCO2e was done by applying emission fac-\ntors provided by an external partner.\nScope 3 emissions data will give us new \ninsights into how our purchases and our \norganizational activities affect our overall \nclimate impact. This will enable us to \nmake fact-based decisions in the future \nto reduce emissions from our operations, \nsuppliers and product portfolio. During \nthe initial process of mapping and linking \nto our business, five key categories were \nidentified that are expected to have the \ngreatest impact on our emissions. These \nare: purchased goods and services, up­­\nstream and downstream transportation \nand distribution, waste generation and \nend-of-life treatment of sold products.\nBelow is a summary of a quality evalua-\ntion of data that shows our confidence \nin the figures for Scopes 1 and 2 and for \nthe material Scope 3 categories.

The regulation is an important step \ntowards achieving the EU’s 2050 carbon-neu-\ntrality target.\nBelow we present the share of the Group’s net \nsales, capital expenditure (CapEx) and opera-\ntional expenditure (OpEx) that is taxonomy-eli-\ngible for 2022 in respect of economic activi-\nties related to the first two environmental \nobjectives (climate change mitigation and cli-\nmate change adaptation), in accordance with \nArticle 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation.\nDuni Group’s economic activities\nDefinitions\nEconomic activity that is deemed to be taxo­\nnomy-eligible means an activity as described \nin the delegated acts to the Taxonomy Reg-\nulation, whether or not it meets any or all of \nthe technical screening criteria defined in \nthe delegated acts.\nFor an economic activity to be regarded as \nsustainable, it must be taxonomy-aligned, it \nmust make a significant contribution to one or \nmore of the six identified environmental objec-\ntives, it must not cause significant damage to \nany of the other objectives, and it must meet \ncertain minimum safeguards. The activities \nto be considered as sustainable are defined \nby technical screening criteria, which are \ndefined in delegated acts to the Regulation.\nAn economic activity that is are neither taxon-\nomy-eligible  nor taxonomy-aligned refers to \nany  activity that is not described in the dele-\ngated acts of the Taxonomy Regulation.\nNet sales\nDuni Group has reviewed the Group’s revenue-­\ngenerating activities for 2022 to see which \nof these are taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-­\naligned respectively. The Group’s revenue-­\ngenerating activities are categorized into the \nwholesale and retail industry, which is a sector \nthat is not covered by the regulation in 2022. \n100% of the Group’s net sales are thereby \ndeemed non-eligible.\nEligible CapEx and OpEx\nThe Taxonomy Regulation specifies three \ncategories of CapEx and OpEx that may be \neligible or aligned in accordance with the \nregulation. The first two are directly related to \ncurrent or planned revenue-generating oper-\nations, which are or will become eligible, and \nare therefore not relevant for Duni Group. \nThe third category concerns expenditure to \nsuppliers whose activities are subject to the \ntaxonomy or expenditure related to individual \nmeasures aimed at improving energy effi-\nciency, if these are included in the taxonomy. \nDuni Group has reviewed its investments \nand operational expenditure to see if they can \nbe classified as eligible or covered by the \ntaxonomy. We identified five eligible activities \nrelated to investments that contribute to climate \nchange mitigation, in accordance with Annex I \nof the first delegated act.\n6.5. Transportation by motorbikes, passenger \ncars and light commercial vehicles\nThis economic activity includes the purchasing, \nfinancing, renting, leasing and operation of \nvehicles classified as category M1, N1, both \nfalling under the scope of Regulation (EC)"

Installation, maintenance and repair of \nenergy efficiency equipment\nThis economic activity includes individual \nrenovation measures consisting of the instal-\nlation, maintenance or repair of energy effi-\nciency equipment, including insulation, energy-­\nefficient doors and windows, energy-­efficient \nlight sources, high-efficiency heating, venti-\nlation, air conditioning and water heating \nsystems, low-water and energy kitchens, and \nsanitary water fittings. In 2022, Duni Group \ninvested in modern, highly efficient heating \nand ventilation systems in its production and \nlogistics facilities in Sweden and Germany.\n7.4. Installation, maintenance and repair of \ncharging stations for electric vehicles in \nbuildings (and parking spaces attached to \nbuildings)\nThis economic activity includes the installa-\ntion, maintenance and repair of charging \nstations for electric vehicles in buildings and \nparking spaces attached to buildings. In 2022, \nelectric charging stations were installed at \nthe production facility in Sweden.\n7.6. Installation, maintenance and repair of \nrenewable energy technologies\nThis activity includes the installation, main-\ntenance and repair of renewable energy tech­\nnologies on site, including photovoltaic \nsystems, solar panels, heat pumps, heat \nexchange/recycling systems. In 2022, Duni \nGroup installed solar panels in its production \nfacilities in Germany and Thailand, as well as \na heat recovery system in the production \nfacility in Germany.\n7.7. Acquisition and ownership of buildings\nThis activity is related to buying real estate \nand exercising ownership of that real estate \n(including leasing). Duni Group owns and \nrents buildings and offices within its opera-\ntions.\nAssociated eligible OpEx is related to vehicle \nmaintenance and service and installation of \nhighly efficient ventilation.\nWe have not been able to fully review the \nabove activities for taxonomy alignment due \nto difficulties in obtaining information about \nwhether suppliers meet the criteria for align-\nment. This will be further investigated in the \ncoming years.\nReporting and calculation of key figures\nThe denominator used to calculate the per-\ncentage of eligible CapEx consists of invest-\nments in property, plant and equipment and \nintangible assets during the fiscal year, before \ndepreciation and impairments, and excluding \nchanges in fair value. For this year’s CapEx, see \nthe “Investments” line in the table “Operating \nsegments, Group” in Note 3 on page 101.\nThe denominator used to calculate the per-\ncentage of eligible operating expenses does \nnot correspond to the Group’s total operating \nexpenses, but only to expenses associated \nwith the continuous and efficient functioning \nof assets. Therefore, these largely consist of \nmaintenance, service and repair costs.\nFor CapEx and OpEx, the numerator con-\nsists of the key figures for investments and \nexpenses related to the economic activities \ndescribed in the previous section.\nProportion of net sales from products or services associated with economic activities that are taxonomy-aligned"

Customers are mainly in the HoReCa+ sector. Its \npurpose is to enable people to socialize, has good food together \nand feel good. The aim is to become the industry’s leading sustain-\nability company in its sector by 2030 and to lead the way in sustain-\nable and circular solutions through innovation and strategic partner-\nships. The Group currently has a market-leading position in Europe, \nbased on a combination of high-quality products, two strong brands \n(Duni and BioPak), established customer relationships, value-added \ndesign and a strong local presence in most European markets. For \nmany years, the Group has focused on sustainability and environ-\nmentally smart solutions, which has strongly contributed to the \nGroup’s leading position. Operations are conducted through two \nbusiness areas, Duni and BioPak. For more details on these, see \nnote 3 Segment reporting and the annual report’s presentation of \neach business area.\nStrategy and Trends\nIn autumn 2021, an updated business strategy was launched, \nextending to 2030, to help the Group manage changes in the world \naround it and meet new customer needs. The strategy is based on \nthe UN’s Agenda 2030 with its seventeen global sustainability goals \nand, together with a long-term vision and a higher purpose, will \nstrengthen the Group in the market. The strategy has a strong focus \non sustainable and circular solutions, where the Group strives to \nlead and accelerate development. Five core areas – Position, Inno-\nvation, Customers, Operations and People & Culture – cover how \nthe Group will develop its offer and produce, but also how it will act \ntowards employees and customers as well as other stakeholders in \nthe value chain and the surrounding society.\nThe three main macro trends affecting the business are sustain-\nability and circular models, hygiene and digitization. On the environ-\nmental side, developments are driven by a general growing aware-\nness of the importance of making choices that slow down climate \nchange. In addition to growing public opinion, new laws and regula-\ntions are a key driver, such as the EU Plastics Directive. The demand \nfor hygiene solutions created by the pandemic continues to be strong. \nThe pandemic also accelerated the adoption of digital solutions, which \nnow have a strong foothold throughout the value chain, from design to \nconsumer and end-of-life solutions.\nInnovation and Concept Development\nInnovation has been given a central role in the new strategy and is \none of the Group’s five core areas. Investing in innovation creates \nfuture opportunities that allow the Group to maintain its competi-\ntiveness in a changing market. The goal is to offer the best prod-\nucts, solutions and winning service. Collaboration with, and invest-\nment in, other companies is crucial to driving innovation. It is also \nimportant to continuously increase the Group’s understanding of, \nfor example, markets and materials, as well as to continuously \ndevelop the skills of its staff.\nIn its development of new products and concepts, the Group has \nalways worked with new designs, shapes and colors as well as with \nnew materials and functional product solutions. The aim is to create \ncollections, concepts and products that simplify and create clear \nadded value for different customer categories.\nThe BioPak business has built its operations on innovative materials \nwith a clearly improved environmental profile compared to the stan-\ndard range. The focus is on characteristics such as resource effi-\nciency, renewability and the best possible solution after the prod-\nucts have been used, such as composting or reuse. As virgin plas-\ntics are phased out, fiber-based solutions are becoming increasingly \nimportant, such as bagasse, a by-product of sugar cane production. \nThe Duni Group has extensive experience in fiber-based solutions.\nThe Duni business area has a number of products as alternatives \nto linen. The table cover material Evolin® combines the look and feel \nof textile and linen table covers with the advantages of single-use \nproducts. Evolin® is aimed at restaurants and catering firms that per-\nceive an advantage in using linen-like single-use material. In 2021, \nDuni also launched tablecloths and napkins with renewable, more \nenvironmentally adapted binders, Bio Dunicel and Bio Dunisoft. This \nis a major step towards a more sustainable range for the business.\nMarket Developments and Environmental Factors\nThe global economic outlook is a key indicator of developments in the \nHoReCa market. Broad economic growth is positive for the industry. \nThis stimulates consumption within HoReCa and also the demand \nfor the Group’s products and services. The long-term trend contin-\nues to point towards an increasing number of restaurant visits, \ndriven mainly by increasing urbanization, changed consumption pat-\nterns and a lifestyle trend whereby meals are increasingly consumed \non the go. New restaurant concepts, such as prepared food in gro-\ncery stores, take-away and quick service restaurants, continue to \ngrow and take an increasing market share, even after the pandemic. \nThe recovery in the HoReCa market is satisfactory. It is evident that \nrestaurant visits are being prioritized once more when this is possible. \nThe ongoing energy crisis in Europe, as a consequence of the war in \nUkraine, has resulted in sharply rising inflation, which has forced the \nindustry to compensate with price increases, which will continue. Con-\nsumers in mature European markets are now showing greater inter-\nest in seeking value, and HoReCa companies are competing harder to \nreach a larger share of the total mealtime market. On the customer \nside, continued structural changes are taking place within the restau-\nrant industry, with restaurant chains that operate under joint brands \ngrowing at a faster rate than the market in general. This is a develop-\nment that benefits the Group’s sales of customized concepts.\nThe Group’s product category in retail focuses both on the produc-\ntion of private labels and sales of own brands. Parts of the category \nhave also expanded distribution in new channels such as garden \ncenters, interior design stores and “do-it-yourself” shops.\nAnother sector of the market comprises the serving of food to \ncompanies and institutions. It is mainly the healthcare sector that is \ntaking a larger share of the segment, and the market has enjoyed \n­stable growth in recent years. Here, there is clear potential for the \nDuni Group to create growth.\nFuture Outlook\nThe HoReCa sector is heavily influenced by changes in people’s life-\nstyles. The hotel and restaurant industry in Europe is an important \ncustomer segment for the Group. The recovery in the market, follow-\ning the pandemic, will continue to be volatile, but stable over time.\nIn general, long-term demand is driven primarily by improved \npurchasing power combined with changing habits, including an \nincreased share of meals outside the home. Demand for brand-pro-\nfiled, environmentally sound single-use products is also increasing. \nFurthermore, the trend towards increased accessibility and conve-\nnience connected with meals is continuing, and thus the take-away \nalternative is continuing to grow. This trend is reinforced by the \nincrease in the number of single households and the fact that \nurbanization is continuing.\nDirectors’ Report"

The previous year \nrefers to the fiscal year of 2021. The Group manages its activities on the \nbasis of what is referred to within the Group as the operating income. \n“Operating income” means operating income before restructuring \ncosts, non-realized valuation effects of currency derivatives, fair value \nallocations and amortization in connection with business acquisi-\ntions. For the bridge between EBIT and operating income, see the \ntable below.\nThe net amount of restructuring costs was SEK 57 million (10). \nThe operation in Russia was divested in April 2022, resulting in a \nrestructuring cost of SEK 9 million. 25% of the shares in Austra-\nlia-based company BioPak Pty Ltd were divested in December. One-\noff expenses relating to accrued costs of evaluating strategic alter-\nnatives for BioPak Pty Ltd and consulting costs in connection with \nthe divestment amounted to SEK 48 million in total. In 2021, a deci-\nsion was made to close down the operation in Singapore, Duni Song \nSeng, which resulted in a restructuring cost of SEK 12 million. For \ndetailed information on restructuring costs, see Note 8.\nBridge between operating income and EBIT\nSEK m\n2022\n2021\nOperating income excluding IFRS 16 Leases\n441\n274\nEffects of IFRS 16 Leases\n9\n5\nOperating income\n450\n279\nRestructuring costs\n-57\n-10\nUnrealized value changes, derivative instruments\n-3\n–\nAmortization of intangible assets  \nidentified in business acquisitions\n-63\n-96\nFair value allocation in connection with acquisitions\n0\n0\nEBIT\n326\n173\nSales and income\nNet sales amounted to SEK 6,976 million (5,061), a 37.8% increase in \nsales. At fixed exchange rates, this corresponds to a 30.9% increase, \nthe same as organic growth. After a weak start to the year, still char-\nacterized by restrictions, sales took off and the year saw steady, \naccelerating growth. The grocery retail trade saw a relatively smaller \nincrease than sales to the hotel and restaurant sector. This is \nexplained by the fact that the loss during the pandemic was signifi-\ncantly lower in this sector. Growth in the Duni business area is \ndriven primarily by premium napkins. Simple one-ply napkins also \nincreased, as did table covers and candles, which performed posi-\ntively. The clear improvement in the Duni business area meant that \nit is once more the largest business area. BioPak in Australia also \nperformed strongly, with several new large contracts. Significant \ncost increases for raw materials have resulted in a number of price \nincreases, and have become increasingly significant with each quarter. \nFurther price increases driven by inflation that were initiated in the third \nquarter will take full effect in the first quarter of 2023.\nOperating income amounted to SEK 450 million (279). At \nunchanged exchange rates from the previous year, EBIT would have \nbeen SEK 40 million lower for the year. The gross margin amounted \nto 18.9% (18.3%) and the operating margin increased from 5.5% to \n6.4%. The clear improvement in income compared with the previous \nyear is explained in its entirety by the improved market situation, as \n2021 was significantly more affected by restrictions than 2022. The \noperating leverage on these volumes was limited, as inflation had a \nstrong negative impact on input costs and thereby also on the oper-\nating margin. Price increases, of which there were several during the \nyear, have not yet had the effect required to compensate for this. \nThe all-important capacity utilization factor in the production facili-\nties improved significantly, but staffing has been challenging at times \nand resulted in both disruption to deliveries and increased temporary \ncosts for production. Furthermore, a lower level of government sup-\nport of SEK 34 million (119) had a negative impact on income.\nNet financial items amounted to SEK -43 million (-39). Income \nbefore tax was SEK 283 million (133).\nA tax expense of SEK 82 million (56) was reported for the fiscal \nyear. The effective tax rate was 28.9% (42.2%). The tax expenses for \nthe year include adjustments and non-recurring effects from the \nprevious year of SEK -7.7 million (1.3).\nNet income for the year amounted to SEK 201 million (77), of \nwhich non-controlling interests amounted to SEK 2 million (1).\nInvestments\nThe Group’s net investments excluding acquisitions amounted to \nSEK 131 million (63). Both 2020 and 2021 saw a low level of invest-\nment due to the pandemic, but during the year they were able to \nreturn to more normal levels, albeit not on a par with depreciation \nand amortization. Depreciation and amortization amounted to SEK \n278 million (270), of which SEK 73 million (62) was attributable to \nright-of-use assets.\nCash flow and financial position\nThe Group’s operating cash flow amounts to SEK 48 million (66). \nInflation is driving working capital including inventories, which \nincreased during the year. Days outstanding for both accounts \nreceivable and accounts payable have shown a stable trend. Inven-\ntory for the BioPak business area increased during the year and \nreflects the decision to secure a higher backup inventory in times ­of \nhigh turbulence in order to meet customer demand. The BioPak \nbusiness area has ongoing activities to reduce inventories. In the \nDuni business area, inventories are being traded faster than the \n­previous year and historical levels. \nCash flow including investing activities amounted to SEK 256 \n­million (-38). 25% of the shares in BioPak Pty Ltd were divested in \nDecember, impacting net debt by SEK 363 million. \nThe Group’s interest-bearing net debt amounted to SEK 1,317 \nmillion, compared with SEK 1,375 million on December 31, 2021. The \nloan liability is reported as a current financial liability as of December \n31, 2021. A three-year loan facility of EUR 150 million and a two-year \nloan facility of EUR 30 million were signed during the first quarter. \nAnother three-year loan facility of EUR 25 million was signed during \nthe second quarter. All facilities are linked to sustainability. \nThe Group’s total assets on December 31 amounted to SEK 7,339 \nmillion (6,396)."

These risks affect, \namong other things, the company’s business model and long-term \nstrategic planning. They may have a negative impact on the Group’s \nresults or reputation.\nStrategic and environmental risks refer to risks and external factors \nthat have an impact on the company’s business and market position. \nThe Board and management develop strategies to manage these \nrisks, which is done through strategy meetings. This includes risks \nrelated to acquisitions, suppliers, regulations and laws. External fac-\ntors that may also affect operations include raw material prices, trans-\nport costs, local restrictions due to a pandemic, a worsening econ-\nomy, and changes in market demand and taxes. Events that could \nlead to fewer restaurant visits, reduced demand and increased price \ncompetition, affect volumes and gross margins, among other things \nthrough increased discounts and customer bonuses. The develop-\nment of a varied and attractive range is important for the Group to \nachieve good sales and earnings development. \nOperational risks are normally handled by the respective operat-\ning unit and may refer to production interruptions, IT breakdowns, \nfire or other risks due to insufficient processes or handling errors. In \nmany cases, the company can control this type of risk itself.\nSustainability risks include environmental impact, social condi-\ntions in the value chain and corruption. This also includes risks such \nas not being able to keep up with external requirements regarding \nmaterial development and reporting or legal requirements. These \nrisks are managed through active prevention measures. The com-\npany also has activities and control mechanisms to manage social \nconditions in the value chain, for example. Suppliers are regularly \naudited in accordance with the Duni Group’s Business Partner Code \nof Conduct. See also the section on Risk on pages 36–41.\nThe Group’s financial management and its management of finan-\ncial risks are regulated by a finance policy adopted by the Board of \nDirectors. This work is presided over and managed by the finance \nfunction, which is included as a unit within the Parent Company. \nThe Group divides the financial risks into market risks (consisting of \ncurrency risks, price risks and interest rate risks), credit risks and \nliquidity risks. These risks are controlled in an overall risk manage-\nment policy that focuses on unforeseen events in the financial mar-\nkets and endeavors to minimize potential adverse effects on the \nGroup’s financial results. See also Note 33 regarding risk \nmanagement.\nImpact of the Covid-19 pandemic\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the Duni Group, \nprimarily between 2020 and 2021, but there was some impact in the \nfirst quarter of 2022. The social restrictions introduced to prevent \nthe spread of infection resulted in government agencies restricting \npeople’s mobility. The Duni business area sells its products primarily \nin the HoReCa sector. Hotel, restaurant and catering businesses \nwere all significantly affected by these restrictions. They were \nforced to operate under severe restrictions, if they were allowed to \nopen at all. Throughout the pandemic, there was a volatile market \nand the level of restrictions varied between the quarters. There was \na clear correlation between sales and the level of restrictions. The \nDuni business area is vertically integrated, and owns its own paper \nmill and conversion plants that produce napkins and table covers. A \nrapid, unscheduled decrease in volume means that fixed costs are \nnot fully absorbed, with a negative impact on income. The BioPak \nbusiness area offers environmentally sound concepts for meal pack-\naging and serving products for applications including take-away. The \nbusiness area does not have in-house production, instead purchas-\ning its products primarily from China and Europe. Many restaurants \nhad to convert their operations during the pandemic so they could \noffer more take-away than before, which had a positive impact on \nthe BioPak business area. There is still some uncertainty about the \nmore long-term effects of the pandemic, such as behavioral pat-\nterns concerning business travel, events and catering, as well as \nother market conditions.\nLegal disputes\nUpon closing of the accounts, there were a few disputes with cus-\ntomers, agents and suppliers involving small amounts. Provisions \nhave been made in the annual accounts that, in management’s \nopinion, cover any negative outcome of these disputes.\nSustainability reporting\nA sustainability report is also published in this annual report, see \npages 42-67. This describes the Group’s approach to sustainability. \nThe updated 2030 strategy launched at the end of the year set a \nnew compass direction for sustainability and social responsibility. \nEnvironmental and social sustainability, circular business models, \ninnovation and collaboration will continue to permeate all our activi-\nties. Three strategic initiatives have been developed to help Duni \nGroup become the industry’s sustainability leader by 2030;\n\t• Becoming circular at scale\n\t• Going net zero (net zero climate emissions)\n\t• Living the change (practicing what we preach)\nThe Group’s sustainability efforts are also described here in the \nDirectors’ Report under “Environment and social responsibility” and \n“Employees and work environment”. See also Note 36 Contingent \nliabilities and pledged assets.\nEnvironment and social responsibility\nThe Duni Group works in accordance with an adopted environmen-\ntal strategy. There are clear goals and policies that include develop-\nment and information about products, efficient and controlled pro-\nduction, as well as knowledge and communication from an environ-\nmental perspective.\nAn environmental management system and a quality manage-\nment system in accordance with ISO 14001 and ISO 9001, respec-\ntively, have been implemented and certified at all of the Group’s \nEuropean production units."

Prior to new contracts for the \npurchase of goods for resale, an audit is first performed at the suppli-\ner’s plant based on the code of conduct. Audits are also performed \non a regular basis at existing suppliers based on a risk assessment \nthat takes into account the suppliers’ location, previous results and \ntype of production. The audit focuses on human rights such as the \nrisk of child labor and involuntary labor, as well as working conditions, \nsafety, pay conditions and working hours.\nThe Group has also been granted an FSC®-certified, license num-\nber FSC-C014985 (Forest Stewardship Council®), for the sale, pro-\nduction and distribution of products such as napkins, table covers \nand serving products. This means that paper products are sourced \nfrom sustainable forests and other controlled sources.\nRexcell Tissue & Airlaid AB conducts two operations which are \nsubject to permit requirements pursuant to the Swedish Environ-\nmental Code.

The values \"We care, We are passionate and We make a differ-\nence\" help to move the organization in this direction.\nGood working conditions, clear goals combined with regular sup-\nport to employees form the foundation for creating growth and \nprofit. Developing employees and leaders as well as the company \nculture are key initiatives to become a leading sustainability company \nin 2030. The Group works actively with diversity in many different \nways to make it clear within the organization that it is considered an \nimportant issue.  The Duni Group shall be a Group that reflects the \nsurrounding community, and has a diversity and inclusion board that \ndrives issues such as diversity and inclusion in the Group.\nThe Group’s code of conduct for employees also includes occu-\npational health and safety. The Group’s factories carry out system-\natic health and safety work, which is audited through internal audits \nbased on the code of conduct. Each month, Group Management \nand the Board receive key ratios concerning accidents and sick \nleave due to accidents at the plants. Each production unit has a \nlocally prepared crisis plan.\nThe Board makes it clear that all employees must be aware and \nhelp to prevent corruption. In addition to the code of conduct, an \nanti-corruption policy was adopted in 2022 that describes how \nemployees should act in contact with customers, suppliers and other \nparties to ensure that neither facilitation payments nor other inappro-\npriate benefits exist. The Duni Group requires that all third parties, \nsuppliers and external parties with whom the Group cooperates com-\nply with the code of conduct and current legislation in each country. \nNo known cases of corruption were reported during the year.\nThe Duni Group also has a whistleblower policy that clarifies that \nany suspicion of fraudulent behavior, corruption or other similar sit-\nuations that are witnessed must be reported without delay. An \nexternal whistleblower system manages reports, which can be \nmade anonymously if desired.  No whistleblower cases were \nreported during the year.\nAs part of the sustainability strategy, the Duni Group’s “Policy \nBook” was updated and supplemented during the year. In order to \nachieve better clarity, all policies have been divided in accordance with \nESG, Environment – Social – Governance.

The three largest owners as of December 31, 2022 are Mellby \nGård AB (29.99%), Polaris Capital Management LLC (10.15%) and Carn-\negie fonder (9.60%).\nThe share\nDuni AB’s share capital consists of 46,999,032 outstanding common \nshares, each carrying 1 vote per share. The quotient value of the \nshares is SEK 1.25 per share. Duni AB holds no treasure shares.\nThere shall be no fewer than 32,008,000 and no more than \n128,032,000 shares. There are no outstanding warrants or convertible \ndebentures.Senior executives together own 0.1% of the shares in \nDuni AB as of December 31, 2021.\nFurther information concerning Duni AB’s share and owners is \nprovided in the Corporate Governance Report.\nAllocation of earnings proposed by the Board of \nDirectors and CEO\nThe following non-restricted earnings of the Parent Company are at \nthe disposal of the Annual General Meeting:\nAllocation of earnings Parent Company (SEK)\n2022\nNon-restricted equity in Parent Company\nRetained earnings\n1,949,537,003\nNet income for the year\n    381,878,695\nTotal non-restricted equity in Parent Company\n2,331,415,699\nThe Board of Directors and CEO propose:\nthat SEK 3.00 share be distributed to shareholders\n    140,997,096\nand that the remaining amount be carried forward\n2,190,418,603\nTotal \n2,331,415,699\nThe Board of Directors proposes that the 2023 AGM resolve to allo-\ncate earnings such that a total of SEK 3.00 per share is distributed to \nshareholders, which is equivalent to a total of SEK 140,997,096, and \nthat the remaining non-restricted equity be carried forward.\nThe Board of Directors also proposes that the dividends be dis-\nbursed in two partial payments to better adapt to the Group’s cash \nflows during the year. The Board of Directors proposed May 19, 2023 \nas the record date for the first partial payment of SEK 1.50 and \nNovember 14, 2023 as the record date for the second partial pay-\nment of SEK 1.50. This means that shareholders registered at the \nrecord dates of May 19 and November 14 are entitled to dividends.\nIn the event that the 2023 AGM resolves in accordance with the \nBoard’s proposed allocation of earnings, SEK 2,331 million will be \ncarried forward. The Parent Company’s restricted equity will be fully \ncovered following the proposed dividend. The Group’s shareholders’ \nequity amounts to SEK 3,742 million.\nIn accordance with Chapter 18, Section 4 of the Swedish Compa-\nnies Act (2005:551), as the basis for its proposed dividend, the \nBoard estimated that the proposed dividend is justifiable in consid-\neration of the requirements of the business for the size of the Par-\nent Company’s and Group’s shareholders’ equity and the Parent \nCompany’s and Group’s consolidation needs, liquidity and financial \nposition in general. The Board believes that the Duni Group has \nrecovered well after the pandemic. The divestment of 25% of the \nshares in BioPak Pty Ltd further strengthens the balance sheet. \nDespite better conditions, there is uncertainty in the world at large \nand continued volatility in demand. The assessment is that the \nGroup has a sound financial position and future competitiveness \nthat allows a dividend equivalent to SEK 141 million, which is equiv-\nalent to 70% of income after tax. The Board believes that even after \nthe proposed dividend, Duni will still be able to meet its obligations \nand complete planned investments.\nFollowing the dividend, the Parent Company and Group’s equi-\nty-assets ratio is also estimated to be sound in relation to the indus-\ntry in which the Group operates. The proposed allocation of earn-\nings will not impact the Parent Company and Group’s ability to meet \ntheir payment obligations. The Board of Directors estimates that \nthe Parent Company and Group are well prepared to cope with \nchanges relating to liquidity and unexpected events. The proposal \nto divide the dividend into two partial payments will make the Com-\npany’s liquidity planning more effective with a better balance in net \ndebt over the year. The Board of Directors believes that the Parent \nCompany and Group are capable of coping with future business \nrisks and losses if such arise.\nShareholders’ equity would have been SEK 0.03 million lower if \nfinancial instruments measured at fair value in accordance with \nChapter 4 Section 14 a of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act had \ninstead been measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nParent Company Directors’ Report\nSales, income and financial position\nThe Parent Company, Duni AB, with company registration number \n556536-7488 and its registered office in Malmö, is responsible for \nthe Group’s sales and customer support in the Nordic market. The \nParent Company also contains Group Management and joint Group \nstaff functions such as finance, HR, purchasing, communication, \nmarketing and IT. Parts of the Group’s development resources are in \nthe Parent Company.\nNet sales amounted to SEK 1,526 million (1,098). EBIT was recog-\nnized at SEK -45 million (10) and net financial items at SEK 468 mil-\nlion (78). Like the Group, the Parent Company has recovered after \nthe pandemic restrictions and sales increased during the year. EBIT \nwas affected by the divestment of the Russian company in April by \nSEK 15 million, primarily in respect of inventory write-downs and \nlegal services in connection with the divestment of 25% of the \nshares in BioPak Pty Ltd in Australia. No government support was \nreceived in the fiscal year 2022. For the fiscal year 2021, government \nsupport for short-time work allowance amounted to SEK 6 million \nand restructuring aid to SEK 10 million.\nNet financial items includes dividends received from subsidiaries in \nthe amount of SEK 12 million (3) and Group contributions received of \nSEK 229 million (84). Net income for the year was SEK 382 million (68).\nThe Parent Company’s investments in fixed assets amounted to SEK \n24 (17) m. Depreciation and amortization amounted to SEK 21 m (21).\nThe Parent Company’s equity-assets ratio at year-end was 49.2% \n(47.1%).The Parent Company’s cash and cash equivalents as of \nDecember 31, 2022 amounted to SEK 204 million (285).\nOperational and financial risks in the Parent Company\nThe Parent Company’s risks are the same as those of the Group in all \nmaterial respects.\nThe Duni AB Group’s financial management and its management \nof financial risks are regulated by a finance policy adopted by the \nBoard of Directors. This work is presided over and managed by the \nGroup’s finance function, which is included as a unit within the Par-\nent Company. The Group divides the financial risks into market risks \n(consisting of currency risks, price risks and interest rate risks), \ncredit risks and liquidity risks."

The Nomina-\ntion Committee also proposed the re-election of Thomas Gustafs-\nson as Chairman of the Board. The Nomination Committee’s rea-\nsoned statement for the 2022 Annual General Meeting states that, \nbased on the company’s operations, stage of development and other \ncircumstances, they discussed the size and composition of the Board \nin terms of, for example, industry experience, expertise and interna-\ntional experience. The Nomination Committee has previously con-\nsidered that the relatively small size of the Board encourages \ngreater efficiency in Board meetings and active engagement.\nIn view of the fact that two external Board members are relatively \nnew to the Board and that most members of the management \ngroup are new to their roles, the Chairman of the Board decided in \n \nCorporate Governance\nNomination  \nCommittee\nGeneral meeting\nExternal audit\nRemuneration  \nCommittee\nBoard of Directors\nAudit Committee\nCEO\nGroup Management"

The evaluation includes the composition of the Board, individ-\nual directors as well as the Board’s work and procedures. The result \nof this evaluation is reported to the Board and the Nomination \nCommittee.\nThe Code contains rules regarding the independence of the \ndirectors and imposes the requirement that a majority of the direc-\ntors must be independent of the Company and company \nmanagement.\nAt least two of the directors who are independent of the Company \nand company management must also be independent in relation to \nall shareholders who control ten percent or more of the shares or \nvotes in Duni AB.

In addition to Duni AB, Carl Fogelberg is also auditor-in-\ncharge of Eniro AB and Ascelia Pharma AB as well as co-authoring \nauditor of Haldex. Carl Fogelberg is an authorized public accountant \nand member of FAR SRS. Apart from the audit engagement, fees to \nPwC for other engagements during 2022 totaled SEK 1.7 million (7.8). \nFor detailed information about the remuneration of external audi-\ntors, see Note 9 Remuneration for auditors.\nof remuneration policy is to offer remuneration on market terms in \norder to attract, motivate and retain skilled and talented employees.\nThe total remuneration of senior executives shall be aligned with \nthe senior executive’s responsibilities and authorities. The total \nremuneration may consist of a fixed cash salary, a variable cash sal-\nary (bonus), pension benefits and other benefits. In addition to this, \nand irrespective of these guidelines, the AGM may resolve on \nshare-related and share price-related remuneration.\nVariable cash salary\nThe variable cash salary shall be limited in advance to a maximum \namount and based on the achievement of predetermined and mea-\nsurable performance targets, designed to promote the company’s \nbusiness strategy and long-term value creation, including its sus-\ntainability. The annual variable cash salary (annual bonus) shall be \ncapped at 75% of the fixed cash salary. The variable cash salary may \nbe based on metrics such as the annual profitability and capital \ntie-up targets set by the Board, and may be linked to the Group’s \nadjusted EBIT and adjusted capital employed.\nOnce the period for measuring attainment of the criteria for pay-\nment of the variable cash salary has ended, the Board shall deter-\nmine to what extent the criteria have been met based on a proposal \nfrom the Remuneration Committee. In its assessment of whether \nthe criteria have been met, the Board, upon proposal from the \nRemuneration Committee, has the option to grant exemptions from \nthe goals that were set on the grounds set out below under devia-\ntion from guidelines. With respect to the attainment of financial tar-\ngets, the assessment shall be based on the most recently published \nfinancial information of the Company with any adjustments that the \nBoard made in advance upon implementation of the program.\nVariable remuneration shall not be paid, or variable remuneration \nshall be reclaimable, if the senior executive acted in breach of the Com-\npany’s code of conduct. The variable cash salary may be paid once the \nmeasurement period has ended or it may be deferred for later pay-\nment. In compliance with legislation, the Board shall have the option to \nfully or partially reclaim variable cash salaries paid on incorrect grounds.\nOther remuneration\nAdditional cash remuneration may be paid as a one-time arrange-\nment under extraordinary circumstances in order to recruit or retain \nexecutives. Such remuneration may not exceed an amount equiva-\nlent to one year of the fixed cash salary. Resolutions on such remu-\nneration shall be passed by the Board upon proposal from the \nRemuneration Committee.\nPension\nSenior executives shall be covered by the ITP plan in accordance \nwith the applicable collective bargaining agreement or equivalent. \nUnder the ITP plan, the pension premium for senior executives does \nnot exceed 40% of their fixed cash salary.\nOther benefits\nOther benefits, such as company car, fuel and health and medical \ninsurance, may be paid to the extent that this is deemed to be in \nline with market conditions for senior executives in equivalent posi-\ntions in the labor market in which the executive is active. The cumu-\nlative value of these benefits is not permitted to exceed 12 percent \nof the fixed cash salary.\nConditions of termination\nSenior executives shall be employed for an indefinite period. Upon \ntermination of employment, the fixed cash salary during the appli-\ncable notice period and severance compensation combined shall"

Among other things, this entails monitoring the financial \nreporting and efficiency in the Company’s internal control and risk \nassessment.\nInternal control as regards financial reporting is aimed at provid-\ning reasonable certainty regarding the reliability of external financial \nreporting in the form of the annual reports and interim reports pub-\nlished by each year, and to ensure that financial reports are prepared \nin accordance with the law, applicable accounting standards, and \nother requirements imposed on listed companies. The internal con-\ntrol also aims to ensure the quality of financial reporting to Com-\npany management and the Board of Directors so that decisions are \nmade based on the right grounds and established principles and \nguidelines are observed.\nThe Group describes the internal control system for financial report-\ning based on the areas that constitute the basis for internal control in \naccordance with the “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” issued \nby COSO, namely the following areas: control environment, risk \nassessment, control structure, information and communication, as \nwell as monitoring.\nThe administration, with the support of the Audit Committee, is \nengaged in risk mapping in accordance with COSO 2013 and the 17 \nfundamental principles. However, the Group chooses to describe \nthe internal control system in relation to the 1992 version of the \nCOSO framework.\nControl environment\nThe rules of procedure of the Board and the instructions issued by \nthe Board regarding the work of the CEO and board committees \nclearly define the division of responsibilities and powers with the \naim of ensuring efficient management of risks in business opera-\ntions. The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee \nto review the instructions and procedures used in the financial \nreporting process as well as accounting principles and changes to \nthem. Group Management reports each month to the Board in \naccordance with established procedures. Internal control instru-\nments for financial reporting consist primarily of the finance policy, \ncommunications policy, and the Group’s finance handbook, which \ndefines accounting and reporting rules.\nIn addition, Group Management has formulated its view on how \nbusiness is to be conducted in a Code of Conduct, which is reviewed \neach year by the Board of Directors. There is an independent \nwhistle­blowing system to which any employee or other external \nparty can write about experienced or observed misconduct by senior \nexecutives. Anonymity is voluntary and the recipients of the infor-\nmation are a designated whistleblowing committee consisting of \nthe Chair of the Audit Committee, the CFO and the EVP People & \nCulture.\nRisk assessment and control structure\nMaterial risks for operations are analyzed by the Board as a part of \nfinancial reporting. In addition, Group Management provides the \nAudit Committee with an overall risk analysis of income statements \nand balance sheets as well as the factors that impact them. Risk \nareas are documented and assessed based on likelihood and \nimpact. Based on this, control processes are structured to ensure \nhigh quality in financial reporting. The risk areas are evaluated by \nthe Audit Committee at least once per year.\nThe organizational structure together with the division of \nresponsibilities and payment authorization procedure are clearly \ndescribed and communicated by means of instructions and policies. \nThe operations are organized into business areas with profit cen-\nters. The Audit Committee regularly communicates with the audi-\ntors in order to evaluate and improve the internal control. The \nGroup has established an accounting center for the European coun-\ntries within the Group. This provides independent accounting ser-\nvices to the operations. This function complies with standardized \nprocedures and routines. The head of the accounting center reports \ndirectly to the Group CFO.\nInformation and communication\nInformation, both externally and internally, is governed by a com-\nmunications and IR policy as well as an insider policy and guidelines. \nThese address responsibilities, routines and rules. The policies are \nregularly evaluated to ensure that information disclosed to the \nstock market is consistently of a high quality and in accordance with \nthe stock exchange rules. Financial information, such as quarterly \nreports, annual reports, and important events are published \nthrough press releases and on the website. Meetings with financial \nanalysts are arranged regularly in connection with the publication of \nquarterly reports. The intranet is the main source of information \ninternally. Accounting handbooks and instructions regarding finan-\ncial reporting are available on the intranet and these are regularly \nupdated in light of changes to IFRS and other recommendations.\nMonitoring\nThe Board and Audit Committee review all external financial reports \nbefore they are formally approved by the Board. The Audit Commit-\ntee receives regular reports from the auditors regarding the internal \ncontrol and monitors significant issues. The Board receives a \nmonthly written report covering sales, operating income, the mar-\nket trend, as well as other material information regarding the opera-\ntions, and a review of current financial reports constitutes a stand-\ning item on the agenda at all meetings. Group Management analy-\nses the financial trend within the Group’s business areas each \nmonth. Comparisons with the preceding year, budgets and plans, \nand evaluation of the key performance indicators are used for moni-\ntoring generally at all levels in the organization.\nStatement regarding internal audit\nThe administration has found no need for a formal internal audit \ndepartment, but it annually evaluates whether such a function is \nneeded. The Group has an accounting center in Poznan, Poland, \nwhich functions as a centralized accounting function providing \naccounting services to all subsidiaries in Europe, apart from \nPaper+Design in Germany and BioPak UK Ltd. The accounting cen-\nter along with the accounts department at the head office serve as \nconsultants to the countries within the Group that are not included \nin the center. The accounting center operates based on standard-\nized processes and routines, is independent of the operational busi-\nness, and reports directly to the CFO. They also perform engage-\nments for external customers, similar to the engagements they per-\nform for the Group. This centralized and independent process for \naccounting and financial reporting is considered to constitute a plat-\nform for sound internal control with respect to financial reporting. \nThe Group’s financial department also performs certain internal \naudit work in the form of controls at subsidiaries."

The Group develops, manufactures and \nsells functional and attractive concepts and products for the serv-\ning, take away and packaging of meals. Duni enjoys a leading posi-\ntion thanks to a combination of high quality, established customer \nrelationships, well-reputed brands, and a strong local presence in \nEurope. Tissue for napkins and table covers is manufactured in Swe-\nden, while conversion to finished products takes place in Germany, \nPoland, Thailand and New Zealand. The Group has sales offices in \nAustralia, Finland, France, United Arab Emirates, Netherlands, New \nZealand, Poland, Russia, Switzerland, Singapore, Spain, UK, Sweden, \nThailand, Czech Republic, Germany, USA and Austria. \nThe Parent Company, Duni AB, is a registered limited company \nwith its registered office in Malmö, Sweden. The address of the head \noffice is Box 237, 201 22 Malmö, Sweden. The Parent Company’s \nmain place of business is in the Nordic countries. The website is \nwww.dunigroup.com. Duni is listed on NASDAQ Stockholm under \nthe ticker name “DUNI”. \nThe Board of Directors approved this annual report for publica-\ntion on March 30, 2023. The annual report may be changed by the \nCompany’s owners after approval by the Board.\nUnless otherwise specifically stated, all amounts are reported in \nmillion kronor (SEK m) and relate to the January 1–December 31 \nperiod with respect to income statement items and December 31 \nwith respect to balance sheet items. Information in brackets relates \nto the preceding fiscal year, i.e. 1/1/2021–12/31/2021. \nNote 2 – General accounting principles\nThis note sets forth general accounting principles applied in the \npreparation of the annual report, to the extent these are not dis-\nclosed in the following notes. The majority of the accounting princi-\nples used can be found under the respective note. Unless otherwise \nstated below, all accounting principles in this annual report have \nbeen applied consistently for all presented years.\nThe consolidated financial statements cover Duni AB and its sub-\nsidiaries. The Parent Company applies the Swedish Annual \nAccounts Act and RFR 2, Accounting for Legal Entities. In those \ncases where the Parent Company applies different accounting prin-\nciples than the Group, such fact is stated separately in Section 2.5, \nParent Company’s accounting principles.\n2.1 Bases for preparation of the financial statements\n2.1.1 Compliance with IFRS\nThe consolidated financial statements for Duni AB and its subsidiar-\nies have been prepared in accordance with the Swedish Annual \nAccounts Act, RFR 1, “Supplementary Accounting Rules for Groups”, \nand the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and inter-\npretations from the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRSIC) as \nadopted by the EU. \n2.1.2 Cost method\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accor-\ndance with the cost method, except for:\n•\t financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) \nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss,\n\t• and financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instru-\nments) classified as hedge instruments and\n\t• defined benefit pension plans – the plan assets are measured \nat fair value through other comprehensive income.\nThe preparation of financial statements in compliance with IFRS \nrequires the use of a number of important estimates for accounting \npurposes. Furthermore, when applying the Group’s accounting princi-\nples, management must make certain judgments. The areas involving \na high degree of judgment, complexity or areas where assumptions \nand estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements \nare disclosed in the respective notes.\n2.2 Changes in accounting principles and disclosures\nThe Duni Group applies the new and amended standards and inter-\npretations from the IASB and statements from the IFRIC as adopted \nby the EU and which are mandatory starting on January 1, 2022.  \nThe Group applies the following standards and amendments for the \nfirst time as of the fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2022:\n\t• Property, plant and equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use \n– Amendments to IAS 16\n\t• Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract – Amend-\nments to IAS 37\n\t• Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018–2020, and\n\t• Reference to the Conceptual Framework – Amendments to IFRS 3 \nThe Group has also chosen to apply the following changes \nprematurely: \n\t• Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a \n­Single Transaction – Amendments to IAS 12, and\n\t• Disclosure of Accounting Policies – Amendments to IAS 1 and \nIFRS Practice Statement 2. \nThe changes specified above had no impact on the amounts \nreported in the comparative period and have not had any material \neffect on the current period. \nA number of new standards, changes to the standards and inter-\npretations enter into force with regard to fiscal years beginning after \nJanuary 1, 2022, and these have not been applied in conjunction \nwith the preparation of this financial report. These new standards \nand interpretations are not expected to have a material impact on \nthe Group’s financial statements in the current or future periods, \nnor on future transactions. \n2.3 Consolidated financial statements\n2.3.1 Subsidiaries\nA subsidiary is a company in which another company holds a con-\ntrolling interest. An investor has a controlling interest over the \ninvestee when the investor is exposed to, or is entitled to variable \nreturns from, the investment in the investee and can influence the \namount of the returns using its controlling interest over the \ninvestee. Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial \nstatements commencing on the day on which the controlling influ-\nence is transferred to the Group. They are removed from the con-\nsolidated financial statements as of the day on which the controlling \ninfluence ceases.\nThe acquisition method is used for reporting the Group’s busi-\nness combinations. The consideration for the acquisition of a sub-\nsidiary consists of the fair value of transferred assets, liabilities and \nthe shares issued by the Group. The consideration also includes the \nfair value of all assets or liabilities which are a consequence of an \nagreement regarding a conditional purchase price and/or liability to \nminority shareholders. Acquisition-related costs are expensed when \nincurred. Identifiable acquired assets and assumed liabilities in a \nbusiness acquisition are initially measured at fair value on the acqui-\nsition date. For each acquisition, it is determined whether non-con-\ntrolling interests in the acquired company are recognized at fair \nvalue or at the interest’s proportional share in the net assets of the \nacquired company.\nThe amount by which the consideration, any non-controlling inter-\nests, and the fair value on the acquisition date of earlier sharehold-\nings exceeds the fair value of the Group’s share of identifiable \n98\nAnnual Report 2022 / Notes"

Where appropriate, the \naccounting principles for subsidiaries have been changed to ensure \nconsistent application of the Group’s principles.\n2.3.2 Changes in ownership stake in a subsidiary without a change \nin controlling interest\nThe Group applies the principle of reporting transactions with \nnon-controlling interests that do not lead to a loss of control as \nequity transactions, i.e., transactions with owners in their role as \nshareholders. Upon acquisitions from non-controlling interests, the \ndifference between the consideration paid and the actual acquired \nshare of the carrying amount of the subsidiary’s net assets is recog-\nnized in equity. Gains or losses upon divestments to non-controlling \ninterests are also recognized in equity. Non-controlling interests in \nan acquired company are recognized either at fair value or at the \nholding’s proportionate share of the identifiable net assets of the \nacquired company. This choice of principle is made for each individ-\nual business acquisition.\nIn cases where there are call options for remaining sharehold-\nings, the companies are recognized as if they were fully consoli-\ndated and a liability is simultaneously recognized amounting to the \ndiscounted expected redemption price of the options. The non-con-\ntrolling interest attributable to the option is thus eliminated. The dif-\nference between the liability for the option and the non-controlling \ninterest to which the option related is recognized directly in equity \nand separated from other changes in equity. The liability to minority \nshareholders is recognized as a derivative instrument, and the reval-\nuation is recognized in equity.\n2.3.3 Associated companies\nAssociated companies are all companies in which the Group has a sig-\nnificant, but not controlling, influence, which generally is the case with \nshareholdings corresponding to between 20% and 50% of the voting \nrights. Participations in associated companies are reported in accor-\ndance with IAS 28 applying the equity method, and are initially \nreported in the Group’s balance sheet at cost.\n2.4 Translation of foreign currency\n2.4.1 Functional currency and reporting currency\nItems included in the financial statements for the various units in \nthe Group are valued in the currency which is used in the economic \nenvironment in which the relevant company primarily operates \n(functional currency). In the consolidated financial statements, the \nSwedish crowns (SEK) is used; this is the Parent Company’s func-\ntional currency and reporting currency.\n2.4.2 Transactions and balance sheet items\nTransactions in foreign currency are translated to the functional cur-\nrency in accordance with the exchange rates applicable on the \ntransaction date. Exchange rate gains and losses which arise in con-\njunction with payments of such transactions and in conjunction with \ntranslation of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency at the \nexchange rate on the balance sheet date are recognized in the income \nstatement. Exchange rate differences on lending and borrowing are \nrecognized in net financial items, while other exchange rate differ-\nences are included in operating income. Exceptions apply when the \ntransactions constitute hedging which satisfies the conditions for \nhedge accounting of cash flows or of net investments, since gains /\nlosses are recognized in other comprehensive income. The Group \napplies hedge accounting via interest rate swaps, with part of the \ninterest rate risk hedged at a fixed rate.\n2.4.3 Group companies\nThe results of operations and financial position of all Group compa-\nnies (of which none has a high inflation currency as their functional \ncurrency) which have a functional currency other than the reporting \ncurrency are translated to the Group’s reporting currency as follows\n1.\tassets and liabilities for each of the balance sheets are trans-\nlated at the closing day rate\n2.\trevenue and expenses for each of the income statements are \ntranslated at the average exchange rate\n3.\tall exchange rate differences which arise are reported in other \ncomprehensive income\nUpon consolidation, exchange rate differences which arise as a con-\nsequence of translation of net investments in foreign operations are \ntransferred to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive \nincome. Upon the full or partial divestment of a foreign business, \nthe exchange rate differences which are recognized in other com-\nprehensive income are transferred to the income statement and \nrecognized as a part of capital gains/losses.\nGoodwill and adjustments of fair value which arise upon the \nacquisition of a foreign business are treated as assets and liabilities \nof such business and translated using the exchange rate at the bal-\nance sheet date.\n2.5 The Parent Company’s accounting principles\nThe Parent Company prepares its annual report pursuant to the \nSwedish Annual Accounts Act and the Swedish Financial Reporting \nBoard’s Recommendation RFR 2, Accounting for Legal Entities. RFR 2 \nentails that the Parent Company’s annual report for the legal entity \nshall apply all IFRSs and statements approved by the EU, insofar as \npossible within the scope of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and \ntaking into consideration the connection between accounting and \ntaxation. The Recommendation states which exceptions and supple-\nments are to be made compared with accounting pursuant to IFRS.\nThe principles regarding the Parent Company are unchanged \ncompared with the preceding year.\n2.5.1 Differences between the accounting principles of the Group \nand the Parent Company\nDifferences between the accounting principles of the Group and the \nParent Company are set forth below. The accounting principles \nstated below have been applied consistently to all periods pre-\nsented in the Parent Company’s financial statements.\nSubsidiaries\nParticipating interests in subsidiaries are recognized in the Parent \nCompany pursuant to the purchase method. In the Parent Com-\npany, acquisition costs are recognized as participations in subsidiar-\nies. Received dividends and Group contributions are recognized as \nfinancial income. \nAssociated companies\nParticipating interests in subsidiaries are recognized in the Parent \nCompany pursuant to the purchase method. The shares are recog-\nnized as “Participations in associated companies” and dividends \nreceived are recognized as revenue.\nLiability for put option of minority owners\nThe liability for put options to minority shareholders is recognized in \nthe Parent Company at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The \nGroup recognizes this liability as a derivative liability.\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets in the Parent Company are reported at acquisition \nvalue less deduction for accumulated amortization and any impair-\nment. Goodwill recognized in the Parent Company is acquisition \ngoodwill; the useful life is thus estimated by company management \nto be no more than 20 years. Amortization of goodwill takes place \non a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of 20 years.\n99\nAnnual Report 2022 / Notes"

This entails, among other things, a different \npresentation regarding equity and that provisions are reported as a \nseparate main heading in the balance sheet.\n2.6 Significant estimates and judgments for accounting purposes\nEstimates and judgments are evaluated regularly based on historical \nexperience and other factors, including expectations of future events \nwhich may be deemed reasonable under prevailing circumstances. \nThe Group makes estimates and judgments regarding the future. By \ndefinition, the estimates for accounting purposes which follow there-\nfrom rarely correspond to the actual outcome. The estimates and \njudgments which entail a significant risk of material adjustments in \nthe carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are specified on an \nongoing basis in the notes.\nNote 3 – Segment reporting\nAccounting principles\nOperating segments\nCompany management has established operating segments based on \nthe information which is addressed by the strategic decision-making \ngroup and used for making strategic decisions. The decision-making \ngroup constitutes Group Management, which decides on the allocation \nof resources within the Group and evaluates the results of operations. \nThe strategic decision-making group addresses and evaluates opera-\ntions based on lines of business, or operating segments, to which the \nsame risks and opportunities apply.  Sales between the business areas \ntake place on market terms.\nDuni business area: stands for what the Group is traditionally associ-\nated with – innovative solutions for the set table, primarily napkins, \ntable covers and candles. The business area’s products and services are \nsold under the Duni brand. Its customers are primarily hotels and restau-\nrants, the HoReCa market, with sales largely made via wholesalers, but \ngrocery retail chains are also a key customer group, along with other chan-\nnels such as various types of specialty stores.\nBioPak business area: offers environmentally sound concepts for meal \npackaging and serving products for applications including take-away, \nready-to-eat meals, and various types of catering. The business area’s \ncustomers are various types of restaurants with take-away concepts and \ncompanies that are active in the health and patient-care sectors. Stores \nand other food producers are also a major customer group. The seg-\nment’s products and services are currently sold under both the Duni \nand BioPak brands but the goal is for the segment to primarily repre-\nsent the BioPak brand.\nOrganizational structure\nProducts are sold via a consolidated commercial organization divided \ninto six regions. Each region is responsible for local sales and marketing \nof both brands, Duni and BioPak, to all customers.\nThe regions are:\n– NorthEast: Northern and Eastern Europe including Russia\n– Central: Germany, Austria and Switzerland\n– West: The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, the UK and Ireland\n– South: France, Spain and Italy\n– Rest of World: All sales outside Europe with Australia accounting for \nover 50%, New Zealand and Thailand each at 10–15% and Singapore at \njust over 5%.\n– Other Sales: External sales of tissue and airlaid materials from the \nSkåpafors factory and external sales of finance and accounting services \nfrom the finance function in Poznan are included in the Duni segment.\nThe Group also has a central marketing department responsible for brand-\ning strategy, marketing communications, product development and inno-\nvation. Group-wide functions are largely shared by the business areas and \nthe expenses for these are allocated with a weighted ratio based on sales \nand indirect costs for each business area, Duni and BioPak.\nGroup Management, which is the highest executive and decision-mak-\ning body, decides on the allocation of resources within the Group and \nevaluates the results of operations. Group Management manages the \nperformance of the business through the business areas on the basis \nof sales and operating income after shared costs have been allocated \nto each business areas.\nThe Group has a vertically integrated business model for its paper-based \nproducts, such as napkins and table covers. This means that the entire \nproduction and delivery chain is owned and controlled by the Group, \nfrom material manufacture and concept development to conversion and \ndistribution. Because in-house-produced napkins and table covers fall \nunder the Duni segment, this segment is responsible for all expenses \nfor production and conversion. By contrast, the BioPak segment’s prod-\nucts are largely produced by external production units. There is a large \nprocurement organization here, and it is a major part of the business.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue includes the fair value of what has been, or will be, received \nfor sold goods in the Group’s operating activities. Revenue is recog-\nnized exclusive of value added tax, returns and discounts and after \nelimination of intra-Group sales. The Duni Group also has service reve-\nnue in the form of sales of financial and administrative services from \nthe Group’s accounting center. This revenue is not of a substantial \namount and is unallocated as part of revenue in the income statement.\nRevenue is recognized when control over the goods is transferred, \nwhich occurs when the goods are delivered to the customer or whole-\nsaler and there are not any unfulfilled obligations that could impact \napproval of the goods. Delivery occurs when the goods have been \ntransported to the specific location, the risk of obsolete or lost goods \nhas been transferred to the customer or wholesaler and they have \naccepted the goods in accordance with the contract, the deadline for \ncomplaints against the contract has expired or there is objective evi-\ndence that all criteria for acceptance have been met.\nRevenue from customer contracts is divided into different categories. \nThe Duni Group has identified each segment as two different category \ntypes. Within these, sales by region and by product group are specified \nin order to reflect the nature of the sales. The Group’s goods and ser-\nvices are transferred at the same time, and income is received in the \nsame month as the goods are delivered to the customer or the service \nis rendered.\n100\nAnnual Report 2022 / Notes"

When \nrecognizing the shared assets by operating segment, they have been \nallocated based on a weighting of each operating segment’s business \nvolume and share of indirect costs; this is deemed to constitute a \n­reasonable basis for allocation since the utilization of the asset by each \noperating segment is proven. Corresponding allocations have also \nbeen made when allocating Group-wide expenses.\nWith the implementation of IFRS, allocation of the Group’s goodwill \nitems has taken place through allocation ratios. In addition, goodwill \non acquisition has been allocated to the cash-generating units and \noperating segments based on a judgment of which units will benefit \nfrom the synergies, etc. created by the business combination. Part of \nthe goodwill comprises SEK 1,199 million for the old organization before \nthe Duni Group was listed, and this is allocated to the Duni segment.  \n The remaining goodwill is goodwill on acquisition that arose when var-\nious companies were acquired. These companies have been allocated \nto a segment based on what products they sell. The companies that \nmanufacture napkins have been allocated to the Duni segment. More \ndetailed disclosures on the allocation of goodwill can be found in Note \n21 – Intangible assets.\nHowever, interest income and interest expenses are not allocated per \nsegment since they are affected by measures taken by the central \n­treasury function, which manages the Group’s cash liquidity.\nReturned goods\nIn those cases where products are sold with volume discounts and the \ncustomers are entitled to return defective products, the sales revenues \nare recognized based on the price stated in the sales contract, net of \nestimated volume discounts and returns at the time of the sale. Accu-\nmulated experience is used to assess and make provision for discounts \nand returns. The assessment of volume discounts is based on expected \nannual purchases. Revenue is recognized only to the extent it is highly \nprobable that no substantial reversal will occur. A liability is recognized \nfor expected volume discounts in relation to sales until the balance \nsheet date. Given that the magnitude of returns has been stable in the \npast years, it is highly probable that there will not be any substantial \nreversal of recognized revenue. The validity of customer agreements, \nentitlement to discounts, customer bonuses and returns, and the esti-\nmated quantity of returns or customer bonuses is reassessed at each \nbalance sheet date. No financial component is deemed to be estab-\nlished since the sale takes place with an average credit period of 45 \ndays, which is in accordance with market practice. Returned goods are \nrecognized as their gross amounts in the balance sheet. Estimated \nreturned goods are recognized as a provision and the cost of sold goods \nwith respect to the recognized returned goods increases inventories.\nOperating segments, Group\n2022‚ SEK m\nDuni\nBioPak\nNon-distributed\nTotal\nTotal net sales\n4,028\n2,973\n–\n7,000\nRevenue from other segments\n24\n1\n–\n25\nNet sales from external customers\n4,004\n2,972\n–\n6,976\nOperating income\n333\n117\n–\n450\nItems not included in operating income\n-46\n-78\n–\n-124\nReported EBIT\n287\n39\n–\n326\nFinancial income\n19\nFinancial expenses\n-56\nIncome from participation in associated companies\n-6\nIncome tax\n-82\nNet income for the year\n201\nTotal assets\n4,730\n2,609\n–\n7,339\nTotal liabilities\n2,413\n1,185\n–\n3,598\nInvestments\n164\n36\n–\n200\nDepreciation\n212\n66\n–\n278\n2021‚ SEK m\nDuni\nBioPak\nNon-distributed\nTotal\nTotal net sales\n2,686\n2,400\n–\n5,086\nRevenue from other segments\n24\n1\n–\n25\nNet sales from external customers\n2,662\n2,399\n–\n5,061\nOperating income\n93\n186\n–\n279\nItems not included in operating income\n-32\n-75\n–\n-106\nReported EBIT\n62\n111\n–\n173\nFinancial income\n2\nFinancial expenses\n-40\nIncome from participation in associated companies\n-2\nIncome tax\n-56\nNet income for the year\n77\nTotal assets\n4,444\n1,951\n–\n6,396\nTotal liabilities\n2,309\n1,372\n–\n3,681\nInvestments\n89\n23\n–\n113\nDepreciation\n205\n65\n–\n270\n101\nAnnual Report 2022 / Notes"

The cost \nof finished goods and work in progress consists of design expenses, \nraw materials, direct salaries, other direct expenses and associated \nindirect manufacturing expenses (based on normal production capac-\nity). Loan expenses are not included. The net realizable value is the \nestimated sales price in operating activities, less applicable variable \nselling expenses.\nEstimated returned goods are recognized at their gross amounts. Sales \ndecrease and a provision for returns is recognized in the balance sheet. \nAs a result, the cost of sold goods with respect to the recognized \nreturned goods increases inventories.\nSignificant estimates and judgments\nThe calculation of the net realizable value is based on an estimate of a \nsale price that may be affected by several parameters such as changes \nin product range, price development, market demand, production vol-\numes, etc. The cost includes freight costs, various input materials, \npulp and manufacturing costs, which means that the complexity of the \ninventory value is high. At the end of each month, management makes \nnew estimates and judgments based on the prevailing market situation \nin order to ensure the correct FIFO valuation.\nFor those contracts that have returns on the seasonal range,  manage-\nment makes an assessment and estimates the size of these based on \nhistoric sales.\nWhen assessing obsolescence, the rate of turnover, age, market \ndemand and new launches are risk factors.\n105\nAnnual Report 2022 / Notes"

The Group closely monitors developments and com-\nplies with all sanctions imposed. As a result of the difficult situation, \nall deliveries to the sales company in Russia were halted, and in the \nfirst quarter of 2022 a decision was made to divest the business \n(with 17 employees), which took place through a management buy-\nout in April. This resulted in a restructuring cost of SEK 9 million for \nthe Group and SEK 15 million for the Parent Company. This relates \nprimarily to write-downs of inventories and accounts receivable. \nThe Parent Company added a write-down of an internal receivable. \n25% of the shares in Australia-based company BioPak Pty Ltd were \ndivested in December 2022. One-off expenses were incurred on an \nongoing basis during the year as a restructuring cost in respect of the \ncosts of evaluating strategic alternatives to optimize the long-term value \nof the BioPak Group. 25% of the shares were divested to Five V Capital, a \nprivate equity company based in Australia. In total, including legal costs \nfor contracts in connection with the divestment, the restructuring \ncost amounted to SEK 48 million for the Group and SEK 4 million for \nthe Parent Company.\nIn 2021, a restructuring cost of SEK 12 million was recognized for \nthe closure and liquidation of operations in Duni Song Seng. This \nrelates primarily to the termination of rental agreements, invento-\nries, accounts receivable, and personnel-related costs.\nSignificant estimates and judgments\nThe provision for restructuring reserve is calculated on the basis of agreements following negotiations with trade unions and other interested par-\nties. The amount of the provision is calculated on the basis of assumptions about the timing of the recognition of the cost and the estimated cost \nof salaries, termination benefits and other obligations arising from termination.\nAccounting principles\nProvisions for restructuring costs and any legal claims are recognized when the Group has a legal or informal obligation as a consequence of earlier \nevents, it is likely that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be calculated in a reliable manner. \nThe change in inventories is reported under the item “Costs of \ngoods sold” and, for the Group, amounted to SEK 6,145 million \n(3,935). The corresponding item for the Parent Company amounted \nto SEK 1,102 million (721).\nThe Group’s impairment write-down of inventory to the net realiz-\nable value amounted to SEK 32 million (9).

For other senior executives, the variable remuneration \nis capped at 50% (50%) of base salary. The bonus system covers \nonly one year each time following a decision by the Board of Direc-\ntors. A bonus of SEK 2.9 million (0) was paid to the CEO for the fiscal \nyear 2022. In February 2021, the Remuneration Committee decided \nthat no performance-based bonus would be paid for the fiscal year \n2021, as the Group continued to be affected by the pandemic and \nmany of the Group’s companies have received government grants. \nNo performance criteria for variable remuneration were therefore \ndrawn up for 2021. The performance criteria for variable remunera-\ntion for the fiscal year 2022 consist of a financial performance mea-\nsure applicable to both the CEO and other senior executives. The \nperformance measure is Residual Income and consists of operating \nincome minus 8% interest on managed capital. For more details, see \nthe Remuneration Report 2022 on the Company’s website. The CEO \nis also entitled to some other employment benefits, such as a com-\npany car.\nPensions\nCEO\nThe CEO has an agreed retirement age of 65 and is covered by the \nDuni Group’s pension policy for senior executives, with the addition \nthat 35% of the pensionable income in excess of 7.5 income base \namounts is paid into the alternative ITP solution. Pension-qualifying \nincome also includes a three-year average of paid bonuses. The pen-\nsion expense corresponds to the costs for defined contribution plans. \nThe occupational pension provision is fully tax-deductible for Duni. \nThere are no other outstanding pension obligations to the CEO.\nOther senior executives\nThe other senior executives have defined contribution plans. One \nhas a share in a pension plan which was closed some time ago and \nin which no new vesting takes place. “Pension entitlement salary” \nmeans fixed annual salary including vacation pay, as well as an aver-\nage of bonus payments received for the past three years. In addi-\ntion, there are commitments regarding sickness pension and survi-\nvor’s pension. Each month, Duni pays a cash pension contribution \nin accordance with each senior executive’s individual pension plan. \nPension is earned on a straight-line basis during the employment \nperiod, i.e. from the date of employment until retirement age. \nThere are no outstanding pension obligations to other senior \nexecutives. \nSeverance compensation\nCEO\nThe CEO has a separate agreement regarding severance compensa-\ntion. The severance compensation comprises payment for twelve \nmonths following a notice period of six months. Only the Company \nis entitled to trigger the agreement. The CEO is entitled to termi-\nnate his employment on six months’ notice. There is no entitlement \nto severance compensation in the event of termination by the CEO \nor if his employment is terminated due to negligence on his part. \nOther senior executives\nThe majority of the other senior executives have employment con-\ntracts which are terminable on 6 months’ notice, by either the Com-\npany or the executive. In the case of termination by the Company, \nthe executive is entitled to severance compensation equal to six \nmonthly salaries, which in some cases is included in the basis for \npension computation. \nNote 17 – Pension obligations\nAccounting principles\nStarting on January 1, 2013, the Duni Group applied the revised IAS 19 \nEmployee Benefits (IAS19R). Consequently, previously non-recognized \nactuarial losses are recognized at the time of transition and actuarial \ngains and losses which arise in the future will be recognized in other \ncomprehensive income.\nThe Group has various pension plans. The pension plans are normally \nfinanced through payments to insurance companies or managed \nfunds, where the payments are determined based on periodic actuarial \ncalculations. The Duni Group has both defined benefit and defined \ncontribution pension plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension \nplan under which fixed contributions are paid to a separate legal entity. \nThe Group has no legal or informal obligations to pay additional contri-\nbutions if the legal entity has insufficient assets to pay all compensa-\ntion to employees relating to the employee’s service during a current \nor earlier period. The majority of the Group’s pension remuneration is \npaid via defined contribution plans. A defined benefit plan is a pension \nplan which is not a defined contribution plan. The distinguishing fea-\nture of defined benefit plans is that they state an amount for the pen-\nsion benefit an employee will receive after retirement, normally based \non one or more factors such as age, period of employment and salary.\nThe liability recognized in the balance sheet with respect to defined \nbenefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation on \nthe balance sheet date, less the fair value of the plan assets. The \ndefined benefit pension obligation is calculated annually by indepen-\ndent actuaries applying the projected union credit method. The present \nvalue of a defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the \nestimated future pension payments using the rate of interest on \ninvestment-grade corporate bonds issued in the same currency as the \ncurrency in which payments are to be made, with terms to maturity \ncomparable to the relevant pension liability. Approximately one half of \npension obligations relate to Sweden. Swedish mortgage bonds are \nconsidered to be corporate bonds.\nSwedish mortgage bonds correspond to investment-grade corporate \nbonds in the sense that the market for mortgage bonds has a high \nturnover and is considered to be liquid and deep; furthermore, these \nbonds often have a triple A rating and thus are extremely creditworthy.\nActuarial gains and losses arising from experience-based adjustments \nand changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in “Other com-\nprehensive income” during the period in which they arise.\nExpenses relating to employment in earlier periods are recognized \ndirectly in the income statement.\nIn respect of defined contribution plans, the Duni Group pays contribu-\ntions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans pur-\nsuant to contractual obligations or on a voluntary basis. The Group has \nno further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. \nThe contributions are recognized as personnel expenses when they fall \ndue for payment. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the \nextent the Group may benefit from cash repayments or a reduction in \nfuture payments.\n113\nAnnual Report 2022 / Notes"

Employees are usually guaranteed a pension equivalent to a \npercentage of their pay. The largest plans are in Sweden, Germany, \nthe UK, the Netherlands and Belgium. The plans in the UK and the \nNetherlands are consolidated externally, with the plan assets held \nby foundations or similar legal entities. The activities of the founda-\ntions are governed by national regulations and practices applicable \nto the relationship between the Group and the manager (or equiva-\nlent) of the foundation’s plan assets and the composition of plan \nassets in terms of different types of assets.\nPension insurance with Alecta\nObligations regarding retirement pensions and family pensions for \nsalaried employees in Sweden are secured through insurance with \nindependent insurance company Alecta. According to a statement \nissued by the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, URF 10 Account-\ning for the ITP 2 pension plan financed through insurance with \nAlecta, this is a defined benefit plan covering several employers. For \nthe fiscal year 2022, the Company did not have access to informa-\ntion needed to recognize its proportional share of the plan’s obliga-\ntions, plan assets and expenses. As a result, it was not possible to \nrecognize the plan as a defined benefit plan. Duni does not have \naccess to such information as makes it possible to recognize this \nplan as a defined benefit plan. The pension plan according to ITP 2, \nwhich is secured through insurance with Alecta, is thus recognized \nas a defined contribution plan. The premium for the defined benefit \nretirement and family pension is calculated on an individual basis \nand depends, among other things, on salary, previously earned pen-\nsion entitlement, and expected remaining period of employment. \nExpected contributions for the next reporting period for ITP 2 poli-\ncies taken out with Alecta amounted to SEK 2 million (4). \nAlecta’s surplus may be divided among the policyholders and/or \nthe insured. As of 12/31/2022, Alecta’s surplus in the form of the \ncollective funding level amounted to 172% (172%) The collective \nfunding level constitutes the market value of Alecta’s assets as a \npercentage of the insurance obligations, calculated in accordance \nwith Alecta’s actuarial calculation assumptions, which do not corre-\nspond to IAS 19. The collective funding level will normally be allowed \nto vary between 125% and 175%. If Alecta’s collective funding level \nfalls below 125% or exceeds 175%, remedial actions will be taken to \ncreate the conditions for the funding level to go back to the normal \ninterval. In the event of low funding, one remedial action could be \nto increase the agreed price for taking out new policies and expand-\ning existing benefits. In the event of high funding, one remedial \naction could be to institute premium reductions.\nSignificant estimates and judgments\nExpenses and the value of pension obligations with respect to defined \nbenefit plans are based on actuarial calculations based on assumptions \nregarding the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, future \nsalary increases, inflation and demographic conditions. Assumptions \nregarding the discount rate are based on high-quality investments at \nfixed interest with a term to maturity corresponding to the Group’s \nexisting pension obligations. Other demographic conditions are based \non established industry practice.\nThe largest pension plan (approximately one half of pension obliga-\ntions) is in Sweden, where there is no sufficiently liquid market for cor-\nporate bonds. Accordingly, the discount rate for the Swedish pension \nliability is based on mortgage bonds with a term to maturity corre-\nsponding to the pension plan. The Group believes that it is possible to \nequate Swedish mortgage bonds with investment-grade corporate \nbonds since the market for such bonds has a high turnover and is con-\nsidered to be liquid and deep; furthermore, these bonds often have a \ntriple A rating and thus are extremely creditworthy.\nProvisions for pensions and similar obligations:\nGroup\nSEK m\n2022\n2021\nDefined benefit plans\n133\n169\nThe amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet consist of:\nDefined benefit plans\nSEK m\n2022\n2021\nPresent value of consolidated obligations\n255\n375\nFair value of plan assets\n-250\n-370\nPresent value of non-consolidated obligations\n128\n164\nLiability in the balance sheet\n133\n169\n114\nAnnual Report 2022 / Notes"

In line with pre-\nvious years, the discount rate is set for the Swedish plans by \nreference to the market for covered mortgage bonds. A deficit \narises if the plan assets do not achieve a corresponding return. \nIn the short term, this can result in volatility, but since the liabil-\nity in the pension plan is long-term in nature, investments in \ninstruments such as equity instruments are suited for managing \nthe plan efficiently and obtaining the best return. Duni has no \nindependent control over the way in which plan assets are \ninvested. They are held by foundations whose activities are \ngoverned by national regulations and practice.\n\t• Changes in the yield on bonds: A decrease in the interest rate \npaid on corporate bonds will result in an increase in the liabilities \nof the plan, although this will be partially offset by an increase in \nthe value of the bonds.\n\t• Inflation risk: Some of the plan’s obligations are linked to infla-\ntion, with higher inflation resulting in higher liabilities. Most of \nthe plan assets are either unaffected by inflation (fixed interest \non bonds) or have a weak correlation to inflation (equities), \nentailing that an increase in inflation will also increase the \ndeficit.\n\t• Lifespan assumptions: Most of the pension obligations entail \nthat the employees covered by the plan will receive lifelong \nbenefits, and consequently increased lifespan assumptions \nresult in higher pension liabilities. This is particularly important \nin the Swedish plans, with increases in inflation resulting in \ngreater sensitivity to changes in lifespan assumptions.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n116\nAnnual Report 2022 / Notes"

In October 2021, 22.36% of the shares in Bûmerang Takeaway SL, in Spain, were acquired for EUR 0.5 million. The total pur-\nchase price amounted to SEK 27 million. Both acquisitions are accounted for as non-controlling interests. Through active partnership and \ncooperation, the Group strives to support these companies in their continued growth. The partnership complements the BioPak business \nand extends the already broad range of sustainable solutions for take-away packaging. Different occasions require either single use, multiple \nuse or a combination of both. Therefore, a complementary range in more European countries is important to meet future customer needs. \nLocal waste management infrastructure varies widely and both single-use and multi-use options are important to ensure a fully circular busi-\nness model in the future.\nRelevo GmbH is a provider of reusable systems for take-away food and beverages and was founded in 2020 by three entrepreneurs in \nMunich, Germany. Relevo has created a digital platform of reusable take-away products and is working to combat the problem of plastic \nwaste by offering smart and sustainable solutions that are easily accessible to companies in the HoReCa industry. Relevo has grown rapidly \nsince its inception and now has 35 employees.\nBûmerang Takeaway SL was founded in 2019 in Barcelona and offers the first return system for the catering market in Spain.

Subsidiar-\nies Duni Thailand and BioPak Pty Ltd in Australia are recognized at fair \nvalue. A detailed description of accounting principles can be found in \ntheir entirety in Note 2.\nSignificant estimates and judgments\nPreliminary acquisition analyses based on as thorough estimates and \njudgments as possible are conducted at the time of acquisition. How-\never, the analyses may need to be adjusted further down the road. All \nacquisition analyses are subject to final adjustments no later than 12 \nmonths after the acquisition date.\nWhen there are obligations to acquire the remaining shares of a com-\npany, these are recognized as if they were fully consolidated. At the \nsame time, the Group recognizes a liability equivalent to the dis-\ncounted expected redemption price for these call options. The \nnon-controlling interest attributable to the option is thus also \neliminated. \nNo business acquisitions took place in 2022 or 2021\nBioPak Pty Ltd\nIn December 2021, a call option for 5% of the shares in BioPak Pty \nLtd was exercised. The acquisition was completed in January 2022 \nand the purchase price was SEK 24.7 million. Duni Group subse-\nquently owned 80% of the shares in BioPak Pty Ltd. The remaining \n20% was then owned by one of the original founders, which since \nthe original acquisition was covered by a call and put option with \nexercise periods between October 2023 and October 2024. The \noption is a derivative instrument and is recognized as a long-term \nliability to the minority owner, valued at SEK 377 million as of \nDecember 31, 2021. The final exercise price will be determined by \nthe future performance and growth of the BioPak Group. \nIn 2022, the Board of Directors had various strategic options to \noptimize the long-term value of the BioPak Group evaluated, within \nthe framework of ensuring that the BioPak Group remains a consoli-\ndated subsidiary of the Duni Group. In December 2022, 25% of the \nshares in BioPak Pty Ltd were sold to Five V Capital, a private equity \ncompany based in Australia.  The Duni Group subsequently owns \n55%, Five V Capital 30% and the original founder 15% of the shares \nin BioPak Pty Ltd. The purchase price for the Duni Group’s divestment \nof 25% of the shares was AUD 65.8 million, of which AUD 61.3 million \nwas paid in December (corresponding to SEK 429 million). AUD 4.5 mil-\nlion may be paid between Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, provided that certain \npredetermined conditions are met. These will be reported at a later \ndate. New shareholder agreements were signed in the new ownership \nstructure in connection with the divestment. The liability relating to the \nminority owner’s option that was recognized as a derivative instrument \nwas SEK 380 million at the time of divestment, and was dissolved with \na settlement amount of SEK 66 million, which was paid in December. \nThe entire transaction is deemed to constitute a transaction with the \nminority owners and is therefore recognized directly in equity at a total \nof SEK 743 million (SEK 429 million + SEK 380 million - SEK 66 million). \nThe Duni Group continues to have a majority shareholding of 55% in \nBioPak Pty and controls the company, and it will therefore continue to \nbe consolidated 100% in the Group. As a result of the sale, 45% of the \nBioPak Group’s profit after tax will be recognized as Non-controlling \ninterests, and earnings per share attributable to the Parent Company’s \nshareholders will be affected. As the transaction took place at the end \nof December, there is no significant impact on the profit/loss for 2022.\n119\nAnnual Report 2022 / Notes"

Goodwill on acquisi-\ntion of subsidiaries is recognized as intangible assets. Goodwill is \nreviewed annually to identify any impairment and recognized at acqui-\nsition value less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment testing is \nconducted to ascertain whether the recoverable amount, i.e. the \nhigher of net realizable value or value in use, exceeds the carrying \namount. The asset’s value is written down to the recoverable amount \nas soon as it is shown that it is lower than the carrying amount. Impair-\nment of goodwill is not reversed. Gains or losses upon the divestment \nof a unit include the remaining carrying amount of the goodwill which \nrelates to the divested unit.\nDetailed information regarding the Group’s definition of cash-generat-\ning units upon the allocation of goodwill is provided below.\nCustomer relationships, trademarks and licenses\nIdentifiable acquired customer relationships are recognized at fair value \nand are attributable to acquisitions made from 2013 onwards. The rela-\ntionships are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated use-\nful life of 10 years.\nAcquired trademarks and licenses are recognized at acquisition value. \nTrademarks and licenses have a determinable useful life and are recog-\nnized at acquisition value less accumulated amortization. Trademarks \nand licenses are amortized on a straight-line basis in order to allocate \ntheir cost over their estimated useful life (3-10 years).\nResearch and development\nCapitalized research expenses relate primarily to expenditure for the \nimplementation of the SAP ERP system.\nResearch expenses are recognized when incurred.\nExpenditure incurred in development projects (relating to design and \ntesting of new or improved products) are recognized as intangible \nassets when the following criteria are fulfilled:\na.\t it is technically feasible to finish the intangible asset so that it can \nbe used or sold,\nb.\tmanagement intends to finish the intangible asset and use or sell \nit,\nc.\t conditions exist to use or sell the intangible asset,\nd.\tthe way in which the intangible asset will generate probable future \neconomic benefits can be demonstrated,\ne.\tadequate technical, financial and other resources exist to com-\nplete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and\nf.\t the expenditures which relate to the intangible asset during its \ndevelopment can be calculated in a reliable manner.\nOther development expenditure which does not fulfill these conditions \nis recognized as an expense when incurred. Development expenditure \npreviously recognized as an expense is not recognized as an asset in a \nsubsequent period.Capitalized development expenses are recognized as \nintangible assets and the assets are amortized from the time the asset is \nready for use on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life (3–10 \nyears).\nEmission rights\nThe Duni Group participates in the EU’s emission rights trading system. \nReceived emission rights are recognized as intangible assets measured \nat cost, in other words, initially at SEK zero. Values are not adjusted up. \nA provision is made if an emission rights deficit is identified between \nowned rights and the rights which will need to be delivered due to \nemissions made. The value of any surplus emission rights is recog-\nnized only when realized upon an external sale.\nSignificant estimates and judgments \nGroup Management determines the estimated useful life and thereby \nthe amortization of the Group’s intangible assets. These estimates are \nbased on historical knowledge of the useful life of equivalent assets. \nUseful lives and estimated residual values are reviewed on each bal-\nance sheet date and adjusted as required.\nEach year, the Group assesses whether there is any impairment of \ngoodwill. The recoverable amount of cash-generating units has been \ndetermined by calculating the value in use. Certain estimates must be \nmade for these calculations. The calculations are based on estimated \nfuture cash flows before tax, based on financial forecasts approved by \ncompany management and which cover the current year as well as a \nfive-year period. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using \nan estimated growth rate. The growth rate does not exceed the long-\nterm growth rate for the industry as a whole.\nSignificant assumptions which are used for calculations of values in \nuse are primarily profit margin, growth rate and a nominal discount \nrate.  Which discount rate is used for each business area can be seen in \nthe table below. The discount rate before tax is used in conjunction \nwith present value calculation of estimated future cash flows. Com-\npany management has established the profit margin and growth rate \nbased on previous income and its expectations as regards market \ngrowth. The discount rates used are stated before tax and reflect spe-\ncific risks in the business area. Company management believes that \nthe Group’s operations are stable and there are therefore not any indi-\nvidual significant assumptions that could impact the profit margin. The \nestimated growth rate is applied in all essential respects to net sales \nand free cash flow. Company management believes that reasonably \npossible changes in the significant assumptions used in the calcula-\ntions would not have such a major impact as to individually reduce the \nrecoverable amount to a value which is below the carrying amount.  \n120\nAnnual Report 2022 / Notes"

      "text": "Allocation of goodwill to the Group’s cash-generating units\nThe Group’s operations are divided into two business areas, Duni \nand BioPak. Each business area has full responsibility for its respec-\ntive value chain. These business areas make up the operating seg-\nments. Each business area is responsible for its respective branding \nstrategy, marketing communications, product development and \ninnovation. The Duni business area has a vertically integrated busi-\nness model for small paper-based products such as napkins and \ntable covers. The BioPak business area does not have any in-house \nmanufacturing or production. Group-wide functions such as \naccounting, HR, communications, sustainability, and IT are largely \nshared by the business areas, and the expenses for these are allo-\ncated by the percentage of sales of each business area. The busi-\nness areas are the two cash-generating units. Goodwill has been \nallocated to these based on the product portfolio of the respective \nacquisitions and thus the business area to which they belong. In \n2022, measures were taken so that Sharp Serviettes can be consid-\nered to be integrated into the Duni business area. This concerns \nboth the business plan and reporting paths, as well as follow-up by \nthe company. There is therefore no longer any impairment testing \nof individual companies.\nSEK m, segment\n2022\n2021\nDuni\n1,589\n1,538\nBioPak\n547\n455\nDuni Song Seng\n–\n0\nSharp Serviettes\n–\n17\nTotal\n2,136\n2,010\nAcquisitions and goodwill\nSegment\nYear\nAcquisitions\nCountry\nGoodwill on acquisition1, \nSEK m\nBioPak\n2019\nHorizons Supply Pty Ltd\nAustralia\n7\nBioPak\n2018\nBioPak Pty Ltd\nAustralia\n475 4)\nBioPak\n2018\nKindtoo Limited (Biopac UK Ltd)\nUK\n10\nDuni\n2017\nUnited Corporation Ltd (Sharp Serviettes)\nNew Zealand\n37\nDuni\n2016\nTerinex Siam Co Ltd\nThailand\n104\nDuni\n2014\nPaper+Design Group\nGermany\n197\nBioPak\n2013\nSong Seng Associates Pte Ltd\nSingapore\n50 2) 3)\n1) Acquired goodwill translated to SEK at the acquisition date\n2) Acquisition of assets and liabilities\n3) In 2021, the goodwill in Duni Song Seng was written down due to restructuring\n4) Goodwill in Australia has been adjusted by SEK 48 million, from the original amount of SEK 427 million. Accrued tax liabilities were corrected in 2022, resulting in an increase in goodwill.\nEmission rights\nIn 2005, the EU introduced an emission rights system as a method \nfor restricting carbon dioxide emissions. The Group holds permits for \nthe production of 65,000 tonnes of wet laid tissue per year and 52,000 \ntonnes of airlaid tissue per year at the mill in Skåpafors and 10,000 \ntonnes of airlaid tissue in Dals Långed. The mill in Skåpafors holds \npermits issued by the Administrative Board in Västra Götaland \nCounty regarding emissions of carbon dioxide, CO2. For the 2013 to \n2020 trading period, Rexcell Tissue & Airlaid AB was allocated a total \nof 166,246 tonnes of CO2. The new trading period runs from 2021 to \n2025 and during this period Skåpafors has received an allocation of \n14,670 tonnes per year and Dals Långed 1,626 tonnes per year. For \n2022, Skåpafors was thus allocated 14,670 tonnes; the correspond-\ning allocation in 2021 was 14,670.  The production plant in Dals \nLånged is dormant and no allowances are used when there is no pro-\nduction, which means that the allocation for Dals Långed is effec-\ntively 0 tonnes per year. The allocation for Dals Långed has been \ndormant since 2017, but can be regained upon application. The \nemission rights for 2022 are not yet finally verified, so an adjustment \nmay be made.\nExcess emission rights are carried over to the following year, while \nsupport purchases are made if the emission rights are insufficient. If \npurchases of additional rights are made in 2023, the Company esti-\nmates that these will not amount to a significant sum. In 2022, Rex-\ncell Tissue & Airlaid AB had 1,694 (3,839) unused emission rights at \na market value of SEK 0 million (0). In total, 12,976 tonnes were used \nin Skåpafors in 2022, while the amount for 2021 was 10,831 tonnes . \nReceived emission rights are reported as intangible assets recog-\nnized at an acquisition value of zero. \nAllocation of goodwill\nWith the implementation of IFRS, allocation of the Group’s goodwill \nitems has taken place through allocation ratios. In addition, goodwill \non acquisition is allocated to the cash-generating units and operat-\ning segments based on a judgment of which units will benefit from \nthe synergies, etc. created by the business combination. \n In making the allocation, management considers the estimated \nbusiness volumes of the units and made a judgment of market \ngrowth for each unit. The allocation of goodwill is shown in the \ntable below.\nImpairment testing for goodwill\nImpairment testing for goodwill is performed annually at the end of the \nfiscal year and when there are indications of impairment.\nThe tables below shows the rate of growth (on average) used in \nthe calculation for each business area and fiscal year. Even if the \nestimated rate of growth which is applied to discounted cash flows \nafter the forecast five-year period had been 1% lower than the man-\nagement’s judgment, there would be no goodwill impairment of the \ngoodwill tested for each segment.\nThe rate of growth is slowly returning to its pre-pandemic level. \nThe recovery has been good for the Duni business area, which is \nexpected to be back after 2024. The BioPak business area continues \nto show a clear growth trend.\nThe estimated pre-tax discount rate is shown in the table below:\nDiscount rate before tax per segment\n2022\n2021\nDuni\n11.6%\n9.7%\nBioPak\n13.1%\n11.0%\nDuni Song Seng\n–\n–\nSharp Serviettes\n–\n13.1%\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n123\nAnnual Report 2022 / Notes"

The Group leases various offices, \nwarehouses, machinery, forklifts and cars. The leases are normally \nsigned for binding terms between 2 and 8 years, but there may be an \noption to extend. The leases may include both lease and non-lease \ncomponents. The Group allocates the remuneration of the contract to \nlease and non-lease components based on their relative independent \nprices. However, for lease payments relating to properties for which \nthe Group is a tenant, the Group has opted not to separate lease and \nnon-lease components, instead recognizing these as a single lease \ncomponent. The terms and conditions are negotiated separately for \neach contract and have many different provisions. The leases do not \ncontain any special conditions or restrictions expect that the lessor \nretains the rights to pledged leased assets. The leased assets cannot \nbe used as collateral for loans.\nAssets and liabilities that arise from leases are initially recognized at \npresent value. Lease liabilities include the present value of the follow-\ning lease payments:\n\t•\nfixed payments or deductions for any benefits associated with \nsigning the lease, variable lease payments that are based on an \nindex or a price\n\t•\namounts expected to be paid by the lessee as per residual value \nguarantees\n\t•\nthe redemption price for a purchase option if the Group is rea-\nsonably certain it will exercise this option\n\t•\npenalties due upon termination of the lease, if the lease term \nindicates that the Group will exercise an option to terminate the \nlease.\nLease payments that will be made for reasonably certain extension \noptions are also included in the measurement of the liability.\nThe leases payments are discounted using the lease’s implicit interest \nrate. If this interest rate cannot be established easily, which is normally \nthe case for the Group’s leases, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate \nwill be used, which is the interest rate that the individual lessee would \npay for borrowing the funds required to purchase an asset similar in \nvalue to the right of use in a similar economic environment with similar \nterms and collateral.\nThe marginal lending rate for new contracts is determined as follows:\nThe Duni Group’s current borrowing rate including maturity premiums \nand adjustments for the internal borrowing margin (corresponding to \nadjustments for the specific terms and conditions of the contract such \nas the lease term, country, currency and collateral).\nThe Group is exposed to any future increases in variable lease pay-\nments based on an index or interest rate that are not included in the \nlease liability until they occur. When adjustments of lease payments \nbased on an index or interest rate occur, the lease liability is remea-\nsured and adjusted to the right of use.\nThe lease payments are distributed between principal repayment and \ninterest. The interest is recognized in the income statement over the \nterm of the lease in a way that results in a fixed interest rate for the \nlease liability recognized in the respective period.\nThe assets with a right of use are measured at cost and include the \nfollowing:\n\t•\nthe amount the lease liability was originally measured at\n\t•\nlease payments paid at or before the start date, less any benefits \nreceived upon signing the lease\n\t•\ninitial direct expenses\n\t•\nexpenses for restoring the asset to the condition stipulated in the \nlease terms and conditions.\nRights of use are normally amortized on a straight-line basis over the \nshorter of the useful life and lease term. If the Group is reasonably cer-\ntain it will exercise a purchase option, the right of use is amortized over \nthe useful life of the underlying asset.\nPayments for short contracts for IT equipment and the hire of work \nequipment, and all low-value leases are recognized as an expense on a \nstraight-line basis in the income statement. Short contracts are leases \nwith a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value leases include IT \nequipment and minor office equipment. Low value is defined as less \nthan USD 5,000.\nAs per RFR 2, the rules of IFRS 16 do not need to be applied in legal \nentities. In such cases, a company that is the lessee shall recognize \nlease payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of \nthe lease. The right of use and lease liability shall thus not be recog-\nnized in the balance sheet. Duni AB has chosen to apply the exemption \nin RFR 2 and leases will therefore be classified as operating leases in \nthe Parent Company going forward.\nSignificant estimates and judgments\nUpon recognition of leases under IFRS 16, estimates and assumptions \nmust be used. The two most significant are the judgments of the lease \nterm’s length and what discount rate will be used.\nEstablishing the lease’s length, management considers all information \navailable that provides an economic incentive to exercise an extension \noption, or to not exercise an option to terminate a lease. Options to \nextend a lease are only included in the lease’s length if it is reasonably \ncertain that the lease will be extended (or not terminated). Individual \nassessments on extensions are made on an ongoing basis, lease by \nlease.\nFor leases for warehouses, offices and equipment, the following factors \nare normally the most significant:\n\t•\nIf the leases have significant fees to terminate them (or not to \nextend them), the Group normally estimates that it is reasonably \ncertain that they will be extended (or not terminated).\n\t•\nIf the Group has leasehold improvements and expects that they \nhave a significant residual value, it is usually reasonably certain \nthat the leases will be extended (or not terminated).\n\t•\nOtherwise, the Group takes into account other factors, including \nhistorical lease terms, and the expenses and business disruptions \nrequired to replace the leased asset.\nThe majority of extension options for leases of offices and vehicles \nhave not been included in the lease liability because the Group can \nreplace these assets without significant expenses or business \ndisruptions.\nThe lease term is reassessed if an option is exercised (or not exercised) \nor if the Group is forced to exercise the option (or not exercise it). The \njudgment that it is reasonably certain is only reassessed if some signifi-\ncant event or change in circumstances occurs that impacts this judg-\nment and the change is within the control of the lessee. There was no \nneed for any such reassessment during the fiscal year.\n127\nAnnual Report 2022 / Notes"

The following requirements must be met for financial \nassets to be classified at amortized cost:\n1.\tthe asset is part of a business model with the goal of collecting \ncontract sure cash flows, and\n2.\tthe contract terms create cash flows that solely consist of capital \nand interest on the outstanding capital at specific points in time.\nThe Group valuates future expected credit losses related to invest-\nments in debt instruments measured at amortized cost or fair value \nwith changes through other comprehensive income based on for-\nward-looking information. The reserving method is selected based on \nwhether or not there has been a material increase in credit risk. In \naccordance with the rules of IFRS 9, the Group applies a simplified \nmethod for impairment testing of accounts receivable. As a result of \nthe simplification, the provision for expected credit losses is calculated \nbased on the risk of loss for the entire term of the receivable and is rec-\nognized upon initial recognition of the receivable.\nAccounts receivable are written off and recognized as incurred losses \nwhen information has been obtained that the customer will likely be \nunable to pay an invoice for reasons such as bankruptcy or unsuccess-\nful garnishment attempts.\nSignificant estimates and judgments\nEstimates and assumptions are made for the provisioning of doubtful \ntrade receivables. On the other hand, general assumptions are made \nabout the allowance for doubtful trade receivables based on when the \ntrade receivables are due. On the other hand, individual assessments \nare made for major customers as to whether the receivables are \ndeemed to be payable. These assumptions are based on knowledge of \ncustomers, such as their ability to pay, their payment history and any \npending disputes.\n129\nAnnual Report 2022 / Notes"

The \nrisk increased during the pandemic, as the  Group’s customers had \ntheir operations severely affected by restrictions, which significantly \nreduced their revenues and thereby their earnings. The Duni Group \nconsiders that the credit risk is therefore temporarily higher during \nthe pandemic and that more customers may go bankrupt or have \npayment difficulties, which resulted in a higher than normal reserve \nfor doubtful receivables during 2021. The recovery started in 2022 \nand sales increased. The Group has been hit by a small number of \nbankruptcies, but uncertainty is still high in an uncertain external \nenvironment with high inflation. The reserve for accounts receivable \nhas returned to a more normal level.\nOf total accounts receivable, which are neither overdue nor \nimpaired, 32% (30%) have a rating of AA or higher. Of the remaining \naccounts receivable, which are neither overdue nor impaired, SEK \n221 million are covered by credit insurance, representing 22% of the \ntotal. The geographical spread, the history of customers and the \nlikelihood that all customers would experience potential payment \ndifficulties at the same time means that there is no need for a major \nimpairment of the remaining share in this category.\nNo single customer’s total trade receivables exceed 19% (16%) of \ntotal trade receivables not past due or impaired.

The parent \ncompany’s figures are consistent with the Group’s except for the \ndebt, where the parent company accounts for SEK 2 million and the \nsubsidiaries for SEK 3 million. The maximum exposure to credit risks \non the balance sheet date is the fair value of the derivative instru-\nments recognized as assets in the balance sheet.\nInterest rate swaps\nThe finance policy prescribes that the average interest term shall be \n6 months for the total loan portfolio, with the possibility of a varia-\ntion of +/- 6 months. The Group has chosen to hedge part of its out-\nstanding loans through interest rate swaps, variable against fixed \ninterest rates. Reporting of interest rate swaps is classified as cash \nflow hedging and recognized under hedge accounting in accordance \nwith IFRS 9. The outstanding nominal amount on 12/31/2022 was EUR \n60 million. Gains and losses on interest rate swaps at December 31, \n2022, which are recognized in the hedging reserve in equity in the \n“Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity”, will be regularly trans-\nferred to financial expenses in the income statement until such time \nas the swap has expired.\nAccounting principles\nThe Group has applied IFRS 9 for hedge accounting as of January 1, \n2018. The hedge accounting rules in IFRS 9 are more compatible with \nthe Company’s practical risk management, as the standard has a more \nprinciple-based approach to hedge accounting. The Duni Group’s previ-\nous hedging arrangements qualified for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 \nand the hedging documentation has therefore been updated in accor-\ndance with this.\nHedging documentation\nTo meet the requirements of hedge accounting, certain documentation \nconcerning the hedging instrument and its relationship to the hedged \nitem is required. Duni also documents goals and strategies for risk \nmanagement and hedging measures, as well as an assessment of the \neffectiveness of the hedging arrangement in terms of offsetting \nchanges in fair value or cash flow for hedged items, both at the start of \nthe hedge and then on an ongoing basis.\nMeasurement of derivative instruments\nDerivative instruments are recognized in the balance sheet at the \ntransaction date and measured at fair value, upon both initial recogni-\ntion and subsequent measurement. The fair value of derivatives traded \non an active market is based on the listed market prices on the balance \nsheet date, which means the current purchase price. For financial instru-\nments which are not traded on an active market (e.g. OTC derivatives), \nthe fair value is determined through the use of various valuation tech-\nniques. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the value of \nfuture cash flows discounted using current market interest rates, while \nthe fair value of currency forward contracts is established through the \nuse of listed prices for currency forward contracts on the balance sheet \ndate. Recognition of subsequent changes in value depends on whether \nthe derivative has been identified as a hedging instrument and, if such is \nthe case, the nature of the hedged item. If a hedging arrangement has \nnot been identified, the change in value of the derivative instrument is \nrecognized in the income statement. Call and put options entered into \nwith minority shareholders upon business combination are recognized \ndirectly in equity as a transaction with minority shareholders. The Duni \nGroup uses derivative instruments as hedging instruments for forecast \ncash flows or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.\nCash flow hedges\nThe effective part of changes in fair value on a derivative instrument \nwhich is identified as a cash flow hedge and which satisfies the condi-\ntions for hedge accounting is recognized in Other comprehensive \nincome. The gain or loss attributable to the ineffective part is recog-\nnized immediately in the income statement under Other net gains/\nlosses. The gain or loss attributable to the effective part of an interest \nrate swap which hedges borrowings at a variable interest rate is recog-\nnized in the income statement in Financial expenses.\nThe Group hedges its future interest payments using interest rate \nswaps. The Group enters into interest rate swaps that have the same \ncritical terms as the hedged object. Critical terms can be the reference \nrate, interest conversion dates, payment dates, due dates and the \nnominal amount. The Group does not hedge 100% of its loans and \ntherefore only identifies the share of outstanding loans corresponding \nto the nominal amounts of the swaps. Ineffectiveness could arise \nbecause of CVA/DVA adjustment to the interest rate swap. There was \nno significant ineffectiveness attributable to interest rate swaps in \n2022 and 2021.\nNet investment hedges\nHedges of net investments in foreign operations via currency forward \ncontracts are recognized similarly to cash flow hedges. The share of a \ngain or loss on a hedging instrument considered an effective hedge is \nrecognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity. \nThe gain or loss attributable to the ineffective part is recognized imme-\ndiately in the income statement as other revenue or other expenses. \nAccumulated gains and losses in equity are classified to profit or loss \nwhen foreign operations are fully or partially divested.\nClassification and recognition\nInformation regarding the fair value for various derivative instruments \nused for hedging purposes is provided in this note. Changes in the \nhedging reserve in equity are set forth in the consolidated statement of \nchanges in equity. The entire fair value of a derivative which constitutes \na hedge instrument is classified as a fixed asset or long-term liability \nwhen the outstanding term of the hedged item exceeds 12 months, \nand as a current asset or short-term liability when the outstanding \nterm of the hedged item is less than 12 months. Derivative instru-\nments held for trading are always classified as current assets or short-\nterm liabilities.\n132\nAnnual Report 2022 / Notes"

In the second quarter of 2022, an additional sustain-\nability-linked facility of EUR 25 million nominally was signed; this \nruns for three years. All facilities are reported as long-term as of \n31/12/2022. A facility of EUR 20 million was also signed in the sec-\nond quarter and runs for 1 year, and is recognized as short-term as \nat 31/12/2022. All sustainability-linked facilities met their key ratios \nas of 31/12/2022.\n The interest rate of all financing is variable and set at EURIBOR \nplus a margin, until the next rolling. The average rate of interest on \nbank loans was 1.78% (0.98%) per year. The change in average inter-\nest rates between 2021 and 2022 is due to the current market situa-\ntion. For more information, also see Note 35. Accrued interest is \nrecognized as accrued expenses. The tables below show nominal \nvalues excluding accrued interest on borrowings. \nOn behalf of the Group, the Parent Company has taken out an \noverdraft facility with a nominal amount of EUR 10 million. As of \n12/31/2022, the amount drawn was EUR 0 million.\nBreakdown of interest-bearing net debt\nGroup\nSEK m\n2022\n2021\nCash and cash equivalents and other long-term receivables\n376\n406\nPension provisions\n-133\n-169\nLease liability\n-164\n-178\nGross debt – variable interest\n-1,402\n-1,435\nInterest-bearing net debt\n-1,323\n-1,375\nInterest-bearing net debt also includes provisions for pensions.

IFRS 9 replaces the \nparts of IAS 39 covering the recognition and derecognition of financial \ninstruments from the balance sheet, the classification and measure-\nment of financial assets and liabilities, the impairment of financial \nassets and hedge accounting.\nClassification\nThe Group’s principles for the classification and measurement of finan-\ncial assets are based on an assessment of both (i) the company’s busi-\nness model for managing financial assets and (ii) the characteristics of \nthe contractual cash flows from the financial asset.\nFinancial assets are initially measured at fair value plus, if the asset is \nnot recognized at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs \ndirectly attributable to the purchase. Transaction costs attributable to \nfinancial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are recog-\nnized as an expense in the income statement directly. Purchases and \nsales of financial assets are recognized on the transaction day, which is \nthe date on which the Group undertakes to purchase or sell the asset.\nFinancial assets and liabilities are set off and recognized at a net \namount in the balance sheet, but only when there is a legal right to set \noff the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle them \nwith a net amount or to simultaneously realize the asset and settle the \ndebt. The legal right may not be dependent on future events and must \nbe legally binding on the Company and the counterparty, both in nor-\nmal business operations and in the event of suspension of payments, \ninsolvency or bankruptcy.\nDerivative instruments\nThe Group’s derivatives are measured at fair value in the balance sheet. \nIn cases where hedge accounting is applied or if the derivatives com-\nprise a package of options in respect of acquired subsidiaries, the \nchanges in value are recognized through other comprehensive \nincome. In other cases, the changes in value are recognized through \nprofit or loss, including cases where they financially hedge the risk but \nhedge accounting is not applied. See more in Note 28 Derivative \ninstruments.\nAssets measured at amortized cost\nThe Duni Group only classifies its financial assets as assets measured \nat amortized cost when the following requirements are met:\n– the asset is part of a business model with the goal of collecting con-\ntractual cash flows, and \n– the contract terms create cash flows that solely consist of capital and \ninterest on the outstanding capital at specific points in time.\nThe following financial assets are measured at amortized cost: Finan-\ncial assets, Other receivables, Accrued revenue, Accounts receivable \nand Cash and cash equivalents.  These assets were measured at amor-\ntized cost under the previous policies as well.\nAssets measured at fair value through profit or loss\nApart from derivative instruments, there are no financial assets mea-\nsured at fair value through profit or loss.\nAssets measured at fair value through other comprehensive \nincome\nThere are no financial assets measured at fair value through other \ncomprehensive income.\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortized cost\nLong-term and short-term interest-bearing liabilities and other finan-\ncial liabilities such as accounts payable and accrued expenses are \nincluded in this category. These liabilities are measured at amortized \ncost. Accounts payable comprise obligations to pay for goods or ser-\nvices which have been acquired from suppliers in the course of operat-\ning activities. Accounts payable are classified as short-term liabilities if \nthey fall due for payment within one year. Financial liabilities are initially \nmeasured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Thereafter, financial lia-\nbilities are measured at amortized cost, and any difference between the \namount received (net of transaction costs) and the repayment amount \nis recognized in the income statement allocated over the loan period, \napplying the effective interest rate method. In the event of early repay-\nment of loans, any pre-payment interest penalties are reported in the \nincome statement at the time of settlement. Loan expenses are \ncharged to income for the period to which they relate. Distributed divi-\ndends are recognized as a liability after the Annual General Meeting \nhas approved the dividend.\nFinancial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss\nApart from derivative instruments, there are no financial assets mea-\nsured at fair value through profit or loss.\nFinancial liabilities measured at fair value through other \n­comprehensive income\nApart from derivative instruments, there are no financial assets mea-\nsured at fair value through profit or loss.\nCalculation of fair value\nThe fair value of listed financial assets traded on an active market is \nbased on the listed market prices on the balance sheet date. The listed \nmarket price used for the Group’s financial assets is the current bid \nprice. For financial instruments which are not traded on an active mar-\nket, the fair value is determined through the use of various valuation \ntechniques. The Group uses a number of different methods and makes \nassumptions based on the market conditions prevailing on the balance \nsheet date. Listed market prices or broker listings for similar instru-\nments are used with respect to long-term liabilities. Other techniques, \nsuch as calculation of discounted cash flows, are used to establish the \nfair value of the remaining financial instruments.\nThe carrying amount of accounts receivable and accounts payable, \nless any impairment, is assumed to correspond to fair value since \nthese items are short-term in nature. For information purposes, the fair \nvalue of financial liabilities is calculated by discounting the future con-\ntracted cash flows to the current market interest rate which is available \nto the Group for similar financial instruments. For other financial assets \nand liabilities, the fair value is deemed to be in line with the carrying \namount, due to the short expected maturity.\nPursuant to the standard for financial instruments, disclosure is \nrequired regarding measurement to fair value per level in the following \nfair value hierarchy:\nLevel 1 – Listed prices (unadjusted) on active markets for identical \nassets or liabilities. \nLevel 2 – Other observable data for assets or liabilities comprises listed \nprices included in Level 1, either directly (as price) or indirectly (derived \nfrom price). \nLevel 3 – Data for assets or liabilities which is not based on observable \nmarket data.\nAll derivative instruments are classified in accordance with Level 2, \nexcept for the put option to the minority shareholders, which is classi-\nfied in accordance with level 3.\nDerecognition of financial assets and liabilities\nFinancial instruments are derecognized from the balance sheet when \nall risks and rewards have been transferred to another party or when \nobligations have been met.\n135\nAnnual Report 2022 / Notes"

These can be divided into currency risks, price risks \nregarding energy consumption and pulp purchases, interest rate \nrisks in cash flow and interest rate risks in fair value, credit risks and \nliquidity risks. The finance policy focuses on contingencies on the \nfinancial markets. \nFinancial risk management is handled by a central finance \ndepartment (Treasury) in accordance with a finance policy reviewed \nand approved annually by the Board of Directors. The policy includes \nboth overall risk management and risk management for specific \nareas, such as currency risks, interest rate risks, the use of derivative \nand non-derivative financial instruments and the investment of sur-\nplus liquidity. Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial \nrisks in close cooperation with the Group’s operational units.  The \nfinancial hedge relationships established by the Duni Group as an \nelement in its risk management do not qualify for hedge accounting \npursuant to the rules in IFRS 9, apart from two exceptions. The inter-\nest rate swaps are recognized in accordance with the rules govern-\ning cash flow hedges. The other exception is that part of the assets \nin acquired company BioPak Pty Ltd, Australia, is hedged using cur-\nrency forward contracts pursuant to the rules on net investment \nhedges in foreign currency.\nMarket risk\nCurrency risk\nThe Duni Group operates internationally and is exposed to currency \nrisks which arise from various currencies exposures. Currency expo-\nsure can be described as translation exposure and transaction expo-\nsure. The Group manages its translation exposure and transaction \nexposure by concentrating the exposure to a small number of \nGroup companies and through a finance policy adopted by the \nBoard of Directors.\nTransaction exposure\nTransaction exposure arises when a company sells and buys in a \ncurrency other than its functional currency. The transaction expo-\nsure is minimized primarily through external commercial transac-\ntions mainly being made in the functional currencies of the subsid-\niaries. Purchases by subsidiaries, primarily internal, may however be \nmade in currencies other than the subsidiary’s own functional cur-\nrency, and thus these purchases are exposed to a currency risk. By \nalso directing the internal flows as far as possible to the functional \ncurrency of the recipient subsidiary, the currency risk is concen-\ntrated to a small number of subsidiaries. The Group’s external out-\nflows are primarily in SEK, USD and PLN, while external inflows are \nprimarily in AUD, DKK, NOK, CHF and GBP. The Group’s policy is to \nnot hedge flows in foreign currency in any way other than as is \ndescribed above. There is also no policy to hedge interest pay-\nments, either internal or external.\nThrough the subsidiary Rexcell Tissue & Airlaid AB there is indi-\nrect currency risk in USD. Internationally, pulp is priced in USD, and \nthus a strengthening/weakening of the USD gives rise to increased or \nreduced purchasing costs for the Group.\nTranslation exposure – Consolidation\nTranslation exposure arises when the income statements of subsid-\niaries are translated to SEK.\nTranslation exposure refers to the Group exposure’s in connection \nwith the consolidation and translation of subsidiaries with a different \nfunctional currency than the Group’s functional currency, SEK. The \nGroup’s functional currency is the same as its presentation currency. \nTranslation from each company’s functional currency to SEK has a \nmajor impact on the Group’s reported revenue and income. At \nunchanged exchange rates compared with 2021, net sales for the \nyear would have been SEK 349 million lower and the underlying EBIT \nwould have been SEK 40 million lower.\nTranslation exposure – Balance sheet\nThe Group is also exposed to another type of translation exposure \nwhich occurs in the balance sheets of the individual Group compa-\nnies due to the fact that such balance sheets include items in a cur-\nrency other than such Group company’s functional currency. Reval-\nuation of these items to the exchange rate at the balance sheet \ndate is included in the Group’s income. \nThe financial borrowing and lending in the individual subsidiaries \nis primarily internal through the Parent Company and in the respec-\ntive subsidiary’s functional currency. In this manner, currency expo-\nsure regarding these items has been centralized to the Parent Com-\npany. In the Parent Company, 100% of the financial borrowing and \nlending is hedged in accordance with the Group’s policy, and thus a \nchange in exchange rates has no essential effect on income. The Par-\nent Company’s external borrowing is matched approximately 60% by \ninternal net lending with the same currency breakdown. The remain-\ning 30% of internal net lending is hedged on the currency futures mar-\nket in accordance with the Group’s policy. Note 30 presents the value \nand nominal amounts of currency forward contracts entered into \nregarding borrowing and lending in the Parent Company.\nAs described in greater detail below in the section addressing \ntransaction exposures, the Duni Group manages its currency risks \nprimarily by concentrating commercial transactions mainly in the \nfunctional currencies of the subsidiaries. As regards the consoli-\ndated Group, the translation exposure in the working capital of the \nindividual subsidiaries is therefore assessed as minor. However, there \nis some exposure in the Group’s working capital, and had all currencies \nbeen 1% higher/lower, due to exposure in the individual subsidiaries \nand the consolidated balance sheet items, the Group’s income would \nhave been approximately +/- SEK 8 million (+/- 5). The corresponding \nfigure for the Parent Company is approximately +/- SEK 0.7 million \n(+/- 0.4).\nThere is also exposure in the Group because the Group’s net \nassets are in subsidiaries with currencies other than SEK. Translation \nof these net assets results in translation effects that are recognized \nin other comprehensive income. The Group has a policy that gov-\nerns when and to what extent this exposure is to be hedged. As of \n2018, the Group hedges part of the net assets in acquired company \nBioPak Pty Ltd using currency forward contracts. Currency forward \ncontracts are recognized pursuant to the rules on net investment \nhedges in foreign currency. The hedge is strictly for financial aims \nand not for speculative purposes. The derivative instrument meets \nthe criteria for hedge accounting. The effectiveness of the hedge \nwas assessed when the hedging arrangement was entered into. The \nhedged item and hedging instrument are assessed on an ongoing \nbasis to ensure that the arrangement meets the requirements.\nPrice risks\nEnergy price risks\nThrough their energy-intensive operations, production and conver-\nsion units in Europe are exposed to risks associated with changes in \nthe price of energy, especially gas and electricity. In cases where \nenergy price risk is not hedged, price changes in the energy market \nwill have a direct impact on the company’s results. A change of +/-5% \nin the price of the electricity used by all production and conversion \nunits in Europe affects income by approximately SEK 10 million (5).\nNote 34 – Financial risks\n138\nAnnual Report 2022 / Notes"

In 2022, Rexcell Tissue & Airlaid AB had 1,694 (3,839) unused \nemission rights with a market value of SEK 0 million (0). In total, \n12,976 tonnes were used in Skåpafors in 2022. For more information \nabout emission rights, please see the Directors’ Report.\nPulp price risk\nOTC trading in financial contracts takes place with respect to certain \npaper and pulp products, i.e. there is a possibility to reduce the risk \nof fluctuations in the paper and pulp price. Purchases of paper and \npulp are carried out by the subsidiary, Rexcell Tissue & Airlaid AB. \nThe Duni Group currently has not signed any such contracts. A \nchange of +/- 5% per tonne in the price of pulp during 2022 affects \nincome by -/+ SEK 28 million (18).\nInterest rate risks with respect to cash flows and fair value\nThe Duni Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk mainly in \nEURIBOR, as all external borrowings are at floating rates (see Note 30 \nfor more details). The Parent Company’s internal lending and borrow-\ning also takes place at variable rates. Part of the interest rate risk has \nbeen hedged at a fixed rate through interest rate swaps, maturing \nbetween December 2022 and December 2027. The interest rate swaps \nare solely for financially hedging risks, not speculative purposes.\nThe impact of the hedge is assessed when the hedging arrange-\nment is entered into. The hedged item and hedging instrument are \nassessed on an ongoing basis to ensure that the arrangement \nmeets the requirements. The Group does not hedge 100% of its \nloans and therefore only identifies the share of outstanding loans \ncorresponding to the nominal amounts of the interest rate swaps. \nThe financial relationship has been 100% effective because the criti-\ncal conditions have been matched.\nThe Group has no significant interest-bearing assets. Revenues \nand cash flows from operating activities are, in all essential \nrespects, independent of changes in market interest rates. The \nGroup’s interest rate risk with respect to cash flows arises through \nexternal borrowing at a variable interest rate. Outstanding loans are \n100% in EUR.\nHad interest rates on the Group’s borrowing at 12/31/2022 been \n100 points higher/lower, with all other variables being constant and \ntaking into account interest rate swaps, net financial items for 2022 \nwould have been SEK 7 million (1) lower/higher. Other components \nof equity would have been SEK 22 million (16) lower/higher, mainly as \nan effect of a decrease/increase in the fair value of interest rate deriv-\natives used as hedging instruments.\nRisk associated with liability for minority put option\nIn December 2022, 25% of the shares in BioPak Pty Ltd were sold to \nFive V Capital, a private equity company based in Australia.  The \nDuni Group subsequently owns 55%, Five V Capital 30% and the origi-\nnal founder 15% of the shares in BioPak Pty Ltd. The purchase price for \nthe Duni Group’s divestment of 25% of the shares amounted to AUD \n65.8 million, of which AUD 61.3 million was paid in December and \nAUD 4.5 million may be paid between Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, pro-\nvided that certain predetermined conditions are met. New share-\nholder agreements were signed in the new ownership structure in \nconnection with the divestment. The liability that the Duni Group rec-\nognized as a derivative instrument of SEK 377 million in respect of the \nminority owner’s option was dissolved with a settlement amount of \nSEK 66 million, which was paid in December. The entire transaction \nis deemed to constitute a transaction with the minority owners and \nis therefore recognized directly in equity.\n The Duni Group continues to have a majority shareholding of \n55% in BioPak Pty and controls the company, and it will therefore \ncontinue to be consolidated 100% in the Group. \nCredit risk\nCredit risks are managed at the Group level. Credit risks arise \nthrough cash and cash equivalents, derivative instruments and bal-\nances held with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit \nexposure in relation to the Group’s customers, including outstand-\ning receivables and agreed transactions. Only banks and financial \ninstitutions with a long-term credit rating from an independent rat-\ning agency of at least A- (minus) or better are accepted. The total \namount deposited or invested in a bank or a single finance company \nmay not exceed SEK 150 million.\nThe maximum credit risk consists of the book value of the \nexposed assets, including derivatives with positive market values.\nAll new large customers are subject to a credit rating assessment \nby an independent rating agency. In those cases where there is no \nindependent credit rating, a risk assessment is made regarding the \ncustomer’s creditworthiness with consideration given to the cus-\ntomer’s financial position, previous experience and other factors. \nIndividual risk limits are established based on internal or external \ncredit assessments in accordance with the limits established by the \nBoard. For more information about accounts receivable, please see \nNote 23.\nReceivables overdue by more than 180 days accounted for 1.3% \n(1.98%) of total accounts receivable. For the Parent Company, the \ncorresponding figure is 0.03% (0.1%).\n139\nAnnual Report 2022 / Notes"

Excess liquidity is centralized via the \nGroup’s cash pools. Treasury manages liquidity both within and \nbetween these cash pools. The Duni Group has liquidity of SEK 372 \nmillion (396) as of December 31, 2022 and an undrawn credit facility \nof SEK 1,113 million (972). Payments for coming periods relating to \nfinancial liabilities are shown in the tables below.\nThe Group’s bank loans and overdraft facilities are in EUR and \ncarry a variable interest rate where the interest is established at the \nloan period, the discount effect for such a relatively short period of \ntime is insignificant, and thus the fair value corresponds to the nom-\ninal value less accrued interest. The Group’s bank loans and over-\ndraft facilities are in EUR and carry a variable interest rate where the \ninterest is established at the loan period, the discount effect for \nsuch a relatively short period of time is insignificant, and thus the \nfair value corresponds to the nominal value less accrued interest. \nOn March 25, 2022, a sustainability-linked financing facility to a total \namount of EUR 180 million was signed. It consists of a EUR 150 mil-\nlion revolving credit facility and a EUR 30 million Term Loan. These \nfacilities run until 2025 and 2024, respectively. In the second quar-\nter, an additional EUR 25 million sustainability-linked facility was \nsigned, which runs for three years. All of these facilities are reported \nas long-term as of 12/31/2022. There is also a EUR 20 million facility \nthat expires in 2023 and is recognized on a short-term basis as at \n31/12/2022. The interest rate of all financing is variable and set at \nEURIBOR plus a margin, until the next rolling. The average rate of \ninterest on bank loans was 1.78% (0.98%) per year. The change in \naverage interest rates between 2021 and 2022 is due to the current \nmarket situation. \nThe credit facility is subject to covenants consisting of a financial \nkey ratio as well as a number of non-financial conditions. The finan-\ncial key ratio comprises financial net debt as a percentage of the \nunderlying EBITDA. The interest margin is calculated based on the \nsame key ratio and adjusted based on given levels each quarter. This \nkey ratio is used for compliance with the credit facilities. A breach of \nthe financial key ratio would result in increased financial expenses in \nthe form of fees, increased margins and canceled credit facilities.\nThe table below shows the Group’s contracted outstanding \nnon-discounted interest payments and repayments on financial lia-\nbilities and liabilities regarding derivative instruments:\n1 to 3 months\n3 to 12 months\n13 to 24 months\nSEK m\nCarrying \namount\nInterest\nRepayment\nInterest\nRepayment\nInterest\nRepayment\nLiabilities\nBank loans\n-1,402\n-10\n–\n-30\n-337\n-40\n-1,065\nAccounts payable and other liabilities\n-997\n–\n-997\n–\n–\n–\n–\nDerivative instruments – currency forward \ncontracts1)\n-5\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\nTotal liabilities\n-2,404\n-10\n-997\n-30\n-337\n-40\n-1,065\nAssets\nDerivative instruments - interest rate swaps\n47\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\nTotal assets\n47\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nTotal\n-2,357\n-10\n-997\n-30\n-337\n-40\n-1,065\n1) Gross flows are shown in the table below.\nThe market value of the derivative instruments breaks down by type of derivative as follows:\nSEK m\n2022\n2021\nCurrency forward contracts\n-5\n2\nInterest rate swaps\n47\n4\nLiability for put option of minority owners*\n–\n-377\nTotal\n42\n-372\n* For liability for put option of minority owners, see Note 29.\n140\nAnnual Report 2022 / Notes"

The annual accounts and consolidated \naccounts of the company are included on pages 70-147 in this document.\nIn our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accor-\ndance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all mate-\nrial respects, the financial position of parent company and the group \nas of 31 December 2022 and its financial performance and cash flow \nfor the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts \nAct. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance \nwith the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material \nrespects, the financial position of the group as of 31 December 2022 \nand their financial performance and cash flow for the year then \nended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Stan-\ndards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. \nOur opinions do not cover the corporate governance statement on \npages 75-84. The statutory administration report is consistent with \nthe other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts.\nWe therefore recommend that the general meeting of sharehold-\ners adopts the income statement and balance sheet for the parent \ncompany and the group.\nOur opinions in this report on the annual accounts and consoli-\ndated accounts are consistent with the content of the additional \nreport that has been submitted to the parent company’s audit com-\nmittee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 11.\nBasis for Opinions\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards \non Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Swe-\nden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described \nin the Auditor’s Responsibilities section. We are independent of the \nparent company and the group in accordance with professional eth-\nics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical \nresponsibilities in accordance with these requirements. This includes \nthat, based on the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited \nservices referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5.1 \nhave been provided to the audited company or, where applicable, its \nparent company or its controlled companies within the EU.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient \nand appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.\nOur audit approach\nAudit scope\nWe designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the \nrisks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial state-\nments. In particular, we considered where management made sub-\njective judgements; for example, in respect of significant account-\ning estimates that involved making assumptions and considering \nfuture events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, \nwe also addressed the risk of management override of internal \n­controls, including among other matters consideration of whether \nthere was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material mis-\nstatement due to fraud.\nWe tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient \nwork to enable us to provide an opinion on the consolidated finan-\ncial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the \nGroup, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in \nwhich the group operates.\nMateriality\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materi-\nality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether \nthe financial statements are free from material misstatement. Mis-\nstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered \nmaterial if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be \nexpected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the \nbasis of the consolidated financial statements.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain \nquantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group \nmateriality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole. \nThese, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to deter-\nmine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our \naudit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both \nindividually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our profes-\nsional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual \naccounts and consolidated accounts of the current period. These mat-\nters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our \nopinion thereon, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a \nwhole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n145"

      "text": "146\nAnnual Report 2022 / Auditor’s Report\nKey audit matter\nHow our audit considered the key audit matter\nValuation of intangible assets \nReference to note 2 and note 21 in the annual report. \nThe value of the intangible assets as of 31 December 2022 amounts to SEK \n2,441 million. In accordance with IFRS, management must annually carry \nout an impairment test on goodwill with an indefinite useful life. SEK 1,555 \nmillion of the goodwill is attributable to business area Duni and SEK 547 \nmillion is attributable to business area BioPak. Some of the assumptions and \nassessments management makes regarding future cash flows and condi-\ntions are complex and have a major impact on the calculation of the value in \nuse. This applies in particular to the following; growth rate, profit margins, \nand discount rate. Changes in these assumptions could lead to a change in \nthe reported value of intangible assets and goodwill. \nWe have previously described that goodwill and other intangible assets \nattributable to business area BioPak was a particularly significant area as \ngoodwill and other intangible assets were recently acquired. The history \nof assessments and assumptions for these business areas is significantly \nshorter compared to business area Duni. As described in note 20, during \nthe year Duni sold 25% of the shares in Biopak. Since acquisition, Biopak \nhas been fully consolidated as there was a mutual purchase and sale option, \nas Duni continued to have the controlling influence, Biopak is part of the \nconsolidated group. The sale has been reported as a transaction with the \nminority. The sale has been made at an valuation that exceeds the original \npurchase price. \nNo write-down needs in any of the business areas have been identified \nby the management in the write-down tests that are carried out annually.\nIn our audit, we have assessed the calculation model used and challenged \nthe material assumptions used by management in their tests. \nWe have assessed the reasonableness of the budget presented by man-\nagement and approved by the board by evaluating historical outcomes \nagainst established budgets. \nWe have compared the growth in the terminal value with independent \nforecasts concerning economic growth and noted that the assumptions \nused are within a reasonable range. \nWe have also assessed the discount rate (weighted average cost of \ncapital (“WACC”)) against comparable businesses and noted that the \nassumptions used are within a reasonable range. \nWe have also evaluated the management’s assessment of how the \ngroup’s calculation models are affected by changes in assumptions and \ncompared this with the information presented in the annual report related \nto impairment tests. \nWith regard to the sale, we have read the agreement and assessed the \naccounting effects and checked the minority’s share of equity.\nKey audit matter\nHow our audit considered the key audit matter\nInventories \nReference to notes 7 and 34. \nDuni has significant inventories of finished goods primarily in its distribution \nunits. Inventories total substantial amounts and the valuation includes \ncomplex assessments and estimates that can affect the inventory value. As \ndescribed, among other things, in the management report and in note 34, \nDuni is affected by the volatile prices of input materials and trade goods that \ncharacterized 2022, above all shipping and energy prices. The uncertainty in \nthe supply chains has also meant that Duni has increased its safety stocks. \nDuni’s inventory consists of both self-produced products and purchased \nproducts. The complexity in the valuation of stock mainly concerns the \nin-house manufactured products. When determining product calculations, \nthere are a number of trade-offs that need to be made by the company \nmanagement that have an impact on the reported values, among other \nthings, regarding exchange rates, raw material prices and allocation keys for \nother direct and indirect costs. Duni has an established process to ensure \nthat the inventory is correctly valued according to FIFO in the external \nreporting. For finished goods, an assessment needs to be made of whether \nthe products have been exposed to obsolescence and how salable they are.\nIn our audit, we have, among other things, assessed book price differ-\nences to assess how much, if any, should be allocated to inventory. \nWe have taken note of, and audited, the calculation that Duni prepares \nto adjust the inventory value to reflect a correct FIFO valuation. \nWe have also randomly tested the inventory of raw material against \nactual purchase prices, evaluated the reasonableness of product estimates \nfor work in progress and finished goods stocks. \nWe have participated in inventories at a selection of Duni’s warehouse \nlocations. \nWe have taken note of the company’s supervisory controls on slow \nmoving-items and assessments of obsolescence and net sales prices. \nWe have challenged the management’s assessments regarding the \nitems that have a higher turnover rate than normal. \nWe have checked the obsolescence model that was used. \nWe have finally tested the relevant disclosures in the annual report \nagainst accounting and other accounting information.\nKey audit matter\nHow our audit considered the key audit matter\nDiscounts, customer bonuses and returns\nReference to note 2 and note 26 in the annual report. \nThe group sells goods with conditions which mean that customers are con-\ntractually entitled to discounts, volume-based bonuses or the right to return \npurchased goods under certain circumstances. These contractual conditions \nresult in reduced turnover at the same time as a commitment is reported \nin the form of a reserve for the bonuses that have not yet been paid out or \nwhere the group judges that returns cannot be ruled out. The reserves are \nreported as an accrued cost and amount to SEK 257 million. As accounting \nfor these reserves involves more or less complex calculations and includes \nmanagement’s assessments, reserves for these commitments have been a \nfocus area in our audit.\nWe have taken note of the management’s calculations regarding the \nunderlying sales to assess the size of the provision. Where applicable, ­ \nwe have also compared management’s assessment against underlying \ncustomer contact, historical sales patterns, discount and return levels. \nWe have also assessed the management’s assumption by compar-\ning the accuracy of historical assessments of the size of the provision \nagainst historical outcomes in order evaluate the precision of this year’s \nassessment. \nWhere applicable, we have checked the year’s reservation against sub-\nsequent payments or returns. \nWe have checked and verified the mathematical calculation model used \nthrough control calculations."

We have nothing to \nreport in this regard.\nResponsibilities of the Board of Director’s and the Managing Director\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible \nfor the preparation of the annual accounts and consolidated \naccounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with \nthe Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated \naccounts, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.

This description is part of \nthe auditor’s report.\nThe auditor’s examination of the ESEF report\nOpinion\nIn addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated \naccounts, we have also examined that the Board of Directors and \nthe Managing Director have prepared the annual accounts and con-\nsolidated accounts in a format that enables uniform electronic \nreporting (the Esef report) pursuant to Chapter 16, Section 4 a of \nthe Swedish Securities Market Act (2007:528) for Duni AB (publ) for \nthe financial year 2022. \nOur examination and our opinion relate only to the statutory \nrequirements. \nIn our opinion, the Esef report has been prepared in a format \nthat, in all material respects, enables uniform electronic reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nWe have performed the examination in accordance with FAR’s rec-\nommendation RevR 18 Examination of the Esef report. Our respon-\nsibility under this recommendation is described in more detail in the \nAuditors’ responsibility section. We are independent of Duni AB \n(publ) in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in \nSweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in \naccordance with these requirements. \nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and \nappropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nResponsibilities of the Board of Director’s and the Managing \nDirector\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible \nfor the preparation of the Esef report in accordance with the Chapter \n16, Section 4(a) of the Swedish Securities Market Act (2007:528), \nand for such internal control that the Board of Directors and the \nManaging Director determine is necessary to prepare the Esef report \nwithout material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.\nAuditor’s responsibility\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance whether the \nEsef report is in all material respects prepared in a format that \nmeets the requirements of Chapter 16, Section 4(a) of the Swedish \nSecurities Market Act (2007:528), based on the procedures \nperformed. \nRevR 18 requires us to plan and execute procedures to achieve \nreasonable assurance that the Esef report is prepared in a format \nthat meets these requirements. \nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it is not a \nguarantee that an engagement carried out according to RevR 18 \nand generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always \ndetect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can \narise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually \nor in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the \neconomic decisions of users taken on the basis of the Esef report. \nThe audit firm applies ISQC 1 Quality Control for Firms that Perform \nAudits and Reviews of Financial Statements, and other Assurance \nand Related Services Engagements and accordingly maintains a \ncomprehensive system of quality control, including documented \npolicies and procedures regarding compliance with professional \nethical requirements, professional standards and legal and regula-\ntory requirements.\nThe examination involves obtaining evidence, through various \nprocedures, that the Esef report has been prepared in a format that \nenables uniform electronic reporting of the annual accounts and \nconsolidated accounts. The procedures selected depend on the \nauditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material \nmisstatement in the report, whether due to fraud or error. In carry-\ning out this risk assessment, and in order to design procedures that \nare appropriate in the circumstances, the auditor considers those \nelements of internal control that are relevant to the preparation of \nthe Esef report by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director, \nbut not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effective-\nness of those internal controls. The examination also includes an \nevaluation of the appropriateness and reasonableness of assump-\ntions made by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director. \nThe procedures mainly include a validation that the Esef report \nhas been prepared in a valid XHTML format and a reconciliation of \nthe Esef report with the audited annual accounts and consolidated \naccounts.\nFurthermore, the procedures also include an assessment of \nwhether the consolidated statement of financial performance, \nfinancial position, changes in equity, cash flow and disclosures in \nthe Esef report has been marked with iXBRL in accordance with \nwhat follows from the Esef regulation.\nThe auditor’s examination of the corporate governance statement\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for that the corporate gover-\nnance statement on pages 75-84 has been prepared in accordance \nwith the Annual Accounts Act.\nOur examination of the corporate governance statement is con-\nducted in accordance with FAR’s auditing standard RevR 16 The \nauditor’s examination of the corporate governance statement. This \nmeans that our examination of the corporate governance statement \nis different and substantially less in scope than an audit conducted \nin accordance with International Standards on Auditing and gener-\nally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. We believe that the \nexamination has provided us with sufficient basis for our opinions.\nA corporate governance statement has been prepared. Disclo-\nsures in accordance with chapter 6 section 6 the second paragraph \npoints 2-6 of the Annual Accounts Act and chapter 7 section 31 the \nsecond paragraph the same law are consistent with the other parts \nof the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and are in accor-\ndance with the Annual Accounts Act.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers AB, Box 4009, 203 11 Malmö, was \nappointed auditor of Duni AB (publ) by the general meeting of the \nshareholders on 17 May 2022 and has been the company’s auditor \nsince 1 November 2007.\nOn April 20, 2023, as indicated by electronic signing\nPricewaterhouseCoopers AB\nCarl Fogelberg\nAuthorized Public Accountant"

Further instructions will \nbe given in the notice of the Annual General \nMeeting.\nDividend\nThe Board proposes to the Annual General \nMeeting that a dividend of SEK 3.00 (0) per \nshare be adopted, corresponding to SEK \n141 million (0). The Board believes that the \nDuni Group has recovered well after the \npandemic. The divestment of 25% of the \nshares in BioPak Pty Ltd further strengthens \nthe balance sheet. Despite better condi-\ntions, there is uncertainty in the world at \nlarge and continued volatility in demand. \nThe assessment is that the Group has a \nsound financial position and future competi-\ntiveness that allows a dividend equivalent \nto SEK 141 million, which is equivalent to \n70% of income after tax. The Board believes \nthat even after the proposed dividend, the \nGroup will still be able to meet its obliga-\ntions and complete planned investments. \nThe Board proposes that the dividend be \ndispersed in two partial payments to bal-\nance cash flows with the Group’s seasonal \nfluctuations. The Board proposed May 19, \n2023 as the record date for the first partial \npayment of SEK 1.50 and November 14, \n2023 as the record date for the second par-\ntial payment of SEK 1.50. \nDuni AB’s Nomination Committee\nThe Nomination Committee is composed \nas follows:\nThomas Gustafsson, Chairman of the Board \nof Duni AB\nJohan Andersson, Mellby Gård AB, Chairman \nof the Nomination Committee\nHans Hedström, Carnegie fonder\n \nBernard R.
