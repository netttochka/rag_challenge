This has led to working from home arrangements being implemented across \nthe Group. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak and the working from home arrangements, the Group has experienced the \nfollowing impacts:\n \n●\nthe timing of regular compliance and advisory work being completed has been impacted or delayed where the operating \nbusinesses have had to prioritise assisting COVID-19 impacted clients with applying for government grants; and\n●\nthe fees charged in relation to assisting COVID-19 impacted clients with applying for government grants are lower and \nless profitable for the reasons of supporting our clients.\n \nDuring the COVID-19 outbreak, various operating businesses of the Group satisfied the criteria for JobSaver and the Group \nreceived in total $1,348,189 of COVID-19 government grants. As at 30 June 2022, the JobSaver program has ended. The \nGroup views the government grants received to be one-off non-recurring in nature and has deducted such income from its \nunderlying results for the purposes of looking through the true underlying performance of the business.\n \nIrrespective of the above, the Group continues to grow and operate profitably. The Group continues to monitor the potential \nimpacts and risks posed by the pandemic and focuses heavily on protecting the physical and mental health of its people.\n \nQuality shareholders\nDuring the first half of FY22 the Group continued its Quality Shareholders initiative and was pleased to have William \nThorndike (author of 'The Outsiders : Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success') and \nLawrence Cunningham (author of 'The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America' and now a Non-Executive \nIndependent Director of the Company from 1 July 2022) speak at our 2021 Annual General Meeting. The Group extends its \nthanks and appreciation to William and Lawrence for their contributions to cultivating the Group’s quality shareholder \nbase. The Group firmly believes that attracting Quality Shareholders, who view themselves as part owners of the business \nand are willing to invest a meaningful amount of their wealth for a very long time, is critical in achieving the Group’s long-\nterm strategy and vision.\n \nFinancial performance\nAcquisitions and integration\nDuring FY22, the Group has completed acquisitions with estimated total annual revenues in the range of $11.7m to \n$15.2m. Further, the Group has completed one acquisition in July 2022 with estimated total annual revenues in the range of \n$3.4m to $4.2m. In aggregate the Group has completed eight acquisitions with estimated total annual revenues in the range \nof $15.1m to $19.4m, representing 30.9% to 39.7% of FY21 revenue.

During the year, the Group commenced \nbusinesses in three new locations in Newcastle, NSW (Jul-21), Canberra, ACT (Dec-21) and Bendigo, VIC (Apr-22). All of \nthe new office openings were a result of acquisitions of local accounting firms that were completed during the year. We are \npleased that 10 of our 19 offices now qualify as a top 100 accounting firm in their own right, commanding dominant market \npositions in their respective regions. During the year, 6 of our offices underwent or are currently undergoing fitout \nupgrades. Over the last 2 years, the Group has progressively upgraded the fitouts for each of its 19 offices in order to build \na consistent brand and office experience for its people and its clients.\n \nAs at 30 June 2022, the total number of equity partners (including the CEO, Brett Kelly) was 62 (30 June 2021: 54) with two \npartners promoted internally, and eight partners joining the group from completed acquisitions. Post balance date, four \npartners joined the group from the Hunter Region acquisition, taking the total number of equity partners to 66. The Group \ncontinues its focus in admitting and recruiting new partners as part of its strategy to retain and motivate key talents and to \ndrive revenue growth.\n \nProperties\nOn 20 December 2021, Kelly Partners (Canberra) Property Trust, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kelly Partners Group Holdings \nLimited, purchased a 100% interest in a commercial property located in Kingston ACT for a total consideration of $2.2m. Kelly \nPartners Canberra has operated from these premises since April 2022, having completed the acquisitions of two Canberra \naccounting firms in December 2021 and February 2022. The office is located in a prime location on the Kingston foreshore \nand will assist the business in building a presence in Canberra.\n \nAs detailed in previous commentary, the Group continues to pursue a strategy of removing properties off balance \nsheet. Nonetheless, the Group still believes that the properties from which its business operate should be owned in a \nseparate structure in which our operating partners can own a share. The Group is currently in the process of considering and \nestablishing such structures to own the properties.\n \nRevenue\nRevenue for FY22 increased 32.6% to $64,862,110 (FY21: $48,906,446).

This is due to higher cost \nof sales and administration staff costs from in year acquisitions and additional team members recruited in the parent entity’s \ncentral progress team to support the Group’s growth. In many of the in year acquisitions, the outgoing vendor also receives \na consulting fee for the first 1-2 years post completion to ensure a successful transition of their business and clients to \nKelly+Partners.

This cost is not expected to recur post the \nexpiration of the existing lease in October 2022, and hence has been excluded from underlying results.\n(4)\n$86,381 in redundancy costs relating to restructuring of acquired businesses and other non-recurring expenses.\n \nThe Group classifies costs related to acquiring businesses under non-recurring and one-off items on the basis that those \nspecific acquisition costs (related to specific businesses acquired) will not re-occur in future periods whilst their associated \nrevenues and earnings are expected to continue into future periods. As part of its growth strategy, management continue to \nidentify acquisition targets and any future acquisition expenses are expected to be accompanied by future revenues and \nearnings associated with those expenses. The separate classification of acquisition costs into non-recurring and one-off \nitems provides transparency to look-through to the underlying performance of the Group.\n \nDepreciation and amortisation and finance costs\nDepreciation and Amortisation expense increased to $6,330,126 (FY21: $4,427,456) and includes depreciation expense of \n$3,968,067 (FY21: $3,352,706) and amortisation expense of $2,362,059 (FY21: $1,074,750). The increase in depreciation \nexpenses is due to the recent fitout upgrades as well as an increase number of leases (leading to higher number of 'right-of-\nuse assets' that need to be depreciated). The increase in amortisation expense is due to recent acquisitions completed \ncreating customer relationship intangible assets that are amortised in accordance with Australian accounting standards.\n \nFinance costs increased to $2,038,179 (FY21: $1,550,839). Finance costs include interest on lease liabilities recognised \nunder AASB 16 and the increase is due to new property leases that the Group has entered into as part of acquiring \nbusinesses in new locations.\n \nIncome tax expense\n \n       \n       2022             2021       \nNet profit before income tax from continuing operations\n$16,421,310\n$12,909,139\n% Growth\n     27.2%\n     11.6%\nIncome tax expense\n $3,092,565\n $1,963,663\n% of net profit\n     18.8%\n     15.2%\n \nThe Group’s Income Tax Expense has increased to $3,092,565 (FY21: $1,963,663), mainly due to an increase in taxable \nincome and an increase in the applicable tax rates. The Group’s revenue for FY22 is greater than $50m, resulting in the \nGroup no longer being eligible as a 'base rate entity'. This has led to an increase in the tax rates to 30% (from 26% in FY21), \nsuch that the proportionate increase in the Income Tax Expense is much higher than the increase in Net Profit Before \nTax. Note that, as the majority of businesses are structured as partnerships, the income tax expense attributable to the \noutside interests in these partnerships is not included in the consolidated accounts and therefore the actual tax expense is \nbelow the applicable tax rate.\n \nCash flow\nCash from operations\nReceipts from customers increased 23.9% to $66,092,248 (FY21: $53,359,426). Payments to suppliers and employees \nincreased 28.8% to $47,559,811 (FY21: $36,939,488).

Of this, $2,093,275 was used to \nacquire a commercial property in Canberra now occupied by the Kelly Partners Canberra operating business. Amounts \ntotalling $4,009,103 was used in fitout upgrades completed in the Oran Park, Hunter Region, North Sydney, Western Sydney, \nCanberra and Melbourne offices. Over the last 2 years, the Group has progressively upgraded the fitouts for each of its 19 \noffices in order to build a consistent brand and office experience for its people and its clients. The remaining $695,012 \nrepresents office and computer equipment, new motor vehicles and other capital expenditures.\n \nCash from financing activities\nIn FY22 the Group’s borrowings (excluding overdrafts considered as working capital) increased significantly by $15,867,226 \nor 96.1% to $32,372,077 (30 June 2021: $16,504,851). New borrowings of $23,406,865 were taken out during the year, \nmainly for the completion of in year acquisitions. The difference reflects the repayments made during the year of $7,539,639 \nand reflects the Group’s strong and disciplined approach in repaying debt, compared to $6,426,892 in the prior period, \nrepresenting an increase of 17.3%. Proceeds from borrowings of $23,406,865 included $13,980,301 for acquisition funding, \n$2,200,000 for the purchase of the Canberra property, $3,405,946 for fitout funding, $1,937,847 for recapitalisation loans, \n$601,002 relating to the buy in by two new partners and the remaining $1,281,771 for insurance premium funding, motor \nvehicle financing and other uses.\n \nWorking capital\nThe Group continues to maintain a disciplined approach to managing its lockup (defined as trade receivables and accrued \nincome less contract liabilities), with lockup of 55.8 days or $11,622,743 (calculated on run rate revenue with annualised \nrevenue contributions from completed acquisitions) compared with the prior year (30 June 2021: 51.1 days, $6,841,427). \n \nThis continues to be a strong result and has been achieved alongside strong acquisition and organic growth. Note that lockup \ncalculated on actual revenue (which is used to calculate lockup) does not include the full 12 months’ revenue of the in-year \nacquisitions. For the purposes of achieving a more meaningful comparison, the lockup based on annualised revenue has \nbeen used.\n \n       2022\n       2021\nLockup $\n$11,622,743\n$6,841,427\nLock up days\n    55.8\n    51.1\nDebtor\n$9,904,836\n$6,204,659\nDebtor days\n    47.6\n    46.3\nAccrued income and contract liabilities\n$1,717,907\n$636,768\nAccrued income and contract liabilities days\n       8.3\n       4.8\n \nCapital structure\nThe business continues to maintain a capital structure that supports its accelerated growth. As at 30 June 2022 the Group’s \nGearing Ratio (defined as Net Debt / Underlying EBITDA) increased to 1.36x (2021: 0.84x) mainly as a result of debt taken \nout to complete the acquisitions. The Group does not view the increased gearing ratio as a risk given acquisition debt is \namortized and repaid through profits generated from the acquired business and is expected to be repaid in full over a 4-5 \nyear term. Net Debt is a non-IFRS measure and means Total Borrowings less Cash and Cash Equivalents. \n \n       2022\n       2021\nGearing Ratio (Net Debt / Underlying EBITDA)\n      1.36x\n      0.84x"

      "text": "Kelly Partners Group Holdings Limited\nDirectors' report\n30 June 2022\n \n \n18\nPrinciples used to determine the nature and amount of remuneration\nThe objective of the Group's executive reward framework is to ensure reward for performance is competitive and appropriate \nfor the results delivered. The framework aligns executive reward with the achievement of strategic objectives and the creation \nof value for shareholders, and it is considered to conform to the market best practice for the delivery of reward. The Board \nof Directors ('the Board') ensures that executive reward satisfies the following key criteria for good reward governance \npractices:\n●\ncompetitiveness and reasonableness;\n●\nacceptability to shareholders;\n●\nperformance linkage / alignment of executive compensation; and\n●\ntransparency.\n \nThe Nomination and Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining and reviewing remuneration arrangements for \nits directors and executives. The performance of the Group depends on the quality of its directors and executives. The \nremuneration philosophy is to attract, motivate and retain high performance and high quality personnel.\n \nThe reward framework is designed to align executive reward to shareholders' interests. The Board has considered that it \nshould seek to enhance shareholders' interests by:\n●\nhaving economic profit as a core component of plan design;\n●\nfocusing on sustained growth in shareholder wealth, consisting of dividends and growth in share price, and delivering \nconstant or increasing return on assets as well as focusing the executive on key non-financial drivers of value; and\n●\nattracting and retaining high calibre executives.\n \nAdditionally, the reward framework should seek to enhance executives' interests by:\n●\nrewarding capability and experience;\n●\nreflecting competitive reward for contribution to growth in shareholder wealth; and\n●\nproviding a clear structure for earning rewards.\n \nIn accordance with best practice corporate governance, the structure of non-executive director and executive director \nremuneration is separate.\n \nNon-executive directors' remuneration\nFees and payments to non-executive directors reflect the demands and responsibilities of their role. Non-executive directors' \nfees and payments are reviewed annually by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. The Nomination and \nRemuneration Committee may, from time to time, receive advice from independent remuneration consultants to ensure non-\nexecutive directors' fees and payments are appropriate and in line with the market.\n \nASX listing rules require the aggregate non-executive directors' remuneration be determined periodically by a general \nmeeting. A maximum annual aggregate remuneration of $160,000 is currently in place.\n \nExecutive remuneration\nThe Group aims to reward executives based on their position and responsibility, with a level and mix of remuneration which \nhas both fixed and variable components.\n \nThe executive remuneration and reward framework has four components:\n●\nbase pay and non-monetary benefits;\n●\nshort-term performance incentives;\n●\nshare-based payments; and\n●\nother remuneration such as superannuation and long service leave.\n \nThe combination of these comprises the executive's total remuneration.\n \nFixed remuneration, consisting of base salary, superannuation and non-monetary benefits, are reviewed annually by the \nNomination and Remuneration Committee based on individual and business unit performance, the overall performance of \nthe Group and comparable market remunerations.\n \nExecutives may receive their fixed remuneration in the form of cash or other benefits (for example motor vehicle benefits) \nwhere it does not create any additional costs to the Group and provides additional value to the executive."

The EIP is designed to assist in the attraction, \nmotivation, retention and reward of employees by allowing them to participate in the overall success and growth of the Group. \nThe EIP is also designed to align the interests of employees with the interests of shareholders by providing an opportunity \nfor the participants to receive an equity interest in the Company. In FY2022 the EIP Trust purchased 190,023 shares on \nmarket for a total of $797,963 with an average share price of $4.04.

The Board was satisfied that the \nremuneration recommendation received was free from undue influence by members of the KMP to whom the \nrecommendation relates, because of strict protocols observed and complied with regarding any interaction between GRG \nand management, and because all remuneration advice was provided to the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.

General information\n \nThe financial statements cover Kelly Partners Group Holdings Limited (the 'Company' or 'parent entity') and its controlled \nentities as a consolidated entity consisting of Kelly Partners Group Holdings Limited and the entities (the 'Group') it controlled \nat the end of, or during, the year. The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is Kelly Partners Group \nHoldings Limited and its controlled entities functional and presentation currency.\n \nKelly Partners Group Holdings Limited is a listed public company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in Australia. \nIts registered office and principal place of business is:\n \nLevel 8, 32 Walker Street\nNorth Sydney\nNSW 2060\n \nA description of the nature of the Group's operations and its principal activities are included in the directors' report, which is \nnot part of the financial statements.\n \nThe financial statements were authorised for issue, in accordance with a resolution of directors, on 1 August 2022. The \ndirectors have the power to amend and reissue the financial statements.\n \nNote 2. Significant accounting policies\n \nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. These policies \nhave been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n \nNew or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations adopted\nThe Group has adopted all of the new or amended Accounting Standards, amendments and Interpretations issued by the \nAustralian Accounting Standards Board ('AASB') that are mandatory for the current reporting period.\n \nAny new or amended Accounting Standards, amendments or Interpretations that are not yet mandatory have not been early \nadopted.\n \nBasis of preparation\nThese general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and \nInterpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board ('AASB') and the Corporations Act 2001, as appropriate \nfor for-profit oriented entities. These financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards as \nissued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB').\n \nHistorical cost convention\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain financial assets and \nfinancial liabilities at fair value.\n \nCritical accounting estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires \nmanagement to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a \nhigher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial \nstatements, are disclosed in note 3.\n \nParent entity information\nIn accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, these financial statements present the results of the Group only. \nSupplementary information about the parent entity is disclosed in note 36.\n \nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of Kelly Partners Group \nHoldings Limited as at 30 June 2022 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended.\n \nSubsidiaries are all those entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed \nto, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its \npower to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to \nthe Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases."

      "text": "Kelly Partners Group Holdings Limited\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n30 June 2022\n \nNote 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)\n \n \n33\nIntercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between entities in the Group are eliminated. \nUnrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. \nAccounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by \nthe Group.\n \nThe acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. A change in ownership interest, \nwithout the loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction, where the difference between the consideration \ntransferred and the book value of the share of the non-controlling interests acquired is recognised directly in equity \nattributable to the parent.\n \nNon-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the statement of profit or loss and \nother comprehensive income, statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the Group. Losses \nincurred by the Group are attributed to the non-controlling interests in full, even if that results in a deficit balance.\n \nWhere the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets including goodwill, liabilities and non-controlling \ninterests in the subsidiary together with any cumulative translation differences recognised in equity. The Group recognises \nthe fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any investment retained together with any gain or loss in \nprofit or loss.\n \nOperating segments\nOperating segments are presented using the 'management approach', where the information presented is on the same basis \nas the internal reports provided to the Chief Operating Decision Makers ('CODM'). The CODM is responsible for the allocation \nof resources to operating segments and assessing their performance.\n \nForeign currency translation\nForeign currency transactions\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the entity's functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the \ndates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from \nthe translation at financial year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are \nrecognised in profit or loss.\n \nForeign operations\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates at the reporting \ndate. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the average exchange \nrates, which approximate the rates at the dates of the transactions, for the period. All resulting foreign exchange differences \nare recognised in other comprehensive income through the foreign currency reserve in equity.\n \nThe foreign currency reserve is recognised in profit or loss when the foreign operation or net investment is disposed of.\n \nRevenue recognition\nThe Group recognises revenue as follows:\n \nRevenue from contracts with customers\nRevenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group is expected to be entitled in exchange \nfor transferring goods or services to a customer. For each contract with a customer, the Group: identifies the contract with a \ncustomer; identifies the performance obligations in the contract; determines the transaction price which takes into account \nestimates of variable consideration and the time value of money; allocates the transaction price to the separate performance \nobligations on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service to be delivered; and \nrecognises revenue when or as each performance obligation is satisfied in a manner that depicts the transfer to the customer \nof the goods or services promised."

      "text": "Kelly Partners Group Holdings Limited\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n30 June 2022\n \nNote 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)\n \n \n34\nVariable consideration within the transaction price, if any, reflects concessions provided to the customer such as discounts \nand refunds, any potential bonuses receivable from the customer and any other contingent events. Such estimates are \ndetermined using either the 'expected value' or 'most likely amount' method. The measurement of variable consideration is \nsubject to a constraining principle whereby revenue will only be recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a \nsignificant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur. The measurement constraint continues \nuntil the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Amounts received that are subject \nto the constraining principle are initially recognised as deferred revenue in the form of a separate refund liability.\n \nProvision of services\nRevenue from a contract to provide services is recognised over time as the services are rendered based on either a fixed \nprice or an hourly rate.\n \nCommissions and other income\nCommissions and other income is recognised when it is received or when the right to receive the payment is established.\n \nGovernment grants\nGrants from the government are recognised at their fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be \nreceived and the Group will comply with all attached conditions. Government grants relating to costs are deferred and \nrecognised in profit or loss over the period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate.\n \nIncome tax\nThe income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable on that period's taxable income based on the applicable \nincome tax rate for each jurisdiction, adjusted by the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary \ndifferences, unused tax losses and the adjustment recognised for prior periods, where applicable.\n \nAn income tax benefit will arise for the financial year where an income tax loss is incurred and, where permitted to do so, is \ncarried-back against a qualifying prior period's tax payable to generate a refundable tax offset.\n \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to be applied when the \nassets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted, except for:\n●\nwhen the deferred income tax asset or liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a \ntransaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor\ntaxable profits; or\n●\nwhen the taxable temporary difference is associated with interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, and the \ntiming of the reversal can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable\nfuture.\n \nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that \nfuture taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.\n \nThe carrying amount of recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date. Deferred tax \nassets recognised are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that future taxable profits will be available for the \ncarrying amount to be recovered. Previously unrecognised deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable \nthat there are future taxable profits available to recover the asset.\n \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against \ncurrent tax liabilities and deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities; and they relate to the same taxable authority on \neither the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend to settle simultaneously.\n \nKelly Partners Group Holdings Limited (the 'head entity') and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries have formed an income \ntax consolidated group under the tax consolidation regime. The head entity and each subsidiary in the tax consolidated group \ncontinue to account for their own current and deferred tax amounts. The tax consolidated group has applied the 'separate \ntaxpayer within group' approach in determining the appropriate amount of taxes to allocate to members of the tax \nconsolidated group.\n \nIn addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, the head entity also recognises the current tax liabilities (or assets) \nand the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from each subsidiary in the tax \nconsolidated group."

Significant accounting policies (continued)\n \n \n35\nAssets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are recognised as amounts \nreceivable from or payable to other entities in the tax consolidated group. The tax funding arrangement ensures that the \nintercompany charge equals the current tax liability or benefit of each tax consolidated group member, resulting in neither a \ncontribution by the head entity to the subsidiaries nor a distribution by the subsidiaries to the head entity.\n \nDiscontinued operations\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and that \nrepresents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to \ndispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The \nresults of discontinued operations are presented separately on the face of the statement of profit or loss and other \ncomprehensive income.\n \nCurrent and non-current classification\nAssets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position based on current and non-current classification.\n \nAn asset is classified as current when: it is either expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the Group's \nnormal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is expected to be realised within 12 months after the \nreporting period; or the asset is cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability \nfor at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other assets are classified as non-current.\n \nA liability is classified as current when: it is either expected to be settled in the Group's normal operating cycle; it is held \nprimarily for the purpose of trading; it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period; or there is no \nunconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other liabilities \nare classified as non-current.\n \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current.\n \nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other short-term, highly \nliquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and \nwhich are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the statement of cash flows presentation purposes, cash \nand cash equivalents also includes bank overdrafts, which are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the statement \nof financial position.\n \nTrade and other receivables\nTrade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective \ninterest method, less any allowance for expected credit losses. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement \nimmediately.\n \nThe Group has applied the simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which uses a lifetime expected loss \nallowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on days overdue.\n \nAccrued income and contract liabilities\nAn accrued income asset arises where the Group has performed by transferring goods or services to a customer prior to the \nreceipt of consideration from the customer or prior to payment becoming due and represents the Group's right to \nconsideration for the transferred good or service.\n \nContract liabilities represent the Group's obligation to transfer services to a customer and are recognised when a customer \npays consideration, or when the Group recognises a receivable to reflect its unconditional right to consideration (whichever \nis earlier) before the Group has transferred the services to the customer.\n \nWhen a customer pays in advance, the amount received by the Group is recognised as a contract liability until the service \nhas been provided to the customer.\n \nProperty, plant and equipment\nPlant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes \nexpenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items."

Significant accounting policies (continued)\n \n \n36\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write off the net cost of each item of property, plant and equipment over \ntheir expected useful lives as follows:\n \nBuildings\n40 years\nLeasehold improvements\n3-10 years\nPlant and equipment\n3-7 years\nMotor vehicles\n8 years\n \nThe residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.\n \nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the assets, \nwhichever is shorter.\n \nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when there is no future economic benefit to the \nGroup. Gains and losses between the carrying amount and the disposal proceeds are taken to profit or loss.\n \nRight-of-use assets\nA right-of-use asset is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which \ncomprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the \ncommencement date net of any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred, and, except where included in the \ncost of inventories, an estimate of costs expected to be incurred for dismantling and removing the underlying asset, and \nrestoring the site or asset.\n \nRight-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful \nlife of the asset, whichever is the shorter. Where the Group expects to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the \nlease term, the depreciation is over its estimated useful life. Right-of use assets are subject to impairment or adjusted for \nany remeasurement of lease liabilities.\n \nThe Group has elected not to recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with terms \nof 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Lease payments on these assets are expensed to profit or loss as \nincurred.\n \nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets acquired as part of a business combination, other than goodwill, are initially measured at their fair value at \nthe date of the acquisition. Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognised at cost. Indefinite life intangible \nassets are not amortised and are subsequently measured at cost less any impairment. Finite life intangible assets are \nsubsequently measured at cost less amortisation and any impairment. The gains or losses recognised in profit or loss arising \nfrom the derecognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying \namount of the intangible asset. The method and useful lives of finite life intangible assets are reviewed annually. Changes in \nthe expected pattern of consumption or useful life are accounted for prospectively by changing the amortisation method or \nperiod.\n \nGoodwill\nGoodwill arises on the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is not amortised. Instead, goodwill is tested annually for impairment, \nor more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and is carried at cost less \naccumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are taken to profit or loss and are not subsequently reversed.\n \nBrand names and intellectual property\nBrand names and intellectual property have indefinite useful lives and are not amortised.\n \nCustomer relationships\nCustomer contracts acquired in a business combination are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of their \nexpected benefit, being their finite life of 3 to 7 years.\n \nSoftware - Computer software\nSignificant costs associated with computer software are deferred and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of \ntheir expected benefit, being their finite life of 3 years."

Significant accounting policies (continued)\n \n \n37\nImpairment of non-financial assets\nGoodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually \nfor impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Other non-\nfinancial assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount \nmay not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its \nrecoverable amount.\n \nRecoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. The value-in-use is the \npresent value of the estimated future cash flows relating to the asset using a pre-tax discount rate specific to the asset or \ncash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Assets that do not have independent cash flows are grouped together to \nform a cash-generating unit.\n \nTrade and other payables\nTrade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial \nyear and which are unpaid. Due to their short-term nature they are measured at amortised cost and are not discounted. The \namounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.\n \nBorrowings\nLoans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of transaction costs. They \nare subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n \nWhere there is an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date, the \nloans and borrowings are classified as non-current.\n \nBorrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or \nexpired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to \nanother party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in \nprofit or loss as other income or finance costs.\n \nLease liabilities\nA lease liability is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The lease liability is initially recognised at the present \nvalue of the lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate. \nLease payments comprise of fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on \nan index or a rate, amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option when \nthe exercise of the option is reasonably certain to occur, and any anticipated termination penalties.\n \nThe variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. \nVariable lease payments include rent concessions in the form of rent forgiveness or a waiver as a direct consequence of \nCOVID-19 and which relate to payments originally due on or before 30 June 2022.\n \nLease liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amounts are remeasured \nif there is a change in the following: future lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate used; residual \nguarantee; lease term; certainty of a purchase option and termination penalties. When a lease liability is remeasured, an \nadjustment is made to the corresponding right-of use asset, or to profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset \nis fully written down.\n \nGroup as a lessor\nWhen the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for the head lease and the sublease as two separate contracts. The \nsublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.\n \nLeases in which the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of an asset are \nclassified as a finance lease, where the asset is recognised on the statement of financial position and presented as a lease \nreceivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. The interest rate implicit in the lease is used to measure \nthe net investment in the lease. Initial direct costs are included in the initial measurement of the net investment in the lease.\n \nFinance costs\nAll finance costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred."

Significant accounting policies (continued)\n \n \n38\nProvisions\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present (legal or constructive) obligation as a result of a past event, it is \nprobable the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the \nobligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present \nobligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. If the time value of \nmoney is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate specific to the liability. The increase in the provision \nresulting from the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.\n \nEmployee benefits\n \nShort-term employee benefits\nLiabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and long service leave expected to be \nsettled wholly within 12 months of the reporting date are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities \nare settled.\n \nOther long-term employee benefits\nThe liability for annual leave and long service leave not expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are \nmeasured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to \nthe reporting date. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and \nperiods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on high quality \ncorporate bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.\n \nEquity-settled compensation\nEquity-settled compensation benefits are provided to employees.\n \nEquity-settled transactions are awards of shares, or options over shares, that are provided to employees in exchange for the \nrendering of services.\n \nThe cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting \nperiod. The cumulative charge to profit or loss is calculated based on the grant date fair value of the award, the best estimate \nof the number of awards that are likely to vest and the expired portion of the vesting period.\n \nFair value measurement\nWhen an asset or liability, financial or non-financial, is measured at fair value for recognition or disclosure purposes, the fair \nvalue is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction \nbetween market participants at the measurement date; and assumes that the transaction will take place either: in the principal \nmarket; or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market.\n \nFair value is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming \nthey act in their economic best interests. For non-financial assets, the fair value measurement is based on its highest and \nbest use. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value are those that are appropriate in the circumstances and which \nmaximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.\n \nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified into three levels, using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the \nsignificance of the inputs used in making the measurements. Classifications are reviewed at each reporting date and transfers \nbetween levels are determined based on a reassessment of the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value \nmeasurement.\n \nFor recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements, external valuers may be used when internal expertise is either not \navailable or when the valuation is deemed to be significant. External valuers are selected based on market knowledge and \nreputation. Where there is a significant change in fair value of an asset or liability from one period to another, an analysis is \nundertaken, which includes a verification of the major inputs applied in the latest valuation and a comparison, where \napplicable, with external sources of data.\n \nIssued capital\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity."

Significant accounting policies (continued)\n \n \n39\nIncremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, \nfrom the proceeds.\n \nShare buy-back\nWhere any group company purchases the Company’s equity instruments, for example as the result of a share buy-back or \na share-based payment plan, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income \ntaxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of Kelly Partners Group Holdings Limited as treasury shares until \nthe shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, \nnet of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity \nattributable to the owners of Kelly Partners Group Holdings Limited.\n \nDividends\nProvision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of \nthe Company, on or before the end of the financial year but not distributed at the reporting date.\n \nBusiness combinations\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations regardless of whether equity instruments \nor other assets are acquired.\n \nThe consideration transferred is the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred, equity instruments \nissued or liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree and the amount of any non-controlling interests \nin the acquiree. For each business combination, the non-controlling interests in the acquiree is measured at either fair value \nor at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred to profit \nor loss.\n \nOn the acquisition of a business, the Group assesses the financial assets acquired and liabilities assumed for appropriate \nclassification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic conditions, the Group's operating or \naccounting policies and other pertinent conditions in existence at the acquisition-date.\n \nWhere the business combination is achieved in stages, the Group remeasures its previously held equity interest in the \nacquiree at the acquisition-date fair value and the difference between the fair value and the previous carrying amount is \nrecognised in profit or loss.\n \nContingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at the acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent \nchanges in the fair value of the contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability is recognised in profit or loss. \nContingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.\n \nThe difference between the acquisition-date fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling \ninterests in the acquiree and the fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of any pre-existing investment \nin the acquiree is recognised as goodwill. If the consideration transferred and the pre-existing fair value is less than the fair \nvalue of the identifiable net assets acquired, being a bargain purchase to the acquirer, the difference is recognised as a gain \ndirectly in profit or loss by the acquirer on the acquisition-date, but only after a reassessment of the identification and \nmeasurement of the net assets acquired, the non-controlling interests in the acquiree, if any, the consideration transferred \nand the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquirer.\n \nBusiness combinations are initially accounted for on a provisional basis. The acquirer retrospectively adjusts the provisional \namounts recognised and also recognises additional assets or liabilities during the measurement period, based on new \ninformation obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition-date. The measurement period ends \non either the earlier of (i) 12 months from the date of the acquisition or (ii) when the acquirer receives all the information \npossible to determine fair value.\n \nEarnings per share\n \nBasic earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of Kelly Partners Group Holdings \nLimited, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary \nshares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the financial year."

Significant accounting policies (continued)\n \n \n40\nDiluted earnings per share\nDiluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the \nafter income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted \naverage number of shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.\n \nGoods and Services Tax ('GST') and other similar taxes\nRevenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred is not \nrecoverable from the tax authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of the acquisition of the asset or as part of \nthe expense.\n \nReceivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST \nrecoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority is included in other receivables or other payables in the statement of \nfinancial position.\n \nCash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities \nwhich are recoverable from, or payable to the tax authority, are presented as operating cash flows.\n \nCommitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority.\n \nNew Accounting Standards and Interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted\nAustralian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet mandatory, \nhave not been early adopted by the Group for the annual reporting period ended 30 June 2022. The Group has not yet \nassessed the impact of these new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations.\n \nNote 3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\n \nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that \naffect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Management continually evaluates its judgements and estimates in \nrelation to assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses. Management bases its judgements, estimates and \nassumptions on historical experience and on other various factors, including expectations of future events, management \nbelieves to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting judgements and estimates will seldom equal \nthe related actual results. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material \nadjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities (refer to the respective notes) within the next financial year are \ndiscussed below.\n \nCOVID-19\nJudgement has been exercised in considering the impacts that COVID-19 has had, or may have, on the Group based on \nknown information. This consideration extends to the nature of the products and services offered, customers, supply chain, \nstaffing and geographic regions in which the Group operates. Other than as addressed in specific notes, there does not \ncurrently appear to be either any significant impact upon the financial statements or any significant uncertainties with respect \nto events or conditions which may impact the Group unfavourably as at the reporting date or subsequently as a result of \nCOVID-19.\n \nAllowance for expected credit losses\nThe allowance for expected credit losses assessment requires a degree of estimation and judgement. It is based on the \nlifetime expected credit loss, grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and on days overdue, and makes \nassumptions to allocate an overall expected credit loss rate for each group. These assumptions include past default \nexperience of the debtor profile and an assessment of the historical loss rates.\n \nAccrued income\nAn accrued income asset arises where the Group has performed by transferring goods or services to a customer prior to the \nreceipt of consideration from the customer and represents the Group’s right to consideration for the transferred good or \nservice. While assessing the accrued income balance, a degree of estimation needs to be applied on its recoverability and \nthe assessment is primarily based on the Operating Business Owner’s professional judgement on the proportionate \ncompletion of the performance obligations in comparison to the transaction price stated in the contract ."

Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued)\n \n \n41\nGoodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets\nThe Group tests annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment, whether goodwill \nand other indefinite life intangible assets have suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in \nnote 2. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These \ncalculations require the use of assumptions, including estimated discount rates based on the current cost of capital and \ngrowth rates of the estimated future cash flows.\n \nLease term\nThe lease term is a significant component in the measurement of both the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Judgement \nis exercised in determining whether there is reasonable certainty that an option to extend the lease or purchase the underlying \nasset will be exercised, or an option to terminate the lease will not be exercised, when ascertaining the periods to be included \nin the lease term. In determining the lease term, all facts and circumstances that create an economical incentive to exercise \nan extension option, or not to exercise a termination option, are considered at the lease commencement date. Factors \nconsidered may include the importance of the asset to the Group's operations; comparison of terms and conditions to \nprevailing market rates; incurrence of significant penalties; existence of significant leasehold improvements; and the costs \nand disruption to replace the asset. The Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, \nor not exercise a termination option, if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances.\n \nIncremental borrowing rate\nWhere the interest rate implicit in a lease cannot be readily determined, an incremental borrowing rate is estimated to discount \nfuture lease payments to measure the present value of the lease liability at the lease commencement date. Such a rate is \nbased on what the Group estimates it would have to pay a third party to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a \nsimilar value to the right-of-use asset, with similar terms, security and economic environment.\n \nBusiness combinations\nAs discussed in note 2, business combinations are initially accounted for on a provisional basis. The fair value of assets \nacquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are initially estimated by the Group taking into consideration all \navailable information at the reporting date. Fair value adjustments on the finalisation of the business combination accounting \nis retrospective, where applicable, to the period the combination occurred and may have an impact on the assets and \nliabilities, depreciation and amortisation reported.\n \nNote 4. Operating segments\n \nThe Group is organised into two reportable segments: (1) Accounting and (2) Other services.\n \nThe principal products and services of each of these operating segments are as follows:\nAccounting\nAccounting and taxation services, corporate secretarial, outsourced CFO, audits, business \nstructuring, bookkeeping, and all other accounting related services.\nOther services\nFinancial broking services, wealth management, investment office and all other non-\naccounting services.\n \nThe operating segments are based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Board of Directors (who are \nidentified as the Chief Operating Decision Makers ('CODM')) in assessing performance and in determining the allocation of \nresources.\n \nThe CODM reviews EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation). The accounting policies adopted \nfor internal reporting to the CODM are consistent with those adopted in the financial statements."

Financial instruments\n \nFinancial risk management objectives\nThe Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks through its use of financial instruments: market risk (including interest \nrate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.\n \nThe Group‘s overall risk management plan seeks to minimise potential adverse effects due to the unpredictability of financial \nmarkets.\n \nThe Group does not use derivative financial instruments or speculate in financial assets.\n \nRisk management is carried out by senior management under policies approved by the Board of Directors ('the Board'). The \npolicies include identification and analysis of the risk exposure of the Group and appropriate procedures, controls and risk \nlimits. Management identifies and evaluates financial risks within the Group's businesses and reports to the Board on a \nregular basis.\n \nThe Group's financial instruments consist mainly of deposits with banks, accounts receivable and payable, bank loans and \noverdrafts, loans to and from subsidiaries, and leases.\n \nMarket risk\n \nPrice risk\nThe Group is not exposed to any significant market risk in relation to the prices it charges for the provision of professional \nservices.\n \nInterest rate risk\nThe Group is exposed to interest rate risk as funds are borrowed at floating and fixed rates. Borrowings issued at floating \nrates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.\n \nThe Group's policy is to minimise interest rate cash flow risk exposures on long-term financing. At the reporting date, \nthe Group is exposed to changes in market interest rates through its bank borrowings, which are subject to variable interest \nrates.\n \nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity on the net result for the year and equity to a reasonably possible change in \ninterest rates of 1% and -1% (2021: +1% and -1%), with effect from the beginning of the year. These changes are considered \nto be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.\n \nThe calculations are based on the financial instruments held at each reporting date.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date to recognised financial assets is the carrying amount, net \nof any provisions for impairment of those assets, as disclosed in the statement of financial position and notes to the financial \nstatements.
