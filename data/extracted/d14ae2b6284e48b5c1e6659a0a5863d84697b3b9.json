We also witnessed escalating freight, natural gas, packaging, \nchemical, and labour costs during the past year. Altogether, we \nestimate inflation raised our cost base by an additional $180 million \nin 2022. \nAccordingly, Adjusted EBITDA(1) declined to $116 million in 2022 as \nprice increases did not fully catch up to inflation until later into the \nyear, while cost management initiatives helped mitigate the impact. \nThese initiatives mainly consisted of reducing capital spending, \nlowering inventory levels, eliminating discretionary spending, and \nmaking productivity gains. In short, we adopted a multi-faceted \nstrategy to return to profitable growth in 2023.\nDino Bianco\nChief Executive Officer\nDear Shareholders,\nFiscal 2022 proved to be a year of recovery despite uncertain \nmarket conditions and persistent inflationary pressure. \nRevenue increased 15% year-over-year to $1.7 billion in 2022 \nmainly due to selling price increases across all segments \nand regions to counter higher pulp, manufacturing and \nfreight costs.\nMESSAGE\nTO SHAREHOLDERS\n(1)\t Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.

      "text": "2022 Annual Report\n4\nNETWORK MODERNIZATION\nDespite inflationary pressure, we continued to invest in our \nbusiness to drive long-term value in 2022. Production capacity at \nTAD Sherbrooke exceeded ramp-up plans. We recently deployed \nartificial intelligence (AI) at this site to maximize reliability and \nuptime. Digital twin tools have also been expanded to include our \nTAD paper machine.\nIn terms of our Sherbrooke Expansion Project, we anticipate it will \nbecome a key, long-term catalyst with our bathroom and facial \ntissue lines starting up in 2023. The paper machine, meanwhile, \nis scheduled to be rolled out by the end of 2024. At this point, \neverything is tracking according to plan, but we are keeping a close \neye on potential supply-chain issues and inflationary pressure.\nTurning to our Memphis, Tennessee plant, we improved operating \nefficiency in January 2023 by permanently shutting down older \nassets, including a paper machine and six converting lines. Although \nthis was a difficult decision, we closed down these assets because \nwe saw no clear path to profitability in a highly competitive market. \nThe impact on US customers has been negligible as we refocused \nproduction capacity on TAD and facial tissue products. Enhanced \noperating efficiency from this shutdown will lead to a more efficient \nand profitable Memphis plant that will become a competitive \nadvantage for us. The new facial tissue line that rolled out last \nsummer continues to ramp up ahead of expectations. Operators \nhave been hired and are quickly developing experience with the \nnew machinery. As a result, we anticipate incremental growth \nopportunities in the U.S.\nBRAND SUPPORT\nAligned with industry-wide trends, our Consumer segment \nexperienced lower volume in the latter part of the year as some \nshoppers traded down on purchases due to higher pricing. \nHistorically, these share fluctuations have returned to normal \nlevels once inflation recedes. Kruger Products still maintains a \ncomfortable leadership position in the bathroom and facial tissue \nmarkets in Canada, along with a well-entrenched No. 2 share in \npaper towels. \nTo support prices increases and innovations in 2022, we prudently \ninvested in our brands. We continued to develop awareness and \ntrial-building activities for established names, such as Cashmere®, \nPurex®, and SpongeTowels UltraPRO®, along with emerging ones \nlike BonterraTM and White Cloud®. Targeted campaigns were \ndedicated to the launch of BonterraTM, our new environmentally \nfriendly line, and the relaunch of White Cloud® in the U.S. to \nhighlight their key selling points. Managing price gaps following \nindustry-wide price increases remains a key focus for our team. \nPurpose-driven, community-focused initiatives also delivered strong \nresults in the past year. The Kruger Big Assist program, which \nawards $200,000 annually to selected minor hockey associations \nacross Canada, was supplemented by a Shopping Assist incentive \nto increase revenue. When consumers spent $25 on participating \ntissue products, they received a $10 gift card to drive in-store sales \nand mitigate prices increases.\nOf particular note, our 19th Annual Cashmere® Collection returned \nto a live audience in late September, signalling the beginning of \nOctober’s Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Clothing was fashioned \nentirely with new-and-improved Cashmere UltraLuxe® bathroom \ntissue.\nDespite inflationary pressure, we continued to invest in our business to drive long-term value in \n2022. Production capacity at TAD Sherbrooke exceeded ramp-up plans. We recently deployed \nartificial intelligence (AI) at this site to maximize reliability and uptime.\n“\n”"

AFH revenue increased 40% year-over-year on the \nstrength of pricing actions, a portfolio approach to targeting higher-\nmargin segments, and aggressive expansion in the U.S. As a result, \nAFH Adjusted EBITDA(1) finished in positive territory at $7.4 million \nin 2022 with room for growth. I would add that our AFH segment is \ngradually moving towards a sustainable profit model.\nSUSTAINABILITY\nOur sustainable development plan—entitled Reimagine 2030—is \nbased on the belief that profitable growth and sustainability are \nnot mutually exclusive goals. We intend to grow our business while \nhaving a positive impact on the planet on a long-term basis. This \nstrategy, which was implemented two years ago, consists of four \npillars: Products Empower, Planet Conscious, Employee Impact \nand Community Embrace. \nOur four key targets for 2030 are well-documented, but I want to \nhighlight the tangible efforts that we are deploying to make this \na better planet. Kruger Energy’s two electric semi-trailer trucks \nhave started carrying material and tissue products between Kruger \nProducts facilities in Quebec. These trucks are among the first \nall-electric, class 8 vehicles operating in Canada and the first in \nthe Canadian tissue industry. Their use is expected to eliminate \n150,000 litres of fossil fuel, resulting in removing the equivalent \nGHG emissions of 90 cars annually from Canadian highways\nWe will keep you updated on our progress in our annual sustainability \nreport.\nREORGANIZATION OF KPLP\nOn January 1, 2023, KPLP undertook a corporate reorganization \n(the Reorganization) under which KPLP, a limited partnership, was \nessentially replaced by a corporate entity without adversely affecting \nKP Tissue. The Reorganization was undertaken to realize certain \ntax efficiencies for Kruger Products and to simplify its corporate \nstructure and financial reporting. As a result of the Reorganization, \nKruger Products, as the successor corporate entity to KPLP, now \noperates the business previously operated by KPLP. KP Tissue \ncurrently holds a 13.5% interest in Kruger Products.\nLOOKING AHEAD\nWe are highly encouraged by the ongoing progress of our financial \nresults. The actions undertaken on pricing, cost management and \nthe Memphis redeployment are driving a path to profitable growth. \nWe are also looking forward to additional leverage in our operating \nmodel through the Sherbrooke Expansion Project. \nLooking ahead to 2023, we intend to deliver continued topline \ngrowth and improved profitability, while closely monitoring input \ncosts and a fluctuating Canadian dollar.\nWRAP-UP\nIn closing, I would like to thank all our employees for their dedication \nand resilience during what can best be described as a recovery year \nin 2022. I would also like to express my appreciation to consumers \nand customers for their deep loyalty to our brands. In addition, \nI want to acknowledge our Board of Directors for their wise counsel \nduring the past year. Finally, many thanks to our shareholders for \nsupporting our long-term growth strategy. \nDino Bianco\nChief Executive Officer\nKP Tissue Inc. and Kruger Products Inc.\n(1)\t Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.

It should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of \nKPT for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and the consolidated financial statements \nof KPLP for the years ended December 31, 2022 (Fiscal 2022) and December 31, 2021 (Fiscal 2021), respectively.   \n \nAbout KP Tissue Inc. \n \nKPT was created to acquire, and its business is limited to holding, a limited partnership interest in KPLP, which is \naccounted for as an investment in an associate using the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2022, KPT held \na 13.9% interest in KPLP. The following MD&A provides discussion and analysis related to KPT to the extent necessary to \nunderstand the equity method of accounting. However, the majority of the discussion and analysis relates to KPLP and to \nKPT’s investment in KPLP.  \n \nSubsequent to December 31, 2022, on January 1, 2023, KPLP undertook a corporate reorganization (the \nReorganization) pursuant to which KPLP sold and assigned to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kruger Products Inc. (Kruger \nProducts), and Kruger Products purchased and assumed from KPLP, in exchange for common shares, all of the properties, \noperations, assets and liabilities of KPLP, and KPLP was subsequently dissolved and wound-up into its partners. As a result \nof the Reorganization, Kruger Products, as the successor corporate entity to KPLP, now operates the business previously \noperated by KPLP. Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein to “KPLP” are references to Kruger Products \nInc. for the period following the Reorganization.

The forward-looking statements are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by KPT or Kruger \nProducts. Although KPT and Kruger Products believe that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking \ninformation is based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements since no \nassurance can be given that such expectations and assumptions will prove to be correct. \n \nMany factors could cause Kruger Products’ actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements or future \nevents or developments (which could in turn affect the economic benefits derived from KPT’s economic interest in Kruger \nProducts) to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, without \nlimitation, the following factors, which are discussed in greater detail in the “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Kruger \nProducts’ Business” section of the KPT Annual Information Form dated March 9, 2023 available on SEDAR at \nwww.sedar.com (the Annual Information Form): Kruger Inc.’s influence over Kruger Products; Kruger Products’ reliance \non Kruger Inc.; consequences of an event of insolvency relating to Kruger Inc.; risks associated with the TAD Sherbrooke \nProject; risks associated with the Sherbrooke Expansion Project; operational risks; significant increases in input costs; \nreduction in supply of fibre; increased pricing pressure and intense competition; Kruger Products’ inability to innovate \neffectively; adverse economic conditions; dependence on key retail trade customers; damage to the reputation of Kruger \nProducts or Kruger Products’ brands; Kruger Products’ sales being less than anticipated; Kruger Products’ failure to \nimplement its business and operating strategies; Kruger Products’ obligation to make regular capital expenditures; Kruger \nProducts entering into unsuccessful acquisitions; Kruger Products’ dependence on key personnel; Kruger Products’ inability \nto retain its existing customers or obtain new customers; Kruger Products’ loss of key suppliers; Kruger Products’ failure to \nadequately protect its intellectual property rights; Kruger Products’ reliance on third party intellectual property licenses; \nadverse litigation and other claims affecting Kruger Products; material expenditures due to comprehensive environmental \nregulation affecting Kruger Products’ cash flow; Kruger Products’ pension obligations are significant and can be materially"

It produces, \ndistributes, markets and sells a wide range of disposable tissue products, including bathroom tissue, facial tissue, paper \ntowels and napkins, for both the Consumer and the Away-From-Home (AFH) markets (in each case, as defined below). \nWhile its principal focus is on the Canadian consumer-branded tissue products market, Kruger Products is also a leader in \nthe Canadian AFH market and has a considerable presence in the U.S. private label tissue market. The Consumer segment \nconsists of well recognized brands such as Cashmere, Purex, Scotties, SpongeTowels and Bonterra in Canada and White \nCloud in the United States.  \n \nKruger Products is headquartered in Mississauga, Ontario and has approximately 2,700 employees across Canada and \nthe United States. Kruger Products’ Canadian paper manufacturing facilities, consisting of four tissue plants in Québec and \none plant in British Columbia, have a combined annual tissue production capacity of approximately 350,000 metric tonnes \nwhich, according to RISI data, represents approximately 44% of Canada’s annual production capacity.   \n \nOn November 14, 2022, KPLP announced that certain older and inefficient production assets will be shut down at its \nU.S. manufacturing facility in January 2023, held in its wholly owned subsidiary K.T.G. (USA) Inc. (KTG), located in \nMemphis, Tennessee. Refer to Business Highlights, Shutdown of Certain Memphis Plant Production Assets for additional \ndetails. Following the shutdown, the Memphis manufacturing facility consists of one TAD paper machine (the Memphis \nTAD Machine) with an aggregate annual capacity of 55,000 metric tonnes and one adjacent Light Dry Crepe (LDC) paper \nmachine with an aggregate annual capacity of 30,000 metric tonnes.  \n \nPursuant to its Articles, KPT’s business is limited to (i) the investment in, holding of and disposition of limited \npartnership interests, units, shares or other securities of KPLP and its general partner, KPGP Inc. (KPGP) (or any successor \nentity of either KPLP or KPGP), (ii) the acquisition of, holding, operation and disposition of any assets, liabilities, operations \nor business of such entities, and (iii) all activities related, incidental or ancillary to any of the foregoing.  \n \nAs of the date of the MD&A, and following the Reorganization and participation by Kruger Products’ shareholders in \nthe Kruger Products DRIP on January 16, 2023, KPT held 13.7% of the Kruger Products class B common shares (the Kruger \nProducts Common Shares). Refer to Business Highlights, Corporate Reorganization for additional details."

      "text": "3 \n \nBasis of Presentation \n \nThe consolidated financial statements of KPLP presented for Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021 and the financial statements \nof KPT presented for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, have each been prepared in accordance \nwith IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards). \n \nAccounting Periods \n \nThis MD&A includes financial information for the 3-month periods ended December 31, 2022 (Q4 2022) and \nDecember 31, 2021 (Q4 2021), respectively, and Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021.  \n \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures  \nThis MD&A refers to “Adjusted EBITDA”, a measure which does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by \nGAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. KPLP believes that \nthis measure provides useful information to management of KPLP and the readers of the financial information in measuring \nthe financial performance and financial condition of KPLP. \n \n“Adjusted EBITDA” is calculated by KPLP as net income (loss) before (i) interest expense and other finance costs, (ii) \nincome taxes, (iii) depreciation, (iv) amortization, (v) impairment (gain on sale) of non-financial assets, (vi) loss (gain) on \ndisposal of property, plant and equipment, (vii) foreign exchange loss (gain), (viii) costs related to restructuring activities, \n(ix) changes in amortized cost of Partnership units liability, (x) change in fair value of derivatives, (xi) consulting costs \nrelated to operational transformation initiatives, (xii) corporate development related costs and (xiii) loss (gain) on sale of \nshares. We use “Adjusted EBITDA” to evaluate the performance of our business as it reflects its ongoing profitability. This \nMD&A contains a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, on page \n7. \n \nOutlook \n \nKruger Products is committed to building its consumer brands and developing innovative products for its retail and \ncommercial customers. Kruger Products’ strategy is to maintain its leadership position in the Canadian market. Though the \nCanadian tissue market is expected to remain competitive, Kruger Products believes that its brands and products are well \npositioned for continued growth. Kruger Products will aim to sustain its consumer and AFH leadership position in the \nCanadian tissue industry by driving marketing and sales excellence, extending product lines, continuing to leverage product \ndevelopment and manufacturing technology to drive product superiority and cost savings, and emphasizing manufacturing \nquality and efficiency.  \n \nKruger Products also expects to continue to grow by leveraging its Through Air Dry (TAD) product capabilities in \nCanada and the United States and focusing on the high-end private label business in the U.S. market. Kruger Products’ U.S. \nstrategy also includes the expansion of the White Cloud brand to additional U.S. retailers. \n \nRefer to Business Highlights, Sherbrooke Expansion Project for additional details. \n \nFactors Affecting the Results of Operations  \n \nRevenue  \n \nKPLP generates revenue on the sale of branded, private label and AFH tissue products in Canada and the United States. \nRevenue is reported on a net basis, after deducting rebates and allowances. KPLP’s revenue is impacted by advertising, \ndiscounts and promotions, merchandising, packaging, the availability of shelf and display space at retail customers, the \ntiming of new product launches and line extensions and competitive pricing, all of which have a significant impact on \nconsumer buying decisions. Continued growth of our revenue will depend substantially on the continued strength of our \nbrands, retail support and our ability to effectively maintain sufficient product supply to meet customer demand."

      "text": "4 \n \nKPLP has two reportable business segments: (i) consumer products sold through traditional retail channels such as \ngrocery stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, drug stores and convenience stores (Consumer) and (ii) AFH. The \nConsumer segment includes sales of branded tissue products such as Cashmere, Purex, Scotties, SpongeTowels, Bonterra \nand White Cloud. AFH sells commercial tissue products primarily through distributors to businesses involved in property \nmanagement, health care, food service, manufacturing and lodging, and to other public facilities. Certain management \noverhead costs not directly attributable to the business segments are reported as Corporate and other costs. \n \nKPLP’s current sales focus includes all regions of Canada and the United States. KPLP is partially exposed to \nfluctuations in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar, as sales made to U.S. customers are made in U.S. dollars. To \nmanage this foreign exchange risk, KPLP may enter into foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards.  \n \nCost of Sales  \nCost of sales includes fixed and variable costs to manufacture KPLP’s products, freight, and warehousing and handling \ncosts. Input costs associated with the manufacturing of tissue paper are primarily variable.  Fibre, labour, and energy costs \nare the largest components, representing 50% to 80% of total cost of sales, depending on the type of fibre and paper making \ntechnology being used. Pulp is a world-wide commodity. Though underlying pulp costs can fluctuate based on worldwide \nshifts in supply and demand, there has historically been an ability to pass along fluctuations to end customers and consumers. \nHowever, the ability to pass through the full amount of pulp cost increases may be affected by the competitive market \nsituation at the time of the fluctuation. KPLP has historically entered into fibre commodity contracts to reduce exposure to \nfluctuations in this key input cost and may continue to do so going forward. KPLP has historically targeted commodity \ncontracts to cover 85% of total fibre purchases. KPLP is exposed to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian \ndollar on production inputs, U.S. dollar denominated debt and other operating costs denominated in U.S. dollars. To manage \nthis foreign exchange risk, KPLP may enter into foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards. Fixed costs at the \nplants include plant maintenance, overhead, insurance, property taxes, information technology, as well as depreciation and \namortization (substantially all depreciation and amortization is included in Cost of sales).  \n \nFreight and handling costs vary based on sales volume, the geographical mix of the product shipped, and the cost of \nfuel used by freight carriers. Freight costs can also be subject to fluctuations based on North American shifts in supply and \ndemand. Freight rates and availability of transportation assets are currently being impacted by high demand and lack of \nsupply. \n \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \n \nKPLP’s selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, selling, general and administrative costs, \nwhich include a very small portion of the overall depreciation and amortization.  \n \nSelling costs include the costs related to sales including selling expenses, commissions and other related costs. \nMarketing costs include the costs related to marketing activities including advertising and promotion and market research. \nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of costs related to operations oversight, logistics and customer service, finance, \ninformation technology, product development, legal, human resources, executive administration and other corporate \nexpenses. It also includes foreign exchange gains and losses realized during the period.  \n \nInterest Expense and Other Finance Costs \n \nInterest expense and other finance costs are derived from the financing activities of KPLP. KPLP is a borrower under \ncertain credit facilities, each of which is described under Liquidity and Capital Resources below. KPLP also records \namortization related to deferred financing fees, interest expense on lease liabilities and interest costs related to pensions and \npost-retirement benefits in interest expense and other finance costs.  \n \nOther Income (Expense)  \n \nOther income (expense) includes foreign exchange gains and losses related to U.S. dollar denominated debt, the change \nin amortized cost of Partnership units liability, the change in fair value of derivatives and other items deemed to be non-\noperational in nature."

      "text": "5 \n \nIncome Taxes  \n \nKPLP is not a tax paying entity. The income (loss) from KPLP flowed to the partners, Kruger Inc., KPGP and KPT for \nFiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021. The income taxes recorded in the consolidated financial statements of KPLP relate to the \nincome taxes for its incorporated subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada and Luxembourg. Effective December 15, 2022, TAD \nLuxembourg S.A.R.L., a principal subsidiary of KPLP, filed a certificate of conversion to continue out of a Luxembourg \nlimited liability company to a Delaware corporation. On December 15, 2022, the name of the company was changed from \nTAD Luxembourg S.A.R.L. to K.T.G. US Holdco Inc. \n \nBUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS \n \nSherbrooke Expansion Project  \n \nOn February 26, 2021, KPLP announced an investment of $240 million to expand the Sherbrooke operations with a \nLDC tissue machine and two new production lines as well as the construction of a new tissue manufacturing facility (the \nSherbrooke Expansion Project) over the next three years. On December 17, 2021, KPLP announced an additional investment \nof $111.5 million in the Sherbrooke Expansion Project, to increase the production capacity of the LDC paper machine, for \na total investment of $351.5 million. The cost of the project could be subject to change as a result of inflationary pressures \nacross the supply chain. Management continues to monitor the project to minimize the overall impact. At maturity, the LDC \nMachine is expected to increase Kruger Products’ annual output by at least 60,000 metric tonnes.  \n \nThe additional capacity will allow Kruger Products to expand its product offering and is expected to enable it to grow \nits market share across its different categories, including bathroom tissue, paper towels and facial tissue for household and \naway-from-home use under such brands as Cashmere®, SpongeTowels®, Scotties®, Purex® and Bonterra™ in Canada, \nand White Cloud® in the U.S. Construction of this new facility has started on a site adjacent to the Sherbrooke TAD facility, \nwith converting production line commissioning in 2023, and the LDC Machine start-up planned in 2024. \n \nAgCredit Agreement \n \nOn March 30, 2022, the borrowers entered into the fourth amendment to the AgCredit Agreement (the Fourth \nAmendment) to make available through the TAD Sherbrooke Project Facility a new US$87 million term loan facility (the \nTerm D Credit Facility) for the purpose of refinancing the borrowings outstanding under the $111 million term loan facility \n(the Term C Credit Facility) and to extend the maturity dates of the revolving loans of US$10 million and $12.5 million \nfrom December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2026. The Term D Credit Facility was drawn in full on March 30, 2022 and was \nused to repay in full the $107.0 million of principal, accrued interest and fees outstanding under the Term C Credit Facility. \nThe Term D Credit Facility is repayable by March 30, 2032.  \n \nOn September 15, 2022, the borrowers entered into the fifth amendment to the AgCredit Agreement (the Fifth \nAmendment) to amend the definition of the Combined Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the AgCredit Agreement) \nand change the starting date of the Combined Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio from the fiscal quarter ending September 30, \n2022 to the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022.  \n \nRefer to Liquidity and Capital Resources, Indebtedness for additional details.  \n \nShutdown of Certain Memphis Plant Production Assets \n \nOn November 14, 2022, KPLP announced that certain older and inefficient production assets would be shut down at \nits plant in Memphis in January 2023. The plant, operated by KPLP’s subsidiary KTG, announced the shutdown of \nproduction assets including a LDC paper machine and six converting lines. The shutdown of these assets was determined to \nbe in the best interests of operating efficiencies and profitability of the Memphis plant, and high quality facial tissue and \npremium TAD products will continue to be produced at the plant. Total restructuring costs of $3.3 million are expected, of \nwhich $2.6 million was recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in Fiscal 2022, with the remaining \n$0.7 million expected to be recorded in 2023.  As of December 31, 2022, $2.3 million was recorded in accrued liabilities in \nthe consolidated statement of financial position."

      "text": "6 \n \nCorporate Reorganization \n \nSubsequent to December 31, 2022, on January 1, 2023, KPLP undertook a corporate reorganization (the \nReorganization) pursuant to which KPLP, a limited partnership, was essentially replaced by a corporate entity without \nadversely affecting KPT. More specifically, KPLP sold and assigned to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kruger Products, and \nKruger Products purchased and assumed from KPLP, in exchange for common shares, all of the properties, operations, assets \nand liabilities of KPLP, and KPLP was subsequently dissolved and wound-up into its partners. As a result of the \nReorganization, Kruger Products, as the successor corporate entity to KPLP, now operates the business previously operated \nby KPLP.  \n  \nThe interest that KPT previously held in KPLP is now held in Kruger Products, and, through a shareholders’ agreement \ndated January 1, 2023 entered into with Kruger Inc. (the Shareholders’ Agreement), KPT has substantially equivalent rights \nin respect of the operation of, and its investment in, Kruger Products, as it had in respect of KPLP. The Reorganization was \nundertaken to realize certain tax efficiencies for Kruger Products and to simplify Kruger Products’ corporate structure and \nfinancial reporting. The Reorganization was approved by the independent directors of KPT.  \n  \nThe Shareholders’ Agreement, and certain other agreements with Kruger Inc. that were amended and restated to reflect \nthe Reorganization, are described in the Annual Information Form, and copies of those agreements are available on SEDAR \nat www.sedar.com.  \n  \nPursuant to the Shareholders’ Agreement, the board of directors of Kruger Products shall determine the amount and \ndate of any distribution by way of dividend. The holders of the issued and outstanding Kruger Products Common Shares are \nentitled to receive dividends if, as and when declared by the board of directors of Kruger Products. \n \nPursuant to the Shareholders’ Agreement, Kruger Products adopted a dividend reinvestment plan (the Kruger Products \nDRIP), which permits shareholders that elect to participate in the Kruger Products DRIP to automatically reinvest all cash \ndividends in additional common shares at a price per common share equal to 100% of the five-day weighted average trading \nprice of the common shares prior to the date of payment of the dividend."

Revenue was also favourably \nimpacted by foreign exchange fluctuations on U.S. dollar sales (USD average 1.30 in Fiscal 2022 compared to 1.25 in Fiscal \n2021). From a geographic perspective, revenue in Canada increased $101.7 million or 11.4% and revenue in the U.S. \nincreased $114.5 million, or 20.0%. \n \nCost of Sales \n \nCost of sales was $1,547.3 million in Fiscal 2022 compared to $1,279.9 million in Fiscal 2021, an increase of $267.4 \nmillion or 20.9%. Manufacturing costs increased primarily due to significantly increased pulp costs, high inflation on other \ninput costs, higher sales volumes net of higher overhead absorption, the impact of labour shortages and productivity in \nMemphis manufacturing, increased plant overhead in Sherbrooke, higher plant maintenance costs and the unfavourable \nimpact of foreign exchange fluctuations on U.S. dollar costs. Depreciation expense increased compared to Fiscal 2021 \nprimarily due to accelerated depreciation related to the shutdown of certain LDC assets at the Memphis plant in January \n2023 (refer to Business Highlights, Shutdown of Certain Memphis Plant Production Assets for additional details) and higher \nwarehousing depreciation expense in Fiscal 2022. Freight costs increased significantly compared to Fiscal 2021 primarily \ndue to increased freight rates resulting from cost inflation along with higher sales volumes. As a percentage of revenue, cost \nof sales was 92.0% in Fiscal 2022 compared to 87.4% in Fiscal 2021.  \n \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses  \n \nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $124.6 million in Fiscal 2022 compared to $118.1 million \nin Fiscal 2021, an increase of $6.5 million or 5.5%. The increase was primarily due to the release of a COVID-19 related \nAFH accounts receivable provision in the comparative period, a return to more normal travel levels, consulting and legal \ncosts related to the Reorganization, higher selling expenses related to increased sales volume, and slightly higher advertising \nand promotion expenses, partially offset by foreign exchange gains related to working capital. As a percentage of revenue, \nSG&A expenses were 7.4% in Fiscal 2022 compared to 8.1% in Fiscal 2021. \n \nAdjusted EBITDA  \n \nAdjusted EBITDA1 was $116.0 million in Fiscal 2022 compared to $153.4 million in Fiscal 2021, a decrease of $37.4 \nmillion or 24.4%. The decrease was primarily due to significant inflation on pulp and manufacturing costs and freight as \ndescribed above, higher SG&A expenses and the unfavourable impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, partially offset by \nselling price increases and higher sales volume. \n  \nInterest Expense and Other Finance Costs  \n \nInterest expense and other finance costs were $74.5 million in Fiscal 2022 compared to $70.7 million in Fiscal 2021, \nan increase of $3.8 million. The increase was primarily due to higher debt levels, increased interest rates and the unfavourable \nimpact of foreign exchange fluctuations, partially offset by a lower loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in Fiscal 2022 \ncompared to Fiscal 2021 and decreases in pension and lease interest expense. \n \nOther Expense \n \nOther expense was $3.4 million in Fiscal 2022 compared to $4.9 million in Fiscal 2021. Other expense in Fiscal 2022 \nwas primarily related to an unrealized foreign exchange loss on USD denominated debt of $28.9 million (Fiscal 2021 - gain \n \n1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.

KPLP \nis not directly taxable on its Canadian business. The income tax recovery resulted from taxable losses in KPLP’s incorporated \noperating entities in the U.S. and Canada. Income tax in partner’s hands was a recovery of $1.2 million in Fiscal 2022 \ncompared to $11.1 million in Fiscal 2021.  \n \nNet Income (Loss) \n \nNet loss was $56.9 million in Fiscal 2022 compared to net income of $42.0 million in Fiscal 2021, a decrease of $98.9 \nmillion. The decrease was primarily due to lower Adjusted EBITDA of $37.4 million as discussed above, higher foreign \nexchange loss of $29.7 million, higher depreciation and interest expense of $17.2 million and $3.8 million, respectively, \nconsulting costs related to operational transformation initiatives of $3.5 million, higher restructuring costs of $4.0 million \nand a lower income tax recovery of $34.9 million, partially offset by a higher decrease in the amortized costs of the \nPartnership units liability of $30.9 million. \n \nResults of Operations of KPT  \n \n \n \nThe financial information presented above is based on KPT’s interest in KPLP for Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021. The \nshare of income (loss) relates to KPT’s share of income (loss) of KPLP. Refer to Results of Operations of KPLP above for \nan explanation of the results. The depreciation of fair value increments relates to adjustments to the carrying amount of \ncertain assets of KPLP on its acquisition by KPT. Refer to note 5 in KPT’s financial statements for additional details. \n \nThe current income tax recovery (expense) is based on KPT’s share of the taxable income (loss) of KPLP for the same \nperiods. The deferred tax recovery is a result of changes in the temporary differences of KPLP’s assets and liabilities since \nacquisition and the difference between the accounting and tax basis for KPT’s investment in KPLP. Refer to note 6 in KPT’s \nfinancial statements for additional details. \n \nOn February 28, 2022, pursuant to the Tax Distribution as defined in the Partnership Agreement, KPLP declared a Tax \nDistribution of $14.1 million, of which the advances of $13.8 million were offset and the remaining $0.3 million was paid \non February 28, 2022.

      "text": "11 \n \nCorporate and Other Costs \n \nFiscal 2022 compared to Fiscal 2021 \n \nCorporate and other costs include certain management overhead costs not directly attributable to the business segments.  \n \nCorporate and other costs were of $8.8 million in Fiscal 2022 compared $9.0 million in Fiscal 2021, a decrease in costs \nof $0.2 million, primarily due to consulting costs related to corporate reorganizations and operational transformation \ninitiatives. \n \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  \n \nOverview  \n \nKPLP’s principal uses of funds are for operating costs, working capital, capital expenditures, pension contributions \nand Tax and Partnership Unit distributions (together, the Funding Requirements). To date, KPLP has met the Funding \nRequirements by using cash generated from operating activities and the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and borrowings under \nits various debt facilities. The registered defined benefit pension plans (RDBPP) sponsored by KPLP are currently in a \nsolvency deficiency position, requiring KPLP to make funding contributions over the next ten years. KPLP Management \nbelieves that cash generated from operations and the Dividend Reinvestment Plan, together with amounts available under \nthe various debt facilities will be sufficient to meet its future Funding Requirements. However, KPLP’s ability to meet future \nFunding Requirements and its ability to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on its debt facilities and to satisfy \nany of its other present or future debt obligations will depend on its future operating performance, which will be affected by \ngeneral economic, financial, and other factors including factors beyond its control. KPLP Management reviews investment \nopportunities in the normal course of its business and may, if suitable opportunities arise, make selected investments to \nimplement KPLP’s business strategy. Historically, the funding for any such investments has come from cash flows from \noperations and/or additional debt.  \n \nAs of December 31, 2022, KPLP was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under all of its outstanding credit \nfacilities. As of December 31, 2022, KPLP had drawn $90.3 million from the $200 million committed amount under the \nKPLP Senior Credit Facility and had $18.0 million of letters of credit outstanding, resulting in $91.7 million available from \nthe KPLP Senior Credit Facility, subject to covenant limitations. As of December 31, 2022, KPLP had drawn US$10 million \n($13.5 million) and $3.6 million, respectively, on the US$10 million ($13.5 million) and $12.5 million committed amounts \nunder the revolving loans of the TAD Sherbrooke Project Facility and had $8.9 million of letters of credit outstanding, \nresulting in the revolving loans being fully drawn. As of December 31, 2022, KPSB had not drawn on the $5 million \ncommitted amount under the KPSB Revolving Facility and had $0.8 million of letters of credit outstanding, resulting in $4.2 \nmillion available from the KPSB Revolving Facility, subject to covenant limitations. As of December 31, 2022, KPLP had \ntotal liquidity of $137.5 million (December 31, 2021 - $263.8 million) representing cash and cash equivalents and availability \nunder the KPLP Senior Credit Facility and the KPSB Revolving Facility within the covenant limitations. In addition, $29.7 \nmillion (December 31, 2021 - $86.5 million) of cash and cash equivalents were held by KPLP for the TAD Sherbrooke and \nSherbrooke Expansion projects.  \n \nAs it pertains to capital expenditures, approximately $25 million annually relates to maintenance projects and the \nremaining expenditures are focused on strategic and growth projects aimed at reducing costs and offsetting annual inflation \nor increasing production capacity. Regular growth projects focused on performance improvement generally have a 3 to 4 \nyear payback. Capital expenditures were $115.6 million in Fiscal 2022, including $20.7 million related to the TAD \nSherbrooke Project, $53.4 million related to the Sherbrooke Expansion Project (including interest capitalized during \nconstruction) and government assistance received of $1.0 million. This included a reduction in discretionary plant \nexpenditures and revised Sherbrooke Expansion Project expenditures due to supply chain delays. Capital expenditures are \nexpected to be approximately $200 million to $230 million in fiscal 2023, including the Sherbrooke Expansion Project. \n \nThe tissue industry is generally characterized by high sales volume and rapid turnover of inventories and accounts \nreceivable. In general, accounts receivable and inventories are readily convertible into cash. Investment in working capital \nmay be affected by fluctuations in the prices of pulp and other supply costs, vendor terms and timing of collection of accounts \nreceivable. KPLP participates in a factoring program to assist in managing working capital. Under the program, KPLP \nderecognizes certain receivables upon sale."

In addition, as of December 31, 2022, KPLP had $16.5 million of \nletters of credit related to pensions outstanding. Pension contributions for fiscal 2023 are expected to be $10.4 million and \npost-retirement contributions for fiscal 2023 are expected to be $2.4 million. \n \nOn December 13, 2012, in connection with the issuance of Partnership units to KPT, the Limited Partnership \nAgreement was amended to require KPLP, subject to compliance with contractual obligations and applicable law, to make \ndistributions to its partners in such amounts as would enable KPT to discharge its obligation to pay federal and provincial \nincome taxes (the Tax Distribution). Each partner is entitled to its share of the Tax Distribution made in respect of any given \nyear. KPLP determined that it was appropriate to reclassify a portion of its equity to Partnership units liability, since the Tax \nDistribution represents a contractual obligation to deliver cash and, as such, meets the definition of a financial liability for \naccounting purposes under IFRS. As of December 31, 2022, $133.6 million was recorded as a liability in respect of this \nobligation (December 31, 2021 - $173.2 million). The amount is in respect of a previously disclosed obligation owed to the \npartners of KPLP.

KPLP has the option under its credit facilities \nto fund the respective borrowing entities to provide liquidity or achieve compliance with covenant ratios. \n \nOn September 15, 2022, the borrowers entered into the fifth amendment to the AgCredit Agreement (the Fifth \nAmendment) to amend the definition of the Combined Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the AgCredit Agreement) \nso that for the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2022, March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, the relevant amount calculated \nfor the ratio is determined not by using four consecutive fiscal quarter periods but instead by using the financial results from \nOctober 1, 2022 to each fiscal quarter end, dividing by the number of days in the period and multiplying by 365. The Fifth \nAmendment also changed the starting date of the Combined Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio from the fiscal quarter ending \nSeptember 30, 2022 to the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022. \n \nOn a Combined Basis and quarterly financial basis, the borrowers: \n \nShall not permit the Combined Leverage Ratio (as defined in the AgCredit Agreement) as of the end of any fiscal \nquarter of the borrowers to exceed 60%; \n \nShall not permit the Combined Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the AgCredit Agreement) as of the end of \nany fiscal quarter of the borrowers, beginning with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022, to be less than: \n(i) \n1.10 to 1.00 with respect to the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022 through and including the fiscal \nquarter ending September 30, 2023; and \n(ii) \n1.25 to 1.00 with respect to the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2023 and each fiscal quarter \nthereafter. \n \nThe AgCredit Agreement was further amended by a consent letter dated as of October 28, 2022 related to, among \nother things, amending certain provisions of the AgCredit Agreement to allow for implementation of the Reorganization. \nRefer to Business Highlights, Corporate Reorganization for additional details. \n \nAs of December 31, 2022, the following amounts were drawn on the TAD Sherbrooke Project Facility: \n(i) \nUS$180.5 million on the Term B Credit Facility (December 31, 2021 – US$180.5 million);  \n(ii) \nUS$87.0 million on the Term D Credit Facility (December 31, 2021 – nil);  \n(iii) \nUS$10.0 million on the revolving loan facility (December 31, 2021 – nil); and \n(iv) \n$3.6 million cash drawn and $8.9 million letters of credit drawn on the $12.5 million revolving loan \nfacility (December 31, 2021 - $2.0 million cash drawn and $7.3 million letters of credit drawn). \n \nAs of December 31, 2022, the following amount was drawn on the KTG Facility: \n(i) \nUS$144.5 million on the Term A Credit Facility (December 31, 2021 – US$147.0 million)."

KPLP’s financial instruments exposed to credit risk as of December 31, 2022 included cash and \ncash equivalents, restricted cash, trade and other receivables and receivables from related parties. KPLP places its cash and \ncash equivalents and restricted cash with financial institutions of high creditworthiness.  \n \nKPLP sells its products to a variety of customers under certain credit terms and therefore is exposed to credit risks. \nNormal trade receivables are due within 30 days from the invoice date and amounts in excess of 90 days past the invoice \ndate are considered delinquent. KPLP routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and mitigates against \nidentified exposure primarily by lowering credit limits with high-risk accounts. KPLP’s customers are well established \ncompanies and accordingly, KPLP has experienced limited financial loss with respect to credit risk. As a result, KPLP \nbelieves that its exposure to credit risk is limited.  \n \nOn November 16, 2018, KPLP entered into a factoring arrangement with the Bank of Nova Scotia, pursuant to a \nReceivables Purchase Agreement, as amended by a first amendment agreement dated November 12, 2020, a second \namendment agreement dated November 8, 2021, a third amendment agreement dated November 8, 2022 and a fourth \namended and restated agreement dated December 15, 2022.

The dilution factor is an estimate of \nrebates accrued for each customer in respect of the customer invoice. KPLP is restricted from selling or pledging these trade \nreceivables. The factoring arrangement bears interest at a floating interest rate based on CDOR plus applicable margin. \nPursuant to the fourth amendment, the Receivables Purchase Agreement was renewed on a non-committed basis going \nforward, whereby either party may terminate the Receivables Purchase Agreement at any time subject to a notice period. As \neligible trade receivables are sold, KPLP removes the factored receivables from the consolidated statement of financial \nposition, recognizes the proceeds received as consideration for the transfer and records a loss on factoring, which is included \nin Interest expense and other finance costs in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Cash flows from the \nfactoring arrangement are presented as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. During Fiscal 2022, \nthe factored receivables sold to the Bank of Nova Scotia were $674.3 million (Fiscal 2021 - $608.1 million). KPLP sold \n95% of these trade receivables, net of a dilution factor, for $672.4 million (Fiscal 2021 - $607.3 million). As of December \n31, 2022, the trade receivables sold were $42.3 million (December 31, 2021 - $33.5 million). \n \nCurrency Risk  \nCurrency risk is the risk that KPLP’s earnings may fluctuate due to changes in Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rates, \nas the financial results are reported in Canadian dollars. KPLP sells certain of its products in U.S. dollars at prevailing U.S. \ndollar prices. The currency exposure is more than offset by U.S. dollar costs and expenses and the U.S. dollar denominated \ndebt. KPLP is generally a net buyer of U.S. dollars.  \n \nAs of December 31, 2022, KPLP had net liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars of $421.2 million (December 31, \n2021 – $254.9 million). Assuming the Canadian dollar strengthened (weakened) by 5% against the U.S. dollar, with all other \nvariables held constant, the hypothetical result on net income before tax in Fiscal 2022 would have been an increase \n(decrease) of $21.1 million (Fiscal 2021 – $12.7 million).  \n \nLiquidity Risk \n \nThe purpose of liquidity risk management is to maintain sufficient cash and cash equivalents and to ensure KPLP has \nsufficient authorized credit facilities to maintain liquidity and meet its future obligations as they come due.  \n \nThe ability to pay its obligations relies on KPLP collecting its trade receivables in a timely manner and by maintaining \nsufficient cash and cash equivalents in excess of anticipated needs. KPLP’s trade and other payables of $279.4 million as of \nDecember 31, 2021 (December 31, 2021 –$258.6 million) are all due for payment within twelve months of the dates of the \nconsolidated statements of financial position. \n \nRefer to Liquidity and Capital Resources, Overview for additional details. \n \nInterest Rate Risk  \n \nKPLP’s interest rate risk arises from its variable rate debt related to the KPLP Senior Credit Facility, certain credit \nfacilities made available as part of the TAD Sherbrooke Project Facility and the KPSB Senior Credit Facility. As of \nDecember 31, 2022, KPLP had variable rate debts of $106.9 million (December 31, 2021 – $106.7 million).

      "text": "25 \n \nCommodity Price Risk  \nCommodity price risk is the risk that future cash flows associated with purchasing required raw materials will fluctuate \ndue to changes in commodity prices, which can be affected by foreign exchange and other trade related risks. KPLP is \nsubject to commodity price fluctuations since KPLP’s main raw material is fibre, which changes price due to market \nconditions, and therefore can result in periodic earnings volatility in the short term. Historically, the industry has generally \nbeen able to mitigate its exposure to commodity price risk over the medium term by passing increases in its supply costs \nonto its customers through incremental price increases, depending on the supply and demand balance. The ability to \neventually pass through the full amount of pulp and other commodity cost increases can be impacted by the competitive \nmarket situation. There can be no assurance that the historical ability to pass through increases in costs will continue to occur \nin the future. From time to time, KPLP enters into futures contracts to manage its commodity risk. No such contracts were \noutstanding as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. \n \nTRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES \n \nKPLP and Kruger are parties to a Third Amended and Restated Management Services Agreement dated as of November \n15, 2019 with effect as of January 1, 2020 (the Management Services Agreement) pursuant to which Kruger provides certain \nmanagement and support services to KPLP, including corporate management support and administrative support services; \naccounting and tax support; corporate financing and treasury support; benefits and human resources support services; \ncorporate insurance; corporate procurement services complementary to KPLP procurement; project development and \nmanagement services, corporate development support, environmental support and corporate engineering support services.  \n \nDuring Fiscal 2022, management fees of $7.8 million (Fiscal 2021 - $7.4 million) were paid to Kruger Inc. for \nmanagement services provided to KPLP. \n \nKruger Inc. is also providing certain management and support services related to the Sherbrooke Expansion Project \nincluding project management services, and engineering, construction, accounting and corporate finance support services.  \n \nKPLP also leases warehouses located in Laval, Québec and Vancouver, British Columbia from an entity of which an \naffiliate of Kruger is a 50% owner.  \n \nKPLP purchases certain supplies and services from Kruger Inc. and its affiliates, including fibre and small quantities \nof pulp and packaging. These transactions generally take place on arm’s-length terms. KPLP also has the ability to procure \nthese goods and services from third party suppliers.  \n \nSales of goods and services to Kruger Inc. during Fiscal 2022 were $0.3 million (Fiscal 2021 – $1.3 million). Sales of \ngoods to subsidiaries of Kruger Inc. during Fiscal 2022 were $4.1 million (Fiscal 2021 – $4.1 million). Goods are sold based \non the price lists in force and terms that would be available to third parties.  \n \nPurchases of goods and services from Kruger Inc. during Fiscal 2022 were $8.0 million (Fiscal 2021 - $7.5 million). \nPurchases of goods and services from subsidiaries of Kruger Inc. during Fiscal 2022 were $57.9 million (Fiscal 2021 - $52.5 \nmillion). These purchases of goods and services are included within Cost of sales and SG&A expenses in the consolidated \nstatement of comprehensive income. \n \nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS \n \nKPLP has entered into right-of-use lease commitments related to land, buildings, IT services, vehicles and other \nmachines and equipment. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources, Contractual Obligations for additional details on \ncontractual obligations including these right-of-use leases. \n \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n \nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements is in accordance with IFRS, which requires KPLP Management \nto make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures made in the KPLP and KPT financial \nstatements and accompanying notes. KPLP Management continually evaluates the estimates and assumptions it uses. These \nestimates and assumptions are based on KPLP Management’s historical experience, best knowledge of current events and"

The estimates and assumptions described in this section depend upon subjective or complex judgment that may \nbe uncertain and changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the financial statements.   \n \nPension and Post-Retirement Benefit Obligations  \n \nThe cost and accrued benefit plan obligations of KPLP’s pension plans, consisting of the RDBPP, supplementary \nretirement arrangements and the Annuity Arrangement and other benefit plans are accrued based on actuarial valuations that \nare dependent on assumptions determined by KPLP Management. These assumptions include the discount rate, the expected \ngrowth rate of health care costs, the rate of compensation increase, retirement ages and mortality rates. These assumptions \nare reviewed quarterly by KPLP Management and KPLP’s actuaries. The discount rate (based on market rates) and the \nexpected growth rate in health care costs represent the most significant assumptions.  \n \nPartnership Units Liability \n \nOn December 13, 2012, in connection with the issuance of Partnership units to KPT, the Limited Partnership \nAgreement was amended to require KPLP, subject to compliance with contractual obligations and applicable law, to make \ndistributions to its partners in such amounts as would enable KPT to discharge its obligation to pay federal and provincial \nincome taxes (the Tax Distribution). Each partner is entitled to its share of the Tax Distribution made in respect of any given \nyear. KPLP determined that it was appropriate to reclassify a portion of its equity to Partnership units liability, since the Tax \nDistribution represents a contractual obligation to deliver cash and, as such, meets the definition of a financial liability for \naccounting purposes under IFRS.  \n \nThe liability is based on KPLP Management’s best estimate of the net present value of expected future Tax \nDistributions, which are made on a pro rata basis based on taxes payable by KPT, which results from KPT’s taxable income \nfrom its partnership interest in KPLP. KPLP updates the net present value of the liability annually and records any resulting \nchange in Other income (expense). The net present value of the liability is based on a number of assumptions including \nestimates of taxable income and tax rates, as well as discount rates, growth rates, forecasted Adjusted EBITDA, future \ncommodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Taxable income can differ significantly from accounting income as a result \nof both timing and permanent tax differences based on enacted tax legislation and therefore changes in the Partnership units \nobligation are not necessarily indicative of a change in the expected future profitability of KPLP.  \n \nAs of December 31, 2022, $133.6 million was recorded as a liability in respect of this obligation (December 31, 2021 \n- $173.2 million). As of December 31, 2022, the valuation utilized a discount rate and terminal growth rate of 9.75% and \n2.0% (December 31, 2021 – 8.75% and 2.0%), respectively. The discount rate reflects the risks associated with the business, \nwhich operates primarily in Canada. \n \nThe gain of $25.6 million recorded during Fiscal 2022 (Fiscal 2021 – loss of $5.3 million) related to the change in \namortized cost of Partnership units liability represents the results of the reassessment performed as of December 31, 2022. \nThe Partnership units liability decreased by $39.6 million due to the change in the discount rate causing a decrease of $27.9 \nmillion, the final 2021 Tax Distribution of $14.1 million and the changes in other assumptions causing an increase of $2.4 \nmillion. \n \nAs a result of the Reorganization, the Partnership unit liability was extinguished as the Partnership Agreement was \ndissolved and the corresponding requirement to make the Tax Distribution was eliminated. Refer to Business Highlights, \nCorporate Reorganization for additional details. \n \nEquity Method of Accounting  \n \nThe equity method of accounting is being applied by KPT as it relates to its investment in KPLP. The conclusion to \naccount for an investment using the equity method, particularly when the percentage of ownership is below 20%, is based \non an assessment of several facts and circumstances and ultimately requires significant judgment in reaching a conclusion. \nManagement has reviewed the agreements and made an assessment of the rights of KPT. Based on KPT having four of ten \nseats on the board of directors of KPGP, KPT Management has concluded that KPT has the ability to exercise significant \ninfluence over KPLP."

      "text": "27 \n \nImpairment Tests \n \nKPLP performs annual impairment tests for goodwill, as it relates to the Consumer Canada CGU and indefinite lived \ntrademarks.  \n \nManagement completed the annual impairment test for goodwill related to the Consumer Canada CGU, utilizing future \nforecasts and concluded that the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount as of December 31, 2022 and no \nimpairment was recorded. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of the Canada Consumer CGU's goodwill was \n$152.0 million. \n \nAs of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of the AFH CGU's goodwill was nil.   \n \nKPLP completed the annual impairment test for indefinite lived trademark. Recoverable amounts related to indefinite \nlived trademarks are determined based on management’s best estimate using a relief from royalty model. The estimates of \nrelief from royalty are based on the royalties that would have to be paid based on market royalty rates and projected sales \nvolumes. Additional assumptions include estimates of the discount rate, growth rates, selling price to customer and foreign \nexchange rates. Management has concluded that current and projected sales volumes and profitability support the \nrecoverable amount of the indefinite lived trademarks. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of indefinite lived \ntrademarks was $16.0 million. \n \nKPT is required to perform an impairment test on its investment in KPLP if there is objective evidence that the \ninvestment may be impaired. Management concluded the future forecasts that support the investment value had not changed \nsignificantly and therefore there was no indication of impairment. \n \nIncome Taxes  \n \nKPLP computes its income taxes in each jurisdiction in which its subsidiaries operate. Estimation of income taxes \nincludes evaluating the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and the income taxes recoverable based on an assessment of \nthe ability to use the underlying tax deductions and credits against future taxable income. The assessment requires an estimate \nof future taxable income compared to the net operating loss carry forwards and U.S. State tax credits. To the extent estimates \ndiffer from the final tax return, earnings would be affected in a subsequent period. Management exercises judgment to \ndetermine the extent to which realization of future taxable benefits is probable, considering factors such as the number of \nyears to include in the forecast period and the history of taxable profits. During Fiscal 2022, KPLP reassessed its ability to \nutilize the U.S. State tax credits and its ability to utilize net operating loss carry forwards. KPLP recognized loss carry \nforwards previously unrecognized and recorded an additional $40.3 million deferred tax asset for Fiscal 2021.   \n \nAs a result of the Reorganization, certain tax assets and liabilities as well as current and deferred income tax expense \nwill be recognized directly by the successor corporate entity, Kruger Products, as it has an obligation to pay income taxes. \nRefer to Business Highlights, Corporate Reorganization for additional details. \n \nKPT has not recognized at the date of acquisition the deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the differences between \nthe accounting and tax basis of KPLP’s assets and liabilities. Accordingly, KPT is tracking temporary differences that are \nsubject to the initial recognition exemption and recognizes newly created temporary differences as they arise. The \ndetermination of the temporary differences that are subject to the initial recognition exemption requires significant judgment. \nKPT has not recognized the deferred tax asset related to its investment in KPLP. \n \nLeases \n \nThe application of IFRS 16 requires a number of critical judgements, including identifying whether a contract (or part \nof a contract) includes a lease, determining whether it is reasonably certain that an extension or termination option will be \nexercised, determining whether variable payments are in-substance fixed, establishing whether there are multiple leases in \nan arrangement, and determining the stand-alone selling price of lease and non-lease components. The application of IFRS \n16 also involves a number of key estimates, including estimating the lease term, determining the appropriate rate to discount \nlease payments, and assessing whether a Right-of-use asset is impaired."

In May 2020, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 37 \nto clarify which costs to include in estimating the cost of fulfilling a contract for the purpose of assessing whether \nthat contract is onerous. The mandatory effective date was for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022. \nThe amended standard had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. \n \n(iii) IAS 16, Proceeds before Intended Use. In May 2020, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 16 to clarify the \naccounting for the net proceeds from selling any items produced while bringing an item of property, plant and \nequipment into use. The mandatory effective date was for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022. \nThe amended standard had no impact on the consolidated financial statements.  \n \nFuture Accounting Standards  \nThe following revised standards and amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, \n2023, and with earlier application permitted. KPLP and KPT Management are in the process of assessing the impact of these \nstandards and amendments and have determined that the standards and amendments will not be early adopted.   \n \n(i) IAS 1, Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current. In January 2020, the IASB issued an amendment to \nIAS 1 to clarify that liabilities are classified as either current or non-current, depending on the rights that exist at \nthe end of the reporting period. In October 2022, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS1, Non-current Liabilities \nwith Covenants, to clarify how conditions with which an entity must comply within twelve months after the \nreporting period affect the classification of a liability. The 2022 amendments also introduce additional disclosure \nrequirements to improve the information an entity provides when its right to defer settlement of a liability is subject \nto compliance with covenants within twelve months after the reporting period. The 2022 amendments changed the \neffective date of the 2020 amendments. The mandatory effective date would be annual periods beginning on or \nafter January 1, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amended standard is expected to result in additional \ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements for non-current liabilities arising from loan arrangements that \nare subject to covenants to be complied with within twelve months after the reporting period.     \n \n(ii) IAS 1, Disclosure of Accounting Policies. In February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 to provide \nguidance and examples to help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting policy disclosures. The \nmandatory effective date would be annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with early adoption \npermitted. The amended standard is not expected to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.    \n \n(iii) IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes to Accounting Estimates and Errors. In February 2021, the IASB issued \namendments to IAS 8 to introduce a new definition of accounting estimates to clarify the distinction between \nchanges in accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates and the correction of errors. The mandatory \neffective date would be annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The \namended standard is not expected to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.   \n \n(iv) IAS 12, Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction. In May 2021, the IASB \nissued amendments to IAS 12 that require an entity to recognize deferred tax on certain transactions such as leases \nand decommissioning obligations that give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences \non initial recognition.

Revenue was also favourably impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations \non U.S. dollar sales (USD average 1.36 in Q4 2022 compared to 1.26 in Q4 2021). From a geographic perspective, revenue \nin Canada increased $17.2 million or 7.0% and revenue in the U.S. increased $16.9 million, or 9.5%. \n \nCost of Sales \nCost of sales was $416.4 million in Q4 2022 compared to $376.0 million in Q4 2021, an increase of $40.4 million or \n10.7%. Manufacturing costs increased primarily due to significantly increased pulp costs and high inflation on other input \ncosts, along with the unfavourable impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on U.S. dollar costs, partially offset by lower \nsales volumes. Depreciation expense increased compared to Q4 2021 primarily due to accelerated depreciation related to the \nshutdown of certain LDC assets at the Memphis plant in January 2023 (refer to Business Highlights, Shutdown of Certain \nMemphis Plant Production Assets for additional details) and higher warehousing depreciation expense in Q4 2022. Freight \ncosts increased compared to Q4 2021 primarily due to increased freight rates resulting from cost inflation.

The decrease was primarily due to lower advertising and promotion expenses \nresulting from cost containment activities partially offset by consulting and legal costs related to the Reorganization and \nhigher personnel costs. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses were 6.7% in Q4 2022 compared to 7.5% in Q4 2021. \n \nAdjusted EBITDA  \n \nAdjusted EBITDA2 was $44.4 million in Q4 2022 compared to $38.3 million in Q4 2021, an increase of $6.1 million \nor 15.8%. The increase was primarily due to higher selling prices and lower SG&A expenses, partially offset by significant \ninflation on pulp, manufacturing costs and freight as described above, lower sales volume and the unfavourable impact of \nforeign exchange fluctuations. \n \nInterest Expense and Other Finance Costs  \n \nInterest expense and other finance costs were $20.7 million in Q4 2022 compared to $22.8 million in Q4 2021, a \ndecrease of $2.1 million. The decrease was primarily due to a loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in Fiscal 2021, \npartially offset by higher debt levels, increased interest rates and the unfavourable impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. \n \nOther Income \n \nOther income was $30.8 million in Q4 2022 compared to $5.9 million in Q4 2021. Other income in Q4 2022 was \nprimarily related to a gain resulting from the change in amortized cost of Partnership units liability of $25.6 million (Q4 \n2021 – $5.0 million) (refer to Critical Accounting Estimates, Partnership Units Liability for additional details) and a foreign \nexchange gain on USD denominated debt of $5.3 million (Q4 2021 – $1.3 million). \n  \nIncome Taxes  \n \nAn income tax expense of $1.8 million was recorded in Q4 2022 compared to a recovery of $43.2 million in Q4 2021. \nKPLP is not directly taxable on its Canadian business. The income tax expense in Fiscal 2022 resulted from a provision \nrecorded against certain tax assets, partially offset by a recovery resulting from taxable losses in KPLP’s incorporated \n \n2 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.

The \ndecrease was primarily due to a significantly lower income tax recovery of $45.0 million as described above, higher \ndepreciation expense of $11.2 and restructuring costs of $3.2 million, partially offset by higher Adjusted EBITDA of $6.1 \nmillion as discussed above, higher change in the amortized costs of the Partnership units liability of $20.6 million, higher \nforeign exchange gain of $4.0 million, lower interest expense of $2.1 million and lower other expense of $0.3 million. \n \nSegment Information Q4 2022 compared to Q4 2021 \n \n \n \nConsumer Segment \n \nQ4 2022 compared to Q4 2021 \n \nConsumer segment revenue was $378.8 million in Q4 2022 compared to $364.0 million in Q4 2021, an increase of \n$14.8 million or 4.1%. The increase in revenue was due to selling price increase in Canada and the U.S., and the favourable \nimpact of foreign exchange fluctuations on U.S. dollar sales, partially offset by a decrease in sales volume related to lower \nconsumer demand in the quarter. Consumer segment revenue increased in both Canada and the U.S. \n \nConsumer Segment Adjusted EBITDA was $42.7 million in Q4 2022 compared to $43.7 million in Q4 2021, a decrease \nof $1.0 million. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower sales volumes and significant inflation in \ncost of sales as described above in Results of Operations for Q4 2022, which was only partially offset by the selling price \nincreases. \n \nAFH Segment \n \nQ4 2022 compared to Q4 2021 \n \nAFH segment revenue was $79.3 million in Q4 2022 compared to $60.1 million in Q4 2021, an increase of $19.2 \nmillion or 31.9%. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher sales volumes in both the U.S. and Canada as the \nbusiness continues to recover from the impact of COVID-19, selling price increases in Fiscal 2022 and the favourable impact \nof foreign exchange fluctuations on U.S. dollar sales. AFH segment revenue increased in both the U.S. and Canada. \n \nAFH Segment Adjusted EBITDA was $5.7 million in Q4 2022 compared to a loss of $1.7 million in Q4 2021, an \nimprovement of $7.4 million. The significant increase was due to the favourable impact of higher sales volume and selling \nprice increases along with increased production efficiencies, which were only partially offset by high inflation in cost of \nsales as described above in Results of Operations for Q4 2022 along with higher SG&A expenses.  \n(C$ millions,\nunless otherwise noted)\nQ4 2022\nQ4 2021\n$ Change\n% Change\nSegment Revenue\nConsumer\n378.8\n              \n364.0\n              \n14.8\n                \n4.1%\nAFH\n79.3\n                \n60.1\n                \n19.2\n                \n31.9%\nTotal segment revenue\n458.1\n              \n424.1\n              \n34.0\n                \n8.0%\nAdjusted EBITDA\nConsumer\n42.7\n                \n43.7\n                \n(1.0)\n                 \nAFH\n5.7\n                  \n(1.7)\n                 \n7.4\n                  \nCorporate and other costs\n(4.0)\n                 \n(3.7)\n                 \n(0.3)\n                 \nTotal Adjusted EBITDA\n44.4\n                \n38.3\n                \n6.1\n                  \nQ4 2022 vs. Q4 2021"

(KPT or the Corporation) was incorporated by articles of incorporation under the Canadian Business \nCorporations Act on October 1, 2012. As of December 31, 2022, the Corporation held a 13.9% (December 31, 2021 – \n14.5%) interest in Kruger Products L.P. (KPLP or the Partnership), whose principal business is to produce, distribute, \nmarket and sell a wide range of disposable tissue products, including bathroom tissue, facial tissue, paper towels and \nnapkins for both the consumer and away-from-home markets in North America. The Corporation’s headquarters are \nlocated in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. \n \nSubsequent to December 31, 2022, on January 1, 2023, KPLP undertook a corporate reorganization (the Kruger Products \nReorganization) pursuant to which KPLP, a limited partnership, was essentially replaced by a corporate entity, Kruger \nProducts Inc. (Kruger Products), without adversely affecting the Corporation. As a result of the Kruger Products \nReorganization, Kruger Products, as the successor corporate entity to KPLP, now operates the business previously \noperated by KPLP. The Corporation currently holds a 13.7% interest in Kruger Products. \n \n2 \nBasis of presentation \n \nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as \nissued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and with interpretations of the International Financial \nReporting Committee which the Canadian Accounting Standards Board has approved for incorporation into Part 1 of \nthe CPA Canada Handbook - Accounting. The financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost \nconvention.  \n \nThe financial statements were approved by the board of directors on March 8, 2023. \n \n3 \nSummary of significant accounting policies \n \nThe significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these financial statements are as follows: \n \n(a) Investments in associates \n \nAssociates are entities over which the Corporation has significant influence but not control. The Corporation \naccounts for its investment in associates using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is \ninitially recognized at cost and the carrying amount is adjusted for the Corporation’s share of profits or losses of \nassociates recognized in the statement of comprehensive income (loss) and its share of other comprehensive income \n(loss) of associates included in other comprehensive income (loss). \n \nUnrealized gains on transactions between the Corporation and an associate are eliminated to the extent of the \nCorporation’s interest in the associate. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides \nevidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Dilution gains and losses arising from changes in interests in \ninvestments in associates are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income (loss). \n \nThe Corporation assesses at each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that its interests in \ninvestments in associates are impaired. If so, the carrying value of the Corporation’s share of the underlying assets \nof associates is written down to its net recoverable amount (being the higher of fair value, less cost to sell and value \nin use) and the loss is charged to the statement of comprehensive income (loss). \n \n(b) Income tax \n \nIncome tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income \n(loss) except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in other comprehensive income (loss) or"

However, deferred tax is not recognized if it \narises from the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other \nthan a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. \nDeferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, \nexcept, in the case of subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the \nCorporation and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. \n \nDeferred income tax is determined on a non-discounted basis using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or \nsubstantively enacted at the statement of financial position date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax \nasset is realized or liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future \ntaxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized. \n \nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are presented as non-current. \n \n(c) Share capital \n \nIncremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of common shares are recognized as a deduction from equity. \n \n(d) Earnings per share \n \nBasic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) for the period attributable to equity \nowners of the Corporation by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. \n \nDiluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for dilutive \ninstruments. The number of shares included with respect to options, warrants and similar instruments is computed \nusing the treasury stock method. The Corporation does not currently have any potentially dilutive instruments. \n \n(e) Accounting standards issued but not yet applied \n \n(i) IAS 1, Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current. In January 2020, the IASB issued an amendment \nto IAS 1 to clarify that liabilities are classified as either current or non-current, depending on the rights that \nexist at the end of the reporting period. In October 2022, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS1, Non-current \nLiabilities with Covenants, to clarify how conditions with which an entity must comply within twelve months \nafter the reporting period affect the classification of a liability. The 2022 amendments also introduce additional \ndisclosure requirements to improve the information an entity provides when its right to defer settlement of a \nliability is subject to compliance with covenants within twelve months after the reporting period. The 2022 \namendments changed the effective date of the 2020 amendments. The mandatory effective date would be \nannual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amended standard is \nnot expected to have an impact on the financial statements.  \n \n(ii) IAS 1, Disclosure of Accounting Policies. In February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 to provide \nguidance and examples to help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting policy disclosures. The \nmandatory effective date would be annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with early adoption \npermitted. The amended standard is not expected to have an impact on the financial statements."

In February 2021, the IASB issued \namendments to IAS 8 to introduce a new definition of accounting estimates to clarify the distinction between \nchanges in accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates and the correction of errors. The \nmandatory effective date would be annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with early adoption \npermitted. The amended standard is not expected to have an impact on the financial statements.   \n \n4 \nCritical accounting estimates and judgments \n \nThe preparation of these financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that \naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the disclosure of contingencies at the \ndates of the statement of financial position, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting \nperiod. On a regular basis and with the information available, management reviews its estimates and judgements, \nincluding those related to fair value and the basis of accounting. Actual results could differ from those estimates. When \nadjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the period in which they occur.  \n \nEquity method of accounting \n \nThe equity method of accounting is being applied by the Corporation as it relates to its investment in KPLP. The \nconclusion to account for an investment using the equity method, particularly when the percentage of ownership is below \n20%, is based on an assessment of several facts and circumstances and ultimately requires significant judgment in \nreaching a conclusion. Management has reviewed the agreements and made an assessment of the rights of the \nCorporation. Based on the Corporation having four of ten seats on the board of directors of KPGP Inc. (KPGP), \nmanagement has concluded that the Corporation has the ability to exercise significant influence over KPLP.   \n \nImpairment test  \n \nThe Corporation is required to perform an impairment test on its investment in KPLP if there is objective evidence that \nindicates that the investment may be impaired. Management applies judgment when assessing whether there is any \nobjective evidence that would require an impairment test to be performed, including whether (i) KPLP has recognized \nimpairment losses in its financial results; or (ii) the recoverable amounts of KPLP’s cash generating units tested for \nimpairment have declined below the carrying amount of the Corporation’s basis in KPLP’s assets included in the \ninvestment in KPLP after taking into account the fair value increment for identifiable assets recorded on acquisition of \ninterests in KPLP; or (iii) there is a significant decline in the market capitalization of the Corporation compared to its \nnet assets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, management considered the impact of various events on the \nCorporation’s assessment of whether there was objective evidence that its investment in KPLP may be impaired.  \nManagement concluded the future forecasts that support the investment value had not changed significantly and as a \nresult no triggering event had occurred requiring an impairment test to be performed.  \nPartnership units \n \nOn December 13, 2012, in connection with the issuance of Partnership units to KPT, the Limited Partnership Agreement \nwas amended to require KPLP, subject to compliance with contractual obligations and applicable law, to make \ndistributions to its partners in such amounts as would enable KPT to discharge its obligation to pay federal and provincial \nincome taxes (the Tax Distribution). Each partner is entitled to its share of the Tax Distribution made in respect of any \ngiven year. \n \nIncome taxes \n \nThe Corporation has not recognized at the date of acquisition the deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the \ndifferences between the accounting and tax basis of KPLP’s assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the Corporation is \ntracking temporary differences that are subject to the initial recognition exemption and recognizes newly created"

The dividends paid, the additional common shares issued at the share price, \nand the gross proceeds were as follows:  \n \n \n \n \n \nAs a result of the Kruger Products Reorganization, the Corporation received a dividend of $1.8 million from Kruger \nProducts on January 16, 2023, such that the Corporation received the same amount in the form of a dividend as the \nCorporation would have received had the January 16, 2023 distribution been paid by KPLP.  \n \nOn January 16, 2023, the Corporation paid a dividend of $1.8 million to shareholders at $0.18 per common share.  \nPursuant to the Corporation DRIP, a portion of the dividend was reinvested by the shareholders, resulting in the \nCorporation issuing 4,682 common shares at a price of $10.18. \n \nSubsequent to December 31, 2022, the Corporation declared a dividend of $0.18 per common share to shareholders, \npayable on April 17, 2023. \n   \nAs a result of the DRIP and Kruger’s reinvestment of its distribution from KPLP in units of KPLP, a dilution gain of \n$0.8 million was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022 (2021 - $0.3 million). \n \n \n \n \n2022\n \nDividends paid\nShare price\nIssuance of\n Common shares\nGross proceeds\nDividend Payment Date\n$\n$\n#\n$\nJanuary 17, 2022\n1,781\n                    \n10.50\n              \n36,007\n                        \n378\n                     \nApril 15, 2022\n1,788\n                    \n10.81\n              \n4,351\n                          \n47\n                       \nJuly 15, 2022\n1,788\n                    \n10.26\n              \n4,426\n                          \n46\n                       \nOctober 17, 2022\n1,789\n                    \n10.26\n              \n5,773\n                          \n58\n                       \n7,146\n                    \n50,557\n                        \n529\n                     \n2021\n \nDividends paid\nShare price\nIssuance of\n Common shares\nGross proceeds\nDividend Payment Date\n$\n$\n#\n$\nJanuary 15, 2021\n1,755\n                    \n10.70\n              \n32,921\n                        \n352\n                     \nApril 15, 2021\n1,761\n                    \n10.47\n              \n39,046\n                        \n409\n                     \nJuly 15, 2021\n1,768\n                    \n10.32\n              \n35,366\n                        \n365\n                     \nOctober 15, 2021\n1,774\n                    \n10.26\n              \n36,315\n                        \n372\n                     \n7,058\n                    \n143,648\n                      \n1,498"
