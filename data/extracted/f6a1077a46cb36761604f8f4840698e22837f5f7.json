Aeeris finished FY22 with 20% growth in \nyear-on-year revenue from ordinary activities.\nThe Company reported a small loss in FY22 \ncompared to a profit in FY21 due to the continued \ninvestment in new staff to drive future growth.\nAfter raising $1.5M of additional capital in October \n2021, the Board is pleased with the investment \nand outcomes delivered. The additional funds \nsupported new staff hires who assisted in \nmaking significant advances in the Company’s \ntechnology. \nAeeris \nhas \nnow \nsuccessfully \nmigrated its key platform to the cloud, on time \nand budget with no down time or loss of data. \nFurther, significant technological advances to the \nClimatics V.2 platform, data analytics, API’s and \ninternal management systems have been made.\nWhile some customers use our primary system, \nthe Spatial Analysis Risk Platform (SARP), \nfor multi-purpose, multi-channel alerting and \ncommunications, many of our customers prefer \nto consume our data through their own platforms. \nOver the period we have successfully integrated \nmultiple large enterprises via our API’s, delivering \nspatial alerting and climate data through their \nown corporate systems.\nMarketing, \nsales \nsystems, \nmonitoring \nand \nreporting have been greatly enhanced and the \nCompany is starting to realise these benefits with \nincreased sales.\nOur Climatics platform has become a “push \nbutton” exercise covering multiple perils. It is \na multiuser, scalable application with its own \nbilling system and the Company now has several \ncustomers using Climatics.\nOur primary platform, SARP, has been in \ncontinuous use by water authorities and dam \noperators as the wet events continue. Northern \nand eastern Australia is currently experiencing \na La Niña weather pattern. Our nation dances \nbetween the extremes with the odd interlude \nof stable climatic conditions. There may well be \nother contributing factors."

This \nmassive vapor injection \nincreased the amount \nof moisture in the global \nstratosphere by about 5%.\n(LIVE SCIENCE) 1\nThe extreme events of the last financial year have \nattracted industries to our services that have \nnot previously been part of our portfolio. These \ninclude large retail clients, vehicle manufacturers, \nrepairers, and community services.\nThe growing appetite among those who invest in \nAustralian companies for the disclosure of climate-\nrelated risks further bolsters our opportunities, \nparticularly for our Climatics product. And it \nseems likely that Australia may follow other \njurisdictions like New Zealand, which have already \nimplemented a mandatory disclosure regime, \nputting further pressure on companies to assess \nand disclose climate related risk.\nJames Eyers reported in the Australian Financial \nReview that “Australian Prudential Regulation \nAuthority (APRA) last month found nearly a \nquarter of banks, insurers and super funds had \nno proper metrics to measure and monitor climate \nrisk. APRA considers climate risk could have a \ncompounding impact on credit, market liquidity \nand operational risk and is keen to see banks \ndevelop better data sets to assess exposures.\n1 Water vapor is by far the most influential greenhouse gas and is likely strengthening the La Niña pattern.\n2 https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/apra-wants-banks-to-urgently-find-better-climate-data-20220907-p5bg7d\n“APRA has been interrogating the availability \nand quality of risk data at the largest financial \ninstitutions through a Prudential Standard known \nas CPS 230 on ‘operational resilience.” 2 This is \nwhat we call operationalised data, something \ngranular, location specific and can be acted on \nversus modelling.\nAeeris is in a unique position to service these \nrequirements as we provide lifesaving, asset \nprotection and predictive analysis on acute \nand physical climate risks, producing useful \ninformation and insights for decision makers\nWe enter FY2023 with a larger more balanced team, \nenhanced technology assets, a strong balance \nsheet, no debt and increased resources to scale \nthe business through accelerated revenue growth.\nOn behalf of the board, I would like to congratulate \nthe Aeeris team responsible for achieving excellent \noutcomes for the year under difficult conditions.\nI would like to thank and welcome the many new \ncustomers who have made the choice to support \na safer future, and for the strong support from \nshareholders and our key stakeholders who \ncontinue with us on our journey to reduce climate \nrisk and help protect people, assets and operations.\nYours sincerely,\nKerry Plowright \nChairman & CEO"

Floods in one place, \ncatastrophic fires in another, cyclones, droughts, \nor plate sized hailstones.\nAll our team in Aeeris have a passion for \nweather…indeed all hazards. Our team comprises \nmeteorologists, SES volunteers, scientists and \nstorm chasers. Whether on duty or not, they live it \nevery day. The team aren’t just observers, they are \nactively involved in events and fully understand \nthe potential outcomes. This experience helps \nkeep our customers safe. Actionable information \nis key to any enterprise in potential risk situations, \nand that is what we deliver – “get out before you \nget in it.”\nFollowing is unedited commentary from our \nGeneral Manager, James Harris, from when he was \ninvolved in the Lismore floods, 28 February 2022.\nToday was an emotional roller-\ncoaster. The confusion at the start \nof the day as to whether we could \ntake boats down or not. We went \nout anyway but felt like we should \nhave gone out sooner.\nSearching streets in a boat that \nwe were literally walking down 24 \nhours earlier. Hearing cries for help, \nit became very real. Seeing the joy \non people’s faces knowing they \nwere safe was incredible. I wanted \nto cry, but at the same time I felt \nimmense pride watching everyone \nwork together. The boats coming \nin with rescued people to the left \nwhilst a queue of empty boats on \nthe right heading out for more. \nPulling up to the road, volunteers \nwould wade out and help the boat \nin. We were then met by police, SES \nand more volunteers all helping \nthe people off the boat and to the \nparamedics waiting for them. The \nnext few weeks are going to be \ntough, but after witnessing what I \nsaw today and hearing of so many \nothers volunteering at shelters, \ncatering etc to assist those who \nhave lost everything there is hope!"

      "text": "XIV\nANNUAL REPORT 2022\nAeeris in the \nData Age\nAeeris deals in real world data and real time \nalerting and forecasting. This, combined with \nthe Company’s SARP, arguably delivers the \nmost superior spatial dataset for multiple perils \nin Australia.  Andy Pitman, director of the ARC \nCentre of Excellence for Climate System Science, \nsummarises the value of such data in a recent \nstudy as reported to The Weekend Australian: \n“Climate models are very \nvaluable tools for many \napplications, but they are \nnot something I want used to \ndecide investment strategies \nfor my superannuation.”\nThe central issue is the \ndifference between weather \nand climate and the inability \nof models to predict weather \nevents at city scale.\nProfessor Pitman said \nattempts to use dynamical \ndownscaling to get far \nhigher resolution data was \n“excellent science but not \nscience designed for the \nfinancial sector”.\nPrevious Aeeris reports expand on the data \nvalue, the point here is to catch up to where the \nmarket is. A climate risk self-assessment survey \npublished by the Australian Prudential Regulation \nAuthority last month found nearly a quarter of \nbanks, insurers and super funds had no proper \nmetrics to measure and monitor climate risk. \n“Empirical measurement, rather than a subjective \njudgment, is going to be needed fairly urgently,” \nAPRA chairman Wayne Byres said in a speech. The \nNew Zealand government has just made climate \nrisk disclosures mandatory for insurers and banks \n– the same rules could be imminent in Australia. \nInsurance Australia Group’s (IAG) Ramana James \nsaid his company, the biggest general insurer in \nAustralasia, is well prepared.\nThe combination of a solution and superior data \nand risk analytics is unique.\nOne of the strongest features Climatics provides \ncustomers is the ability to compare and contrast \ntheir assets across Australia and determine \nlocations that may require immediate attention. \nThis kind of analysis across the country is \nimportant to help businesses recognise the \nchanges that are being experienced at one \nlocation are not necessarily equivalent in other \nlocations and provides them with climate context \nso they may make informed decisions about the \nfuture of their assets."

      "text": "XV\nFlooding across the eastern seaboard in the \nfirst half of 2022 has highlighted the need for \nbusinesses to be able to assess their flood risk, \nwhich is a key component of the offering from \nClimatics through use of JBA Risk Management \nAustralian flood maps. To date, the data has \nverified well from events with a positive response \nfrom users regarding its ability to identify if an \nasset will or not as a worst case scenario. \nThe analysis work focuses on increasing the \nnumber of hazards available to users, including \nadding analysis for sea level, storm surge, lightning, \nfrost and solar energy. This will undoubtedly \nplace Climatics in a unique position in the Climate \nRisk market by being able to provide climate \nintelligence for 15+ hazards in a single, easy to \nuse platform that will also be available via an API. \nWeather has a direct impact on the performance \nof a business with a trail of affected service \nproviders and employees. The Construction \nsector, already under pressure, is a good example \nof the substantial impact of weather on business. \nWet weather forecasts for spring and summer \nwill likely cause more construction delays as the \n2022 trifecta of Covid, rain and price escalation \ncontinue to take its toll. With the east coast of \nAustralia looking set to experience another La \nNiña season over the coming six months, this will \nbring heavy rain and more flooding to communities \nstill in disrepair. Roberts Co chief executive Alison \nMirams said it would be a “depressing” outcome \nafter what had already proved to have been a \ntough year in the construction sector.\nAs of July 2022, the commercial builder had lost \nabout 75 workdays this year to wet weather, \nmeaning the business only achieved 46 per cent \nproductivity from January to July.\nThe recent independent inquiry led by Mick \nFuller and Mary O’Kane into the catastrophic \nNorthern Rivers floods found that “many people \nlive on flood plains in NSW, and many of these \nare in known high-risk areas”. If a 19m flood \n(such as the 1867 record flood) happened in the \nHawkesbury-Nepean Valley, more than 90,000 \npeople would need to be evacuated and more \nthan 15,500 homes would flood. The Insurance \nCouncil of Australia estimates that since 1970 \nthe total incurred claims from flooding are more \nthan $21.3bn, with floods in NSW and southeast \nQueensland in February-March this year costing \nmore than $3.35bn."

Combined with an organisations’ vulnerability and exposure \ninformation, it assists companies with physical risk reporting. \n \nThe Group’s services solve natural disaster awareness problems and promote personal and employee \nsafety, asset protection, risk management, as well as helping to mitigate the financial impact of adverse \nevents.  The SARP system is globally scalable. \n \nCOVID-19 Impact Assessment \nAeeris does not expect any further impact on its business from the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nAeeris is listed on ASX with the ticker code AER. \n \nFinancial Position \nThe net assets of the consolidated group have increased by $1,330,589 from 30 June 2021 to $2,390,872 in \n2022. This increase is largely due to the following factors: \n \n• \nAn increase of $1,312,257 in cash and cash equivalents arising from a $1.5 million capital raise in \nOctober 2021 by way of a placement  of new fully paid ordinary shares; \n• \nAn increase of $136,200 in trade and other receivables; and offset by \n• \nAn increase of $19,515 in trade & other payables. \n \nSignificant Changes in State of Affairs \nThere were no significant changes in the state of affairs of the parent entity during the financial year. \n \nEvents After the Reporting Period \nThere have been no events after the reporting period and there has been no impact from COVID-19 after \nbalance date."

Material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these \nfinancial statements are presented below and have been consistently applied unless stated otherwise. \n \nExcept for the cash flow information, the financial statements, have been prepared on an accruals basis and \nare based on historical costs, modified, where applicable, by the measurement at fair value of selected non-\ncurrent assets, financial assets and financial liabilities. The amounts presented in the financial statements have \nbeen rounded to the nearest dollar. \n \nGoing Concern \nThe accounts have been prepared on the going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of normal \nbusiness activities and the realisation of assets and liabilities in the normal course of business. \n \nThe Directors are aware that the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, and its ability to pay its debts \nas and when they fall due, is largely dependent on increases in revenue and successfully managing its short to \nmedium term liquidity position. \n \nCOVID-19 Impact Assessment on Going Concern \nThe Company enjoys a reliable annuity income stream from blue chip customers. This annuity revenue stream \nenables it to map and comfortably manage cashflows for the next 12 months without the assumption of any \nnew business. \n \nPrinciples of Consolidation \nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate all of the assets, liabilities and results of the parent (Aeeris \nLtd) and all of the subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities the parent controls. The parent controls an entity when \nit is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to \naffect those returns through its power over the entity. A list of the subsidiaries is provided in Note 13. \n \nThe assets, liabilities and results of all subsidiaries are fully consolidated into the financial statements of the \nGroup from the date on which control is obtained by the Group. The consolidation of a subsidiary is \ndiscontinued from the date that control ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains or \nlosses on transactions between group entities are fully eliminated on consolidation. Accounting policies of \nsubsidiaries have been changed and adjustments made where necessary to ensure uniformity of the \naccounting policies adopted by the Group."

Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill \nrelated to the entity disposed of. \n \nChanges in the ownership interests in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as \nequity transactions and do not affect the carrying amounts of goodwill."

Current tax liabilities/(assets) are measured at the amounts expected to be paid to/(recovered from) \nthe relevant taxation authority using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end \nof the reporting period. Deferred income tax expense reflects movements in deferred tax asset and deferred \ntax liability balances during the year as well as unused tax losses. \n \nCurrent and deferred income tax expense is charged or credited directly to equity instead of profit or loss \nwhen the tax relates to items that are recognised outside profit or loss. \n \nExcept for business combinations, no deferred income tax is recognised from the initial recognition of an asset \nor liability where there is no effect on accounting or taxable profit or loss. \n \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when \nthe asset is realised or the liability is settled and their measurement also reflects the manner in which \nmanagement expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of the related asset or liability. With respect to \nnon-depreciable items of property, plant and equipment measured at fair value and items of investment \nproperty measured at fair value, the related deferred tax liability or deferred tax asset is measured on the \nbasis that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered entirely through sale. \n \nDeferred tax assets relating to temporary differences and unused tax losses are recognised only to the extent \nthat it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the benefits of the deferred tax \nasset can be utilised. \n \nWhere temporary differences exist in relation to investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint \nventures, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised where the timing of the reversal of the \ntemporary difference can be controlled and it is not probable that the reversal will occur in the foreseeable \nfuture. \n \nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists and it is intended \nthat net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur. \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where: (a) a legally enforceable right of set-off exists; and (b) the \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the \nsame taxable entity or different taxable entities where it is intended that net settlement or simultaneous \nrealisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur in future periods in which significant \namounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled. \n \nFair Value of Assets and Liabilities \nThe Group measures some of its assets and liabilities at fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis, \ndepending on the requirements of the applicable Accounting Standard. \n \nFair value is the price the Group would receive to sell an asset or would have to pay to transfer a liability in an \norderly transaction between independent, knowledgeable and willing market participants at the measurement \ndate. \n \nAs fair value is a market-based measure, the closest equivalent observable market pricing information is used \nto determine fair value.

The fair values of assets and liabilities that are not traded in an active market are \ndetermined using one or more valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise, to the extent \npossible, the use of observable market data. \n \nTo the extent possible, market information is extracted from either the principal market for the asset or \nliability or, in the absence of such a market, the most advantageous market available to the entity at the end \nof the reporting period. \n \nFor non-financial assets, the fair value measurement also takes into account a market participant’s ability to \nuse the asset in its highest and best use or to sell it to another market participant that would use the asset in \nits highest and best use. \n \nThe fair value of liabilities and the entity’s own equity instruments (excluding those related to share-based \npayment arrangements) may be valued, where there is no observable market price in relation to the transfer \nof such financial instruments, by reference to observable market information where such instruments are held \nas assets. Where this information is not available, other valuation techniques are adopted and, where \nsignificant, are detailed in the respective note to the financial statements. \n \nProperty, Plant and Equipment \nEach class of property, plant and equipment is carried at cost or fair value as indicated less, where applicable, \nany accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. \n \nProperty \nFreehold land and buildings are carried at their fair value (being the amount for which an asset could be \nexchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction), based on periodic, but at \nleast triennial, valuations by external independent valuers, less accumulated depreciation for buildings. \n \nIncreases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation of land and buildings are credited to a revaluation \nsurplus in equity. Decreases that offset previous increases of the same asset are recognised against \nrevaluation surplus directly in equity; all other decreases are recognised in profit or loss. \n \nAny accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the \nasset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. \n \nPlant and Equipment \nPlant and equipment are measured on the cost basis and therefore carried at cost less accumulated \ndepreciation and any accumulated impairment. In the event the carrying amount of plant and equipment is \ngreater than the estimated recoverable amount, the carrying amount is written down immediately to the \nestimated recoverable amount and impairment losses are recognised either in profit or loss or as a revaluation \ndecrease if the impairment losses relate to a revalued asset. A formal assessment of recoverable amount is \nmade when impairment indicators are present. \n \nThe carrying amount of plant and equipment is reviewed annually by Directors to ensure it is not in excess of \nthe recoverable amount from these assets. The recoverable amount is assessed on the basis of the expected \nnet cash flows that will be received from the asset’s employment and subsequent disposal. The expected net \ncash flows have been discounted to their present values in determining recoverable amounts. \nSubsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as \nappropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the"

For financial assets, this is the date that the entity commits itself to either the \npurchase or sale of the asset. \n \nFinancial instruments are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs, except where the instrument is \nclassified “at fair value through profit or loss”, in which case transaction costs are expensed to profit or loss \nimmediately."

They comprise investments in the equity of other entities where there is neither a fixed \nmaturity nor fixed or determinable payments. \n \nThey are subsequently measured at fair value with any remeasurements other than impairment losses \nand foreign exchange gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income. When the financial \nasset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss pertaining to that asset previously recognised in \nother comprehensive income is reclassified into profit or loss. \n \nAvailable-for-sale financial assets are classified as non-current assets when they are not expected to \nbe sold within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

Financial liabilities are derecognised when the related obligations \nare discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability \nextinguished or transferred to another party and the fair value of consideration paid, including the transfer of \nnon-cash assets or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss. \n \nImpairment of Assets \nAt the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be \nimpaired. The assessment will include the consideration of external and internal sources of information, \nincluding dividends received from subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures deemed to be out of pre-\nacquisition profits. If such an indication exists, an impairment test is carried out on the asset by comparing the \nrecoverable amount of the asset, being the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in \nuse, to the asset’s carrying amount. Any excess of the asset’s carrying amount over its recoverable amount is \nrecognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount in accordance with \nanother Standard (e.g. in accordance with the revaluation model in AASB 116:   Property, Plant and \nEquipment). Any impairment loss of a revalued asset is treated as a revaluation decrease in accordance with \nthat other Standard. \n \nWhere it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the \nrecoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. \n \nImpairment testing is performed annually for goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives and intangible \nassets not yet available for use. \n \nIntangibles Other Than Goodwill \nIT Research and Development \nExpenditure during the research phase of a project is recognised as an expense when incurred. Development \ncosts are capitalised only when technical feasibility studies identify that the project is expected to deliver \nfuture economic benefits and these benefits can be measured reliably. IT research and development costs are \namortised over 5 years using the prime cost method. \n \nEmployee Benefits \nShort-Term Employee Benefits \nProvision is made for the Group’s obligation for short-term employee benefits. Short-term employee \nbenefits are benefits (other than termination benefits) that are expected to be settled wholly before 12 \nmonths after the end of the annual reporting period in which the employees render the related service, \nincluding wages, salaries and sick leave. Short-term employee benefits are measured at the \n(undiscounted) amounts expected to be paid when the obligation is settled. \n \n \nThe Group’s obligations for short-term employee benefits such as wages, salaries, superannuation and \nleave are recognised as a part of current trade and other payables in the statement of financial position."

The fair value is determined by a Black Scholes model. The cost of \nequity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the \nperiod in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant \nemployees become fully entitled to the award (‘vesting date’). \n \nThe cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until vesting \ndate reflects (i) the extent to which the vesting period has expired and (ii) the number of awards that, in \nthe opinion of the Directors of the Company, will ultimately vest.

When the inflow of consideration is deferred, it is \ntreated as the provision of financing and is discounted at a rate of interest that is generally accepted in \nthe market for similar arrangements. The difference between the amount initially recognised and the \namount ultimately received is interest revenue. \n \nSubscription Income \nRevenue from subscriptions is recognised over the period which the relevant service is provided. \n \nInterest Revenue \nInterest revenue is recognised using the effective interest rate method. \n \nRendering of Services \nRevenue in relation to rendering of services depends on whether the outcome of the services can be \nmeasured reliably.

The fair value is determined by an external valuer using \nthe Black Scholes Model simulation. The accounting estimates and assumptions relating to equity-settled \nshare-based payments would have no impact on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the \nannual reporting period but may impact expenses and equity. \n \nRevenue \nThe Directors have assessed the impact of AASB 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers on the \nfinancial statements and have determined that other than unearned revenue, the Group has recognised \nrevenue to depict the transfer of services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to \nwhich the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for the services. \n \nUnearned revenue \nThe Directors have assessed the impact of AASB 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers on the \nfinancial statements and have determined that unearned revenue reflects the value of consideration that \nhas or will be received before the transfer of services is made to customers."

These valuation techniques maximise, to the extent possible, the use of \nobservable market data. If all significant inputs required to measure fair value are observable, the asset or \nliability is included in Level 2. If one or more significant inputs are not based on observable market data, \nthe asset or liability is included in Level 3."

The availability of sufficient and relevant data primarily depends \non the specific characteristics of the asset or liability being measured. The valuation techniques selected \nby the Group are consistent with one or more of the following valuation approaches: \n•\nMarket Approach: valuation techniques that use prices and other relevant information generated\nby market transactions for identical or similar assets or liabilities\n•\nIncome Approach: valuation techniques that convert estimated future cash flows or income and\nexpenses into a single discounted present value\n•\nCost Approach: valuation techniques that reflect the current replacement cost of an asset at its\ncurrent service capacity.\nEach valuation technique requires inputs that reflect the assumptions that buyers and sellers would use \nwhen pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risks. When selecting a valuation \ntechnique, the Group gives priority to those techniques that maximise the use of observable inputs and \nminimise the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs that are developed using market data (such as publicly \navailable information on actual transactions) and reflect the assumptions that buyers and sellers would \ngenerally use when pricing the asset or liability are considered observable, whereas inputs for which \nmarket data is not available and therefore are developed using the best information available about such \nassumptions are considered unobservable. \nThe following tables provide the fair values of the Group’s assets and liabilities measured and recognised \non a recurring basis after initial recognition and their categorisation within the fair value hierarchy: \n30 June 2022 \nRecurring Fair Value Measurements \nNote \nLevel 1 \nLevel 2 \nLevel 3 \nTotal \nFinancial Assets \nCash and Cash Equivalents \n11 \n2,739,215 \n- \n- \n2,739,215 \nTrade and Other Receivables \n12 \n337,988 \n- \n- \n337,988 \nPrepayments \n14,791 \n- \n- \n14,791 \nTotal Financial Assets \n3,091,994 \n- \n- \n3,091,994 \nNon-Financial Assets \nProperty Plant and Equipment \n14 \n11,968 \n- \n- \n11,968 \nTotal Non-Financial Assets \n11,968 \n- \n- \n11,968 \nLiabilities \nTrade and other Payables \n15 \n586,018 \n- \n- \n586,018 \nProvisions \n16 \n127,072 \n- \n- \n127,072 \nTotal Liabilities \n713,090 \n- \n- \n713,090 \nThere were no transfers between Level 1 and level 2 for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a \nrecurring basis during the reporting period (2021: no transfers)."

We have nothing to report in this regard. \nResponsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report \nThe directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair \nview in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal \ncontrol as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true \nand fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Misstatements \ncan arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably \nbe expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report. \nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and \nmaintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n• \nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or \nerror, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is \nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material \nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve \ncollusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. \n• \nObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that \nare appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the \neffectiveness of the Group’s internal control. \n• \nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates \nand related disclosures made by the directors."
