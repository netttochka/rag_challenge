We are seeking \nplatinum and palladium, the two major Platinum \nGroup Elements (PGEs).\nPlatinum and palladium are essential for green \nenergy technologies, including current usage \nin catalytic converters in combustion engines. \nHowever, major growth is expected to unfold in \napplications with green energy technologies and \nlow carbon energy solutions.\nPeako’s exploration team completed an initial \nprospectivity review of the Eastman Project \nand identified ultramafic intrusions that we \nconsidered to have the potential to host a large \nPGE mineralised system. Subsequently, several \nphases of exploration were completed, aimed at \ndelivering the highest priority prospects as well \nas improving our understanding of the controls \non mineralisation. Importantly, these programs \nindicated that previous PGE exploration, which \nhad focused on the discontinuous strataform \nchromite lenses, may not be the optimal \nexploration target. In parallel with exploration \nundertaken by the other explorers in the region, \nwe now believe that PGE mineralisation is not \nlimited to the chromite lenses but, importantly, \nthat our targets should also include the \nstratabound mineralisation within the entire suit \nof ultramafic units.\nThis understanding became an important focus \nfor the exploration effort, with the drill program \nthat recently commenced, focusing on the \nultramafic units. The results are expected to be \nreleased soon. \nGeochemical surface sampling has also \nconfirmed the presence of PGEs, with targeted \nsamples taken at Louisa, The Gap and Grand \nCentral prospects returning excellent PGE + Au \nindications. Further details are included in the \nOperations Review in this Annual Report. \nAll this work is a testament to the dedication \nand focus of our management and exploration \nteam. Led by Executive Director, Rae Clark, and \nTechnical Director, Dr Paul Kitto, the Peako team \nhas significantly increased the understanding \nof the Eastman PGE Project over the past year. \nI thank them and the entire Peako team for their \nhard work. \nThe coming year looks exciting for the Company. \nWith geology becoming better understood and \nRC drill results due shortly, we are excited for \nwhat we may be able to achieve over the next 12 \nmonths.\n On behalf of the Board, I thank our shareholders \nfor their support and financial contribution and to \nour team, consultants and my fellow directors for \ntheir efforts. \n \nE.G.

The Eastern Zone extends for ~9.4km \nwith 2.5km under cover, and the Western zone \nfor 7.1km, mostly under cover. \nThe Eastman Intrusion is a layered mafic \nto ultramafic intrusive complex comprised \npredominately of pyroxenite, anorthosite and \ngabbro. The pyroxenite forms the basal unit \nwith the gabbro and anorthosite overlaying it. \nThe sequence has been variously folded and \nfaulted in places resulting in structural repetition \nof the sequence. Having multiple layers of the \nsequence adds considerably to the prospectivity \nof the intrusive complex.\nWidespread anomalous PGE intercepts from \nsparse, wide-spaced historical drilling over \nthe 16.5km extent of the Eastman Intrusion \nindicate an extensive PGE mineralised system \n(refer Figure 2). Historical exploration was \nfocused on the eastern most outcropping ~6.9 \nkm length of the intrusive complex, targeting \nshort discontinuous chromite lenses within the \nsequence. PGE mineralisation, however, is shown \nto be stratabound within the ultramafic intrusives. \nFigure 2: Eastman Intrusion with interpreted geology and location of historical drillholes and selected assay highlights for 3E mineralisation\n8\nPEAKO LIMITED"

A collection of rock samples at regular \nintervals for pXRF analysis assisted the definition \nof magmatic units making up the intrusion as well \nas Koongie Park Formation host rocks to \nthe intrusion. \nThe study highlighted associations between \ncarbonate units within the Koongie Park \nFormation and emplacement of the PGE-bearing \nultramafic complex. In addition, the stratigraphic \nframework identified the occurrence of multiple \nultramafic horizons, many having open to isoclinal \nfold forms associated with thickness variations \nacross the ultramafic intrusions.  \nRock Chip Analyses \nGeochemistry\nGeochemistry results from rock chip samples \ncollected during mapping traverses across three \nprospects: The Gap, Grand Central and Louisa \nwere returned, with 3E PGE grades up to 2.9g/t. \nTwelve of the 54 submitted rock chips returned \n3E values greater than 0.5 g/t.  \nNine of those rock chip samples were \nsubsequently analysed using the nickel sulphide \n(NiS) fire assay method with total Platinum \nGroup Element (PGE) values for those samples \nsignificantly increased. \nThe NiS fire assay method allows for the analysis \nof all PGEs (Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium, \nIridium, Ruthenium and Osmium) as well as gold. \nThe samples were initially analysed using Aqua \nRegia and lead collection fire assay methods to \nprovide values for a large suite of elements (53 \nelements), however this method was unable to \nanalyse for the less abundant PGEs (Rhodium, \nIridium, Osmium and Ruthenium).\nThe best rock-chip NiS fire assay method results \nwere returned from the Louisa Prospect where \nall five samples returned PGE+Au results greater \nthan 1g/t. Highest assay results from each of \nthe prospects were 3.49g/t PGE+Au at Grand \nCentral, 2.17g/t PGE+Au at Louisa, and 1.17g/t \nPGE+Au at The Gap (Figure 4).\nQEMSCAN and laser petrography study \nA preliminary petrography study on 10 weathered \nsurface samples was completed using QEMSCAN \nmicroscopy and LA-ICP-MS laser ablation \nimaging. \nThe results defined alteration assemblages and \nidentified positive correlations between Pd and \nCu–Ni that could serve as a potential guide for \nPd mineralisation in the field.  An association \nbetween Pt and the weathered rock types were \nobserved, with Pt associated with both chromite \nand silicate minerals. Chromite samples were \nalso observed to have slightly higher levels of Pt \ntogether with occasional PGE nuggets. \nLaser results also highlighted the presence of \nRuthenium (Ru), Rhodium (Rh), Iridium (Ir), and \nOsmium (Os), which positively correlated with \nchromite. In addition, gold (Au) also correlated \nwith the occurrence of chromite.\nQEMSCAN (Quantitative Evaluation of \nMaterials by Scanning Electron Microscopy) \nis an integrated automated mineralogy and \npetrography solution providing quantitative \nanalysis of minerals and rocks.

The financial \nreport has also been prepared on a historical cost \nbasis.  The Parent Entity is registered and \ndomiciled in Australia. \n \nThe \nfinancial \nstatements \ncomprise \nthe \nconsolidated financial statements for the Group. \nFor the purposes of preparing the consolidated \nfinancial statements, the Company is a for-profit \nentity.The financial statements are presented in \nAustralian dollars, unless otherwise stated. \n \nGoing concern \nFor the year ended 30 June 2022 the Group \nincurred a net cash outflow from operating and \ninvesting \nactivities \nof \n$2,365,608 \n(2021: \n$2,081,558) and a net loss after tax of $1,104,118 \n(2021: $714,743). As at 30 June 2022, the Group \nhas positive working capital of $1,423,045 (2021: \n$1,154,257). \n \nDirectors expect that the group will be able to \nsuccessfully raise sufficient funding to enable it to \ncontinue as a going concern for at least 12 months \nfrom the signing of annual financial report. \n \nThe Group raised $1,403,353 (before costs) in a \nrights issue completed during September 2022. \n(Note 17).  \n \nThis financial report has been prepared on a going \nconcern basis which contemplates the continuity of \nnormal business activities and the realisation of \nassets and settlement of liabilities in the ordinary \ncourse of business. In the event that sufficient \nfunds are not raised to meet all of the Group's \ncommitments, debt and payables, the interest in \nsome or all of the Group's tenements may be \naffected and all assets and liabilities may not be \nrealised at the amounts disclosed.

Therefore, the Directors consider it \nappropriate to prepare the financial statements on \na going concern basis \n \n(b) Adoption of new and revised standards \nChanges in accounting policies on initial \napplication of Accounting Standards \n \nThe Group has adopted all of the new and revised \nAccounting Standards issued by the Australian \nAccounting Standards Board (AASB) that are \nrelevant to its operations and effective for annual \nreporting periods beginning on 1 July 2021. \n \n(c) Statement of compliance \nThe financial report was authorised by the board \nof directors for issue on 29 September 2022. \n \nThe consolidated financial report is a general \npurpose financial report which has been prepared \nin \naccordance \nwith \nAustralian \nAccounting \nStandards, \nincluding \nthe \nAccounting \nInterpretations, \nissued \nby \nthe \nAustralian \nAccounting Standards Board (‘AASB’) and the \nCorporations Act 2001.

The classification is determined by both: \n• \nthe entity’s business model for managing \nthe financial asset \n• \nthe contractual cash flow characteristics of \nthe financial asset  \nAll income and expenses relating to financial \nassets that are recognised in profit or loss are \npresented within finance costs, finance income \nor other financial items, except for impairment of \ntrade receivables which is presented within \nother expenses.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubsequent measurement of financial assets  \nFinancial assets are measured at amortised \ncost if the assets meet the following conditions \n(and are not designated as FVTPL):  \n• \nthey are held within a business model \nwhose objective is to hold the financial \nassets and collect its contractual cash flows \n• \nthe contractual terms of the financial assets \ngive rise to cash flows that are solely \npayments of principal and interest on the \nprincipal amount outstanding  \nImpairment of financial assets  \nAASB \n9’s \nimpairment \nrequirements \nuse \nforward-looking \ninformation \nto \nrecognise \nexpected credit losses – the ‘expected credit \nloss (ECL) model’.  Instruments included loans \nand other debt-type financial assets measured \nat amortised cost and FVOCI, trade receivables, \ncontract assets recognised and measured \nunder AASB 15 and loan commitments and \nsome financial guarantee contracts (for the \nissuer) that are not measured at fair value \nthrough profit or loss.  \n \nThe Group considers a range of information \nwhen assessing credit risk and measuring \nexpected credit losses, including past events, \ncurrent conditions, reasonable and supportable \nforecasts that affect the expected collectability \nof the future cash flows of the instrument. In \napplying this approach, a distinction is made \nbetween: \n• \nfinancial \ninstruments \nthat \nhave \nnot \ndeteriorated significantly in credit quality \nsince initial recognition or that have low \ncredit risk (‘Stage 1’) and  \n• \nfinancial instruments that have deteriorated \nsignificantly in credit quality since initial \nrecognition and whose credit risk is not low \n(‘Stage 2’). \nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022\n42\nPEAKO LIMITED"
