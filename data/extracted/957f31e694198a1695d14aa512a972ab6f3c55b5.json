      "text": "MESSAGE TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS\nMore than a decade ago, Aptiv recognized that demands \nfor a safer, greener and more connected world would \nreshape the future of the automotive industry, and since \nthat time we have continued to reﬁne and execute our \nstrategy to capitalize on these megatrends. While the \nrecent pandemic and supply chain challenges tested our \nresilience, our ability to meet customer demands and \nachieve record new bookings conﬁrmed the strength of \nour portfolio, the commitment of our global workforce \nand the value of our mission.\nToday, the megatrends are accelerating, driven by the \ngrowing appeal of feature-rich, highly electriﬁed vehicles. \nOur ability to enable these advanced features at a price \nconsumers can afford is a testament to our capabilities. \nWe are uniquely positioned as the industry’s only full-\nsystem solutions provider, which enables us to optimize \nthe performance and cost of the solutions we develop. \nEach day, our products help customers solve their \ntoughest challenges, support the sustainability of our \nplanet and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. \nWhile we are proud of the resilient and innovative \ncompany that we have built, we are even more excited \nabout how we are positioned for the future. \nDEMAND ACCELERATING FOR ELECTRIFIED, \nFEATURE-RICH VEHICLES\nDuring 2022, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) accounted \nfor approximately 10 percent of new-vehicle production, \nreﬂecting continued strong growth driven by more \nstringent government regulations and increasing \nconsumer demand. As a result, we expect the market for \nhigh-voltage electriﬁcation to increase by more than  \n20 percent annually between now and 2030.\nThe demand for higher levels of vehicle safety also \nincreased, which is reﬂected in almost 20 percent of \nnew vehicles built including Level 2 or higher advanced \ndriver-assistance systems (ADAS). Multiple OEMs have \nnow launched hands-free driving applications, many \nof which are enabled by Aptiv solutions that deliver \ngreater levels of efﬁciency, ﬂexibility and robustness \nacross the broadest possible range of driving scenarios.\n2022 also saw a step-function increase in OEMs \nbeginning the transition to next-generation hardware \nand software architectures. By 2030, we expect that \nnearly 1 out of every 4 vehicles produced will use a \nhighly centralized, software-deﬁned architecture \napproach similar to the one Aptiv has been developing.\nA CLEAR PATH FORWARD\nAptiv is leading the transformation in advanced \nvehicle architectures. This effort has been informed \nby the experience of launching more than 200 BEV \narchitecture platforms and 60 high-complexity,  \nsoftware-intensive programs across more than  \n20 OEMs — all while maintaining exceptional levels  \nof quality and delivery.\nOur Smart Vehicle Architecture™ (SVA™) solution, \nintroduced in 2017, comprises hardware and software \nbuilding blocks designed to efﬁciently enable new \nsoftware-deﬁned functionality. We have worked with \nmultiple global OEMs on advanced development \nprograms. In doing so, we have leveraged our expertise \nin both the “brain” (software and compute) and \nthe “nervous system” (power and data distribution) of \nthe vehicle to serve as a trusted technology partner. \nThis resulted in more than $4 billion in new SVA™ \nbusiness awards during 2022 — up signiﬁcantly from \nless than $1 billion total when we entered the year. We \ncontinue to be recognized for our innovation. In 2022, \nwe won our 25th Automotive News PACE Award for the \ncentral vehicle controller, a key component of SVA™.\nAt the same time, Aptiv’s high-voltage solutions are \nreducing weight and mass while also improving range \nand enabling faster charging — critical factors for \nBEV adoption. We have a comprehensive high-voltage \nportfolio, which we expanded during 2022 to include \nintegrated power electronics. This solution combines six \ndevices into one while also hosting battery management \nsystem software, and we won our ﬁrst program to \ndeliver this integrated solution to a major OEM.\nDuring 2022, Aptiv also acquired an 85 percent \nequity stake in Intercable Automotive Solutions, a \npioneer in the design and manufacture of high-voltage \npower distribution and interconnect technology. The \ncompany’s industry-leading busbar technologies \nenhance our high-voltage product portfolio, and \nIntercable Automotive is able to leverage Aptiv’s  \nglobal scale and manufacturing footprint.\nTHE NEXT CHAPTER FOR APTIV\nConsumers increasingly are demanding advanced, \nsoftware-enabled features, which need to be supported \nacross the full life cycle of the vehicle. This requires \na continued evolution of the in-vehicle software \narchitecture, as well as the development tools and \nprocesses OEMs use to enable these solutions."

Our global scale and regional service model enabl\na es us to\nengineer globally and execute regionally to serve the largest OEMs, which are seeking suppliers that can serve them on a\nworldwide basis. Our foot\nf\npr\nt\nint also enabl\na es us to adapt\na\nto the regional design variations the global OEMs require while also\nserving key growth market OEMs.\nOur Industry\nThe automotive technology and components industry\nr provides critical technologies, components, systems, subsystems\nand modules to OEMs for\nf\nthe manufaf ctur\nt\ne of new vehicles, as well as to the aftf ermarket for\nf\nuse as replacement parts for\nf\ncurrent\nproduction and older vehicles. In addition, the industry\nr is increasingly progressing towards softf ware-defif ned vehicles becoming\ncritical elements of the overall automotive ecosystem. Overall, we expect long-term growth of global vehicle sales and\nproduction in the OEM market. In 2022, the industry\nr experienced increased global customer sales and production schedules,\ndespite the ongoing adverse impacts of global supply chain disrupt\nr\nions and increased global inflf ationary\nr pressures. Global\nautomotive vehicle production increased 5% (5% on an Aptiv weighted market basis, which represents global vehicle\nproduction weighted to the geographi\na\nc regions in which the Company generates its revenue) frf om 2021 to 2022, reflf ecting\nincreased vehicle production of 10% in North America, 3% in China and 8% in South America, our smallest region, and a\ndecrease of 1% in Europe. Demand for\nf\nautomotive components in the OEM market is generally a func\nf\ntion of the number of\nnew vehicles produced in response to consumer demand, which is primarily driven by macro-economic faf ctors such as credit\navailabi\na lity, interest rates, fue\nf\nl prices, consumer confif dence, employment and other trends. Although OEM demand is tied to\nactua\nt\nl vehicle production, participants in the automotive technology and components industry\nr also have the opportuni\nt\nty to grow\nthrough increasing product content per vehicle by fur\nf\nther penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets,\ngaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets. We believe that evolving entrants into the global\ntransportation industry\nr such as mobility providers, electric vehicle developers and smart cities will provide additional markets\nfor\nf\nour advanced technologies. We believe that as a company with a global presence and advanced technology, engineering,\nmanufaf ctur\nt\ning and customer support capa\na\nbi\na lities, we are well-positioned to benefif t frf om these opportuni\nt\nties.\nWe believe that continuously increasing societal demands have created the three “mega-trends” that serve as the basis for\nf\nthe next wave of market-driven automotive technology advancement. We aim to continue developing leading edge technology\nfoc\nf\nused on addressing these mega-trends, and appl\na\ny that technology toward products with sustainabl\na e margins that enabl\na e our\ncustomers, both OEMs and others, to produce distinctive market-leading products. We have identifif ed a core portfol\nf io of\nproducts that draw on our technical strengths and align with these mega-trends where we believe we can provide difff ef rentiation\nto our customers.\nSaf\nS\nef . The fif rst mega-trend, “Safef ,” represents technologies aimed not just at protecting vehicle occupants when\na crash occurs, but those that actua\nt\nlly proactively reduce the risk of a crash occurring. OEMs continue to foc\nf\nus on\nimproving occupant and pedestrian safef ty in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory\nr requirements in various\nmarkets. As a result, suppliers are foc\nf\nused on developing technologies aimed at protecting vehicle occupants when\na crash occurs, as well as advanced driver assistance systems that reduce driver distractions and automated safef ty\nfef atur\nt\nes that proactively mitigate the risk of a crash occurring. Examples of new and alternative technologies that\nincorpor\nr\nate sophisticated detection and advanced softf ware for\nf\ncollision avoidance include lane departur\nt\ne warning\nand centering systems, adapt\na ive crui\nr se control and trafff if c jam assist, and driver and cabi\na n monitoring systems.\nGr\nG een. The second mega-trend, “Green,” represents technologies designed to help reduce emissions, increase\nfue\nf\nl economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles. Green is a key mega-trend today because of the\nconvergence of several issues: climate change, volatility in oil prices, an increasing number of vehicles in use\nworldwide and recent and pending regulation in every\nr region regarding fue\nf\nl economy and greenhouse gas (“GHG”)\nemissions. OEMs continue to foc\nf\nus on improving fue\nf\nl efff if ciency and reducing emissions in order to meet\nincreasingly stringent regulatory\nr requirements in various markets. On a worldwide basis, the relevant authorities in\nthe largest markets in which we operate have already institut\nt ed regulations requiring reductions in emissions and/or\nincreased fue\nf\nl economy. In many cases, other authorities have initiated legislation or regulation that would fur\nf\nther\ntighten the standards through 2023 and beyond. Based on the current regulatory\nr environment, we believe that\nOEMs, including those in the U.S. and China, will be subject to requirements for\nf\neven greater reductions in carbon\nr\ndioxide (“CO2”) emissions over the next ten years.

These and other standards will require meaningful\nf\ninnovation as OEMs and suppliers are challenged to\nfif nd ways to improve engine management, electrical power consumption, vehicle weight and integration of electric\nvehicles and alternative technologies. As a result, suppliers are developing innovations that result in signifif cant\nimprovements in fue\nf\nl economy, emissions and perfor\nf\nmance frf om internal combustion engines and electric vehicles.\nAt the same time, suppliers are also developing and marketing new and alternative technologies that support\nelectric vehicles, hybrid vehicles and fue\nf\nl cell products to improve fue\nf\nl economy and emissions. We are developing\nkey enabl\na ing technologies in the areas of vehicle charging and vehicle power distribution and control that are\nessential to the introduction of our customers’ electrifif ed vehicle platfor\nf\nms.

The technology content of vehicles continues to increase as consumers demand\ngreater safef ty, personalization, infot\nf ainment, productivity and convenience while driving, which in tur\nt\nn leads to\nincreasing demand for\nf\nelectrical architectur\nt\ne as a founda\nf\ntion for\nf\nthis content. Also with increased smart device\nusage in vehicles, driver distractions can be dramatically increased, which in tur\nt\nn results in greater risk of\naccidents. We are pioneering vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrf astruc\nr\ntur\nt\ne (V2I) communication\ntechnologies which enabl\na e vehicles to detect and signal danger, reducing vehicle collisions and improving driver\nsafef ty, while also maintaining connectivity to an increasing number of devices inside and outside of vehicles. We\nalso utilize advanced connectivity solutions such as over-the-air (OTA) technology that enabl\na e vehicles to receive\nsoftf ware updates remotely and collect market-relevant data frf om connected vehicles.\nWe expect these mega-trends to continue to create growth and opportuni\nt\nty for\nf\nus.

Although the terms and conditions vary\nr frf om customer to customer, they\ntypically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for\nf\ntheir requirements of specifif c components\nsupplied for\nf\nparticular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products frf om us. These relationships\ntypically extend over the lifef of the related vehicle. Prices are negotiated with respect to each business award, which may be\nsubject to adjustments under certain circumstances, such as commodity or for\nf\neign exchange escalation/de-escalation clauses or\nfor\nf\ncost reductions achieved by us. The terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products\nsupplied; in most cases, the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offf ef red by the OEM to the end-user of\nthe vehicle. We may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the OEM recalls its vehicles for\nf\ndefef cts\nattributabl\na e to our products.\nIndividual purchase orders are terminabl\na e for\nf\ncause or non-perfor\nf\nmance and, in most cases, upon our insolvency and\ncertain change of control events. In addition, many of our OEM customers have the option to terminate for\nf\nconvenience on\ncertain programs, which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the lifef of the vehicle program, and issue\npurchase contracts for\nf\nless than the duration of the vehicle program, which potentially reduces our profif t margins and increases\nthe risk of our losing fut\nf ur\nt\ne sales under those purchase contracts. We manufaf ctur\nt\ne and ship based on customer release\nschedules, normally provided on a weekly basis, which can vary\nr due to cyclical automobile production or dealer inventory\nr\nlevels.\nAlthough customer programs typically extend to fut\nf ur\nt\ne periods, and although there is an expectation that we will supply\ncertain levels of OEM production during such fut\nf ur\nt\ne periods, customer agreements including appl\na\nicabl\na e terms and conditions\ndo not necessarily constitut\nt e fif rm orders. Firm orders are generally limited to specifif c and authorized customer purchase order\nreleases placed with our manufaf ctur\nt\ning and distribution centers for\nf\nactua\nt\nl production and order ful\nf fif llment.

To achieve these\ncommitments, we are targeting:\n•\nReducing Scope 1 and 2 abs\na\nolute CO2e emissions by 25% between the baseline year (2019) and 2025;\n•\nMaintaining annual certifif cation of all maja or manufaf ctur\nt\ning sites to the ISO 14001 standard;\n•\nCertifyi\nf ng ten of the most energy-intensive sites to the ISO 50001 certifif cation by 2025;\n•\nSourcing 100% of electricity for\nf\noperations frf om renewabl\na e sources by 2030; and\n•\nDelivering only carbon-\nr\nneutral products by 2039, frf om sourcing to disposal.\nKey to achieving these goals is our global Environmental, Health and Safef ty and Sustainabi\na lity management system,\nwhich helps to keep us aligned with stringent environmental, health and safef ty regulations and provides a struc\nr\ntur\nt\ne for\nf\ncontinuous improvement. This system appl\na\nies to all Aptiv sites, which means that in some countries our procedures go beyond\nlocal regulations and requirements.

RISK FACTORS\nSet for\nf\nth below are certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely afff ef ct our results of operations or fif nancial\ncondition and cause our actua\nt\nl results to difff ef r materially frf om those expressed in for\nf\nward-looking statements made by the\nCompany. Also refef r to the Cautionary\nr Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Infor\nf\nmation in this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Business Environment and Economic Conditions\nDisi rupt\nu it ons in\ni\nth\nt e suppl\nu\nyl of raw matet rialsl and oth\nt er suppl\nu\nil es th\nt at we and our custom\nt\nersr use in\ni\nour productst may\nadversr elyl afff ef ct our profif ti abi\nt\nli il ti yt .y\nWe and our customers use a broad range of materials and supplies, including copper and other metals, petroleum-based\nresins, chemicals, electronic components and semiconductors. A signifif cant disrupt\nr\nion in the supply of these materials for\nf\nany\nreason could decrease our production and shipping levels, which could materially increase our operating costs and materially\ndecrease our profif t margins.\nWe, as with other component manufaf ctur\nt\ners in the automotive industry,\nr\nship products to our customers’ vehicle assembly\nplants throughout the world so they are delivered on a “j“ ust-in-time” basis in order to maintain low inventory\nr levels. Our\nsuppliers also use a similar method. However, this “j“ ust-in-time” method makes the logistics supply chain in our industry\nr very\nr\ncomplex and very\nr vulnerabl\na e to disrupt\nr\nions.\nSuch disrupt\nr\nions could be caused by any one of a myriad of potential problems, such as closures of one of our or our\nsuppliers’ plants or critical manufaf ctur\nt\ning lines due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns or faf ilures, electrical outages, fif res,\nexplosions or political upheaval, as well as logistical complications due to weather, global climate change, volcanic erupt\nr\nions,\nor other natur\nt\nal or nuclear disasters, delayed customs processing, the spread of an infef ctious disease, virus\nr\nor other widespread\nillness and more. Additionally, as we foc\nf\nus operations in best cost countries, the risk for\nf\nsuch disrupt\nr\nions is heightened. The\nlack of any single subcomponent necessary\nr to manufaf ctur\nt\ne one of our products could for\nf\nce us to cease production, potentially\nfor\nf\na prolonged period. Similarly, a potential quality issue could for\nf\nce us to halt deliveries while we validate the products. Even\nwhere products are ready to be shipped, or have been shipped, delays may arise befor\nf\ne they reach our customer. Our customers\nmay halt or delay their production for\nf\nthe same reason if one of their other suppliers faf ils to deliver necessary\nr components. This\nmay cause our customers, in tur\nt\nn to suspend their orders, or instruc\nr\nt us to suspend delivery,\nr\nof our products, which may\nadversely afff ef ct our fif nancial perfor\nf\nmance.\nWhen we faf il to make timely deliveries in accordance with our contractua\nt\nl obligations, we generally have to abs\na\norb\nr our\nown costs for\nf\nidentifyi\nf ng and solving the “root cause” problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or\nproducts. Generally, we must also carry\nr the costs associated with “catching up,” such as overtime and premium frf eight.\nAdditionally, if we are the cause for\nf\na customer being for\nf\nced to halt production, the customer may seek to recoup all of its\nlosses and expenses frf om us. These losses and expenses could be signifif cant, and may include consequential losses such as lost\nprofif ts. Any supply-chain disrupt\nr\nion, however small, could potentially cause the complete shutdown of an assembly line of one\nof our customers, and any such shutdown that is due to causes that are within our control could expose us to material claims of\ncompensation. Where a customer halts production because of another supplier faf iling to deliver on time, there can be no\nassurance we will be ful\nf ly compensated, if at all.\nDue to various faf ctors that are beyond our control, there are currently global supply chain disrupt\nr\nions, including a\nworldwide semiconductor supply shortage. The semiconductor supply shortage, due in part to increased demand across multiple\nindustries, is impacting production in automotive and other industries. We anticipate these supply chain disrupt\nr\nions will persist\nin 2023. We, along with most automotive component manufaf ctur\nt\ners that use semiconductors, have been unabl\na e to ful\nf ly meet\nthe vehicle production demands of OEMs because of events which are outside our control, including but not limited to, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the global semiconductor shortage, fif res in our suppliers’ faf cilities, unprecedented weather events in the\nsouthwestern United States, and other extraordinary\nr events. Although we are working closely with suppliers and customers to\nminimize any potential adverse impacts of these events, some of our customers have indicated that they expect us to bear at\nleast some responsibility for\nf\ntheir lost production and other costs. While no assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome\nof these customer expectations or any other fut\nf ur\nt\ne claims, we do not currently believe a loss is probabl\na e. We will continue to\nactively monitor all direct and indirect potential impacts of these supply chain disrupt\nr\nions, and will seek to aggressively\nmitigate and minimize their impact on our business.\nIn addition, we are carryi\nr ng critical inventory\nr items and key components, and we continue to procure productive, raw\nmaterial and non-critical inventory\nr components in order to satisfy\nf our customers’ vehicle production schedules. However, as a\nresult of our customers’ recent production volatility and cancellations, our balance of productive, raw and component material\ninventories has increased substantially frf om customary\nr levels as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. We will continue to actively\nmonitor and manage inventory\nr levels across all inventory\nr types in order to maximize both supply continuity and the efff if cient\nuse of working capi\na tal.\n16"

During the second half of\n2020, many of these impacts aba\na\nted, resulting in increased sales and profif tabi\na lity frf om the levels observed earlier in 2020. In\n2021, our manufaf ctur\nt\ning faf cilities were not impacted by prolonged shutdowns directly resulting frf om the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBeginning late in the fif rst quarter of 2022 and continuing into the second quarter, various regions in China, including\nregions where Aptiv has operations, were subjected to lockdowns imposed by governmental authorities to mitigate the spread of\nCOVID-19. In response, our manufaf ctur\nt\ning faf cilities located in these areas implemented measures designed to minimize the\nimpacts of any shutdowns. Despite these measures, industry-\nr\nwide production interrupt\nr\nions adversely impacted our sales and\nprofif tabi\na lity beginning at the end of the fif rst quarter and continuing throughout much of the second quarter. Most of the\nlockdowns were eased in China late in the second quarter, however many lockdowns were re-imposed and production was once\nagain adversely impacted for\nf\nportions of the four\nf\nth quarter of 2022. Estimated total indirect and direct adverse impacts to\nrevenue as a result of these lockdowns during 2022 was appr\na\noximately $270 million. The overall duration and impact, as well\nas possible reoccurrence, of these lockdowns in China or other regions, or other measures aimed at containing and mitigating\nthe efff ef cts of the pandemic, including renewed travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, social distancing orders, “lockdown”\norders and shutdowns of non-essential activities, remain uncertain and may adversely impact our results of operations and cash\nflf ows in fut\nf ur\nt\ne periods. Other than these production interrupt\nr\nions in China, our manufaf ctur\nt\ning faf cilities were not impacted by\nprolonged shutdowns directly resulting frf om the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022.\nDue to the continuing uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic, including potential fut\nf ur\nt\ne governmental actions and\neconomic impacts, it is possible that these adverse impacts could reoccur, resulting in fur\nf\nther adverse impacts on our fut\nf ur\nt\ne\noperating earnings and cash flf ows. In addition, to the extent the faf ctors indicated above\na\nadversely afff ef ct our business, fif nancial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flf ows, they may also have the efff ef ct of heightening many of the other risk faf ctors in\nthis section.\nTh\nT e cy\nc clil cal nature of autom\nt\notit ve salel s and productit on can adversr elyl afff ef ct our busin\ni ess.\nOur business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers. Automotive\nsales and production are highly cyclical and, in addition to general economic conditions, also depend on other faf ctors, such as\nconsumer confif dence and consumer prefef rences. Lower global automotive sales would be expected to result in substantially all\nof our automotive OEM customers lowering vehicle production schedules, which has a direct impact on our earnings and cash\nflf ows. In addition, automotive sales and production can be afff ef cted by labor\na\nrelations issues, regulatory\nr requirements, trade\nagreements, the availabi\na lity of consumer fif nancing, inflf ationary\nr pressures, interest rate volatility, supply chain disrupt\nr\nions and\nother faf ctors, including global health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic declines that result in a signifif cant\nreduction in automotive sales and production by our customers have in the past had, and may in the fut\nf ur\nt\ne have, an adverse\nefff ef ct on our business, results of operations and fif nancial condition.\nOur sales are also afff ef cted by inventory\nr levels and OEMs’ production levels. We cannot predict when OEMs will decide\nto increase or decrease inventory\nr levels or whether new inventory\nr levels will appr\na\noximate historical inventory\nr levels.\nUncertainty and other unexpected flf uctua\nt\ntions could have a material adverse efff ef ct on our business and fif nancial condition.\nA prolon\nl\nged economic downturn or economic uncertai\nt n\ni tyt couldl adversr elyl afff ef ct our busin\ni ess and cause us tot requiri e\nadditi it onal sources of f\nf if n\ni ancin\ni g, which may not be availi abl\nl\nel .e\nOur sensitivity to economic cycles and any related flf uctua\nt\ntion in the businesses of our customers or potential customers\nmay have a material adverse efff ef ct on our fif nancial condition, results of operations or cash flf ows. Global automotive vehicle\nproduction increased 5% (5% on an Aptiv weighted market basis, which represents global vehicle production weighted to the\ngeographi\na\nc regions in which the Company generates its revenue) frf om 2021 to 2022, reflf ecting increased vehicle production of\n10% in North America, 3% in China and 8% in South America, our smallest region, and a decrease of 1% in Europe.\nUncertainty relating to global or regional economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business. A prolonged\ndowntur\nt\nn in the global or regional automotive industry,\nr\nor a signifif cant change in product mix due to consumer demand, could\nrequire us to shut down plants or result in impairment charges, restruc\nr\ntur\nt\ning actions or changes in our valuation allowances\n17"

Furthermore, the rapi\na dly evolving natur\nt\ne of the markets in which we\ncompete has attracted, and may continue to attract, new and disrupt\nr\nive entrants frf om outside the traditional automotive supply\nindustry,\nr\nparticularly in countries such as China or in areas of evolving vehicle technologies such as automated driving\ntechnologies and advanced softf ware. These entrants may seek to gain access to certain vehicle technology and component\nmarkets. Any of these new competitors may develop and introduce technologies that gain greater customer or consumer\nacceptance, which could adversely afff ef ct the fut\nf ur\nt\ne growth of the Company. Additionally, consolidation in the automotive\nindustry\nr may lead to decreased product purchases frf om us. As a result, our sales levels and margins could be adversely afff ef cted\nby pricing pressures frf om OEMs and pricing actions of competitors. These faf ctors led to selective resourcing of business to\ncompetitors in the past and may also do so in the fut\nf ur\nt\ne.\nIn addition, any of our competitors may for\nf\nesee the course of market development more accurately than us, develop\nproducts that are superior to our products, have the abi\na lity to produce similar products at a lower cost than us, adapt\na\nmore\nquickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements or develop or introduce new products or solutions\nbefor\nf\ne we do, particularly related to potential transfor\nf\nmative technologies such as autonomous driving solutions. As a result,\nour products may not be abl\na e to compete successful\nf ly with their products. These trends may adversely afff ef ct our sales as well as\nthe profif t margins on our products. If we do not continue to innovate to develop or acquire new and compelling products that\ncapi\na talize upon new technologies, this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nIfI we do not respon\ns\nd appropriatet lyl ,y th\nt e evolutit on of th\nt e autom\nt\notit ve in\ni dustrt y\nr tow\nt\nards auton\nt\nomous vehiclel s and mobili il ti yt\non demand services couldl adversr elyl afff ef ct our busin\ni ess.\nThe automotive industry\nr is increasingly foc\nf\nused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies, with the\ngoal of developing and introducing a commercially-viabl\na e, ful\nf ly automated driving experience.

There has also been an increase in consumer prefef rences for\nf\nmobility\non demand services, such as car- and ride-sharing, as opposed to automobile ownership, which may result in a long-term\nreduction in the number of vehicles per capi\na ta. These evolving areas have also attracted increased competition frf om entrants\noutside the traditional automotive industry.\nr\nIf we do not continue to respond quickly and efff ef ctively to this evolutionary\nr process\nour results of operations could be adversely impacted.\n18"

Furthermore,\nbecause our customers typically have no obligation to purchase a specifif c quantity of parts, a decline in the production levels of\nany of our maja or customers, particularly with respect to models for\nf\nwhich we are a signifif cant supplier, could reduce our sales\nand thereby adversely afff ef ct our fif nancial condition, operating results and cash flf ows.\nOur busin\ni ess in\ni\nCh\nC in\ni a isi subject tot aggressive compe\nm\ntit ti it on and isi sensiti it ve tot economic and marke\nr\nt conditi it ons.\nMaintaining a strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. The automotive\ntechnology and components market in China is highly competitive, with competition frf om many of the largest global\nmanufaf ctur\nt\ners and numerous smaller domestic manufaf ctur\nt\ners. As the size of the Chinese market continues to increase over the\nlong-term, we anticipate that additional competitors, both international and domestic, will seek to enter the Chinese market and\nthat existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share. Increased competition may result in price\nreductions, reduced margins and our inabi\na lity to gain or hold market share. Additionally, there have been periods of increased\nmarket volatility and moderations in the level of economic growth in China, which resulted in periods of lower automotive\nproduction growth rates in China than those previously experienced. Our business in China is sensitive to economic and market\nconditions that drive automotive sales volumes in China and may be impacted if there are reductions in vehicle demand in\nChina. For example, in 2022, various regions in China, including regions where Aptiv has operations, were subjected to\nlockdowns imposed by governmental authorities to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, which resulted in industry-\nr\nwide\nproduction interrupt\nr\nions during portions of the year. Estimated total indirect and direct adverse impacts to revenue as a result of\nthese lockdowns during 2022 was appr\na\noximately $270 million. If we are unabl\na e to maintain our position in the Chinese market\nor if vehicle sales in China continue to experience minimal growth or decrease, our business and fif nancial results could be\nmaterially adversely afff ef cted.\nWe\nW may not realil zi e salel s repr\ne\nesentet d by awarded busin\ni ess.\nWe estimate awarded business using certain assumptions, including projected fut\nf ur\nt\ne sales volumes. Our customers\ngenerally do not guarantee volumes. In addition, awarded business may include business under arrangements that our customers\nhave the right to terminate without penalty. Therefor\nf\ne, our actua\nt\nl sales volumes, and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that\nwe derive frf om such sales, are not committed. If actua\nt\nl production orders frf om our customers are not consistent with the\nprojections we use in calculating the amount of our awarded business, we could realize substantially less revenue over the lifef\nof these projects than the currently projected estimate.\nCon\nC\ntit n\ni ued pricin\ni g pressures,s OE\nO M\nE\ncost reductit on in\ni iti it atit ves and th\nt e abili il ti yt of OE\nO M\nE\ns\nM tot re-source or cancel vehiclel\nprograms may resultl in\ni\nlow\nl\ner th\nt an antit cipat\ni\net d margi\nr n\ni s,s or los\nl\nses,s which may have a sign\ni\nifi if cant negat\ne\nit ve im\ni pac\nm\nt on our\nbusin\ni ess.\nCost-cutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing. Our customer supply\nagreements generally require step-downs in component pricing over the period of production, typically one to three percent per\nyear. In addition, our customers oftf en reserve the right to terminate their supply contracts for\nf\nconvenience, which enhances their\nabi\na lity to obtain price reductions. OEMs have also possessed signifif cant leverage over their suppliers, including us, because the\nautomotive technology and component supply industry\nr is highly competitive, serves a limited number of customers, has a high\nfif xed cost base and historically has had excess capa\na\ncity. Based on these faf ctors, and the faf ct that our customers’ product\nprograms typically last a number of years and are anticipated to encompass large volumes, our customers are abl\na e to negotiate\nfaf vorabl\na e pricing. Accordingly, as a Tier I supplier, we are subject to substantial continuing pressure frf om OEMs to reduce the\nprice of our products. For example, our customer supply agreements generally provide for\nf\nannual reductions in pricing of our\nproducts over the period of production. It is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify\nf as OEMs\npursue restruc\nr\ntur\nt\ning and cost-cutting initiatives. If we are unabl\na e to generate sufff if cient production cost savings in the fut\nf ur\nt\ne to\nofff sf et price reductions, our gross margin and profif tabi\na lity would be adversely afff ef cted.

In addition, our inabi\na lity or the inabi\na lity of\nany of our customers, our suppliers or our customers’ suppliers to negotiate an extension of a collective bargaining agreement\nupon its expiration could reduce our sales and harm our profif tabi\na lity.

Approximately 64% of our net revenue for\nf\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 came frf om sales\noutside the U.S., which were primarily invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we expect net revenue frf om non-\nU.S. markets to continue to represent a signifif cant portion of our net revenue. Accordingly, signifif cant changes in currency\nexchange rates, particularly the Euro and Chinese Yuan (Renminbi), could cause flf uctua\nt\ntions in the reported results of our\nbusinesses’ operations that could negatively afff ef ct our results of operations. Price increases caused by currency exchange rate\nflf uctua\nt\ntions may make our products less competitive or have an adverse efff ef ct on our margins. Currency exchange rate\nflf uctua\nt\ntions may also disrupt\nr\nthe business of our suppliers by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more\ndifff if cult to fif nance.\nHistorically, we have reduced our currency exposure by aligning our costs in the same currency as our revenues or, if that\nis impracticabl\na e, through fif nancial instrum\nr\nents that provide offf sf ets or limits to our exposures, which are opposite to the\nunderlying transactions. However, any measures that we may implement to reduce the efff ef ct of volatile currencies and other\nrisks of our global operations may not be efff ef ctive.\nWe\nW fac\nf\ne risi ks associatet d witi h\nt\ndoin\ni g busin\ni ess in\ni\nvarious natit onal and loc\nl\nal jurisi dictit ons.\nThe maja ority of our manufaf ctur\nt\ning and distribution faf cilities are in Mexico, China and other countries in Asia Pacifif c,\nEastern and Western Europe, South America and Northern Afrf ica. We also purchase raw materials and other supplies frf om\nmany difff ef rent countries around the world. For the year ended December 31, 2022, appr\na\noximately 64% of our net revenue came\nfrf om sales outside the U.S. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business globally, including:\n•\nexposure to local economic, political and labor\na\nconditions;\n•\nunexpected changes in laws, regulations, economic and trade sanctions, trade or monetary\nr or fif scal policy, including\ninterest rates, for\nf\neign currency exchange rates and changes in the rate of inflf ation in the U.S. and other countries;\n•\ntarifff sf , quotas, customs and other import or export restrictions and other trade barriers;\n•\nexpropriation and nationalization;\n•\ndifff if culty of enfor\nf\ncing agreements, collecting receivabl\na es and protecting assets through certain non-U.S. legal\nsystems;\n•\nreduced technology, data or intellectua\nt\nl property protections;\n•\nlimitations on repatriation of earnings;\n•\nwithholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n•\ninvestment restrictions or requirements;\n•\nviolence and civil unrest in local countries, including the conflf ict between Ukraine and Rus\nR\nsia; and\n•\ncompliance with the requirements of an increasing body of appl\na\nicabl\na e anti-bribery\nr laws, including the U.S. Foreign\nCorrupt\nr\nPractices Act, the U.K. Bribery\nr Act and similar laws of various other countries.\nAdditionally, our global operations may also be adversely afff ef cted by political events, terrorist events and hostilities,\ncomplications due to natur\nt\nal, nuclear or other disasters or the spread of an infef ctious disease, virus\nr\nor other widespread illness.\nFor instance, the conflf ict between Ukraine and Rus\nR\nsia caused the U.S., European Union and other nations to implement broad\neconomic sanctions against Rus\nR\nsia. These countries may impose fur\nf\nther sanctions and take other actions as the situa\nt\ntion\ncontinues. While the sanctions announced to date have not had a material adverse impact on us, any fur\nf\nther sanctions imposed\nor actions taken by these countries, and any retaliatory\nr measures by Rus\nR\nsia in response, including restrictions on energy\nsupplies frf om Rus\nR\nsia to countries in the region and asset expropriations, could increase our costs, reduce our sales and earnings\nor otherwise have an adverse efff ef ct on our operations.\nUkraine and Rus\nR\nsia are signifif cant global producers of raw materials used in our supply chain, including copper,\naluminum, palladium and neon gases. Disrupt\nr\nions in the supply and volatility in the price of these materials and other inputs\nproduced by Ukraine or Rus\nR\nsia, including increased logistics costs and longer transit times, could adversely impact our business\nand results of operations.

Any of the impacts mentioned above\na\n, among others, could adversely afff ef ct our business, business\nopportuni\nt\nties, results of operations, fif nancial condition and cash flf ows.\nIn addition, the global spread of COVID-19, which originated in late 2019 and was later declared a pandemic by the\nWorld Health Organization in March 2020, caused certain governmental authorities worldwide to initiate “lockdown” orders for\nf\nall non-essential activities, which at times, included extended shutdowns of businesses in the impacted regions. This includes\nthe lockdowns in China that occurred in 2022, as discussed fur\nf\nther above\na\n. This or any fur\nf\nther political or governmental\ndevelopments or health concerns in China or Mexico and other countries in which we operate could result in social, economic\nand labor\na\ninstabi\na lity. These uncertainties could have a material adverse efff ef ct on the continuity of our business and our results\nof operations and fif nancial condition.\nExisting frf ee trade laws and regulations, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, provide certain benefif cial\nduties and tarifff sf for\nf\nqualifyi\nf ng imports and exports, subject to compliance with the appl\na\nicabl\na e classifif cation and other\nrequirements. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tarifff sf or\ntaxes on imports frf om countries where we manufaf ctur\nt\ne products, such as China and Mexico, could have a material adverse\nefff ef ct on our business and fif nancial results. For example, in October 2022, the U.S. government imposed additional export\ncontrol restrictions targeting the export, re-export or transfef r of,f among other products, certain advanced computing\nsemiconductors, semiconductor manufaf ctur\nt\ning items and related technology to China, which could fur\nf\nther disrupt\nr\nsupply chains\nand adversely impact our business. Furthermore, management continues to monitor the volatile geopolitical environment to\nidentify,\nf\nquantify\nf and assess threatened duties, taxes or other business restrictions which could adversely afff ef ct our business\nand fif nancial results.\nIncreasing our manufaf ctur\nt\ning foot\nf\npr\nt\nint in Asian markets, including China, and our business relationships with Asian\nautomotive manufaf ctur\nt\ners are important elements of our long-term strategy. In addition, our strategy includes increasing\nrevenue and expanding our manufaf ctur\nt\ning foot\nf\npr\nt\nint in lower-cost regions. As a result, our exposure to the risks described above\na\nmay be greater in the fut\nf ur\nt\ne.

While we believe that\nsuch transactions are an integral part of our long-term strategy, there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities.\nAssessing a potential growth opportuni\nt\nty involves extensive due diligence. However, the amount of infor\nf\nmation we can obtain\nabout\na\na potential growth opportuni\nt\nty may be limited, and we can give no assurance that new business ventur\nt\nes, acquisitions,\nand strategic alliances will positively afff ef ct our fif nancial perfor\nf\nmance or will perfor\nf\nm as planned. For instance, our acquisition\nof Wind River, is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which may result in the faf ilure to realize the expected benefif ts of\nthe transaction. We expect Wind River to become a founda\nf\ntional element of executing our business strategy as Wind River’s\nindustry-\nr\nleading softf ware services are complementary\nr to our existing portfol\nf io of softf ware solutions, advanced compute and\nsmart architectur\nt\nes and we intend to establ\na ish Wind River as the cornerstone of our softf ware strategy.

These capa\na\nbi\na lities are also susceptible to interrupt\nr\nions (including those caused by systems faf ilures, cyber-\nattacks and other natur\nt\nal or man-made incidents or disasters), which may be prolonged or go undetected. Cyber-attacks are\ncontinually increasing in their frf equency, sophistication and intensity.

Although we continue to employ capa\na\nbi\na lities, processes and other security\nand privacy measures designed to reduce risks of cyber-attacks against our products, such measures may not provide abs\na\nolute\nsecurity (and, in tur\nt\nn, privacy) and may not sufff if ciently mitigate all potential risks under all scenarios. Failure of such products\nto efff ef ctively protect against attacks targeted at our products can negatively afff ef ct our brand and harm our business, prospects,\ncustomers, fif nancial condition and operating results.\nFurther, engineering and maintaining security for\nf\nour systems and products may require signifif cant costs.

Each vehicle manufaf ctur\nt\ner has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liabi\na lity actions relating\nto its suppliers. However, as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the\nvehicle assembly func\nf\ntions, OEMs continue to look to their suppliers for\nf\ncontribution when faf ced with recalls and product\nliabi\na lity claims. A recall claim brought against us, or a product liabi\na lity claim brought against us in excess of our availabl\na e\ninsurance, may have a material adverse efff ef ct on our business. OEMs also require their suppliers to guarantee or warrant their\nproducts and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties.

In\nresponse to the conflf ict, the European Union (the “E.U.”), United States (the “U.S.”) and other nations implemented broad\neconomic sanctions against Rus\nR\nsia. These countries may impose fur\nf\nther sanctions and take other actions as the situa\nt\ntion\ncontinues.\nGiven the sanctions put in place by the E.U., U.S. and other governments, which restrict our abi\na lity to conduct business in\nRus\nR\nsia, we initiated a plan to exit our maja ority owned subsidiary\nr in Rus\nR\nsia in the second quarter of 2022. As a result, the\nCompany determined that this subsidiary,\nr\nwhich is reported within the Signal and Power Solutions segment, met the held for\nf\nsale criteria as of December 31, 2022. Consequently, for\nf\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a pre-tax\ncharge of $51 million to impair the carryi\nr ng value of the Rus\nR\nsian subsidiary’\nr\ns net assets to faf ir value, which was recorded\nprimarily within cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations. Approximately $25 million of these charges were\nattributabl\na e to the noncontrolling interest based on the noncontrolling shareholder’s economic interest. The remaining assets\nand liabi\na lities, which are de minimis, were reclassifif ed to other current assets and other current liabi\na lities, respectively, in the\nconsolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\nUkraine and Rus\nR\nsia are also signifif cant global producers of raw materials used in our supply chain, including copper,\naluminum, palladium and neon gases. Disrupt\nr\nions in the supply and volatility in the price of these materials and other inputs\nproduced by Ukraine or Rus\nR\nsia, including increased logistics costs and longer transit times, could adversely impact our business\nand results of operations. In addition, in July 2022, the E.U. introduced an emergency natur\nt\nal gas rationing plan to reduce the\nuse of natur\nt\nal gas by businesses and in public buildings in E.U. member states frf om August 2022 through March 2023 in order\nto replenish gas reserves. Among other impacts, this may cause widespread economic disrupt\nr\nions during this time period,\nincluding potential shutdowns at our suppliers’ or customers’ faf cilities in the region. The conflf ict has also increased the\npossibility of cyberattacks occurring, which could either directly or indirectly impact our operations. Furthermore, the conflf ict\nhas caused our customers to analyze their continued presence in the region and fut\nf ur\nt\ne customer production plans in the region\nremain uncertain.\n34"

The global spread of COVID-19, which originated in late 2019 and was later declared a pandemic\nby the World Health Organization in March 2020, negatively impacted the global economy, disrupt\nr\ned supply chains and created\nsignifif cant volatility in global fif nancial markets in 2020 with various adverse impacts continuing to date.\nThe direct adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Aptiv, which primarily afff ef cted us in the fif rst half of 2020,\nincluded extended work stoppages and travel restrictions at our faf cilities and those of our customers and suppliers, decreases in\nconsumer demand and vehicle production schedules, disrupt\nr\nions to our supply chain and other adverse global economic\nimpacts, particularly those resulting frf om temporary\nr governmental “lockdown” orders for\nf\nall non-essential activities, initially in\nthe fif rst quarter of 2020 in China and subsequently in Europe, North America and South America. During the second half of\n2020, many of these impacts aba\na\nted, resulting in increased sales and profif tabi\na lity frf om the levels observed earlier in 2020. In\n2021, our manufaf ctur\nt\ning faf cilities were not impacted by prolonged shutdowns directly resulting frf om the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBeginning late in the fif rst quarter of 2022 and continuing into the second quarter, various regions in China, including\nregions where Aptiv has operations, were subjected to lockdowns imposed by governmental authorities to mitigate the spread of\nCOVID-19. In response, our manufaf ctur\nt\ning faf cilities located in these areas implemented measures designed to minimize the\nimpacts of any shutdowns. Despite these measures, industry-\nr\nwide production interrupt\nr\nions adversely impacted our sales and\nprofif tabi\na lity beginning at the end of the fif rst quarter and continuing throughout much of the second quarter. Most of the\nlockdowns were eased in China late in the second quarter, however many lockdowns were re-imposed and production was once\nagain adversely impacted for\nf\nportions of the four\nf\nth quarter of 2022. Estimated total indirect and direct adverse impacts to\nrevenue as a result of these lockdowns during 2022 was appr\na\noximately $270 million. The overall duration and impact, as well\nas possible reoccurrence, of these lockdowns in China or other regions, or other measures aimed at containing and mitigating\nthe efff ef cts of the pandemic, including renewed travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, social distancing orders, “lockdown”\norders and shutdowns of non-essential activities, remain uncertain and may adversely impact our results of operations and cash\nflf ows in fut\nf ur\nt\ne periods. Other than these production interrupt\nr\nions in China, our manufaf ctur\nt\ning faf cilities were not impacted by\nprolonged shutdowns directly resulting frf om the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022.\nCertain direct and indirect adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have persisted to date and are expected to\ncontinue in 2023, including the worldwide semiconductor supply shortage and global supply chain disrupt\nr\nions. As a result, due\nto the continuing uncertainties surrounding of the COVID-19 pandemic, including potential fut\nf ur\nt\ne governmental actions and\neconomic impacts, it is possible that these adverse impacts could reoccur, resulting in fur\nf\nther adverse impacts on our fut\nf ur\nt\ne\noperating earnings and cash flf ows. We will continue to actively monitor all direct and indirect potential impacts of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and will seek to aggressively mitigate and minimize their impact on our business.\nGlobal supplyl chain disi ruptions. Due to various faf ctors that are beyond our control, there are currently global supply\nchain disrupt\nr\nions, including a worldwide semiconductor supply shortage. The semiconductor supply shortage, due in part to\nincreased demand across multiple industries, is impacting production in automotive and other industries. We anticipate these\nsupply chain disrupt\nr\nions will persist in 2023. We, along with most automotive component manufaf ctur\nt\ners that use\nsemiconductors, have been unabl\na e to ful\nf ly meet the vehicle production demands of OEMs because of events which are outside\nour control, including but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic, the global semiconductor shortage, fif res in our suppliers’\nfaf cilities, unprecedented weather events in the southwestern United States, and other extraordinary\nr events. Although we are\nworking closely with suppliers and customers to minimize any potential adverse impacts of these events, some of our customers\nhave indicated that they expect us to bear at least some responsibility for\nf\ntheir lost production and other costs.

Our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our\ncustomers. Automotive sales depend on a number of faf ctors, including global and regional economic conditions. Global\nautomotive vehicle production increased 5% (5% on an Aptiv weighted market basis, which represents global vehicle\nproduction weighted to the geographi\na\nc regions in which the Company generates its revenue, “AWM”) frf om 2021 to 2022,\nreflf ecting increased vehicle produc\nd\ntion of 10% in North America, 3% in China and 8% in South America, our smallest region,\nand a decrease of 1% in Europe.

Financial Statements and Supplementary\nr Data of this Annual Report for\nf\nfif nancial infor\nf\nmation\nconcerning principal geographi\na\nc areas.\nEconomic volatility or weakness in North America, Europe, China or, to a lesser extent, South America, could result in a\nsignifif cant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers, which would have an adverse efff ef ct on our business,\nresults of operations and fif nancial condition. In 2022, global inflf ationary\nr pressures both reduced consumer demand for\nf\nautomotive vehicles and increased the price of inputs to our products, which has adversely impacted our profif tabi\na lity and this\ntrend is expected to continue in 2023. There is also potential that geopolitical faf ctors could adversely impact the U.S. and other\neconomies, and specifif cally the automotive sector. In particular, changes to international trade agreements, such as the United\nStates-Mexico-Canada Agreement or other political pressures could afff ef ct the operations of our OEM customers, resulting in\nreduced automotive production in certain regions or shiftf s in the mix of production to higher cost regions. Increases in interest\nrates could also negatively impact automotive production as a result of increased consumer borrowing costs or reduced credit\navailabi\na lity. Additionally, economic weakness may result in shiftf s in the mix of fut\nf ur\nt\ne automotive sales (frf om vehicles with\nmore content such as luxury\nr vehicles, truc\nr\nks and sport utility vehicles toward smaller passenger cars). While our diversifif ed\ncustomer and geographi\na\nc revenue base, along with our flf exible cost struc\nr\ntur\nt\ne, have well positioned us to withstand the impact\nof industry\nr downtur\nt\nns and benefif t frf om industry\nr uptur\nt\nns, shiftf s in the mix of global automotive production to higher cost\nregions or to vehicles with less content could adversely impact our profif tabi\na lity.\nKe\nK y\ne growtht mark\nr e\nk tst . There have been periods of increased market volatility and moderation in the level of economic\ngrowth in China, which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in China than those previously\nexperienced. Automotive production in China experienced growth of 3% in 2022, which fol\nf lows growth of 2% in 2021. Despite\nthe moderation in the level of economic growth in China, rising income levels in China and other key growth markets are\nexpected to result in stronger growth rates in these markets over the long-term. Our strong global presence, and presence in\nthese markets, has positioned us to experience above\na\n-market growth rates over the long-term. We continue to expand our\nestabl\na ished presence in key growth markets, positioning us to benefif t frf om the expected long-term growth opportuni\nt\nties in these\nregions. We are capi\na talizing on our long-standing relationships with the global OEMs and fur\nf\nther enhancing our positions with\nthe key growth market OEMs to continue expanding our worldwide leadership. We continue to build upon our extensive\ngeographi\na\nc reach to capi\na talize on faf st-growing automotive markets. We believe that our presence in best cost countries\npositions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shiftf s towards the key\ngrowth markets.\nWe have a strong local presence in China, including a maja or manufaf ctur\nt\ning base and well-establ\na ished customer\nrelationships. Each of our business segments have operations and sales in China. Our business in China remains sensitive to\neconomic and market conditions that impact automotive sales volumes in China, and may be afff ef cted if the pace of growth\nslows as the Chinese market matur\nt\nes or if there are reductions in vehicle demand in China, as have recently been experienced as\na result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental lockdowns.

Many OEMs are continuing to adopt global vehicle platfor\nf\nms to increase standardization, reduce per\nunit cost and increase capi\na tal efff if ciency and profif tabi\na lity. As a result, OEMs are selecting suppliers that have the capa\na\nbi\na lity to\nmanufaf ctur\nt\ne products on a worldwide basis, as well as the flf exibility to adapt\na\nto regional variations.

We are also subject to risks associated\nwith actions taken by governmental authorities to impose changes in laws or regulations that restrict certain business operations,\ntrade or travel in response to a pandemic or widespread outbr\nt\neak of an illness. For instance, as described above\na\n, the conflf ict\nbetween Ukraine and Rus\nR\nsia has created numerous economic uncertainties, including the potential for\nf\nfur\nf\nther sanctions against\nRus\nR\nsia, the impact on the global supply chain for\nf\nraw materials produced in each country,\nr\nas well as increased logistics costs\nand transit times, the impact of the E.U. natur\nt\nal gas rationing plan and the actions of automotive OEMs and suppliers as they\nrelate to production plans in each country.\nr\nThe impacts of any of these faf ctors mentioned above\na\n, among others, could adversely\nafff ef ct our business, business opportuni\nt\nties, results of operations, fif nancial condition and cash flf ows.\nIn addition, the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and variants thereof in recent years, has had various direct and\nindirect adverse impacts on our global operations, the automotive industry\nr and economies around the world. Although certain\nof the adverse impacts of the pandemic aba\na\nted during the second half of 2020, other direct and indirect adverse impacts\ncontinued throughout 2021 and 2022, such as the overall supply chain disrupt\nr\nions, including the global semiconductor supply\nshortage and the regional lockdowns imposed by governmental authorities in China during portions of 2022. These impacts\ncontinue to negatively afff ef ct the global economy and automotive industry,\nr\nand we anticipate that certain impacts will persist in\n2023. As a result, we are unabl\na e to predict the ultimate impact to our business due to a number of evolving faf ctors, including\nthe duration and spread of the pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on economic activity, our supply chain, consumer demand\nand vehicle production schedules, and the actions of governmental authorities across the globe.\nFurthermore, existing frf ee trade laws and regulations, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, provide\ncertain benefif cial duties and tarifff sf for\nf\nqualifyi\nf ng imports and exports, subject to compliance with the appl\na\nicabl\na e classifif cation\nand other requirements. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions,\ntarifff sf or taxes on imports frf om countries where we manufaf ctur\nt\ne products, such as China and Mexico, could have a material\nadverse efff ef ct on our business and fif nancial results. For example, in October 2022, the U.S. government imposed additional\nexport control restrictions targeting the export, re-export or transfef r of,f among other products, certain advanced computing\nsemiconductors, semiconductor manufaf ctur\nt\ning items and related technology to China, which could fur\nf\nther disrupt\nr\nsupply chains\nand adversely impact our business. Furthermore, management continues to monitor the volatile geopolitical environment to\nidentify,\nf\nquantify\nf and assess threatened duties, taxes or other business restrictions which could adversely afff ef ct our business\nand fif nancial results.\nProduct development. The automotive technology and components industry\nr is highly competitive and is characterized by\nrapi\na dly changing technology, evolving industry\nr standards and changes in customer needs. Our abi\na lity to anticipate changes in\ntechnology and regulatory\nr standards and to successful\nf ly develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely and cost\ncompetitive basis will be a signifif cant faf ctor in our abi\na lity to remain competitive. To compete efff ef ctively in the automotive\ntechnology and components industry,\nr\nwe must be abl\na e to develop and launch new products to meet our customers’ demands in\na timely manner.

We have a team of appr\na\noximately 22,000 scientists, engineers and technicians foc\nf\nused on developing leading\nproduct solutions for\nf\nour key markets, located at 11 maja or technical centers in China, Germany, India, Mexico, Poland,\nSingapor\na\ne and the United States. Our total investment in research and development, including engineering, was appr\na\noximately\n$1.5 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion for\nf\nthe years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which includes\nappr\na\noximately $379 million, $320 million and $303 million of co-investment by customers and government agencies. Each year\nwe share some engineering expenses with OEMs and government agencies which generally ranges frf om 20% to 30% of\nengineering expenses. This level of co-investment supports product development, accelerates the pace of innovation and\nreduces the risk associated with successful\nf\ncommercialization of technological breakthroughs. We also encourage “open\ninnovation” and collabor\na\nate extensively with peers in the industry,\nr\ngovernment agencies and academic institut\nt ions.\nIn the past, suppliers oftf en incurred the initial cost of engineering, designing and developing automotive component parts,\nand recovered their investments over time by including a cost recovery\nr component in the price of each part based on expected\nvolumes. Recently, we and many other suppliers have negotiated for\nf\ncost recovery\nr payments independent of volumes. This\ntrend reduces our economic risk.\nWe utilize a Technology Advisory\nr Council, a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders, which helps us\nanticipate cutting-edge technology trends and guides our product strategies and investments in technology with a foc\nf\nus on\ndeveloping advanced technologies to drive growth and fos\nf\nter innovation. This independent perspective assists Aptiv in pursuing\ninvestments in the right technologies that create the most value for\nf\nall of its stakeholders. We believe that our engineering and\ntechnical expertise, together with our emphasis on continuing research and development, allow us to use the latest technologies,\nmaterials and processes to solve problems for\nf\nour customers and to bring new, innovative products to market. We believe that\ncontinued engineering activities are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products. Given our strong\nfif nancial discipline, we seek to efff ef ctively manage fif xed costs and efff if ciently rationalize capi\na tal spending by critically\nevaluating the profif t potential of new and existing customer programs, including investment in innovation and technology. We\nmaintain our engineering activities around our foc\nf\nused product portfol\nf io and allocate our capi\na tal and resources to those products\nwith distinctive technologies. We expect expenditur\nt\nes for\nf\nresearch and development activities, including engineering, net of co-\ninvestment, to be appr\na\noximately $1.2 billion for\nf\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, which includes increased expenditur\nt\nes as a\nresult of our acquisition of Wind River.\nWe maintain a large portfol\nf io of appr\na\noximately 9,500 patents and protective rights in the operation of our business as of\nDecember 31, 2022. While no individual patent or group of patents, taken alone, is considered material to our business, taken in\nthe aggregate, these patents provide meaningful\nf\nprotection for\nf\nour products and technical innovations. Similarly, while our\ntrademarks are important to identify\nf our position in the industry,\nr\nwe do not believe that any of these are individually material to\nour business. We are actively pursuing marketing opportuni\nt\nties to commercialize and license our technology to both automotive\nand non-automotive industries and we have selectively taken licenses frf om others to support our business interests. These\nactivities fos\nf\nter optimization of intellectua\nt\nl property rights.\nPricing. Cost-cutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing. Our\ncustomer supply agreements generally require step-downs in component pricing over the periods of production and OEMs have\nhistorically possessed signifif cant leverage over their outside suppliers because the automotive component supply industry\nr is\nfrf agmented and serves a limited number of automotive OEMs. Our profif tabi\na lity depends in part on our abi\na lity to generate\nsufff if cient production cost savings in the fut\nf ur\nt\ne to offf sf et price reductions. In addition, during recent years, global economies and\nour industry\nr were subjected to signifif cant inflf ationary\nr cost pressures, and these pressures are expected to continue in 2023. We\ncontinue to work with our customers, both through price recoveries and adjustments as well as fut\nf ur\nt\ne pricing adjustments as\ncontracts renew, to mitigate the impact of these inflf ationary\nr pressures on our results of operations.\nWe are foc\nf\nused on maintaining a low fif xed cost struc\nr\ntur\nt\ne that provides us flf exibility to remain profif tabl\na e at all points of\nthe traditional vehicle industry\nr production cycle. As a result, appr\na\noximately 97% of our hourly workfor\nf\nce is located in best cost\ncountries. Furthermore, we have substantial operational flf exibility by leveraging a large workfor\nf\nce of contingent workers,\nwhich represented appr\na\noximately 24% of the hourly workfor\nf\nce as of December 31, 2022. However, we will continue to adjust\nour cost struc\nr\ntur\nt\ne and optimize our manufaf ctur\nt\ning foot\nf\npr\nt\nint in response to changes in the global and regional automotive\nmarkets and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering, as evidenced by our ongoing\nrestruc\nr\ntur\nt\ning programs foc\nf\nused on reducing our global overhead costs and on the continued rotation of our manufaf ctur\nt\ning\nfoot\nf\npr\nt\nint to best cost locations in Europe. As we continue to operate in a cyclical industry\nr that is impacted by movements in the\nglobal and regional economies, we continually evaluate opportuni\nt\nties to fur\nf\nther refif ne our cost struc\nr\ntur\nt\ne. Assuming constant\nproduct mix and pricing, based on our 2022 results, we estimate that our EBITDA breakeven level would be reached if we\nexperienced a 45% downtur\nt\nn to current product volumes.\nWe have a strong balance sheet with gross debt of appr\na\noximately $6.5 billion and substantial availabl\na e liquidity of\nappr\na\noximately $4.0 billion consisting of cash and cash equivalents, and availabl\na e fif nancing under our Revolving Credit Facility\n38"

Although we engage in\nextensive product quality programs and processes, it is possible that we may be adversely afff ef cted in the fut\nf ur\nt\ne if the pace of\nthese recalls continues.\nEf\nE ff if cient use of capital. The global vehicle components industry\nr is generally capi\na tal intensive and a portion of a supplier’s\ncapi\na tal equipment is frf equently utilized for\nf\nspecifif c customer programs. Lead times for\nf\nprocurement of capi\na tal equipment are\nlong and typically exceed start of production by one to two years. Substantial advantages exist for\nf\nsuppliers that can leverage\ntheir prior investments in capi\na tal equipment or amortize the investment over higher volume global customer programs.\nIndus\nI\ntrt y\nr consolidation and disi ruptive new entrt antst . Consolidation among worldwide OEMs and suppliers is expected to\ncontinue as these companies seek to achieve operating synergies and value stream efff if ciencies, acquire complementary\nr\ntechnologies and build stronger customer relationships. Additionally, the rise of advanced softf ware and technologies in vehicles\nhas attracted new and disrupt\nr\nive entrants frf om outside the traditional automotive supply industry.\nr\nThese entrants may seek to\ngain access to certain vehicle technology and component markets. Any of these new competitors may develop and introduce\ntechnologies that gain greater customer or consumer acceptance, which could adversely afff ef ct the fut\nf ur\nt\ne growth of the\nCompany. We believe companies with strong balance sheets and fif nancial discipline are in the best position to take advantage\nof these trends.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nOur total net sales during the year ended December 31, 2022 were $17.5 billion, an increase of appr\na\noximately 12%\ncompared to 2021. Our overall volumes increased 14%, which was driven, in part, by increased global automotive production\nof 5% (5% on an AWM basis) for\nf\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021 production rates. Despite the volatility\ncaused by the global supply chain disrupt\nr\nions throughout 2022, our overall lean cost struc\nr\ntur\nt\ne, along with continued above\na\n-\nmarket sales growth in all regions, has enabl\na ed us to achieve strong levels of operating income, while continuing to strategically\ninvest in the fut\nf ur\nt\ne.\nAptiv typically experiences flf uctua\nt\ntions in revenue due to changes in OEM production schedules, vehicle sales mix and\nthe net of new and lost business (which we refef r to collectively as volume), increased prices attributabl\na e to escalation clauses in\nour supply contracts for\nf\nrecovery\nr of increased commodity costs (which we refef r to as commodity pass-through), flf uctua\nt\ntions in\nfor\nf\neign currency exchange rates (which we refef r to as “FX”), contractua\nt\nl reductions of the sales price to the OEM (which we\nrefef r to as contractua\nt\nl price reductions) and engineering changes. Changes in sales mix can have either faf vorabl\na e or unfaf vorabl\na e\nimpacts on revenue. Such changes can be the result of shiftf s in regional growth, shiftf s in OEM sales demand, as well as shiftf s in\nconsumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration. For instance, a shiftf in sales demand faf voring a\nparticular OEM’s vehicle model for\nf\nwhich we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue. A shiftf in\nregional sales demand toward certain markets could faf vorabl\na y impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large\nmarket share in those regions, which in tur\nt\nn would be expected to have a faf vorabl\na e impact on our revenue.\nWe typically experience (as described below) flf uctua\nt\ntions in operating income due to:\n•\nVolume, net of contractua\nt\nl price reductions—changes in volume offf sf et by contractua\nt\nl price reductions (which\ntypically range frf om 1% to 3% of net sales) and changes in mix;\n•\nOperational perfor\nf\nmance—changes to costs for\nf\nmaterials and commodities or manufaf ctur\nt\ning and engineering\nvariances; and\n•\nOther—i\nr\nncluding restruc\nr\ntur\nt\ning costs and any remaining variances not included in Volume, net of contractua\nt\nl price\nreductions or Operational perfor\nf\nmance.\nThe automotive technology and component supply industry\nr is traditionally subject to inflf ationary\nr pressures with respect\nto raw materials and labor\na\nwhich may place operational and profif tabi\na lity burdens on the entire supply chain. For instance, the\nindustry\nr has recently been subjected to increased pricing pressures, specifif cally in relation to copper and petroleum-based resin\nproducts, which have experienced signifif cant volatility in price. We have also been impacted globally by increased overall\n39"

In addition, we expect semiconductor supply\ncost and commodity cost volatility to have a continual impact on fut\nf ur\nt\ne earnings and/or operating cash flf ows. As such, we\ncontinually seek to mitigate both inflf ationary\nr pressures and our material-related cost exposures using a number of appr\na\noaches,\nincluding combining purchase requirements with customers and/or other suppliers, using alternate suppliers or product designs,\nnegotiating cost reductions and/or commodity cost contract escalation clauses into our vehicle manufaf ctur\nt\ner supply contracts\nand hedging.

Subsequently, Aptiv Global Financing Limited (“AGFL”), a wholly-owned subsidiary\nr\nof Aptiv PLC, executed a joinder agreement to the Credit Agreement, which allows it to act as a borrower under the Credit\nAgreement, and a guaranty supplement, under which AGFL guarantees the obligations under the Credit Agreement, subject to\ncertain exceptions.\nThe Credit Agreement was entered into in March 2011 and has been subsequently amended and restated on several\noccasions, most recently on June 24, 2021. The June 2021 amendment, among other things, (1) refif nanced and replaced the\nexisting term loan A and revolver with a new term loan A that matur\nt\nes in 2026, and a new fif ve-year revolving credit faf cility\nwith aggregate commitments of $2 billion, (2) utilized the Company’s existing sustainabi\na lity-linked metrics and commitments,\nthat, if achieved, would change the faf cility fef e and interest rate margins as described below, and (3) establ\na ished the leverage\nratio maintenance covenant that requires the Company to maintain total net leverage (as calculated in accordance with the\nCredit Agreement) of less than 3.5 to 1.0 (or 4.0 to 1.0 for\nf\nfour\nf\nful\nf l fif scal quarters fol\nf lowing completion of material\nacquisitions, as defif ned in the Credit Agreement) and allowed for\nf\ndividends and other payments on equity. Losses on\nmodifif cation of debt totaled $1 million and $4 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively,\nrelated to the June 2021 amendment and May 2020 amendment. Aptiv paid amendment fef es of $6 million and $18 million\nduring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are reflf ected as fif nancing activities in the\nconsolidated statements of cash flf ows.\nThe Tranche A Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility matur\nt\ne on June 24, 2026. Beginning in the third quarter of\n2022, Aptiv was obligated to begin making quarterly principal payments on the Tranche A Term Loan according to the\namortization schedule in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also contains an accordion fef atur\nt\ne that permits Aptiv to\nincrease, frf om time to time, the aggregate borrowing capa\na\ncity under the Credit Agreement by up to an additional $1 billion\nupon Aptiv’s request, the agreement of the lenders participating in the increase, and the appr\na\noval of the Administrative Agent.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were no amounts drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility and less than $1 million in\nletters of credit were issued under the Credit Agreement. Letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement reduce availabi\na lity\nunder the Revolving Credit Facility. No amounts were drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022.\nLoans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at Aptiv’s option, at either (a) the Administrative Agent’s Alternate Base\nRate (“ABR” as defif ned in the Credit Agreement) or (b) the London Interba\nr\nnk Offf ef red Rate (the “Adjusted LIBO Rate” as\ndefif ned in the Credit Agreement) (“LIBOR”) plus in either case a percentage per annum as set for\nf\nth in the tabl\na e below (the\n“Applicabl\na e Rate”). The June 2021 amendment also contains provisions to faf cilitate the replacement of the LIBOR-based rate\nwith a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) based rate upon the discontinuation or unavailabi\na lity of LIBOR. The\nApplicabl\na e Rates under the Credit Agreement on the specifif ed dates are set for\nf\nth below:\nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021\nLIBOR plus\nABR plus\nLIBOR plus\nABR plus\nRevolving Credit Facility .....................................................\n1.06 %\n0.06 %\n1.10 %\n0.10 %\nTranche A Term Loan ..........................................................\n1.105 %\n0.105 %\n1.125 %\n0.125 %\nUnder the June 2021 amendment, the Applicabl\na e Rate under the Credit Agreement, as well as the faf cility fef e, may\nincrease or decrease frf om time to time based on changes in the Company’s credit ratings and whether the Company achieves or\nfaf ils to achieve certain sustainabi\na lity-linked targets with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and workplace safef ty. Such\nadjustments may be up to 0.04% per annum on interest rate margins on the Revolving Credit Facility, 0.02% per annum on\ninterest rate margins on the Tranche A Term Loan and 0.01% per annum on the faf cility fef e. Accordingly, the interest rate is\nsubject to flf uctua\nt\ntion during the term of the Credit Agreement based on changes in the ABR, LIBOR, changes in the\nCompany’s corpor\nr\nate credit ratings or whether the Company achieves or faf ils to achieve its sustainabi\na lity-linked targets.

These\njudgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our evaluation of trends in the industry,\nr\ninfor\nf\nmation provided by our customers and infor\nf\nmation availabl\na e frf om other outside sources, as appr\na\nopriate.\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:f\n•\nIt requires us to make assumptions about\na\nmatters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate, and\n•\nChanges in the estimate or difff ef rent estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our\nfif nancial condition or results of operations.\nAcquisi iti it ons and Oth\nt er Tr\nT ansactit ons\nIn accordance with the accounting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards\nCodifif cation (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Com\nC\nbinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its\nidentifif abl\na e assets and liabi\na lities based on estimated faf ir values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to\nthe assets and liabi\na lities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. The process to estimate faf ir value described herein is generally\nappl\na\nicabl\na e to other transactions, including the faf ir value estimates used in establ\na ishing the identifif abl\na e assets, liabi\na lities and\ngoodwill recorded upon for\nf\nmation of Motional, Aptiv’s autonomous driving joint ventur\nt\ne, and the resulting equity method\ninvestment recorded on Aptiv’s balance sheet.\nAn acquisition may include a contingent consideration component. The faf ir value of the contingent consideration is\nestimated as of the date of the acquisition and is recorded as part of the purchase price. This estimate is updated in fut\nf ur\nt\ne\nperiods and any changes in the estimate, which are not considered an adjustment to the purchase price, are recorded in our\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nAn acquisition may also include a redeemabl\na e noncontrolling interest component. The faf ir value of the noncontrolling\ninterest is recorded to temporary\nr equity in the consolidated balance sheet and is estimated as of the date of acquisition using a\nMonte Carlo simulation appr\na\noach, which includes several assumptions including estimated fut\nf ur\nt\ne profif tabi\na lity, expected\nvolatility rate and risk frf ee rate. The redeemabl\na e noncontrolling interest is then adjusted each reporting period for\nf\nthe income\n(loss) attributabl\na e to the noncontrolling interest, and for\nf\nany measurement period adjustments necessary\nr to record the\nredeemabl\na e noncontrolling interest at the higher of its redemption value, assuming it was redeemabl\na e at the reporting date, or its\ncarryi\nr ng value. Any measurement period adjustments are recorded to retained earnings, with a corresponding increase or\nreduction to net income attributabl\na e to Aptiv.\nWe use all availabl\na e infor\nf\nmation to estimate faf ir values. We typically engage outside appr\na\naisal fif rms to assist in the faf ir\nvalue determination of identifif abl\na e intangible assets and any other signifif cant assets or liabi\na lities. We adjust the preliminary\nr\npurchase price allocation, as necessary,\nr\nup to one year aftf er the acquisition closing date as we obtain more infor\nf\nmation\nregarding asset valuations and liabi\na lities assumed.\nOur purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions\nand to appl\na\ny judgment to estimate the faf ir value of acquired assets and liabi\na lities. Management estimates the faf ir value of assets\nand liabi\na lities based upon quoted market prices, the carryi\nr ng value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation\ntechniques, including discounted cash flf ows and market multiple analyses. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur\nwhich could afff ef ct the accuracy of our faf ir value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry\nr economic faf ctors and\nbusiness strategies.\nOther estimates used in determining faf ir value include, but are not limited to, fut\nf ur\nt\ne cash flf ows or income related to\nintangibles, market rate assumptions, actua\nt\nrial assumptions for\nf\nbenefif t plans and appr\na\nopriate discount rates. Our estimates of\nfaf ir value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonabl\na e, but that are inherently uncertain, and therefor\nf\ne, may not be\nrealized. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates, assumptions, and values reflf ected in the valuations will be\nrealized, and actua\nt\nl results could vary\nr materially.\nWar\nW\nrantyt Oblil gat\ni\nit ons and Pr\nP oduct Recalll Cos\nC\ntst\nEstimating warranty obligations requires us to for\nf\necast the resolution of existing claims and expected fut\nf ur\nt\ne claims on\nproducts sold.

If not, no fur\nf\nther goodwill impairment\ntesting is perfor\nf\nmed. If so, we perfor\nf\nm the step 1 test discussed hereaftf er. Our qualitative assessment involves signifif cant\nestimates, assumptions, and judgments, including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry\nr and market\nconditions, fif nancial perfor\nf\nmance of the Company, reporting unit specifif c events and changes in the Company’s share price.\nIf the faf ir value of the reporting unit is greater than its carryi\nr ng amount (step 1), goodwill is not considered to be\nimpaired. We estimate the faf ir value of our reporting units using a combination of a fut\nf ur\nt\ne discounted cash flf ow valuation\nmodel and, if possible, a comparabl\na e market transaction model. Estimating faf ir value requires the Company to make judgments\nabout\na\nappr\na\nopriate discount rates, growth rates, relevant comparabl\na e company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of\nexpected fut\nf ur\nt\ne cash flf ows. If the faf ir value of the reporting unit is less than its carryi\nr ng amount, an entity must record an\nimpairment charge based on the amount by which a reporting unit’s carryi\nr ng value exceeds its estimated faf ir value, limited to\nthe amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nWe review indefif nite-lived intangible assets for\nf\nimpairment annually or more frf equently if events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate the assets might be impaired.

A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our defef rred tax assets to the amount that\nis more likely than not to be realized. Changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may afff ef ct recorded defef rred\ntaxes in fut\nf ur\nt\ne periods.\nWhen establ\na ishing a valuation allowance, we consider fut\nf ur\nt\ne sources of taxabl\na e income such as “fut\nf ur\nt\ne reversals of\nexisting taxabl\na e temporary\nr difff ef rences, fut\nf ur\nt\ne taxabl\na e income exclusive of reversing temporary\nr difff ef rences and carryf\nr\nor\nf\nwards”\nand “tax planning strategies.” A tax planning strategy is defif ned as “an action that: is prude\nr\nnt and fef asible; an enterpr\nr\nise\nordinarily might not take, but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryf\nr\nor\nf\nward frf om expiring unused; and\nwould result in realization of defef rred tax assets.” In the event we determine it is more likely than not that the defef rred tax\nassets will not be realized in the fut\nf ur\nt\ne, the valuation adjustment to the defef rred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the\nperiod in which we make such a determination. The valuation of defef rred tax assets requires judgment and accounting for\nf\nthe\ndefef rred tax efff ef ct of events that have been recorded in the fif nancial statements or in tax retur\nt\nns and our fut\nf ur\nt\ne projected\nprofif tabi\na lity. Changes in our estimates, due to unfor\nf\neseen events or otherwise, could have a material impact on our fif nancial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe calculate our current and defef rred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could difff ef r frf om the actua\nt\nl\nresults reflf ected in income tax retur\nt\nns fif led in subsequent years. Adjustments based on fif led retur\nt\nns are recorded when\nidentifif ed. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by fef deral, state and for\nf\neign tax authorities. Our\nestimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, faf cts, and\ncircumstances existing at that time. We use a more-likely-than-not threshold for\nf\nfif nancial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax retur\nt\nn. We record a liabi\na lity for\nf\nthe difff ef rence between the\nbenefif t recognized and measured and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax retur\nt\nn. To the extent that our\nassessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made.\nWe report tax-related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. We do not believe there is a reasonabl\na e\nlikelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowance balances.

Additionally, the signifif cant accounting standards that have been adopted during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 are described.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks frf om changes in currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices. In order to\nmanage these risks, we operate a centralized risk management program that consists of entering into a variety of derivative\ncontracts with the intent of mitigating our risk to flf uctua\nt\ntions in currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We do not\nenter into derivative transactions for\nf\nspeculative or trading purpos\nr\nes.\nA discussion of our accounting policies for\nf\nderivative instrum\nr\nents is included in Note 2. Signifif cant Accounting Policies\nto the audited consolidated fif nancial statements included herein and fur\nf\nther disclosure is provided in Note 17. Derivatives and\nHedging Activities to the audited consolidated fif nancial statements included herein. We maintain risk management control\nsystems to monitor exchange and commodity risks and related hedge positions. Positions are monitored using a variety of\nanalytical techniques including market value and sensitivity analysis. The fol\nf lowing analyses are based on sensitivity tests,\nwhich assume instantaneous, parallel shiftf s in currency exchange rates and commodity prices. For options and instrum\nr\nents with\nnon-linear retur\nt\nns, appr\na\nopriate models are utilized to determine the impact of shiftf s in rates and prices.\nWe have currency exposures related to buying, selling and fif nancing in currencies other than the local currencies in which\nwe operate. Historically, we have reduced our exposure through fif nancial instrum\nr\nents (hedges) that provide offf sf ets or limits to\nour exposures, which are opposite to the underlying transactions. We also faf ce an inherent business risk of exposure to\ncommodity prices risks, and have historically offf sf et our exposure, particularly to changes in the price of various non-fef rrous\nmetals used in our manufaf ctur\nt\ning operations, through fif xed price purchase agreements, commodity swaps\na\nand option contracts.\nWe continue to manage our exposures to changes in currency rates and commodity prices using these derivative instrum\nr\nents.\nCu\nC rrency\nc Exc\nE\nhange Ratet Risi k\nCurrency exposures may impact fut\nf ur\nt\ne earnings and/or operating cash flf ows. We have currency exposures related to\nbuying, selling and fif nancing in currencies other than the local func\nf\ntional currencies in which we operate (“transactional\nexposure”). We also have currency exposures related to the translation of the fif nancial statements of our for\nf\neign subsidiaries\nthat use the local currency as their func\nf\ntional currency into U.S. dollars, the Company’s reporting currency (“translational\nexposure”). The impact of translational exposure is recorded within currency translation adjustment in the consolidated\nstatements of comprehensive income. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the for\nf\neign currency translation adjustment\nloss of $198 million was primarily due to the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar, which increased appr\na\noximately 5% in\nrelation to the Euro and 8% in relation to the Chinese Yuan Renminbi frf om December 31, 2021.\nAs described in Note 17. Derivatives and Hedging Activities to the audited consolidated fif nancial statements included\nherein, in order to manage certain translational exposure, we have designated the 2015 Euro-denominated Senior Notes and the\n2016 Euro-denominated Senior Notes as net investment hedges of the for\nf\neign currency exposure of our investments in certain\nEuro-denominated subsidiaries. We have also entered into for\nf\nward contracts designated as net investment hedges of the for\nf\neign\ncurrency exposure of our investments in certain Chinese Yuan Renminbi-denominated subsidiaries. The efff ef ctive portion of the\ngains or losses on instrum\nr\nents designated as net investment hedges are recognized within the cumulative translation adjustment\ncomponent in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income to offf sf et changes in the value of the net investment in these\nfor\nf\neign currency-denominated operations.\nIn some instances, we choose to reduce our transactional exposures through fif nancial instrum\nr\nents (hedges) that provide\nofff sf ets or limits to our exposures. Currently, our most signifif cant hedged currency exposures relate to the Mexican Peso,\nChinese Yuan Renminbi, Polish Zloty, Euro and Hungarian Forint. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 the net faf ir value\nliabi\na lity of all fif nancial instrum\nr\nents, including hedges and underlying transactions, with exposure to currency risk was\nappr\na\noximately $446 million and $876 million, respectively. The potential change in faf ir value for\nf\nsuch fif nancial instrum\nr\nents\nfrf om a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be a gain of appr\na\noximately $17 million and a\nloss of appr\na\noximately $34 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The potential change in faf ir value frf om a\nhypothetical 10% faf vorabl\na e change in quoted currency exchange rates would be a loss of appr\na\noximately $6 million and a gain\nof appr\na\noximately $43 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The impact of a 10% change in rates on faf ir\nvalue difff ef rs frf om a 10% change in the net faf ir value liabi\na lity due to the existence of hedges. The model assumes a parallel shiftf\nin currency exchange rates; however, currency exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that currency\nexchange rates change in a parallel faf shion may overstate the impact of changing currency exchange rates on assets and\nliabi\na lities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\n60"

The Credit Agreement carries\nan interest rate, at our option, on Tranche A Term Loan borrowings of either (a) the ABR plus 0.105% per annum, or\n(b) LIBOR plus 1.105% per annum, and on Revolving Credit Facility borrowings of either (a) the ABR plus 0.06% per annum,\nor (b) LIBOR plus 1.06% per annum, each of which include an adjustment resulting frf om the Company having met the\nsustainabi\na lity-linked targets for\nf\nthe 2021 calendar year.\nThe interest rate period with respect to the LIBOR interest rate option can be set at one-, three-, or six-months as selected\nby us in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement (or other period as may be agreed by the appl\na\nicabl\na e lenders), but\npayabl\na e no less than quarterly. We may elect to change the selected interest rate option over the term of the credit faf cilities in\naccordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY\nR\nDATA\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Aptiv PLC\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Aptiv PLC (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and\n2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, redeemabl\na e noncontrolling interest and\nshareholders’ equity and cash flf ows for\nf\neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes\nand fif nancial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively refef rred to as the “consolidated fif nancial\nstatements”). In our opinion, the consolidated fif nancial statements present faf irly, in all material respects, the fif nancial position\nof the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flf ows for\nf\neach of the three years\nin the period ended December 31, 2022, in confor\nf\nmity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over fif nancial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria establ\na ished in\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(2013 frf amework), and our report dated Februa\nr\nry\nr 8, 2023 expressed an unqualifif ed opinion thereon.\nBasis for\nf\nOpinion\nThese fif nancial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s fif nancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting fif rm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. fef deral securities laws and the appl\na\nicabl\na e\nrul\nr es and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perfor\nf\nm the\naudit to obtain reasonabl\na e assurance about\na\nwhether the fif nancial statements are frf ee of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or frf aud. Our audits included perfor\nf\nming procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the fif nancial\nstatements, whether due to error or frf aud, and perfor\nf\nming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the fif nancial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and signifif cant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the fif nancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonabl\na e basis for\nf\nour opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising frf om the current period audit of the consolidated fif nancial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the fif nancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated fif nancial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on\nthe critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nDescript\ni ion\nof the\nt\nMat\nM ter\nAs described in Notes 2 and 14, the Company establ\na ishes reserves for\nf\nuncertain tax positions for\nf\npositions that\nare taken on their income tax retur\nt\nns that might not be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. At\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company has recorded appr\na\noximately $224 million relating to uncertain tax positions.\nIn determining whether an uncertain tax position exists, the Company determines, based solely on its technical\nmerits, whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, and if so, a tax benefif t\nis measured on a cumulative probabi\na lity basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon the ultimate\nsettlement. The Company identifif es its certain and uncertain tax positions and then evaluates the recognition and\nmeasurement steps to determine the amount that should be recognized. The Company then evaluates uncertain\ntax positions in subsequent periods for\nf\nrecognition, de-recognition or re-measurement if changes have occurred,\nor when efff ef ctive settlement or expiration of the statut\nt e of limitations occurs.\n62"

      "text": "Auditing the uncertain tax positions is complex because of the judgmental natur\nt\ne of the tax accrua\nr\nls and various\nother tax retur\nt\nn positions that might not be sustained upon review by taxing authorities. The Company fif les tax\nretur\nt\nns in multiple jurisdictions and is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world due to\nits complex global foot\nf\npr\nt\nint. Taxing jurisdictions signifif cant to Aptiv include Barba\nr\ndos, China, Germany,\nIreland, Luxembourg, Mexico, South Korea, the U.K. and the U.S.\nHow\nH\nWe\nW\nAddressed\nthe\nt\nMat\nM ter\nin Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating efff ef ctiveness of controls related to\nthe recognition, measurement and the evaluation of changes in uncertain tax positions. This included testing\ncontrols over management’s review of the tax positions, their evaluation of whether they met the measurement\nthreshold and then recalculating the amounts recognized based upon a cumulative probabi\na lity assessment\nperfor\nf\nmed by management.\nOur audit procedures to test the Company’s uncertain tax positions included, among others, involvement of our\ntax profef ssionals, including transfef r pricing profef ssionals. This included evaluating tax opinions and third-party\ntransfef r pricing studi\nt\nes obtained by the Company and assessing the Company’s correspondence with the\nrelevant tax authorities. We analyzed the Company’s assumptions and data used to determine the amount of tax\nbenefif t to recognize and tested the accuracy of the calculations. Our testing also included the evaluation of the\nongoing positions and consideration of changes, the recording of penalties and interest and the ultimate\nsettlement and payment of certain tax matters.\nRevenue Recognition\nDescript\ni ion\nof the\nt\nMat\nM ter\nAs described in Notes 2 and 24, Aptiv occasionally enters into pricing agreements with its customers that\nprovide for\nf\nprice reductions, some of which are conditional upon achieving certain joint cost saving targets. In\naddition, frf om time to time, Aptiv makes payments to customers in conjunction with ongoing business. Revenue\nis recognized based on the agreed-upon price at the time of shipment, and sales incentives, allowances and\ncertain customer payments are recognized as a reduction to revenue at the time of the commitment to provide\nsuch incentives or make these payments. Certain other customer payments or upfrf ont fef es are considered to be a\ncost to obtain a contract as they are directly attributabl\na e to a contract, are incremental and management expects\nthe payments to be recoverabl\na e. In these cases, the customer payment is capi\na talized and amortized to revenue\nbased on the transfef r of goods and services to the customer for\nf\nwhich the upfrf ont payment relates. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, Aptiv has recorded $78 million related to these capi\na talized upfrf ont payments.\nAuditing the accounting for\nf\nand completeness of arrangements containing elements such as sales incentives,\nallowances and customer payments, including the appr\na\nopriate timing and presentation of adjustments to revenue\nas well as costs to obtain a contract is judgmental due to the unique faf cts and circumstances involved in each\nrevenue arrangement, as well as on-going commercial negotiations with customers.\nHow\nH\nWe\nW\nAddressed\nthe\nt\nMat\nM ter\nin Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating efff ef ctiveness of controls over the\nreview of customer contracts. This included testing controls over management’s process to identify\nf and evaluate\ncustomer contracts that contain sales incentives, allowances and customer payments that impact revenue\nrecognition.\nOur audit procedures to test the completeness of the Company’s identifif cation of such contracts included,\namong others, interviewing sales representatives who are responsible for\nf\nnegotiations with customers and\ntesting cash payments and credit memos issued to customers. To test management’s assessment of customer\ncontracts containing sales incentives, allowances and customer payments, our procedures included, among\nothers, selecting a sample of customer agreements, obtaining and reviewing source documentation, including\nmaster agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement, and evaluating the contract terms to\ndetermine the appr\na\nopriateness of the accounting treatment.\n63"

The acquisition was accounted for\nf\nas\na business combination and, as such, the Company measured the assets acquired and liabi\na lities assumed at their\nacquisition-date faf ir values, including the estimated faf ir values of the technology-related and customer-based\nintangible assets of $750 million and $630 million, respectively. The estimated faf ir value of these assets was\nbased on third-party valuations and management’s estimates, generally utilizing income and market appr\na\noaches.\nAuditing the Company's valuation of technology-related and customer-based intangible assets was complex and\nrequired signifif cant auditor judgment due to the high degree of subjectivity in evaluating certain assumptions\nrequired to estimate the faf ir value of these intangible assets.

      "text": "APTIV PLC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. GENERA\nR L\nGeneral and basis of presentation—“Aptiv,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refef r to Aptiv PLC (for\nf\nmerly\nknown as Delphi Automotive PLC), a public limited company for\nf\nmed under the laws of Jersey on May 19, 2011, which\ncompleted an initial public offf ef ring on November 22, 2011, and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company’s ordinary\nr shares\nare publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “APTV.”\nThe consolidated fif nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).\nNature of operations—Aptiv is a leading global technology and mobility architectur\nt\ne company primarily serving the\nautomotive sector. We deliver end-to-end mobility solutions enabl\na ing our customers' transition to more electrifif ed, softf ware-\ndefif ned vehicles. We design and manufaf ctur\nt\ne vehicle components and provide electrical, electronic and active safef ty\ntechnology solutions to the global automotive and commercial vehicle markets. Aptiv is one of the largest vehicle technology\nsuppliers and our customers include the 25 largest automotive original equipment manufaf ctur\nt\ners (“OEMs”) in the world. Aptiv\noperates 131 maja or manufaf ctur\nt\ning faf cilities and 11 maja or technical centers utilizing a regional service model that enabl\na es the\nCompany to efff if ciently and efff ef ctively serve its global customers frf om best cost countries. Aptiv has a presence in 48 countries\nand has appr\na\noximately 22,000 scientists, engineers and technicians foc\nf\nused on developing market relevant product solutions for\nf\nits customers.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nConsolidation—The consolidated fif nancial statements include the accounts of Aptiv and the subsidiaries in which Aptiv\nholds a controlling fif nancial or management interest and variabl\na e interest entities of which Aptiv has determined that it is the\nprimary\nr benefif ciary.\nr\nAptiv’s share of the earnings or losses of non-controlled afff if liates, over which Aptiv exercises signifif cant\ninflf uence (generally a 20% to 50% ownership interest), is included in the consolidated operating results using the equity method\nof accounting. When Aptiv does not have the abi\na lity to exercise signifif cant inflf uence (generally when ownership interest is less\nthan 20%), investments in non-consolidated afff if liates without readily determinabl\na e faf ir value are measured at cost, less\nimpairments, adjusted for\nf\nobservabl\na e price changes in orderly transactions for\nf\nidentical or similar investments of the same\nissuer, while investments in publicly traded equity securities are measured at faf ir value based on quoted prices for\nf\nidentical\nassets on active market exchanges as of each reporting date. The Company monitors its investments in afff if liates for\nf\nindicators\nof other-than-temporary\nr declines in value on an ongoing basis. If the Company determines that such a decline has occurred, an\nimpairment loss is recorded, which is measured as the difff ef rence between carryi\nr ng value and estimated faf ir value. Estimated\nfaf ir value is generally determined using an income appr\na\noach based on discounted cash flf ows or negotiated transaction values.\nIntercompany transactions and balances between consolidated Aptiv businesses have been eliminated.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, Aptiv received dividends of $5 million, $6 million and $9\nmillion, respectively, frf om one of its equity method investments. The dividends were recognized as a reduction to the\ninvestment and represented a retur\nt\nn on investment in cash flf ows frf om operating activities.\nAptiv's equity investments without readily determinabl\na e faf ir value totaled $67 million and $30 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are classifif ed within other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAptiv's investments in publicly traded equity securities totaled $17 million and $66 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, and are classifif ed within other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Refef r to Note 5. Investments in\nAfff if liates for\nf\nfur\nf\nther infor\nf\nmation regarding Aptiv's equity investments.\nIn 2022, the Company acquired 85% of the equity interests of Intercabl\na e Automotive Solutions (“Intercabl\na e\nAutomotive”). Concurrent with the acquisition, the Company entered into an agreement with the noncontrolling interest holders\nthat provides the Company with the right to purchase, and the noncontrolling interest holders with the right to sell, the\nremaining 15% of Intercabl\na e Automotive for\nf\ncash at a contractua\nt\nlly defif ned value beginning in 2026. As a result of this\nredemption fef atur\nt\ne, the Company recorded the redeemabl\na e noncontrolling interest at its acquisition-date faf ir value to temporary\nr\nequity in the consolidated balance sheet. The redeemabl\na e noncontrolling interest is adjusted each reporting period for\nf\nthe\nincome (loss) attributabl\na e to the noncontrolling interest, and for\nf\nany measurement period adjustments necessary\nr to record the\nredeemabl\na e noncontrolling interest at the higher of its redemption value, assuming it was redeemabl\na e at the reporting date, or its\ncarryi\nr ng value. Any measurement period adjustments are recorded to retained earnings, with a corresponding increase or\nreduction to net income attributabl\na e to Aptiv. Refef r to Note 20. Acquisitions and Divestitur\nt\nes for\nf\nfur\nf\nther infor\nf\nmation regarding\nthis acquisition and the redeemabl\na e noncontrolling interest.\n74"

      "text": "Use of estimates—Preparation of consolidated fif nancial statements in confor\nf\nmity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of\nestimates and assumptions that afff ef ct amounts reported therein. Generally, matters subject to estimation and judgment include\namounts related to accounts receivabl\na e realization, inventory\nr obsolescence, asset impairments, useful\nf\nlives of intangible and\nfif xed assets, defef rred tax asset valuation allowances, income taxes, pension benefif t plan assumptions, accrua\nr\nls related to\nlitigation, warranty costs, environmental remediation costs, contingent consideration arrangements, redeemabl\na e noncontrolling\ninterest, worker’s compensation accrua\nr\nls and healthcare accrua\nr\nls. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates,\nincluding the duration and severity of the impacts of the ongoing global supply chain disrupt\nr\nions and the conflf ict between\nUkraine and Rus\nR\nsia, actua\nt\nl results reported in fut\nf ur\nt\ne periods may be based upon amounts that difff ef r frf om those estimates.\nRevenue recognition—Revenue is measured based on consideration specifif ed in a contract with a customer. Customer\ncontracts for\nf\nproduction parts generally are represented by a combination of a current purchase order and a current production\nschedule issued by the customer. Customer contracts for\nf\nsoftf ware licenses are generally represented by a sales contract or\npurchase order. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfif es a perfor\nf\nmance obligation by transfef rring control over a\nproduct or service to a customer. Revenue frf om softf ware licenses is generally recognized at a point in time upon delivery\nr while\nrevenue frf om post delivery\nr support and maintenance for\nf\nsoftf ware contracts are recognized over time on a ratabl\na e basis over the\ncontract term. From time to time, Aptiv enters into pricing agreements with its customers that provide for\nf\nprice reductions,\nsome of which are conditional upon achieving certain joint cost saving targets. In these instances, revenue is recognized based\non the agreed-upon price at the time of shipment.\nSales incentives and allowances are recognized as a reduction to revenue at the time of the related sale. In addition, frf om\ntime to time, Aptiv makes payments to customers in conjunction with ongoing business. These payments to customers are\ngenerally recognized as a reduction to revenue at the time of the commitment to make these payments. However, certain other\npayments to customers, or upfrf ont fef es, meet the criteria to be considered a cost to obtain a contract as they are directly\nattributabl\na e to a contract, are incremental and management expects the fef es to be recoverabl\na e.\nAptiv collects and remits taxes assessed by difff ef rent governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent\nwith a revenue-producing transaction between the Company and the Company’s customers. These taxes may include, but are\nnot limited to, sales, use, value-added, and some excise taxes. Aptiv reports the collection of these taxes on a net basis\n(excluded frf om revenues). Shipping and handling fef es billed to customers are included in net sales, while costs of shipping and\nhandling are included in cost of sales. Refef r to Note 24. Revenue for\nf\nfur\nf\nther infor\nf\nmation.\nNet income per share—Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributabl\na e to ordinary\nr\nshareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary\nr shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share\nreflf ects the weighted average dilutive impact of all potentially dilutive securities frf om the date of issuance and is computed\nusing the treasury\nr stock and if-f converted methods. The if-f converted method is used to determine if the impact of conversion of\nthe 5.50% Mandatory\nr Convertible Prefef rred Shares, Series A, $0.01 par value per share (the “MCPS”) into ordinary\nr shares is\nmore dilutive than the MCPS dividends to net income per share. If so, the MCPS are assumed to have been converted at the\nlater of the beginning of the period or the time of issuance, and the resulting ordinary\nr shares are included in the denominator\nand the MCPS dividends are added back to the numerator. Unless otherwise noted, share and per share amounts included in\nthese notes are on a diluted basis. Refef r to Note 15. Shareholders’ Equity and Net Income Per Share for\nf\nadditional infor\nf\nmation\nincluding the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share.\nResearch and development—Costs are incurred in connection with research and development programs that are\nexpected to contribute to fut\nf ur\nt\ne earnings. Such costs are charged against income as incurred. Total research and development\nexpenses, including engineering, net of customer reimbursements, were appr\na\noximately $1,120 million, $1,030 million and\n$1,024 million for\nf\nthe years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCash and cash equivalents—Cash and cash equivalents are defif ned as short-term, highly liquid investments with\noriginal matur\nt\nities of three months or less, for\nf\nwhich the book value appr\na\noximates faf ir value.\nAccounts receivable—Aptiv enters into agreements to sell certain of its accounts receivabl\na e, primarily in Europe. Sales\nof receivabl\na es are accounted for\nf\nin accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC Topic 860,\nTr\nT ansfs ef rsr and Servicing (“ASC 860”). Agreements which result in true\nr\nsales of the transfef rred receivabl\na es, as defif ned in ASC\n860, which occur when receivabl\na es are transfef rred without recourse to the Company, are excluded frf om amounts reported in the\nconsolidated balance sheets. Cash proceeds received frf om such sales are included in operating cash flf ows. Agreements that\nallow Aptiv to maintain efff ef ctive control over the transfef rred receivabl\na es and which do not qualify\nf as a sale, as defif ned in ASC\n860, are accounted for\nf\nas secured borrowings and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets within accounts receivabl\na e, net\nand short-term debt. The expenses associated with receivabl\na es faf ctoring are recorded in the consolidated statements of\noperations within interest expense.\nThe Company exchanges certain amounts of accounts receivabl\na e, primarily in the Asia Pacifif c region, for\nf\nbank notes with\noriginal matur\nt\nities greater than three months.

The Company\nmay hold such bank notes until matur\nt\nity, exchange them with suppliers to settle liabi\na lities, or sell them to third-party fif nancial\ninstitut\nt ions in exchange for\nf\ncash.\nCredit losses—Aptiv is exposed to credit losses primarily through the sale of vehicle components and services. Aptiv\nassesses the creditworthiness of a counterpa\nr\nrty by conducting ongoing credit reviews, which considers the Company’s expected\nbilling exposure and timing for\nf\npayment, as well as the counterpa\nr\nrty’s establ\na ished credit rating. When a credit rating is not\navailabl\na e, the Company’s assessment is based on an analysis of the counterpa\nr\nrty’s fif nancial statements. Aptiv also considers\ncontract terms and conditions, country\nr and political risk, and business strategy in its evaluation. Based on the outcome of this\nreview, the Company establ\na ishes a credit limit for\nf\neach counterpa\nr\nrty. The Company continues to monitor its ongoing credit\nexposure through active review of counterpa\nr\nrty balances against contract terms and due dates, which includes timely account\nreconciliation, payment confif rmation and dispute resolution. The Company may also employ collection agencies and legal\ncounsel to pursue recovery\nr of defaf ulted receivabl\na es, if necessary.\nr\nAptiv primarily utilizes historical loss and recovery\nr data, combined with infor\nf\nmation on current economic conditions and\nreasonabl\na e and supportabl\na e for\nf\necasts to develop the estimate of the allowance for\nf\ndoubtful\nf\naccounts in accordance with ASC\nTopic 326, Fi\nF nancial Ins\nI\ntrt umentst – Cr\nC edit Losses (“ASC 326”). As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the\nCompany reported $3,433 million and $2,784 million, respectively, of accounts receivabl\na e, net of the allowances, which\nincludes the allowance for\nf\ndoubtful\nf\naccounts of $52 million and $37 million, respectively. The provision for\nf\ndoubtful\nf\naccounts\nwas $27 million, $22 million, and $39 million for\nf\nthe years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Other\nchanges in the allowance were not material for\nf\nthe year ended December 31, 2022.\nInventories—As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a fif rst-in,\nfif rst-out basis, or net realizabl\na e value, including direct material costs and direct and indirect manufaf ctur\nt\ning costs. Refef r to Note\n3. Inventories for\nf\nadditional infor\nf\nmation. Obsolete inventory\nr is identifif ed based on analysis of inventory\nr for\nf\nknown\nobsolescence issues, and, generally, the market value of inventory\nr on hand in excess of one year’s supply is ful\nf ly-reserved.\nFrom time to time, payments may be received frf om suppliers. These payments frf om suppliers are recognized as a\nreduction of the cost of the material acquired during the period to which the payments relate. In some instances, supplier rebates\nare received in conjunction with or concurrent with the negotiation of fut\nf ur\nt\ne purchase agreements and these amounts are\namortized over the prospective agreement period.\nProperty—Maja or improvements that materially extend the useful\nf\nlifef of property are capi\na talized. Expenditur\nt\nes for\nf\nrepairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is determined based on a straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful\nf\nlives of groups\nu\nof property. Leasehold improvements under fif nance leases are depreciated over the period\nof the lease or the lifef of the property, whichever is shorter. Refef r to Note 6. Property, Net and Note 25. Leases for\nf\nadditional\ninfor\nf\nmation.\nPre-production costs related to long-term supply agreements—The Company incurs pre-production engineering,\ndevelopment and tooling costs related to products produced for\nf\nits customers under long-term supply agreements. Engineering,\ntesting and other costs incurred in the design and development of production parts are expensed as incurred, unless the costs are\nreimbursabl\na e, as specifif ed in a customer contract. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, $250 million and $286 million of such\ncontractua\nt\nlly reimbursabl\na e costs were capi\na talized, respectively. These amounts are recorded within other current and other long-\nterm assets in the consolidated balance sheets, as fur\nf\nther detailed in Note 4. Assets.\nSpecial tools represent Aptiv-owned tools, dies, jigs and other items used in the manufaf ctur\nt\ne of customer components\nthat will be sold under long-term supply arrangements, the costs of which are capi\na talized within property, plant and equipment\nif the Company has title to the assets. Special tools also include capi\na talized unreimbursed pre-production tooling costs related to\ncustomer-owned tools for\nf\nwhich the customer has provided Aptiv a non-cancellabl\na e right to use the tool. Aptiv-owned special\ntool balances are depreciated over the expected lifef of the special tool or the lifef of the related vehicle program, whichever is\nshorter. The unreimbursed costs incurred related to customer-owned special tools that are not subject to reimbursement are\ncapi\na talized and depreciated over the expected lifef of the special tool or the lifef of the related vehicle program, whichever is\nshorter. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the special tools balance, net of accumulated depreciation, was $437 million and $405\nmillion, respectively, included within property, net in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the\nAptiv-owned special tools balance was $350 million and $303 million, respectively, and the customer-owned special tools\nbalance was $87 million and $102 million, respectively.\nValuation of long-lived assets—The carryi\nr ng value of long-lived assets held for\nf\nuse, including defif nite-lived intangible\nassets, is periodically evaluated when events or circumstances warrant such a review. The carryi\nr ng value of a long-lived asset\nheld for\nf\nuse is considered impaired when the anticipated separately identifif abl\na e undiscounted cash flf ows frf om the asset are less\nthan the carryi\nr ng value of the asset. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carryi\nr ng value exceeds\nthe estimated faf ir value of the long-lived asset.

Fair value\nof long-lived assets is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flf ows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk\ninvolved (an income appr\na\noach), and in certain situa\nt\ntions Aptiv’s review of appr\na\naisals (a market appr\na\noach). Refef r to Note 6.\nProperty, Net and Note 7. Intangible Assets and Goodwill for\nf\nadditional infor\nf\nmation.\nLeases—The Company accounts for\nf\nleases in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases. The Company determines\nwhether an arrangement is a lease at inception. For leases where the Company is the lessee, a lease liabi\na lity and a right-of-f use\nasset is recognized for\nf\nall leases, with the exception of short-term leases with terms of twelve months or less. The lease liabi\na lity\nrepresents the lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising frf om a lease, and is measured as the present value of the lease\npayments. As the rate implicit in the lease is usually not known at lease commencement, the Company uses its incremental\nborrowing rate to discount the lease obligation. The right-of-f use asset represents the lessee’s right to use a specifif ed asset for\nf\nthe\nlease term, and is measured at the lease liabi\na lity amount, adjusted for\nf\nlease prepayment, lease incentives received and the\nCompany’s initial direct costs.\nThe Company appl\na\nies the short-term lease exception, which results in a single lease cost being allocated over the lease\nterm, generally on a straight-line basis, for\nf\nleases with a term of twelve months or less. These leases are not presented in the\nconsolidated balance sheets. Additionally, the Company appl\na\nies the practical expedient to not separate lease components frf om\nnon-lease components and instead accounts for\nf\nboth as a single lease component for\nf\nall asset classes. Refef r to Note 25. Leases\nfor\nf\nadditional infor\nf\nmation.\nAssets and liabilities held for\nf\nsale—The Company considers assets to be held for\nf\nsale when management, having the\nappr\na\nopriate authority, appr\na\noves and commits to a for\nf\nmal plan to actively market the assets for\nf\nsale at a price reasonabl\na e in\nrelation to their estimated faf ir value, the assets are availabl\na e for\nf\nimmediate sale in their present condition, an active program to\nlocate a buyer and other actions required to complete the sale have been initiated, the sale of the assets is probabl\na e and expected\nto be completed within one year and it is unlikely that signifif cant changes will be made to the plan. Upon designation as held\nfor\nf\nsale, the Company records the assets at the lower of their carryi\nr ng value or their estimated faf ir value, less cost to sell, and\nceases to record depreciation expense on the assets.\nAssets and liabi\na lities of a discontinued operation are reclassifif ed as held for\nf\nsale for\nf\nall comparative periods presented in\nthe consolidated balance sheets. For assets that meet the held for\nf\nsale criteria but do not meet the defif nition of a discontinued\noperation, the Company reclassifif es the assets and liabi\na lities in the period in which the held for\nf\nsale criteria are met, but does\nnot reclassify\nf prior period amounts.\nIntangible assets—The Company amortizes defif nite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful\nf\nlives. The\nCompany has defif nite-lived intangible assets related to patents and developed technology, customer relationships and trade\nnames. Indefif nite-lived in-process research and development intangible assets are not amortized, but are tested for\nf\nimpairment\nannually, or more frf equently when indicators of potential impairment exist, until the completion or aba\na\nndonment of the\nassociated research and development efff or\nf\nts. Upon completion of the projects, the assets will be amortized over the expected\neconomic lifef of the asset, which will be determined on that date. Should the project be determined to be aba\na\nndoned, and if the\nasset developed has no alternative use, the ful\nf l value of the asset will be charged to expense. The Company also has intangible\nassets related to acquired trade names that are classifif ed as indefif nite-lived when there are no for\nf\neseeabl\na e limits on the periods\nof time over which they are expected to contribute cash flf ows. These indefif nite-lived trade name assets are tested for\nf\nimpairment annually, or more frf equently when indicators of potential impairment exist. Costs to renew or extend the term of\nacquired intangible assets are recognized as expense as incurred. No intangible asset impairment charges were recorded during\nthe years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Refef r to Note 7. Intangible Assets and Goodwill for\nf\nadditional\ninfor\nf\nmation.\nGoodwill—Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the estimated faf ir value of identifif abl\na e net assets acquired in\nbusiness combinations. The Company tests goodwill for\nf\nimpairment annually in the four\nf\nth quarter, or more frf equently when\nindications of potential impairment exist. The Company monitors the existence of potential impairment indicators throughout\nthe fif scal year. The Company tests for\nf\ngoodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are the components\nof operating segments which constitut\nt e businesses for\nf\nwhich discrete fif nancial infor\nf\nmation is availabl\na e and is regularly\nreviewed by segment management.\nThe impairment test involves fif rst qualitatively assessing goodwill for\nf\nimpairment. If the qualitative assessment is not met\nthe Company then perfor\nf\nms a quantitative assessment by comparing the estimated faf ir value of each reporting unit to its\ncarryi\nr ng value, including goodwill. Fair value reflf ects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale\nof the reporting unit. If the estimated faf ir value exceeds carryi\nr ng value, then we conclude that no goodwill impairment has\noccurred. If the carryi\nr ng value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated faf ir value, the Company recognizes an impairment\nloss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

      "text": "Goodwill impairment—In the four\nf\nth quarter of 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company completed a qualitative goodwill\nimpairment assessment, and aftf er evaluating the results, events and circumstances of the Company, we concluded that sufff if cient\nevidence existed to assert qualitatively that it was more likely than not that the estimated faf ir value of each reporting unit\nremained in excess of its carryi\nr ng values. Therefor\nf\ne, a quantitative impairment assessment was not necessary.\nr\nNo goodwill\nimpairments were recorded in 2022, 2021 or 2020. Refef r to Note 7. Intangible Assets and Goodwill for\nf\nadditional infor\nf\nmation.\nWarranty and product recalls—Expected warranty costs for\nf\nproducts sold are recognized at the time of sale of the\nproduct based on an estimate of the amount that eventua\nt\nlly will be required to settle such obligations. These accrua\nr\nls are based\non faf ctors such as past experience, production changes, industry\nr developments and various other considerations. Costs of\nproduct recalls, which may include the cost of the product being replaced as well as the customer’s cost of the recall, including\nlabor\na\nto remove and replace the recalled part, are accrue\nr\nd as part of our warranty accrua\nr\nl at the time an obligation becomes\nprobabl\na e and can be reasonabl\na y estimated. These estimates are adjusted frf om time to time based on faf cts and circumstances that\nimpact the status\nt\nof existing claims. Refef r to Note 9. Warranty Obligations for\nf\nadditional infor\nf\nmation.\nIncome taxes—Defef rred tax assets and liabi\na lities reflf ect temporary\nr difff ef rences between the amount of assets and\nliabi\na lities for\nf\nfif nancial and tax reporting purpos\nr\nes. Such amounts are adjusted, as appr\na\nopriate, to reflf ect changes in tax rates\nexpected to be in efff ef ct when the temporary\nr difff ef rences reverse. The efff ef ct on defef rred tax assets and liabi\na lities of a change in\ntax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce\ndefef rred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In the event the Company determines it is more\nlikely than not that the defef rred tax assets will not be realized in the fut\nf ur\nt\ne, the valuation allowance adjustment to the defef rred\ntax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which the Company makes such a determination. In determining whether\nan uncertain tax position exists, the Company determines, based solely on its technical merits, whether the tax position is more\nlikely than not to be sustained upon examination, and if so, a tax benefif t is measured on a cumulative probabi\na lity basis that is\nmore likely than not to be realized upon the ultimate settlement. In determining the provision for\nf\nincome taxes for\nf\nfif nancial\nstatement purpos\nr\nes, the Company makes certain estimates and judgments which afff ef ct its evaluation of the carryi\nr ng value of its\ndefef rred tax assets, as well as its calculation of certain tax liabi\na lities. As it relates to changes in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss), the Company’s policy is to release tax efff ef cts frf om accumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss) when the underlying components afff ef ct earnings. Refef r to Note 14. Income Taxes for\nf\nadditional infor\nf\nmation.\nForeign currency translation—Assets and liabi\na lities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that use a currency other than U.S. dollars\nas their func\nf\ntional currency are translated to U.S. dollars at end-of-f period currency exchange rates. The consolidated statements\nof operations of non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at average-period currency exchange rates. The efff ef ct of\ntranslation for\nf\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries is generally reported in other comprehensive income (“OCI”). The accumulated for\nf\neign\ncurrency translation adjustment related to an investment in a for\nf\neign subsidiary\nr is reclassifif ed to net income upon sale or upon\ncomplete or substantially complete liquidation of the respective entity. The efff ef ct of remeasurement of assets and liabi\na lities of\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their func\nf\ntional currency is primarily included in cost of sales. Also included in\ncost of sales are gains and losses arising frf om transactions denominated in a currency other than the func\nf\ntional currency of a\nparticular entity. Net for\nf\neign currency transaction losses of $30 million were included in the consolidated statements of\noperations for\nf\nthe year ended December 31, 2022. There were no net for\nf\neign currency transaction gains or losses for\nf\nthe year\nended December 31, 2021. Net for\nf\neign currency transaction losses of $20 million were included in the consolidated statements\nof operations for\nf\nthe year ended December 31, 2020.\nRestructuring—Aptiv continually evaluates alternatives to align the business with the changing needs of its customers\nand to lower operating costs. This includes the realignment of its existing manufaf ctur\nt\ning capa\na\ncity, faf cility closures, or similar\nactions, either in the normal course of business or pursuant to signifif cant restruc\nr\ntur\nt\ning programs. These actions may result in\nemployees receiving voluntary\nr or involuntary\nr employee termination benefif ts, which are mainly pursuant to union or other\ncontractua\nt\nl agreements or statut\nt ory\nr requirements. Voluntary\nr termination benefif ts are accrue\nr\nd when an employee accepts the\nrelated offf ef r. Involuntary\nr termination benefif ts are accrue\nr\nd upon the commitment to a termination plan and when the benefif t\narrangement is communicated to afff ef cted employees, or when liabi\na lities are determined to be probabl\na e and estimabl\na e,\ndepending on the existence of a substantive plan for\nf\nseverance or termination. Contract termination costs and certain early\ntermination lease costs are recorded when contracts are terminated. All other exit costs are expensed as incurred. Refef r to Note\n10.

Changes in faf ir value are reported\ncurrently through earnings unless they meet hedge accounting criteria.\nExposure to flf uctua\nt\ntions in currency exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices are managed by entering\ninto a variety of for\nf\nward and option contracts and swaps\na\nwith various counterpa\nr\nrties.

The RSU awards include a time-based vesting portion and a perfor\nf\nmance-based\nvesting portion. The perfor\nf\nmance-based vesting portion includes perfor\nf\nmance and market conditions in addition to service\nconditions. The grant date faf ir value of the RSUs is determined based on the closing price of the Company’s ordinary\nr shares on\nthe date of the grant of the award, including an estimate for\nf\nfor\nf\nfef itur\nt\nes, or a contemporaneous valuation perfor\nf\nmed by an\nindependent valuation specialist with respect to awards with market conditions.

Determining the faf ir values of assets acquired and liabi\na lities assumed requires\nmanagement’s judgment, the utilization of independent appr\na\naisal fif rms and oftf en involves the use of signifif cant estimates and\nassumptions with respect to the timing and amount of fut\nf ur\nt\ne cash flf ows, market rate assumptions, actua\nt\nrial assumptions, and\nappr\na\nopriate discount rates, among other items. Refef r to Note 20. Acquisitions and Divestitur\nt\nes for\nf\nadditional infor\nf\nmation.\nGovernment incentives—From time to time, Aptiv receives government incentives in the for\nf\nm of cash grants and other\nincentives in retur\nt\nn for\nf\npast or fut\nf ur\nt\ne compliance with certain conditions. The Company accounts for\nf\nfunds\nf\nreceived frf om\ngovernment grants that are not in the for\nf\nm of an income tax credit, revenue frf om a contract with a customer or a loan, by\nanalogy to International Accounting Standards 20, Accounting for\nf\nGovernment Grantst and Disi closure of Government\nAssisi tance. Accordingly, we recognize funds\nf\nwe receive frf om government grants in the consolidated statement of operations\nwhen there is reasonabl\na e assurance that Aptiv will comply with the conditions associated with the grant and the grants will be\nreceived. Recognition occurs on a systematic basis over the periods in which Aptiv recognizes, as expenses, the related costs for\nf\nwhich the grants are intended to defrf ay.\nAptiv is eligible to receive certain government grants because we engage in qualifyi\nf ng capi\na tal investments and other\nactivities as defif ned by the relevant governmental entities awarding the grants. Typically, grant agreements require that Aptiv\ncomplies with certain conditions, including committing to minimum levels of capi\na tal investment and maintenance of a\nminimum level of headcount at the impacted manufaf ctur\nt\ning site. Aptiv generally recognizes government grants of an operating\nnatur\nt\ne as a reduction to operating expenses (primarily cost of sales) in the consolidated statements of operations. During the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, government grants were recognized as reductions to operating expenses of appr\na\noximately $20\nmillion.\nAptiv records capi\na tal-related grants as a reduction to property, plant and equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheets,\nwhich ultimately results in a reduction to depreciation expense over the useful\nf\nlifef of the corresponding asset. Capi\na tal-related\ngrants reduced gross property, plant and equipment by appr\na\noximately $10 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAmounts recorded as due frf om and due to governmental entities in the consolidated balance sheets were not signifif cant for\nf\nany\nperiod presented.\nOur agreements with governmental entities have an average duration of fif ve years and certain of these agreements include\nprovisions for\nf\nthe recapt\na ur\nt\ne of fundi\nf\nng if the Company faf ils to comply with various aspects of the agreement.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements—In June 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update\n(“ASU”) 2022-03, Fai\nF r Val\nV ue Me\nM asurement (T\n( opi\nT\nc 820): Fai\nF r Val\nV ue Me\nM asurement of Equityt Securities Subject to Cont\nC\nrt actual\nSale Restrt ictions.

WARRA\nR NTY OBLIGATIONS\nExpected warranty costs for\nf\nproducts sold are recognized principally at the time of sale of the product based on an\nestimate of the amount that eventua\nt\nlly will be required to settle such obligations.

The estimated costs related to\nproduct recalls based on a for\nf\nmal campaign soliciting retur\nt\nn of that product are accrue\nr\nd at the time an obligation becomes\nprobabl\na e and can be reasonabl\na y estimated. These estimates are adjusted frf om time to time based on faf cts and circumstances that\nimpact the status\nt\nof existing claims. Aptiv has recognized its best estimate for\nf\nits total aggregate warranty reserves, including\nproduct recall costs, across all of its operating segments as of December 31, 2022. The Company estimates the reasonabl\na y\npossible amount to ultimately resolve all matters in excess of the recorded reserves as of December 31, 2022 to be zero to $10\nmillion.\n87"

RESTRUCTURING\nAptiv’s restruc\nr\ntur\nt\ning activities are undertaken as necessary\nr to implement management’s strategy, streamline operations,\ntake advantage of availabl\na e capa\na\ncity and resources, and ultimately achieve net cost reductions. These activities generally relate\nto the realignment of existing manufaf ctur\nt\ning capa\na\ncity and closure of faf cilities and other exit or disposal activities, as it relates to\nexecuting Aptiv’s strategy, either in the normal course of business or pursuant to signifif cant restruc\nr\ntur\nt\ning programs.\nAs part of the Company’s continued efff or\nf\nts to optimize its cost struc\nr\ntur\nt\ne, it has undertaken several restruc\nr\ntur\nt\ning programs\nwhich include workfor\nf\nce reductions as well as plant closures. These programs are primarily foc\nf\nused on reducing global\noverhead costs and the continued rotation of our manufaf ctur\nt\ning foot\nf\npr\nt\nint to best cost locations in Europe. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company recorded employee-related and other restruc\nr\ntur\nt\ning charges related to these programs totaling\nappr\na\noximately $85 million, of which $61 million was recognized for\nf\nprograms implemented in the European region and $23\nmillion was recognized for\nf\nprograms implemented in the North America region. None of the Company’s individual\nrestruc\nr\ntur\nt\ning programs initiated during 2022 were material and there have been no changes in previously initiated programs that\nhave resulted (or are expected to result) in a material change to our restruc\nr\ntur\nt\ning costs. The Company expects to incur\nadditional restruc\nr\ntur\nt\ning costs of appr\na\noximately $10 million (of which appr\na\noximately $5 million relates to the Advanced Safef ty\nand User Experience segment and appr\na\noximately $5 million relates to the Signal and Power Solutions segment) for\nf\nprograms\nappr\na\noved as of December 31, 2022, which are expected to be incurred within the next twelve months.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded employee-related and other restruc\nr\ntur\nt\ning charges\ntotaling appr\na\noximately $24 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded employee-related and\nother restruc\nr\ntur\nt\ning charges totaling appr\na\noximately $136 million, of which $62 million was recognized for\nf\nprograms\nimplemented in the North America region and $57 million was recognized for\nf\nprograms implemented in the European region.\nThe charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 included the recognition of appr\na\noximately $90 million of\nemployee-related and other costs related to actions taken as a result of the global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRestruc\nr\ntur\nt\ning charges for\nf\nemployee separation and termination benefif ts are paid either over the severance period or in a\nlump sum in accordance with either statut\nt ory\nr requirements or individual agreements. Aptiv incurred cash expenditur\nt\nes related\nto its restruc\nr\ntur\nt\ning programs of appr\na\noximately $67 million, $80 million and $151 million in the years ended December 31,\n2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe fol\nf lowing tabl\na e summarizes the restruc\nr\ntur\nt\ning charges recorded for\nf\nthe years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and\n2020 by operating segment:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020\n(in millions)\nSignal and Power Solutions............................................................................. $\n30\n$\n8\n$\n90\nAdvanced Safef ty and User Experience ...........................................................\n55\n16\n46\nTotal............................................................................................................ $\n85\n$\n24\n$\n136\n88"

Subsequently, Aptiv Global Financing Limited (“AGFL”), a wholly-owned subsidiary\nr\nof Aptiv PLC, executed a joinder agreement to the Credit Agreement, which allows it to act as a borrower under the Credit\nAgreement, and a guaranty supplement, under which AGFL guarantees the obligations under the Credit Agreement, subject to\ncertain exceptions.\nThe Credit Agreement was entered into in March 2011 and has been subsequently amended and restated on several\noccasions, most recently on June 24, 2021. The June 2021 amendment, among other things, (1) refif nanced and replaced the\nexisting term loan A and revolver with a new term loan A that matur\nt\nes in 2026, and a new fif ve-year revolving credit faf cility\nwith aggregate commitments of $2 billion, (2) utilized the Company’s existing sustainabi\na lity-linked metrics and commitments,\nthat, if achieved, would change the faf cility fef e and interest rate margins as described below, and (3) establ\na ished the leverage\nratio maintenance covenant that requires the Company to maintain total net leverage (as calculated in accordance with the\nCredit Agreement) of less than 3.5 to 1.0 (or 4.0 to 1.0 for\nf\nfour\nf\nful\nf l fif scal quarters fol\nf lowing completion of material\nacquisitions, as defif ned in the Credit Agreement) and allowed for\nf\ndividends and other payments on equity.

We, along with most automotive component manufaf ctur\nt\ners that use semiconductors, have been unabl\na e to ful\nf ly meet\nthe vehicle production demands of OEMs because of events which are outside our control, including but not limited to, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the global semiconductor shortage, fif res in our suppliers’ faf cilities, unprecedented weather events in the\nsouthwestern United States, and other extraordinary\nr events. Although we are working closely with suppliers and customers to\nminimize any potential adverse impacts of these events, some of our customers have indicated that they expect us to bear at\nleast some responsibility for\nf\ntheir lost production and other costs. While no assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome\nof these customer expectations or any other fut\nf ur\nt\ne claims, we do not currently believe a loss is probabl\na e, and accordingly, no\nreserve has been made as of December 31, 2022. We will continue to actively monitor all direct and indirect potential impacts\nof these supply chain disrupt\nr\nions, and will seek to aggressively mitigate and minimize their impact on our business.\nBrazil Matters\nAptiv conducts business operations in Brazil that are subject to the Brazilian fef deral labor\na\n, social security, environmental,\nhealth and safef ty, tax and customs laws, as well as a variety of state and local laws. While Aptiv believes it complies with such\nlaws, they are complex, subject to varyi\nr ng interpr\nr\netations, and the Company is oftf en engaged in litigation with government\nagencies regarding the appl\na\nication of these laws to particular circumstances. As of December 31, 2022, the maja ority of claims\nasserted against Aptiv in Brazil relate to such litigation. The remaining claims in Brazil relate to commercial and labor\na\nlitigation\nwith private parties. As of December 31, 2022, claims totaling appr\na\noximately $105 million (using December 31, 2022 for\nf\neign\ncurrency rates) have been asserted against Aptiv in Brazil. As of December 31, 2022, the Company maintains accrua\nr\nls for\nf\nthese\nasserted claims of $5 million (using December 31, 2022 for\nf\neign currency rates). The amounts accrue\nr\nd represent claims that are\ndeemed probabl\na e of loss and are reasonabl\na y estimabl\na e based on the Company’s analyses and assessment of the asserted claims\nand prior experience with similar matters.

Simultaneously, the Company completed the underwritten public offf ef ring of 11.5 million\n5.50% Mandatory\nr Convertible Prefef rred Shares, Series A, $0.01 par value per share (the “MCPS”) with a liquidation prefef rence\nof $100 per share, resulting in net proceeds of appr\na\noximately $1,115 million, aftf er deducting expenses and the underwriters’\ndiscount of $35 million.\nEach share of MCPS will convert on the mandatory\nr conversion date of June 15, 2023, into between 1.0754 and 1.3173\nshares of the Company’s ordinary\nr shares, subject to customary\nr anti-dilution adjustments, and fur\nf\nther adjustment if there are any\naccumulated and unpaid MCPS dividends at the conversion date. The number of the Company’s ordinary\nr shares issuabl\na e upon\nconversion will be determined based on the volume-weighted average price per share of the Company’s ordinary\nr shares over\nthe 20 consecutive trading day period beginning on, and including the 21st scheduled trading day immediately befor\nf\ne June 15,\n2023. Subject to certain exceptions, at any time prior to June 15, 2023, holders of the MCPS may elect to convert each share\ninto 1.0754 ordinary\nr shares, subject to fur\nf\nther anti-dilution adjustments. In the event of a funda\nf\nmental change, the MCPS will\nconvert at the funda\nf\nmental change rates specifif ed in the statement of rights, and the holders of the MCPS would be entitled to a\nfunda\nf\nmental change make-whole dividend.\nHolders of the MCPS will be entitled to receive, when and if declared by the Company’s Board of Directors, cumulative\ndividends at the annual rate of 5.50% of the liquidation prefef rence of $100 per share (equivalent to $5.50 annually per share),\npayabl\na e in cash or, subject to certain limitations, by delivery\nr of the Company’s ordinary\nr shares or any combination of cash and\nthe Company’s ordinary\nr shares, at the Company’s election. If declared, dividends on the MCPS are payabl\na e quarterly on March\n15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year (commencing on September 15, 2020 to, and including June 15,\n2023), to the holders of record of the MCPS as they appe\na\nar on the Company’s share register at the close of business on the\nimmediately preceding March 1, June 1, September 1 or December 1, respectively.\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributabl\na e to ordinary\nr shareholders by the weighted\naverage number of ordinary\nr shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share reflf ects the weighted average\ndilutive impact of all potentially dilutive securities frf om the date of issuance and is computed using the treasury\nr stock and if-f\nconverted methods. The if-f converted method is used to determine if the impact of the conversion of the MCPS into ordinary\nr\nshares is more dilutive than the MCPS dividends to net income per share. If so, the MCPS are assumed to have been converted\nat the later of the beginning of the period or the time of issuance, and the resulting ordinary\nr shares are included in the\ndenominator and the MCPS dividends are added back to the numerator. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the\nimpact of the MCPS calculated under the if-f converted method was anti-dilutive, and as such 12.37 million and 12.37 million\nordinary\nr shares underlying the MCPS, respectively, were excluded frf om the diluted net income per share calculation. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2020, the calculation of net income per share includes the dilutive impacts of the MCPS under the if-f\nconverted method. For all periods presented, the calculation of net income per share also contemplates the dilutive impacts, if\nany, of the Company’s share-based compensation plans. Refef r to Note 21.

Unrealized amounts in accumulated OCI will\nflf uctua\nt\nte based on changes in the faf ir value of hedge derivative contracts at each reporting period. Net gains on cash flf ow\nhedges included in accumulated OCI as of December 31, 2022 were $29 million (appr\na\noximately $40 million, net of tax). Of this\ntotal, appr\na\noximately $15 million of gains are expected to be included in cost of sales within the next 12 months and\nappr\na\noximately $14 million of gains are expected to be included in cost of sales in subsequent periods.

The gains or losses on instrum\nr\nents designated as net investment hedges are recognized\nwithin OCI to offf sf et changes in the value of the net investment in these for\nf\neign currency-denominated operations. Gains and\nlosses reported in accumulated OCI are reclassifif ed to earnings only when the related currency translation adjustments are\nrequired to be reclassifif ed, usually upon sale or liquidation of the investment. Cash flf ows frf om derivatives designated as net\ninvestment hedges are classifif ed as investing activities within the consolidated statements of cash flf ows.\nThe Company has entered into a series of for\nf\nward contracts, each of which have been designated as net investment\nhedges of the for\nf\neign currency exposure of the Company’s investments in certain Chinese Yuan Renminbi (“RMB”)-\ndenominated subsidiaries. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company received $7 million, and\nmade net payments of $17 million and $1 million, respectively, at settlement related to these series of for\nf\nward contracts which\nmatur\nt\ned throughout each respective year. In December 2022, the Company entered into for\nf\nward contracts with a total notional\namount of 700 million RMB (appr\na\noximately $100 million, using December 31, 2022 for\nf\neign currency rates), which matur\nt\ne in\nMarch 2023.

      "text": "Aptiv uses the fol\nf lowing faf ir value hierarchy prescribed by U.S. GAAP, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure faf ir\nvalue as fol\nf lows:\nLevel 1—Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\nf\nidentical assets or liabi\na lities.\nLevel 2—Observabl\na e inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for\nf\nsimilar assets or liabi\na lities; quoted prices\nin markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observabl\na e or can be corroborated by observabl\na e market data for\nf\nsubstantially the ful\nf l term of the assets or liabi\na lities.\nLevel 3—Unobservabl\na e inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are signifif cant to the faf ir value of\nthe assets or liabi\na lities.\nTypically, assets and liabi\na lities are considered to be faf ir valued on a recurring basis if faf ir value is measured regularly.\nHowever, if the faf ir value measurement of an instrum\nr\nent does not necessarily result in a change in the amount recorded on the\nconsolidated balance sheets, assets and liabi\na lities are considered to be faf ir valued on a nonrecurring basis. This generally occurs\nwhen accounting guidance requires assets and liabi\na lities to be recorded at the lower of cost or faf ir value, or assessed for\nf\nimpairment.\nFair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis\nDerivative instrt umentst —All derivative instrum\nr\nents are required to be reported on the balance sheet at faf ir value unless\nthe transactions qualify\nf and are designated as normal purchases or sales. Changes in faf ir value are reported currently through\nearnings unless they meet hedge accounting criteria. Aptiv’s derivative exposures are with counterpa\nr\nrties with long-term\ninvestment grade credit ratings. Aptiv estimates the faf ir value of its derivative contracts using an income appr\na\noach based on\nvaluation techniques to convert fut\nf ur\nt\ne amounts to a single, discounted amount. Estimates of the faf ir value of for\nf\neign currency\nand commodity derivative instrum\nr\nents are determined using exchange traded prices and rates. Aptiv also considers the risk of\nnon-perfor\nf\nmance in the estimation of faf ir value, and includes an adjustment for\nf\nnon-perfor\nf\nmance risk in the measure of faf ir\nvalue of derivative instrum\nr\nents. The non-perfor\nf\nmance risk adjustment reflf ects the credit defaf ult spread (“CDS”) appl\na\nied to the\nnet commodity by counterpa\nr\nrty and for\nf\neign currency exposures by counterpa\nr\nrty. When Aptiv is in a net derivative asset\nposition, the counterpa\nr\nrty CDS rates are appl\na\nied to the net derivative asset position. When Aptiv is in a net derivative liabi\na lity\nposition, estimates of peer companies’ CDS rates are appl\na\nied to the net derivative liabi\na lity position.\nIn certain instances where market data is not availabl\na e, Aptiv uses management judgment to develop assumptions that are\nused to determine faf ir value. This could include situa\nt\ntions of market illiquidity for\nf\na particular currency or commodity or where\nobservabl\na e market data may be limited. In those situa\nt\ntions, Aptiv generally surveys investment banks and/or brokers and\nutilizes the surveyed prices and rates in estimating faf ir value.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Aptiv was in a net derivative asset position of $22 million and $21 million,\nrespectively, and no signifif cant adjustments were recorded for\nf\nnonperfor\nf\nmance risk based on the appl\na\nication of peer companies’\nCDS rates, evaluation of our own nonperfor\nf\nmance risk and because Aptiv’s exposures were to counterpa\nr\nrties with investment\ngrade credit ratings. Refef r to Note 17. Derivatives and Hedging Activities for\nf\nfur\nf\nther infor\nf\nmation regarding derivatives.\nCont\nC\ningent consideration—The liabi\na lity for\nf\ncontingent consideration is estimated as of the date of the acquisition and is\nrecorded as part of the purchase price, and is subsequently re-measured to faf ir value at each reporting date, based on a\nprobabi\na lity-weighted analysis using a rate that reflf ects the uncertainty surrounding the expected outcomes, which the Company\nbelieves is appr\na\nopriate and representative of market participant assumptions. The measurement of the liabi\na lity for\nf\ncontingent\nconsideration is based on signifif cant inputs that are not observabl\na e in the market, and is therefor\nf\ne classifif ed as a Level 3\nmeasurement in accordance with ASC Topic 820-10-35. Examples of utilized unobservabl\na e inputs are estimated fut\nf ur\nt\ne earnings\nor milestone achievements of the acquired businesses and appl\na\nicabl\na e discount rates. The estimate of the liabi\na lity may flf uctua\nt\nte if\nthere are changes in the for\nf\necast of acquired businesses’ fut\nf ur\nt\ne earnings or milestone achievements, as a result of actua\nt\nl\nearnings or milestone achievements or in the discount rates used to determine the present value of contingent fut\nf ur\nt\ne cash flf ows.\nThe Company regularly reviews these assumptions and makes adjustments to the faf ir value measurements as required by faf cts\nand circumstances. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has determined that all earn-out provisions have been achieved\nunder existing agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the liab\na ility for\nf\ncontingent consideration was $10 million (which was classifif ed\nwithin other current liabi\na lities) and $10 million (which was classifif ed within other long-term liabi\na lities), respectively,\nrepresenting the maximum required amounts to be paid under existing agreements. Adjustments to this liabi\na lity for\nf\ninterest\naccretion are recognized in interest expense, and any other changes in the faf ir value of this liabi\na lity are recognized within other\nincome (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.\n113"

Hyundai contributed to Motional appr\na\noximately $1.6 billion in cash, along with vehicle engineering\nservices, research and development resources and access to intellectua\nt\nl property for\nf\na 50% ownership interest in Motional. As a\nresult, Motional is expected to fu\nf nd all of its fut\nf ur\nt\ne operating expenses and investments in autonomous driving technologies for\nf\nthe for\nf\neseeabl\na e fut\nf ur\nt\ne. Consequently, Aptiv is not required to fund\nf\nthese investments and expenses, which appr\na\noximated $180\nmillion for\nf\nthe year ended December 31, 2019 prior to Motional’s for\nf\nmation. Upon closing of the transaction, Aptiv\ndeconsolidated the carryi\nr ng value of the associated assets and liabi\na lities contributed to Motional, previously classifif ed as held\nfor\nf\nsale, and recognized an asset of appr\na\noximately $2 billion within investments in afff if liates in the consolidated balance sheet,\nbased on the preliminary\nr faf ir value of its investment in Motional. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of appr\na\noximately\n$1.4 billion in the consolidated statement of operations (appr\na\noximately $5.32 per diluted share for\nf\nthe year ended December 31,\n2020), net of transaction costs of $22 million, based on the difff ef rence between the carryi\nr ng value of its contribution to Motional\nand the preliminary\nr faf ir value of its investment in Motional. The estimated faf ir value of Aptiv’s ownership interest in Motional\nwas determined primarily based on third-party valuations and management estimates, generally utilizing income and market\nappr\na\noaches. Determining the faf ir value of Motional and the underlying assets required the use of management’s judgment and\ninvolved signifif cant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of fut\nf ur\nt\ne cash flf ows, market rate\n120"

As a result, the Company determined that this subsidiary,\nr\nwhich is reported within the Signal and Power Solutions\nsegment, met the held for\nf\nsale criteria as of December 31, 2022. Consequently, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the\nCompany recorded a pre-tax charge of $51 million to impair the carryi\nr ng value of the Rus\nR\nsian subsidiary’\nr\ns net assets to faf ir\nvalue, which was recorded primarily within cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations. Approximately $25\nmillion of these charges were attributabl\na e to the noncontrolling interest based on the noncontrolling shareholder’s economic\ninterest. The remaining assets and liabi\na lities of the subsidiary\nr were reclassifif ed as held for\nf\nsale and reflf ect the appr\na\nopriate\nvaluation allowances. The net assets and liabi\na lities are de minimis and are presented as other current assets and other current\nliabi\na lities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.

In addition, the Company has competitive and\nmarket-appr\na\nopriate ownership requirements for\nf\nits directors and offf if cers. All of the RSUs granted under the PLC LTIP are\neligible to receive dividend equivalents for\nf\nany dividend paid frf om the grant date through the vesting date.

Signifif cant Accounting Policies for\nf\na complete description of the Company’s revenue recognition\naccounting policy.\nNature of Goods and Services\nThe principal activity frf om which the Company generates its revenue is the manufaf ctur\nt\ning of production parts for\nf\nOEM\ncustomers. Aptiv recognizes revenue for\nf\nproduction parts at a point in time, rather than over time, as the perfor\nf\nmance obligation\nis satisfif ed when customers obtain control of the product upon title transfef r and not as the product is manufaf ctur\nt\ned or\ndeveloped.\nAlthough production parts are highly customized with no alternative use, Aptiv does not have an enfor\nf\nceabl\na e right to\npayment as customers have the right to cancel a product program without a notifif cation period. The amount of revenue\nrecognized is based on the purchase order price and adjusted for\nf\nrevenue allocated to variabl\na e consideration (i.e. estimated\nrebates and price discounts), as appl\na\nicabl\na e. Customers typically pay for\nf\nproduction parts based on customary\nr business practices\nwith payment terms averaging 60 days.\nThe Company also generates revenue frf om the sale of softf ware licenses, post delivery\nr support and maintenance and\nprofef ssional softf ware services, primarily frf om Wind River, which the Company acquired in December 2022. Refef r to Note 20.\nAcquisitions and Divestitur\nt\nes for\nf\nfur\nf\nther infor\nf\nmation on this acquisition. The Company generally recognizes revenue for\nf\nsoftf ware licenses and profef ssional softf ware services at a point in time upon delivery\nr or when the services are provided.\nRevenue frf om post delivery\nr support and maintenance for\nf\nsoftf ware contracts are recognized over time on a ratabl\na e basis over the\ncontract term. Under certain of these arrangements, timing may difff ef r between revenue recognition and billing.\n128"

As permitted, Aptiv does not disclose infor\nf\nmation about\na\nremaining perfor\nf\nmance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less for\nf\nproduction parts.\nCustomer contracts for\nf\nsales of softf ware and related services are generally represented by a sales contract or purchase\norder with contract durations typically ranging frf om one to three years. Remaining perfor\nf\nmance obligations include contract\nliabi\na lities and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in fut\nf ur\nt\ne periods. Transaction price allocated to the\nremaining perfor\nf\nmance obligation is based on the standalone selling price. The value of the transaction price allocated to\nremaining perfor\nf\nmance obligations under softf ware and related service contracts as of December 31, 2022 was appr\na\noximately\n$135 million. The Company expects to recognize appr\na\noximately 67% of remaining perfor\nf\nmance obligations as revenue in the\nnext twelve months, and the remainder thereaftf er.\nCosts to Obtain a Contract\nFrom time to time, Aptiv makes payments to customers in conjunction with ongoing business. These payments to\ncustomers are generally recognized as a reduction to revenue at the time of the commitment to make these payments. However,\ncertain other payments to customers, or upfrf ont fef es, meet the criteria to be considered a cost to obtain a contract as they are\ndirectly attributabl\na e to a contract, are incremental and management expects the fef es to be recoverabl\na e. As of December 31, 2022\nand 2021, Aptiv has recorded $78 million (of which $17 million was classifif ed within other current assets and $61 million was\nclassifif ed within other long-term assets) and $92 million (of which $34 million was classifif ed within other current assets and\n$58 million was classifif ed within other long-term assets), respectively, related to these capi\na talized upfrf ont fef es.\nCapi\na talized upfrf ont fef es are amortized to revenue based on the transfef r of goods and services to the customer for\nf\nwhich\nthe upfrf ont fef es relate, which typically range frf om three to fif ve years. There have been no impairment losses in relation to the\ncosts capi\na talized. The amount of amortization to net sales was $28 million, $31 million and $18 million for\nf\nthe years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n25. LEASES\nLease Portfol\nf io\nThe Company has operating and fif nance leases for\nf\nreal estate, offf if ce equipment, automobiles, for\nf\nkliftf s and certain other\nequipment. The Company's leases have remaining lease terms of one year to 30 years, some of which include options to extend\nthe leases for\nf\nup to eight years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within one year. Certain of our lease\nagreements include rental payments which are adjusted periodically for\nf\ninflf ation. Our lease agreements do not contain any\nmaterial residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. When availabl\na e, we use the rate implicit in the lease to\ndiscount lease payments to present value; however, most of our leases do not provide a readily determinabl\na e implicit rate.\nTherefor\nf\ne, we must estimate our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on infor\nf\nmation availabl\na e at\nlease commencement. The incremental borrowing rate is not a quoted rate and is primarily derived by appl\na\nying a spread over\nU.S. Treasury\nr rates with a similar duration to the Company’s lease payments. The spread utilized is based on the Company’s\ncredit rating and the impact of ful\nf l collateralization.\nRelated Partyt Lease Agreement\nAptiv subleases certain offf if ce space to Motional, our autonomous driving joint ventur\nt\ne, which has a remaining lease term\nof appr\na\noximately six years as of December 31, 2022. Total income under the agreement was $4 million, $3 million and $3\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The sublease income and Aptiv’s associated\noperating lease cost are recorded to cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company believes the terms\nof the lease agreement have not signifif cantly been afff ef cted by the faf ct the Company and the lessee are related parties.\n130"

Under the supervision of the Chief Executive\nOfff if cer and Chief Financial Offf if cer, management conducted an evaluation of the efff ef ctiveness of the Company’s internal\ncontrol over fif nancial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the frf amework set for\nf\nth by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” Based on that\nevaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over fif nancial reporting was efff ef ctive as of\nDecember 31, 2022.
