Our international procurement team has secured the required \nmanufacturing materials and is committed to delivering products to all customers with our best efforts.\nThe Company has continued work on the ERP system implementation as part of the Digital Enterprise Transformation. The \nfirst phase of ERP implementation has been completed, with Australia and Singapore subsidiaries consolidated into one \nplatform. Phase 2 will bring the entire Company onto a unified platform that will significantly enhance efficiencies and business \nintelligence. The Company expects phase 2 of the ERP system implementation to begin in the first half-year of 2023 and take \n12 months to implement. \nOutlook\nTo increase the competitiveness of RT22, the Company decided to significantly raise the technical benchmark for the product, \nwhich pushed back the original deadlines but resulted in a superior product. The engineering of the 'RT22 50KW EV Charger \nModule' has continued throughout the period. It has included the safety certification by TUV SUD, which is to be completed \nby Q4 2022, to enable our customers to supply the product in Europe and the USA. In addition, engineering has continued to \nwork on the volume release of the product by validating a range of alternative components to ensure the supply chain meets \nmarket demand for the product. We are expecting RT22 to contribute significantly to company revenue in 2023. \nOn 26 July 2022, the Company announced that the 'Highbury DC Bi-Directional Charger' project was put on hold, and the \navailable engineering resources have been deployed to other developments, such as the 'RT22 50KW EV Charger Module' \nand 'high-voltage input rectifier', which are now scheduled H1 2023.\nWe will continue to strive to grow our business in 2023, particularly in the electric vehicle chargers market.\n30 September 2022\nMelbourne\nOn behalf of the Board\nYing Ming Wang\nChairman\nOn behala f f f f of\nof\nof\nof\no the\nhe Board\nYing\nn\nMing Wa\nWang\nng\nChairman\nan\nan\nan\nan\na\nFor personal use only"

      "text": "Rectifier Technologies Ltd\nDirectors' report\n30 June 2022\n8\nThe reward framework is designed to align executive reward to shareholders' interests. The Board has considered that it \nshould seek to enhance shareholders' interests by:\n●\nhaving economic profit as a core component of plan design;\n●\nfocusing on sustained growth in shareholder wealth, consisting of dividends and growth in share price, and delivering \nconstant or increasing return on assets as well as focusing the executive on key non-financial drivers of value; and\n●\nattracting and retaining high calibre executives.\nAdditionally, the reward framework should seek to enhance executives' interests by:\n●\nrewarding capability and experience\n●\nreflecting competitive reward for contribution to growth in shareholder wealth\n●\nproviding a clear structure for earning rewards\nIn accordance with best practice corporate governance, the remuneration structure of non-executive director and executive \ndirector is separate.\nNon-executive directors' remuneration\nThe Board's policy is to remunerate non-executive directors at market rates for comparable companies for time, commitment \nand responsibilities. The Board determines payments to the non-executive directors and reviews their remuneration annually, \nbased on market practice, duties and accountability. Independent external advice is sought when required. The maximum \naggregate amount of fees that can be paid to non-executive directors is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual \nGeneral Meeting. Fees for non-executive directors are not linked to the performance of the consolidated entity.\nASX listing rules require the aggregate non-executive directors' remuneration to be determined periodically by a general \nmeeting. The most recent determination was at the Annual General Meeting held on 25 January 2022, where the \nshareholders approved a maximum annual aggregate remuneration of $32,760.\nExecutive remuneration\nThe consolidated entity aims to reward executives based on their position and responsibility, with a level and mix of \nremuneration which has both fixed and variable components.\nThe executive remuneration and reward framework has four components:\n●\nbase pay and non-monetary benefits;\n●\nshort-term performance incentives;\n●\nshare-based payments; and\n●\nother remuneration such as superannuation and long service leave.\nThe combination of these comprises the executive's total remuneration.\nFixed remuneration, consisting of base salary, superannuation and non-monetary benefits, is reviewed annually by the Board \nbased on individual and business unit performance, the overall performance of the consolidated entity and comparable \nmarket remunerations.\nExecutives may receive their fixed remuneration in the form of cash or other fringe benefits (for example motor vehicle \nbenefits), which does not create any additional costs to the consolidated entity and provides additional value to the executive.\nThe short-term incentives ('STI') program is designed to align the targets of the business units with the performance hurdles \nof executives. STI payments are granted to executives based on specific annual targets and key performance indicators \n('KPI's') being achieved. KPI's include profit contribution, customer satisfaction, leadership contribution and product \nmanagement.\nThe long-term incentives ('LTI') include long service leave and share-based payments. Shares are awarded to executives in \naccordance with performance guidelines established by the Board. These include increase in shareholders' value relative to \nthe entire market and the increase compared to the consolidated entity's direct competitors.

The intention of this program is to facilitate goal congruence between \ndirectors/executives with that of the business and shareholders. Where applicable, the KPI’s are set annually, with a certain \nlevel of consultation with directors/executives to ensure buy-in. The measures are specifically tailored to the areas each \ndirector/executive is involved in and has a level of control over. The KPI’s target areas the Board believes hold greater \npotential for the consolidated entity expansion and profit, covering financial and non-financial as well as short-term and long-\nterm goals. The level set for each KPI is based on budgeted figures for the consolidated entity and respective industry \nstandards. \nPerformance in relation to the KPI’s is assessed annually, with bonuses being awarded depending on the number and \ndeemed difficulty of the KPI’s achieved. Following the assessment, the KPI’s are reviewed by the Board in light of the desired \nand actual outcomes, and their efficiency is assessed in relation to the consolidated entity’s goals and shareholder wealth \nbefore the KPI’s are set for the following year.\nIn determining whether or not a KPI has been achieved, Rectifier Technologies Ltd bases the assessment on audited figures; \nhowever, where the KPI involves comparison of individual performance within the consolidated entity, management reports \nwhich form the foundation for the consolidated entity audited results are used.\nRefer to the section 'Additional information' below for details of the earnings and total shareholders return for the last five \nyears.\nUse of remuneration consultants\nDuring the financial year ended 30 June 2022, the consolidated entity, did not engage any remuneration consultants.\nVoting and comments made at the Company's 30 June 2021 Annual General Meeting ('AGM')\nAt the 25 January 2022 AGM, 99.77% of the votes received supported the adoption of the remuneration report for the year \nended 30 June 2021.

The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, \nwhich is Rectifier Technologies Ltd's functional and presentation currency.\nRectifier Technologies Ltd is a listed public company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in Australia. Its registered \noffice and principal place of business is:\n97 Highbury Road\nBurwood, VIC 3125\nA description of the nature of the consolidated entity's operations and its principal activities are included in the directors' \nreport, which is not part of the financial statements.\nThe financial statements were authorised for issue, in accordance with a resolution of directors, on 30 September 2022. The \ndirectors have the power to amend and reissue the financial statements.\nNote 2. Significant accounting policies\nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. These policies \nhave been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.\nNew or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations adopted\nThe consolidated entity has adopted all of the new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the \nAustralian Accounting Standards Board ('AASB') that are mandatory for the current reporting period.\nAny new or amended Accounting Standards or Interpretations that are not yet mandatory have not been early adopted.\nGoing concern\nThe financial report has been prepared on the basis of the Group continuing as a going concern, which assumes continuity \nof normal business activities and realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.\nBasis of preparation\nThese general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and \nInterpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board ('AASB') and the Corporations Act 2001, as appropriate \nfor for-profit oriented entities. These financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards as \nissued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB').\nHistorical cost convention\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.\nCritical accounting estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires \nmanagement to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the consolidated entity's accounting policies. The areas \ninvolving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the \nfinancial statements, are disclosed in note 3.\nParent entity information\nIn accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, these financial statements present the results of the consolidated entity only. \nSupplementary information about the parent entity is disclosed in note 33.\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of Rectifier Technologies Ltd \n('Company' or 'parent entity') as at 30 June 2022 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year ended.

      "text": "Rectifier Technologies Ltd\nNotes to the financial statements\n30 June 2022\nNote 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)\n20\nSubsidiaries are all those entities over which the consolidated entity has control. The consolidated entity controls an entity \nwhen the consolidated entity is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the \nability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from \nthe date on which control is transferred to the consolidated entity. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.\nIntercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between entities in the consolidated entity are \neliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset \ntransferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies \nadopted by the consolidated entity.\nThe acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. A change in ownership interest, \nwithout the loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction, where the difference between the consideration \ntransferred and the book value of the share of the non-controlling interest acquired is recognised directly in equity attributable \nto the parent.\nWhere the consolidated entity loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets including goodwill, liabilities and \nnon-controlling interest in the subsidiary together with any cumulative translation differences recognised in equity. The \nconsolidated entity recognises the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any investment retained \ntogether with any gain or loss in profit or loss.\nOperating segments\nOperating segments are presented using the 'management approach', where the information presented is on the same basis \nas the internal reports provided to the Chief Operating Decision Makers ('CODM'). The CODM is responsible for the allocation \nof resources to operating segments and assessing their performance.\nForeign currency translation\nThe financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is Rectifier Technologies Ltd's functional and presentation \ncurrency.\nForeign currency transactions\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the entity’s functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the \ndates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from \nthe translation at financial year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are \nrecognised in profit or loss.\nForeign operations\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates at the reporting \ndate. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the average exchange \nrates, which approximate the rates at the dates of the transactions for the period. All resulting foreign exchange differences \nare recognised in other comprehensive income through the foreign currency reserve in equity.\nThe foreign currency reserve is recognised in profit or loss when the foreign operation or net investment is disposed of.\nRevenue recognition\nThe consolidated entity recognises revenue as follows:\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nRevenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the consolidated entity is expected to be entitled \nin exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. For each contract with a customer, the consolidated entity: \nidentifies the contract with a customer; identifies the performance obligations in the contract; determines the transaction price \nwhich takes into account estimates of variable consideration and the time value of money; allocates the transaction price to \nthe separate performance obligations on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service to \nbe delivered; and recognises revenue when or as each performance obligation is satisfied in a manner that depicts the \ntransfer to the customer of the goods or services promised.\nFor personal use only"

      "text": "Rectifier Technologies Ltd\nNotes to the financial statements\n30 June 2022\nNote 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)\n21\nVariable consideration within the transaction price, if any, reflects concessions provided to the customer such as discounts, \nrebates and refunds, any potential bonuses receivable from the customer and any other contingent events. Such estimates \nare determined using either the 'expected value' or 'most likely amount' method. The measurement of variable consideration \nis subject to a constraining principle whereby revenue will only be recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a \nsignificant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur. The measurement constraint continues \nuntil the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Amounts received that are subject \nto the constraining principle are recognised as a refund liability.\nSale of goods\nRevenue from the sale of power rectifiers and the related after-sales services is recognised at the point in time when the \nconsolidated entity satisfies performance obligations by transferring the promised products and services, which is generally \nat the time of delivery.\nThe consolidated entity recognises contract liabilities for consideration received in respect of unsatisfied performance \nobligations and reports these amounts as other liabilities in the statement of financial position. Similarly, if the consolidated \nentity satisfies a performance obligation before it receives the consideration, the consolidated entity recognises either a \ncontract asset or a receivable in its statement of financial position, depending on whether something other than the passage \nof time is required before the consideration is due.\nOther revenue\nOther revenue is recognised when it is received or when the right to receive payment is established.\nInterest\nInterest revenue is recognised as interest accrued using the effective interest method. This is a method of calculating the \namortised cost of a financial asset and allocating the interest income over the relevant period using the effective interest rate, \nwhich is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the \nnet carrying amount of the financial asset.\nIncome tax\nThe income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable on that period's taxable income based on the applicable \nincome tax rate for each jurisdiction, adjusted by the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary \ndifferences, unused tax losses and the adjustment recognised for prior periods, where applicable.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to be applied when the \nassets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted, except for:\n●\nWhen the deferred income tax asset or liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a \ntransaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor\ntaxable profits; or\n●\nWhen the taxable temporary difference is associated with interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, and the\ntiming of the reversal can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable\nfuture.\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that \nfuture taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.\nThe carrying amount of recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date. Deferred tax \nassets recognised are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that future taxable profits will be available for the \ncarrying amount to be recovered. Previously unrecognised deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable \nthat there are future taxable profits available to recover the asset.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against \ncurrent tax liabilities and deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities; and they relate to the same taxable authority on \neither the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend to settle simultaneously.\nFor personal use only"

Significant accounting policies (continued)\n22\nRectifier Technologies Ltd (the 'head entity') and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries have formed an income tax \nconsolidated group under the tax consolidation regime. The head entity and each subsidiary in the tax consolidated group \ncontinue to account for their own current and deferred tax amounts. The tax consolidated group has applied the 'separate \ntaxpayer within group' approach in determining the appropriate amount of taxes to allocate to members of the tax \nconsolidated group.\nIn addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, the head entity also recognises the current tax liabilities (or assets) \nand the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from each subsidiary in the tax \nconsolidated group.\nAssets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are recognised as amounts \nreceivable from or payable to other entities in the tax consolidated group. The tax funding arrangement ensures that the \nintercompany charge equals the current tax liability or benefit of each tax consolidated group member, resulting in neither a \ncontribution by the head entity to the subsidiaries nor a distribution by the subsidiaries to the head entity.\nCurrent and non-current classification\nAssets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position based on current and non-current classification.\nAn asset is classified as current when: it is either expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the \nconsolidated entity's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is expected to be realised within \n12 months after the reporting period, or the asset is cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used \nto settle a liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other assets are classified as non-current.\nA liability is classified as current when: it is either expected to be settled in the consolidated entity's normal operating cycle; \nit is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period, or there is no \nunconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other liabilities \nare classified as non-current.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other short-term, highly \nliquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and \nwhich are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\nTrade and other receivables\nTrade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective \ninterest method, less any allowance for expected credit losses. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 30 \ndays.\nThe consolidated entity has applied the simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which uses a lifetime \nexpected loss allowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on days \noverdue.\nOther receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less any allowance for expected credit losses.\nInventories\nRaw materials, work in progress and finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a 'weighted \naverage' basis. Cost comprises of direct materials and delivery costs, direct labour, import duties and other taxes, an \nappropriate proportion of variable and fixed overhead expenditure based on normal operating capacity, and, where \napplicable, transfers from cash flow hedging reserves in equity. Costs of purchased inventory are determined after deducting \nrebates and discounts received or receivable.\nStock in transit is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises of purchase and delivery costs, net of \nrebates and discounts received or receivable.\nNet realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion \nand the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\nFor personal use only"

Significant accounting policies (continued)\n23\nProperty, plant and equipment\nFreehold land is stated at historical cost and is not depreciated but is subject to impairment testing if there is any indication \nof impairment.\nBuilding and plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost \nincludes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write off the net cost of each item of property, plant and equipment \n(excluding land) over their expected useful lives as follows:\nBuilding\n50 years\nLeasehold improvement\n10 years\nPlant and equipment\n2.5-5 years\nMotor vehicle\n5 years\nThe residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the assets, \nwhichever is shorter.\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when there is no future economic benefit to the \nconsolidated entity. Gains and losses between the carrying amount and the disposal proceeds are taken to profit or loss.\nRight-of-use assets\nA right-of-use asset is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which \ncomprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the \ncommencement date net of any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred, and, except where included in the \ncost of inventories, an estimate of costs expected to be incurred for dismantling and removing the underlying asset, and \nrestoring the site or asset.\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful \nlife of the asset, whichever is shorter. Where the consolidated entity expects to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the \nend of the lease term, the depreciation is over its estimated useful life. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment or \nadjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.\nThe consolidated entity has elected not to recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for short-term \nleases with terms of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Lease payments on these assets are expensed to \nprofit or loss as incurred.\nIntangible assets\nResearch and development\nResearch costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Development costs are capitalised when: it is probable \nthat the project will be a success considering its commercial and technical feasibility; the consolidated entity is able to use \nor sell the asset; the consolidated entity has sufficient resources and intent to complete the development; and its costs can \nbe measured reliably. Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected \nbenefit, being their finite life of 10 years.\nImpairment of non-financial assets\nNon-financial assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying \namount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount \nexceeds its recoverable amount.\nRecoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. The value-in-use is the \npresent value of the estimated future cash flows relating to the asset using a pre-tax discount rate specific to the asset or \ncash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Assets that do not have independent cash flows are grouped together to \nform a cash-generating unit.\nFor personal use only"

Significant accounting policies (continued)\n24\nTrade and other payables\nTrade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the consolidated entity prior to the end of \nthe financial year and which are unpaid. Due to their short-term nature, they are measured at amortised cost and are not \ndiscounted. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.\nBorrowings\nLoans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of transaction costs. They \nare subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\nLease liabilities\nA lease liability is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The lease liability is initially recognised at the present \nvalue of the lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, \nif that rate cannot be readily determined, the consolidated entity's incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments comprise of \nfixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, amounts \nexpected to be paid under residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option when the exercise of the option is \nreasonably certain to occur, and any anticipated termination penalties. The variable lease payments that do not depend on \nan index or a rate are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.\nLease liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amounts are remeasured \nif there is a change in the following: future lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate used; residual \nguarantee; lease term; the certainty of a purchase option and termination penalties. When a lease liability is remeasured, an \nadjustment is made to the corresponding right-of use asset, or to profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset \nis fully written down.\nFinance costs\nFinance costs attributable to qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the asset. All other finance costs are expensed in \nthe period in which they are incurred.\nEmployee benefits\nShort-term employee benefits\nLiabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and long service leave expected to be \nsettled wholly within 12 months of the reporting date are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities \nare settled.\nOther long-term employee benefits\nThe liability for annual leave and long service leave not expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are \nmeasured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to \nthe reporting date. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, the experience of employee departures \nand periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on high-quality \ncorporate bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.\nDefined contribution superannuation expense\nContributions to defined contribution superannuation plans are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.\nShare-based payments\nEquity-settled share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees.\nEquity-settled transactions are awards of shares, or options over shares, that are provided to employees in exchange for the \nrendering of services.\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions are measured at fair value on grant date. Fair value is independently determined using \nthe Black-Scholes option pricing model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of dilution, \nthe share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk \nfree interest rate for the term of the option, together with non-vesting conditions that do not determine whether the \nconsolidated entity receives the services that entitle the employees to receive payment.

Significant accounting policies (continued)\n25\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity at the vesting \ndate which is at the grant date. The cumulative charge to profit or loss is calculated based on the grant date fair value of the \naward, the best estimate of the number of awards that are likely to vest and the expired portion of the vesting period. The \namount recognised in profit or loss for the period is the cumulative amount calculated at each reporting date less amounts \nalready recognised in previous periods.\nIf equity-settled awards are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the modification has not been made. An \nadditional expense is recognised, over the remaining vesting period, for any modification that increases the total fair value \nof the share-based compensation benefit as at the date of modification.\nIf the non-vesting condition is within the control of the consolidated entity or employee, the failure to satisfy the condition is \ntreated as a cancellation. If the condition is not within the control of the consolidated entity or employee and is not satisfied \nduring the vesting period, any remaining expense for the award is recognised over the remaining vesting period, unless the \naward is forfeited.\nIf equity-settled awards are cancelled, it is treated as if it has vested on the date of cancellation, and any remaining expense \nis recognised immediately. If a new replacement award is substituted for the cancelled award, the cancelled and new award \nis treated as if they were a modification.\nIssued capital\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity.\nIncremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, \nfrom the proceeds.\nDividends\nDividends are recognised when declared during the financial year and no longer at the discretion of the Company.\nEarnings per share\nBasic earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of Rectifier Technologies Ltd, excluding \nany costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding \nduring the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the financial year.\nDiluted earnings per share\nDiluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the \nafter income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted \naverage number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming conversion of all dilutive potential \nordinary shares.\nGoods and Services Tax ('GST') and other similar taxes\nRevenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred are not \nrecoverable from the tax authority. In this case, it is recognised as part of the cost of the acquisition of the asset or as part of \nthe expense.\nReceivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST \nrecoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority is included in other receivables or other payables in the statement of \nfinancial position.\nCash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities \nwhich are recoverable from, or payable to the tax authority, are presented as operating cash flows.\nCommitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority.\nFor personal use only"

The consolidated \nentity has not yet assessed the impact of these new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations.\nNote 3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that \naffect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Management continually evaluates its judgements and estimates in \nrelation to assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses. Management bases its judgements, estimates and \nassumptions on historical experience and on other various factors, including expectations of future events, management \nbelieves to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting judgements and estimates will seldom equal \nthe related actual results. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material \nadjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities (refer to the respective notes) within the next financial year are \ndiscussed below.\nProvision for impairment of inventories\nThe provision for impairment of inventories assessment requires a degree of estimation and judgement. The level of the \nprovision is assessed by taking into account the recent sales experience, the ageing of inventories and other factors that \naffect inventory obsolescence.\nR & D tax rebate\nThe consolidated entity has recognised the R&D rebate on an accrual basis. As the return has not yet been submitted, the \nconsolidated entity has made an estimate of the likely refund amount based on the preliminary number provided by external \ntax consultant.\nIncome tax\nThe consolidated entity is subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgement is required \nin determining the provision for income tax. There are many transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary \ncourse of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The consolidated entity recognises liabilities for \nanticipated tax audit issues based on the consolidated entity's current understanding of the tax law. Where the final tax \noutcome of these matters is different from the carrying amounts, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax \nprovisions in the period in which such determination is made.\nFor personal use only"

Financial instruments\nFinancial risk management objectives\nThe Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the consolidated entity and the parent entity’s risk management \nobjectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and \noperating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the consolidated entity and the \nparent entity’s finance function. The Board receives monthly reports from the Chief Financial Officer through which it reviews \nthe effectiveness of the processes put in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets.\nThe overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the \nconsolidated entity’s competitiveness and flexibility.\nMarket risk\nForeign currency risk\nThe consolidated entity undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currency and is exposed to foreign currency \nrisk through foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe only currency where receivables are not denominated in their functional currency is US dollars (USD). Cash balances \nin USD are kept at levels only sufficient to pay the amounts owing. Since the local sales in Malaysia are made by foreign \noperations in their individual functional currencies, there is no direct foreign currency risk exposure involved. The \nconsolidated entity’s exposure to foreign currency risk is primarily its exposure to trade receivables denominated in USD. \nFor personal use only"

Cash \nbalances that are held at call for day to day activities are non-interest bearing. \nAn analysis of remaining contractual maturities is shown in 'liquidity and interest rate risk management' below.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk arises principally from the consolidated entity’s trade receivables. It is the risk that the counterparty fails to \ndischarge its obligation in respect of the instrument.\nPrior to accepting new customers, a credit check is obtained from a reputable external source. Based on this information, \ncredit limits and payment terms are established. Customers who subsequently fail to meet their credit terms are required to \nmake purchases on a prepayment basis until creditworthiness can be re-established.\nThe nature of the consolidated entity’s operations means that approximately 92% (2021: 92%) of its sales are made to 5 \n(2021: 5) key customers in Australia, Singapore and America. Whilst credit risk is mainly influenced by factors specific to \nthese individual customers, the concentration of sales geographically is a contributory factor. \nFor personal use only"

This \nrepresents the estimated claim for the period 1 July \n2021 to 30 June 2022. \nThis is a key audit matter due to the size of the \nreceivable and the degree of judgement and \ninterpretation of the R&D tax legislation required by \nmanagement to assess the eligibility of the R&D \nexpenditure under the scheme. \nOur procedures included, amongst others: \n•\nObtaining and documenting through discussions with \nmanagement an understanding of the process to\nestimate the claim;\n•\nEvaluating the competence, capabilities and\nobjectivity of management’s expert;\n•\nReviewing and testing the R&D estimate by:\n−\nreviewing the methodology used by\nmanagement’s expert for consistency with the\nR&D tax offset rules;\n−\nperforming testing on a sample of R&D expenses\nto supporting documents to assess eligibility and\naccuracy of the amounts recorded in the general\nledger;\n−\nconsidering the nature of expenses against the\neligibility criteria of the R&D tax incentive scheme \nto assess whether the expense included in the\nestimate are likely to meet the eligibility criteria.\n•\nComparing the nature of the R&D expenditure\nincluded in the current year to the prior year’s claim;\n•\nComparing the eligible expenditure used in the\nreceivable calculation to expenditure recorded in the\ngeneral ledger;\n•\nConsidering the entity’s history of successful claims;\n•\nInspecting copies of relevant correspondence with\nAusIndustry and the Australian Taxation Office\nrelated to the claims; and\n•\nAssessing the adequacy of the relevant disclosures\nin the financial statements.\n50\nFor personal use only"

      "text": "Grant Thornton Australia Limited \nInventory valuation (Note 11) \nAs at 30 June 2022, the Group holds inventory with a \ncarrying value of $5,877,879. The Group is required to \ncarry their inventory at the lower of cost or net \nrealisable value, in accordance with AASB 102 \nInventories. \nDetermining the value of inventory requires significant \njudgement. Specifically, estimating inventory provisions \ninvolves significant management judgement, including \npredictions about market conditions, future sales, and \nobsolescence. \nThis is a key audit matter due to the materiality of the \ninventory balance and the level of management \njudgement required to determine the inventory value. \nOur procedures included, amongst others: \n•\nUnderstanding and documenting management's\nprocess of calculating the inventory provision and\nevaluating the Group’s compliance with the\nrequirements of AASB 102;\n•\nTesting a sample of inventory items to assess the\ncost basis and net realisable value of inventories;\n•\nAnalysing slow-moving inventory and evaluating\ntheir saleability and obsolescence;\n•\nConsidering additional factors that may indicate\ninventory items require an adjustment to their\ncarrying amount, including discontinued lines;  and\n•\nAssessing the adequacy of the related disclosures in\nthe financial statements.\nRevenue recognition (Note 5) \nRevenue recorded from the sale of products and \nservices to customers amounted to $14,761,523 for the \nyear ended 30 June 2022. \nThe Group enters into transactions for the sale of \npower rectifiers. The total transaction price for a \ncontract is based on their relative stand-alone selling \nprice. Revenue is recognised at a point in time when \nthe Group satisfies the performance obligations, which \nis generally at the point of delivery. \nThis is a key audit matter given the judgement applied \nto determine the appropriate recognition of revenue \nand the material nature of revenue to the Group’s \noverall performance. \nOur procedures included, amongst others: \n•\nReviewing revenue recognition policies for\nappropriateness in accordance with AASB 15\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers;\n•\nTesting a sample of revenue transactions during the\nyear and assessing whether revenue has been\nrecognised in accordance with AASB 15, including:\n−\nReviewing the relevant contracts with customers;\n−\nAssessing management’s determination of\nperformance obligations within contracts and the\nallocation of the transaction price to those\nobligations;\n−\nTesting the timing of revenue recognition;\n•\nEvaluating sales transactions around reporting date\nto assess whether revenue is recognised in the\ncorrect period;\n•\nPerforming non-substantive analytical procedures to\nassess revenue recognised against known business\nfactors and investigating variances to our\nexpectations; and\n•\nAssessing the adequacy of related disclosures in the\nfinancial statements.\n51\nFor personal use only"
