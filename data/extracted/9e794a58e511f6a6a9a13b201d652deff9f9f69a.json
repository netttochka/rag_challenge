Key Information\nImplications of Being a Company with the Holding Company Structure and the VIE Structures\nThe VIE Structures and Associated Risks\nPintec Technology Holdings Limited, the Parent, is the ultimate Cayman Islands holding company with no material operations of its\nown. The Parent carries out its business in China through the WFOEs and their respective contractual arrangements, commonly known as\nthe VIE structures, with the VIEs based in China and their respective shareholders. Investors in our securities are purchasing the equity\nsecurities of Pintec Technology Holdings Limited, the Cayman Islands holding company, rather than the equity securities of the VIEs in\nwhich our operations are conducted.\nThe VIE structures were established through a series of agreements, including those by and among Sky City (Beijing) Technology\nCo., Ltd., Anquying (Tianjin) Technology Co., Ltd. and the shareholders of Anquying (Tianjin) Technology Co., Ltd., those by and\namong Pintec (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing Xinshun Dingye Technology Co., Ltd. and the shareholders of Beijing Xinshun\nDingye Technology Co., Ltd., those by and among Pintec (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd., Pintec Jinke (Beijing) Technology Information\nCo., Ltd. and the shareholders of Pintec Jinke (Beijing) Technology Information Co., Ltd., and those by and among Pintec (Beijing)\nTechnology Co., Ltd., Beijing Hongdian Fund Distributor Co., Ltd. and the shareholders of Beijing Hongdian Fund Distributor Co., Ltd..\nThe series of agreements generally comprises executive business cooperation agreements (or exclusive technology consulting and service\nagreement), equity pledge agreements, exclusive option agreements, shareholders’ voting rights proxy agreements and spousal consent\nletters. The contractual arrangements allow us to (1) be considered as the primary beneficiary of the VIEs for accounting purposes and\nconsolidate the financial results of the VIEs, (2) receive substantially all of the economic benefits of the VIEs, (3) have the pledge right\nover the equity interests in the VIEs as the pledgee, and (4) have an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in the\nVIEs when and to the extent permitted by PRC law. For details, see “Item 4. Information on the Company — C. Organizational\nStructure — Contractual Arrangements with Our Variable Interest Entities.”\nHowever, neither the Parent nor WFOEs own any equity interest in the VIEs. Our contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their\nrespective shareholders are not equivalent of an investment in the equity interest of the VIEs. Instead, as described above, we are\nregarded as the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and consolidate the financial results of the VIEs under U.S. GAAP in light of the VIE\nstructures.\nThe VIE structures involve unique risks to holders of our securities. It may be less effective than direct ownership in providing us\nwith operational control over the VIEs, and we may incur substantial costs to enforce the terms of the arrangements. For instance, the\nVIEs and their respective shareholders could breach their contractual arrangements with us by, among other things, failing to conduct the\noperations of the VIEs in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests. If we had direct ownership of\nthe VIEs in China, we would be able to exercise our rights as a shareholder to effect changes in the board of directors of the VIEs, which\nin turn could implement changes, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations, at the management and operational level. However,\nunder the current contractual arrangements, we rely on the performance by the VIEs and their respective shareholders of their obligations\nunder the contracts to direct the VIEs’ activities. The shareholders of the VIEs may not act in the best interests of our company or may\nnot perform its obligations under these contracts. If any dispute relating to these contracts remains unresolved, we will have to enforce\nour rights under these contracts through the operations of PRC law and arbitration, litigation and other legal proceedings and therefore\nwill be subject to uncertainties in the PRC legal system."

      "text": "Table of Contents\n4\nWe may face challenges in enforcing the contractual arrangements due to jurisdictional and legal limitations. There are substantial\nuncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations and rules regarding the status of the\nrights of our Cayman Islands holding company with respect to the contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their respective\nshareholders through the WFOEs. As of the date of this annual report, the contractual arrangements governing the VIEs have not been\ntested in a court of law. It is uncertain whether any new PRC laws or regulations relating to VIE structures will be adopted or, if adopted,\nwhat they would provide. If we or the VIEs are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations or fail to obtain\nor maintain any of the required licenses, permits, registrations or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad\ndiscretion to take action in dealing with such violations or failures. The PRC regulatory authorities could disallow the VIE structures at\nany time in the future. If the PRC government deems that our contractual arrangements with the VIEs do not comply with PRC\nregulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the relevant industries, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations\nchange or are interpreted differently in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties and may incur substantial costs to enforce the\nterms of the arrangements, or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations. Our Cayman Islands holding company, our\nsubsidiaries, the VIEs and our shareholders face uncertainty with respect to potential future actions by the PRC government that could\naffect the enforceability of the contractual arrangements with the VIEs and, consequently, significantly affect the financial performance\nof our company and the VIEs as a whole. For details, see “— D. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Corporate Structure.”\nFor a condensed consolidation schedule depicting the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for us, the WFOEs and\nthe VIEs during 2020, 2021 and 2022, see “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects.” For details of the permissions and\nlicenses required for operating our business in China and the related limitations, see “— Our Operations in China and Permissions\nRequired from the PRC Authorities for Our Operations.”"

For instance, if any of the WFOEs or the VIEs incur\ndebt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing such debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to us and our\nshareholders, as well as the ability to settle amounts owed under the contractual arrangements. As of the date of this annual report, none\nof Pintec Technology Holdings Limited, the WFOEs and the VIEs has paid any dividends or made any distributions to their respective\nshareholders, including any U.S. investors, nor do we have any present plan to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We\ncurrently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business. See\n“Dividend Policy” for details. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, the total amount of the service fees that the VIEs paid to the WFOEs under the\ncontractual arrangements was RMB77.7 million (US$12.2 million), RMB8.8 million (US$1.4 million) and RMB7.5 million (US$1.1\nmillion), respectively. We expect to continue to distribute earnings and settle the service fees owed under the contractual arrangements at\nthe request of the WFOEs and based on our business needs, and do not expect to declare dividend in the foreseeable future.\nUnder PRC laws and regulations, the WFOEs are permitted to pay dividends only out of their retained earnings, if any, as\ndetermined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Furthermore, the WFOEs and the VIEs are required to make\nappropriations to certain statutory reserve funds or may make appropriations to certain discretionary funds, which are not distributable as\ncash dividends except in the event of a solvent liquidation of the companies. Remittance of dividends by the WFOEs out of China is also\nsubject to certain procedures with the banks designated by the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”). These\nrestrictions are benchmarked against the paid-in capital and the statutory reserve funds of the WFOEs and the net assets of the VIEs in\nwhich we have no legal ownership. In addition, while there are currently no such restrictions on foreign exchange and our ability to\ntransfer cash or assets between Pintec Technology Holdings Limited and our subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong, if certain PRC\nlaws and regulations, including existing laws and regulations and those enacted or promulgated in the future were to become applicable\nto our subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong in the future, and to the extent our cash or assets are in Hong Kong or a Hong Kong entity,\nsuch funds or assets may not be available due to interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations on our ability to transfer\nfunds or assets by the PRC government. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the PRC government will not intervene or impose\nrestrictions on Pintec Technology Holdings Limited, its subsidiaries and the VIEs to transfer or distribute cash within the organization,\nwhich could result in an inability of or prohibition on making transfers or distributions to entities outside of mainland China and Hong\nKong.\nUnder PRC laws and regulations, we, the Cayman Islands holding company, may fund the WFOEs only through capital\ncontributions or loans, and fund the VIEs only through loans, subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval\nrequirements. For details, see “Item 3. Key Information—Implications of Being a Company with the Holding Company Structure and the\nVIE Structures—The VIE Structures and Associated Risks.”"

Our operations in China are governed by PRC laws and\nregulations. We and the VIE are required to obtain certain licenses, permits and approvals from relevant governmental authorities in\nChina in order to operate our business. As of the date of this annual report, as advised by our PRC counsel, Shihui Partners, the WFOEs\nand the VIEs have obtained the licenses, permits and registrations from the PRC government authorities that are material and necessary\nfor our business operations in China. Given the uncertainties of interpretation and implementation of relevant laws and regulations and\nthe enforcement practice by relevant government authorities, and the promulgation of new laws and regulations and amendment to the\nexisting ones, we may be required to obtain additional licenses, permits, registrations, filings or approvals for our business operations in\nthe future. We cannot assure you that we or the VIEs will be able to obtain, in a timely manner or at all, or maintain such licenses,\npermits or approvals, and we or the VIEs may also inadvertently conclude that such permissions or approvals are not required. Any lack\nof or failure to maintain requisite approvals, licenses or permits applicable to us or the VIEs may have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and prospects and cause the value of any securities we offer to significantly decline or\nbecome worthless. For details, see “— D. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Doing Business in China— Because all of our operations are\nin China, our business is subject to the complex and evolving laws and regulations there. The Chinese government may exercise certain\noversight and discretion over the conduct of our business and may influence our operations at time, which could result in a material\nchange in our operations and/or the value of our ADSs.”\nOn December 28, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China (the “CAC”) and other 12 PRC regulatory authorities jointly issued\nan amendment to the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (the “Cybersecurity Review Measures”), which took effect on February 15,\n2022. See “Item 4. Information on the Company — Regulation — Regulations Relating to Internet Information Security and Privacy\nProtection.”\nPursuant to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, in addition to “critical information infrastructure operators” who procure internet\nproducts and services that affect or may affect national security shall be subject to a cybersecurity review, any “online platform\noperators” carrying out data processing activities that affect or may affect national security should also be subject to the cybersecurity\nreview requirements. The Cybersecurity Review Measures also provide that if a “online platform operator” holding personal information\nof more than one million users intends to go public in a foreign country, it must apply for a cybersecurity review. In addition, the relevant\nPRC governmental authorities may initiate cybersecurity review if they determine certain network products, services, or data processing\nactivities affect or may affect national security. As of the date of this annual report, we have not been informed by any PRC governmental\nauthority of any requirement that we file for a cybersecurity review. However, if we are not able to comply with the cybersecurity and\ndata privacy requirements in a timely manner, or at all, we may be subject to government enforcement actions and investigations, fines,\npenalties, suspension of our non-compliant operations, or removal of our applications from the relevant application stores, among other\nsanctions, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. See “— D. Risk Factors — Risks Relating\nto Doing Business in China — The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our\nbusiness activities and may intervene or influence our operations at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations\nand the value of our ADSs.”"

The Overseas Listing Trial Measures has comprehensively improved and reformed the existing\nregulatory regime for overseas offering and listing of securities by PRC domestic companies and regulates both direct and indirect\noverseas offering and listing of securities by PRC domestic companies by adopting a filing-based regulatory regime. According to the\nOverseas Listing Trial Measures, PRC domestic companies that seek to offer and list securities in overseas markets, either in direct or\nindirect means, are required to fulfill the filing procedure with the CSRC and report relevant information. The CSRC provided further\nnotice related to the Overseas Listing Trial Measures that companies that have already been listed on overseas stock exchanges prior to\nMarch 31, 2023 are not required to make immediate filings for its listing, but are required to make filings for subsequent offerings in\naccordance with the Overseas Listing Trial Measures, i.e., to file with the CSRC within three business days after the closing of such\nsubsequent offerings. As we had been listed on Nasdaq prior to March 31, 2023, we are not required to make immediate filing with the\nCSRC in connection with our listing on Nasdaq. However, we could be subject to the filing requirements with the CSRC if we conduct\nsubsequent offerings. See “Item 4. Information on the Company — Regulation — Regulations Relating to M&A and Overseas Listing.”\nWe cannot assure you that we or the VIEs can complete the filing procedures, obtain the approvals or complete other compliance\nprocedures in a timely manner, or at all, or that any completion of filing or approval or other compliance procedures would not be\nrescinded. Any such failure would subject us to sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory authorities. These regulatory authorities\nmay impose restrictions and penalties on the operations in China, significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to launch any new\noffering of our securities, limit our ability to pay dividends outside of China, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from future\ncapital raising activities into China, or take other actions that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and prospects, as well as the trading price of our ADSs. Furthermore, the PRC government authorities may further\nstrengthen oversight and control over listings and offerings that are conducted overseas. Any such action may adversely affect our\noperations and significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to you and cause the value of\nsuch securities to significantly decline or be worthless. For details, see “— D. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Doing Business in\nChina — Filing procedure with the CSRC shall be fulfilled and the approval of other PRC government authorities may be required in\nconnection with our future offshore offerings under PRC law, and we cannot predict whether or for how long we will be able to obtain\nsuch approval or complete such filing if required.”\nThe Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act\nThe Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCA Act, was enacted on December 18, 2020. The HFCA Act states that\nif the SEC determines that we have filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to\ninspection by the PCAOB for three consecutive years beginning in 2021, the SEC will prohibit our ordinary shares from being traded on\na national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United States.\nOn December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted final amendments to its rules implementing the HFCA Act. Such final rules establish\nprocedures that the SEC will follow in (i) determining whether a registrant is a “Commission-Identified Issuer” (a registrant identified by\nthe SEC as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign\njurisdiction and that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that\njurisdiction) and (ii) prohibiting the trading of an issuer that is a Commission-Identified Issuer for three consecutive years under the\nHFCA Act. The SEC began identifying Commission-Identified Issuers for the fiscal years beginning after December 18, 2020. A\nCommission-Identified Issuer is required to comply with the submission and disclosure requirements in the annual report for each year in\nwhich it was identified. On June 22, 2021, United States Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or\nAccelerating HFCA Act, which was signed into law on December 29, 2022, amending the HFCA Act and requiring the SEC to prohibit\nan issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchange if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two\nconsecutive years instead of three consecutive years.\nAs of the date of this annual report, we have not been, and do not expect to be identified by the SEC under the HFCA Act. However,\nwhether the PCAOB will continue to conduct inspections and investigations completely to its satisfaction of PCAOB-registered public\naccounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong is subject to uncertainty and depends on a number of factors out of\nour, and our auditor’s control including positions taken by authorities of the PRC."

As of the date hereof, Marcum Asia CPAs LLP is not included in the list of PCAOB identified firms in 2021\nDeterminations.\nOn August 26, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it had signed a Statement of Protocol (the “Statement of Protocol”) with the CSRC\nand the Ministry of Finance of China (“MOF”). The terms of the Statement of Protocol would grant the PCAOB complete access to audit\nwork papers and other information so that it may inspect and investigate PCAOB-registered accounting firms headquartered in mainland\nChina and Hong Kong.\nOn December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it was able to conduct inspections and investigations completely of PCAOB-\nregistered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2022. The PCAOB vacated its previous 2021\nDeterminations accordingly. Our auditors, Marcum Asia CPAs LLP, headquartered in New York, New York, are not included in the list of\nPCAOB identified firms in the 2021 Determinations. For this reason, we do not expect to be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer\nunder the HFCAA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 after we file our annual report on Form 20-F for such fiscal year.\nHowever, whether the PCAOB will continue to conduct inspections and investigations completely to its satisfaction of PCAOB-\nregistered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong is subject to uncertainty and depends on a number\nof factors out of our, and our auditor’s, control, including positions taken by authorities of the PRC. The PCAOB is expected to continue\nto demand complete access to inspections and investigations against accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong\nin the future and states that it has already made plans to resume regular inspections in early 2023 and beyond.\nThe PCAOB is required under the HFCAA to make its determination on an annual basis with regards to its ability to inspect and\ninvestigate completely accounting firms based in the mainland China and Hong Kong. Should the PCAOB again encounter impediments\nto inspections and investigations in mainland China or Hong Kong as a result of positions taken by any authority in either jurisdiction,\nthe PCAOB will make determinations under the HFCAA as and when appropriate. If the PCAOB determines in the future that it no\nlonger has full access to inspect and investigate completely accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong and if we use an\naccounting firm headquartered in one of these jurisdictions to issue an audit report on our financial statements filed with the SEC by\nthen, we may be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer following the filing of the annual report on Form 20-F for the relevant\nfiscal year. There can be no assurance that we would not be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer for any future fiscal year, and\nthe possibility of being a Commission-Identified Issuer and risk of delisting could continue to adversely affect the trading price of our\nsecurities. For details, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Doing Business—If the PCAOB, is unable to inspect our auditors as\nrequired under the Holdings Foreign Companies Accountable Act, the SEC will prohibit the trading of our ADSs. A trading prohibition\nmay materially and adversely affect the value of your investment. Additionally, the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of our\nauditors deprives our investors of the benefits of such inspections.”\nSelected Financial Data\nThe following selected consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss data for the years ended December 31, 2020,\n2021 and 2022 and selected consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 have been derived from our audited\nconsolidated financial statements, which are included in this annual report beginning on page F-1.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Dumiao, our lending solutions platform, was launched in June 2015. Our Hongdian and Polaris\nwealth management platforms were launched in September 2015 and June 2016, respectively. We have been operating our financial\nsolutions business separately from Jimu’s peer-to-peer funding business only since June 2015, and we have been operating our company\nsubstantially as a stand-alone company only since September 2016. We operate in China’s consumer finance and wealth management\nindustries, which are rapidly evolving and may not develop as we anticipate. In addition, we commenced new offering of the SME\ntechnical services in 2021, which is also in a new field that is rapidly evolving. Starting from 2022, we have further upgraded our\nbusiness model to provide loan services to MSMEs, as the direct lender, facilitator and enabler. There are few established players and no\nproven business model yet in these new industries. The regulatory framework governing these industries is currently uncertain and\nrapidly evolving and is expected to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Our business partners and financial partners may have\ndifficulty distinguishing our platforms, services and solutions from those of our competitors. As these industries and our business\ndevelop, we may modify our business model or change our platforms, services and solutions. These changes may not achieve the\nexpected results and may have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nYou should consider our business and future prospects in light of the risks and challenges we may encounter in these rapidly\nevolving industries, including, among other things, our ability to:\n·\nexpand the network of our business partners and financial partners;\n·\nprovide diversified and distinguishable services and solutions to financial service providers;\n·\nenhance our data analysis and risk management capabilities;"

The application and\ninterpretation of these laws and regulations is ambiguous and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently between different\ngovernment authorities. In addition, the PRC government is in the process of developing and implementing a regulatory framework to\ngovern the consumer finance market. New regulations may be issued without clear guidance on how to interpret them, or without the\nimplementing procedures necessary to enable us to comply with them. The result is a continually evolving regulatory environment where\ncompliance and business planning is very challenging. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulations\n—Regulations Relating to Loan Interest,” “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulations—Regulations\nRelating to Cooperation with Institutional Funding Partners” and “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—\nRegulations—Regulations Relating to Microfinance Industry” for more information on the regulations that affect or may affect our\nbusiness at this time. We expect more regulations to continue to appear.\nIt is difficult for us to predict how our business might have to evolve under these changing circumstances to remain in compliance.\nAs of the date of this annual report, we have not been subject to any material fines or other penalties under any PRC laws or regulations\non our business operations. However, if the PRC government adopts a more stringent regulatory framework for the consumer finance\nmarket in the future and imposes specific requirements (including capital requirements, reserve requirements and licensing requirements)\non market participants, our business, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. It may be costly for us\nto comply with applicable PRC laws and regulations. If our ability to continue our current practices were to be restricted, our access to\nfunding may be materially constrained. In addition, some of our businesses are subject to licensing requirements. We currently hold\ninternet micro lending license, fund distribution license, insurance brokerage license and enterprise credit investigation license in order to\nconduct the related businesses. Our current licenses have a limited term of validity, and upon expiration of the term, there is no guarantee\nthat we will be able to renew such licenses on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, or at all. New licensing\nrequirements may be imposed on us in the future. If we are unable to obtain any licenses that may also be required in the future or if our\npractice is deemed to violate any existing or future laws and regulations, we may face injunctions, including orders to cease illegal\nactivities, and may be subject to other penalties as determined by the relevant government authorities.\nIn addition, as China’s microfinance industry has grown rapidly since 2008, the applicable laws, regulations and policies governing\nthe industry have evolved in recent years. Any new developments in the laws, regulations and policies governing the microfinance\nindustry, including developments at the national, provincial or local level, could change or replace the laws, regulations and policies that\nare currently applicable to us. There is no assurance that we will be able to strictly comply with any changes or new requirements on a\ntimely basis. While we may be conducting our operations in compliance with existing regulations, new regulations may render our\noperations non-compliant and require us to make significant changes to our business. Any incident involving non-compliance may\nsubject us to administrative sanctions, monetary penalties and restrictions on our business activities or the revocation of our license. If we\ndo not respond to the changes in a timely manner or fail to fully comply with the applicable laws and regulations, our financial condition,\nresults of operations and business prospects could be adversely affected."

However, we may not be able to locate counter-guarantors after a customer defaults and\nthere is also no assurance that these persons will have sufficient financial resources to make full payment on the default customer’s\nbehalf. Upon a customer default, if we are unable to locate the corresponding counter-guarantors or the counter-guarantors have limited\nor no ability to repay, we may have to apply for a court order to attach the assets of the default customer and its counter-guarantor, if any,\nand resort to legal proceedings to enforce our unsecured interests against these assets. In China, the procedures for applying for court\norders to attach assets of another person and liquidating or otherwise realizing the value to attached assets may be protracted or\nultimately unsuccessful, and the enforcement process in China may be difficult for legal and practical reasons.\nWe face credit risks in most funding situations.\nWe connect business partners and financial partners and enable them to provide financial services to users. As of December 31,\n2022, almost all of the loans that we facilitated were funded by our self-owned financial partners (which are our\nsubsidiaries/consolidated affiliated entities). Our goal is to act as a financial solutions provider and to reduce the credit risk we take on\nthe loan products that we facilitate. However, independent financial solution providers that bear minimal credit risks, such as ourselves,\nhave generally experienced unfavorable market conditions in China. To address the market challenges, in 2019, we bore credit risk for a\nhigher proportion of our funding than we did at the time of our initial public offering. Starting from 2020, aligned with our strategic shift\nof business focus towards providing digital-centric services, we have gradually reduced a significant portion of our technical services\nusing a risk-sharing model, leading to relatively lower credit risk (without taking into account the impact of COVID-19). In 2021, we\ncontinued to adjust insurance models, expand the strengths of our brands, deepen our partner channels, vigilantly manage risk profile\nwhile enhancing our asset quality. Specifically, the reduction of risk-sharing loan facilitation business resulted in a decrease of off-\nbalance sheet loans facilitated in 2021. Commencing from April 2022, we did not engage new customers of loan facilitation business and\ncurrently only provide loan facilitation business to our existing customers. Moreover, starting from 2022, we further shifted our business\nfocus from facilitating loan products as a financial solutions provider to directly providing technology enabled financial and digital\nservices to MSME ecosystem, which further reduced the credit risk of loan facilitation. We may adjust our credit risk exposure from time\nto time in the ordinary course of business.\nWe provided credit enhancement through our subsidiaries or variable interest entities to a group of select financial partners. Starting\nfrom 2021, we ceased providing credit enhancement through trust structures. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects\n—A. Operating Results—Funding Sources and Credit Risk” for more details.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had short-term financing receivables, net, of RMB87.1 million (US$12.6 million) on our balance\nsheet. We maintain a provision for credit losses based on delinquency levels and historical charge offs of the underlying on-and off-\nbalance sheet loans, where applicable, using an established systematic process on a pooled basis within each credit risk level of the\nborrowers. For each credit risk level, we estimate the expected loss rate based on the delinquency status of the financial assets to be\nwithin that level: current, 1 to 30 days past due, 31 to 60 days past due, 60 to 90 days past due, or 91 days or greater past due. These loss\nrates in each delinquency status are based on average historical loss rates of financial assets subject to credit losses associated with each\nof the abovementioned delinquency categories. The expected loss rate of the specific delinquency status category within each risk level\nwill be applied to the outstanding balances of the applicable financial assets within that level to determine the provision for credit losses\nfor each reporting period. We had a provision for credit losses related to financing receivables of RMB22.4 million (US$3.2 million) for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022."

However, the Notice on Regulating and Rectifying “Cash Loan” Business, or the\nCircular 141, and the Implementation Plans of Internet Micro Finance Companies both prohibit financial institutions from accepting\ncredit enhancement services provided by institutions with no relevant qualifications. We cannot assure you that the arrangements\nbetween our subsidiaries and our financial partners would be deemed to be in compliance with those requirements. If we were no longer\nallowed to continue with our current business practices in this regard, we would need to make adjustments to ensure compliance with\nrelevant laws and regulations, including securing qualified sources to provide credit enhancement services for the borrowers. However, it\nis uncertain whether our financial partners would accept such adjustments on commercially reasonable terms. We historically have\ncooperated with two independent guarantee companies to provide credit enhancement services to the end users of our financial partners.\nIn our cooperation with these independent guarantee companies, they provide guarantees to the end users of our financial partners, but if\nthey fail to perform their obligations to provide guarantees, we will, instead, provide supplementary guarantees to our financial partners.\nAs of the date of this annual report, we were in cooperation with one of the aforementioned independent guarantee company, and we\nhave fully ceased providing credit enhancement through our variable interest entities for loans that we facilitated with any financial\npartners commencing from November 2022. We currently do not expect to cooperate with additional independent guarantee companies\ndue to our strategic shift of business focus towards providing digital-centric services and optimizing our product matrix and\norganizational structure. Moreover, due to the lack of interpretation and implementation rules and the fact that the applicable laws and\nregulations are rapidly evolving, we cannot assure you that we would not be required to make further changes to our business model in\nthe future. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and\nadversely affected.\nWe may be deemed to operate a financing guarantee business by the PRC regulatory authorities.\nThe State Council of China promulgated the Regulations on the Administration of Financing Guarantee Companies, or the Financing\nGuarantee Rules, effective October 1, 2017. Pursuant to the Financing Guarantee Rules, “financing guarantee” refers to the activities in\nwhich guarantors provide guarantees to the guaranteed parties as to loans, bonds or other types of debt financing, and “financing\nguarantee companies” refer to companies legally established and operating financing guarantee businesses. According to the Financing\nGuarantee Rules, the establishment of financing guarantee companies shall be subject to the approval by the competent government\ndepartment, and unless otherwise stipulated by the state, no entity may operate a financing guarantee business without such approval. If\nany entity violates these regulations and operates a financing guarantee business without approval, the entity may be subject to penalties\nincluding ban or suspension of business, fines of RMB500,000 (US$72,464) to RMB1,000,000 (US$144,928), and confiscation of any\nillegal gains, and if the violation constitutes a criminal offense, criminal liability shall be imposed in accordance with the law.\nIn October 2019, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, or the CBIRC, and eight other PRC regulatory agencies\npromulgated the Supplementary Provisions on the Supervision and Administration of Financing Guarantee Companies, or the Financing\nGuarantee Supplementary Provisions, which became effective in October 2019 and was amended in June 2021. The Financing Guarantee\nSupplementary Provisions further clarify that institutions providing services such as client recommendation and credit assessment to\nvarious institutional funding partners shall not render any financing guarantee service, whether in direct form or disguised form, without\nthe approval of the competent authorities. An institution that operates financing guarantee business without a financing guarantee\nbusiness license shall be cancelled by the supervision and administration department in accordance with the regulations and the\noutstanding transactions of the unlicensed financing guarantee business shall be properly settled. In case any institution intends to\ncontinue its financing guarantee business, financing guarantee companies may be established in accordance with the Financing\nGuarantee Rules."

Due to the lack of further interpretations, the\nexact definition and scope of “operating financing guarantee business” under the Financing Guarantee Rules and what behavior would be\ndeemed as “render any financing guarantee service in disguised form” is unclear. It is uncertain whether we would be deemed to operate\na financing guarantee business because of the credit enhancement services we provide. If such credit enhancement services are deemed to\nbe in violation of the Financing Guarantee Rules or the Financing Guarantee Supplementary Provisions, we could be subject to penalties\nand be required to change our business model in cooperation with our financial partners. As a result, our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe current arrangements with certain of our financial partners and borrowers may have to be modified to comply with existing or\nfuture laws or regulations.\nCircular 141 and the Implementation Plans of Internet Micro Finance Companies both prohibit third parties that cooperate with\nfinancial institutions and internet micro finance companies from directly charging any interest or fees to borrowers. In our cooperation\nwith certain of our financial partners in the past, including micro finance companies and banks, we directly charged interest and fees to\nborrowers for loans funded by those financial partners. In response to Circular 141, we have gradually ceased this practice and as of\nDecember 31, 2021, we did not have any additional loans under which we charge borrowers directly. For purpose of repayments to Jimu\nBox’s online platform lenders, the repayments from borrowers in connection with the remaining loans funded by Jimu Box has been\ncollected through us and repaid to Jimu Box’s online lenders through custody bank account of Jimu Group. As the custody bank account\nof Jimu Group established for online lending platform business has been frozen following its insolvency and exit from online lending\nplatform business in February 2020, in order to facilitate Jimu Box’s platform unwinding plan, we entered into an agreement with Jimu\nGroup, under which we are obligated to transfer principal and interest collected from the borrowers to the party designed by Jimu Group\nfor purpose of Jimu Box’s online borrowers repayment to lenders. Circular 141 and the Implementation Plans of Internet Micro Finance\nCompanies are subject to further interpretation, and detailed implementation rules may be promulgated in the future. We cannot assure\nyou that our current fee arrangements would be deemed to be in compliance with existing or new interpretations or rules. In the event\nthat we are required to modify the current fee arrangements with our financial partners again, our financial partners may be unwilling to\ncooperate with us to make those adjustments on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our\nbusiness may be materially and adversely affected.\nLimitations on interest and fees that may be charged to borrowers may adversely affect our ability to collect fees.\nIn accordance with the Provisions on Several Issues Concerning Laws Applicable to Trials of Private Lending Cases issued by the\nSupreme People’s Court in 2015, or the Private Lending Judicial Interpretations (2015 version), agreements between a lender and a\nborrower for loans with annual interest rates below 24% are valid and enforceable. For loans with annual interest rates between 24% and\n36%, the courts will likely refuse a borrower’s request for the return of the interest payment if the interest on the loans has already been\npaid to the lender, provided such payment has not damaged the interest of the state, the community or any third parties. If the annual\ninterest rate of a private loan is higher than 36%, the obligation to make interests payment in excess of 36% is void and the court will\nuphold the borrower’s claim for the return of the excess portion to the borrower. The Certain Opinions Regarding Further Strengthening\nthe Financial Judgment Work, issued by the Supreme People’s Court in August 2017, provide more detailed rules regarding the legal\nlimits on interest and fees charged in connection with a loan and specify that intermediary service fees charged by an online lending\nintermediary to circumvent the statutory limit on interest rates for private lending will be held invalid. Circular 141 further clarifies that\nnot just the interest but the total amount of interest and fees charged to borrowers must be within the limit set forth in the Private Lending\nJudicial Interpretations (2015 version).\nIn the past, the annual interest and fees charged to our customers in connection with the loans we facilitated may exceed 24%\nper year. Therefore, our customers may be entitled to refuse to repay the interest or fees in excess of 24% and the judicial authorities\nwould be unlikely to uphold any claim for remedies that we might make, or they may make a claim for any excess that they paid over\n36% per year and the judicial authorities may grant their claim. Since March 1, 2018, the annual interest and fees charged to our\ncustomers in connection with the loans we facilitate have been no more than 36% and, since September 1, 2019, such annual interest and\nfees have been no more than 24%."

Under such Private Lending Judicial Interpretations (2020 version), the total annual percentage rates\n(inclusive of any default rate and default penalty and any other fee) exceeding four times that of China’s benchmark one-year loan prime\nrate, or the LPR, as published on the 20th of each month will not be legally protected. For example, based on the LPR of 3.85% as\npublished on August 20, 2020, such cap would be 15.4%. The Private Lending Judicial Interpretations (2020 version) shall also apply to\nthe first-instance cases involving private lending disputes accepted by the people’s courts after the implementation of such revised\njudicial interpretation.\nIn December 2020, the Supreme People’s Court issued the Official Reply to Issues on the Application of the Interpretations of the\nSupreme People’s Court of New Private Lending, or the Official Reply on the Application of Interpretations of New Private Lending.\nThe Official Reply on the Application of Interpretations of New Private Lending confirms that any disputes arising from the relevant\nfinancial business conducted by the microcredit companies, financing guarantee companies, regional equity market, pawn enterprises,\nfinancial leasing companies, business factoring companies and local assets management companies that are supervised by the local\nfinancial supervision governmental authorities, shall not be subject to the Interpretations of the Supreme People’s Court of New Private\nLending.\nIn March 2021, the People’s Bank of China, or the PBOC, issued Announcement No.3 to further clarify the method of calculating\nthe “total annual interest rate.” According to Announcement No.3, the annualized rate of a loan shall be calculated as the annualized ratio\nof total costs (to the borrower) to the outstanding principal amount. The costs include interest and other fees and charges directly related\nto the loan. The amount of principal should be specified in the loan contract or other loan certificates. If the loan is repaid in installments,\nthe outstanding principal amount should be the balance after each repayment. The calculation of the annualized interest rate may be\nbased on compound interest or simple interest. The calculation based on compound interest is equivalent to that of the internal rate of\nreturn, and the simple-interest approach should be specified as such.\nWhile the Private Lending Judicial Interpretations (2020 version) stipulates that it does not apply to licensed financial institutions,\nthe PRC court’s prior rulings were inconsistent as to whether loans provided by certain financial institutions such as consumer financing\ncompanies would be subject to such interest cap. In addition, as the relevant laws and regulations are rapidly evolving, it is uncertain\nwhether any new PRC laws, regulations or rules will be adopted so that the interest and/or fees charged by our institutional funding\npartners, including but not limited to microcredit companies, will be subject to any cap provided by any newly adopted laws or\nregulations.\nFurthermore, if the cap of aggregated borrowing costs charged by licensed financial institutions is further lowered by any newly\nadopted, or by the application of any existing, laws, regulations or ruling, then the fees we charged to our institutional funding partners\nmay, subject to further negotiation with our institutional funding partners, need to be lowered to reflect the adjustment of the aggregated\nborrowing costs. Should any of the foregoing occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\nRegulatory uncertainties relating to campus online lending may materially and adversely affect our business and results of\noperations.\nThe laws, regulations, rules and governmental policies governing campus online lending are expected to continue to evolve.

To minimize our risk,\nwith respect to our point-of-sale installment loans and personal installment loans, we have set the age threshold of our end users at 22.\nWe have also implemented a number of measures for different loan facilitation scenarios, including the following: (i) our business\npartners will present to borrowers a commitment letter stating that the borrower is not a student and seek their confirmation before\nextending any point-of-sale installment loans; (ii) any loan request labeled with “student consumption” by our business partners in the\npoint-of-sale installment loans will be rejected; (iii) any loan request generated by lenders identified as students by our financial partners\nor business partners through the China Credentials Verification system will be rejected; (iv) all the lenders who are between the age of 20\nand 22 will be required to confirm whether they are students or not, and any loan request generated by those who have selected the\noption of “students” will be rejected; and (v) all of our credit lending services will not serve lenders below 22 years of age, who will be\nlabeled as students or individuals with low repayment capabilities.

If any of the foregoing takes place, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected,\npotentially for a prolonged period of time. For example, a considerable number of troubled online lending platforms in China defaulted\nor collapsed or otherwise were shut down beginning in June 2018. Although these online lending platforms were not related to us, their\nfailures adversely affected investors’ confidence in the consumer finance industry, resulting in a reduction in the availability of funding\nfrom individual investors. Consequently, our results of operations and profitability have been adversely affected by market conditions\nsince July 2018. We had ceased facilitating loans through such technology enablement platforms in February 2020, and accordingly were\nexposed to less risks in this regard. Regulators in the PRC have required online lending platforms to reduce their overall loan volume,\noutstanding balance, and number of retail investors and borrowers. The consumer finance industry has been faced with difficulty with\nliquidity and growth. Many industry players have announced their exit or default, and many have begun to transition to other business\nmodels as the trial registration for online lending platform did not progress. Negative developments such as widespread borrower\ndefaults, fraudulent behavior and the closure of other platforms may also lead to heightened regulatory scrutiny and limit the scope of\npermissible business activities that may be conducted, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe trading price of our ADSs is likely to be volatile due to publicity regarding the consumer finance industry and the evolving\nregulatory environment governing this industry in China.\nThe trading price of our ADSs is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely due to publicity regarding the consumer finance\nindustry and the evolving regulatory environment governing this industry in China. While we are not regulated as a financial service\nprovider, we may be affected by PRC financial regulations as a result of the financial products on our platforms and our relationships\nwith our financial partners. In addition, we may be associated with any negative publicity regarding those industries in which our\nfinancial and business partners operate. The tremendous growth of the consumer finance industry has recently led to the offering of\ncommercially unreasonable products in the marketplace from certain market players with questionable business ethics and practices. The\npeer-to-peer lending industry in China has experienced a number of defaults and bankruptcies since the summer of 2018, and a number\nof investors have lost significant sums of money as a result. The negative publicity has affected investor confidence and caused a sharp\ndrop in loan volumes on peer-to-peer lending platforms across the industry. In November 2019, the Internet Finance Rectification Office\nand the Online Lending Rectification Office jointly issued the Guidelines on Transformation from Online Lending Information\nIntermediaries to Microcredit Company, pursuant to which online lending information intermediaries that conform to certain\nrequirements may apply to transform to microcredit companies. The relevant transformation period shall not exceed one or two years in\nprinciple, depending on the outstanding business volume of and the terms of loans facilitated by such online lending information\nintermediaries. As a result of the foregoing, a number of Chinese companies operating in the consumer finance industry who have listed\ntheir securities in the United States experienced significant volatility and sudden price declines. In November 2020, the CBIRC and\nPBOC released the Interim Measures for the Administration of Network Microcredit Companies Business (Draft) to solicit public\ncomments, seeking to tighten the online consumer finance industry. See “—Limitations on micro finance companies and online lending\ninformation intermediaries may adversely affect our access to funding.”\nThese laws and regulations have imposed stringent requirements on the operation of peer-to-peer online lending platforms. Although\nhow these requirements will be interpreted and implemented is still unclear, it is likely that more stringent laws and regulations will be\nissued and adopted to further regulate related businesses. As a result of the stringent and evolving regulatory environment, consumer\nfinance industry in China is facing great challenges and shrinking in size. The regulatory environment of the consumer finance industry\nmay continue to evolve in response to factors beyond our control. Any rumors of or perceived changes to the regulations, even if proven\nto be untrue or completely unrelated or inapplicable to our business, may cause wide fluctuations in the trading price of our ADSs, and in\ncertain cases significant declines, which could result in substantial losses to investors. See also “—Risks Relating to Our ADSs—The\ntrading price of our ADSs has declined significantly since listing, and our ADSs could be delisted from Nasdaq or trading could be\nsuspended, which could result in substantial losses to investors.”"

Our business partners and financial partners may decide not to cooperate with us,\nor users may choose not to use our platform, and our reputation and market share would be materially and adversely affected, which\nwould adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses and social activities in China and other countries and regions have\nbeen adversely affected. To contain the COVID-19 outbreak, the PRC government imposed strict measures across the country including,\nbut not limited to, travel restrictions, mandatory quarantine requirements, temporary closure of business premises, and postponed\nresumption of business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had adversely impacted our operations and our business partners, particularly our business partners in the\nonline travel agency and telecom industries. We also experienced temporary shut-down and closure of unprofitable spaces as a result of\nthe regional resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China, particularly during the fourth quarter of 2022. As a result of the pandemic and a\nseries of challenges we encountered, including changes in market conditions, market regulations, external partners and management\nmembers, we continued to vigilantly manage risk profile while enhancing our asset quality, and accordingly our loan volume in 2022\ndecreased by 75% compared with 2021. We have taken measures in response to the outbreak to protect our employees, including\ntemporarily closing our offices, facilitating remote working arrangements for our employees and cancelling business meetings and travel.\nFurthermore, in part in response to the challenges, we are now shifting our business focus by increasing the digital-centric services and\nsubstantially reducing our risk-sharing services. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—A. Operating Results—\nKey Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Impact of COVID-19.”\nSince December 2022, many of the restrictive measures previously adopted by the PRC government at various levels to control the\nspread of the COVID-19 virus have been revoked or replaced with more flexible measures. As a result, there has recently been and may\ncontinue to be an increase in COVID-19 cases in China, which may lead to temporary interruptions to business operations. There remain\nsignificant uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, including with respect to the ultimate spread of the virus, the severity and\nduration of the pandemic and the further actions government authorities may take in response. While it is unknown how long these\nconditions will last and what the complete financial effect will be on us, we are closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19. Our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected to the extent that COVID-19\nharms the Chinese and global economy in general."

The range, pricing and terms of financial\nproducts available in the market partly result from competition among our financial partners and other financial service providers. In a\nrising interest rate environment, end users may seek funding through other means. In a declining interest rate environment, end users may\nchoose to refinance their loans with lower-priced financial products, which may not be available through our partners. There can be no\nassurance that our financial partners can respond to fluctuations in interest rates in a timely manner.\nIn addition, changes in the competitive landscape of the China’s consumer finance and wealth management industries, as well as\nSME technical services industry, may affect our business. For example, our business partners and financial partners may accumulate\nmore experience and develop more expertise in using our financial solutions, thus they may develop their own capabilities and forgo\nusing the services provided by independent technology platforms such as ours.\nA credit crisis or prolonged downturn in the credit markets could severely impact our operating environment. A credit crisis or\nprolonged downturn in the credit markets might cause tightening in credit guidelines, limited liquidity, deterioration in credit\nperformance and increased foreclosure activities. A decrease in transaction volumes could cause a material decline in our revenues for\nthe duration of the crisis, even if we do not bear credit risk in the event of borrower default. Moreover, a financial and credit crisis may\nbe coupled with or trigger a downturn in the macroeconomic environment, which could cause a general decrease in lending activity over\na longer period of time. If a credit crisis were to occur, particularly in China’s credit markets, our business, financial performance and\nprospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nWe experience some seasonality in our business, primarily reflecting seasonality in our business partners’ businesses. Our\nseasonality is associated with seasonal demands for consumer loans and travel and for consumption in general, as users use point-of-sale\ninstallment loans to finance installment purchases from our business partners. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business\nOverview—Seasonality.” Our quarterly results of operations, including the levels of our revenues, expenses, net loss or income and other\nkey metrics, may vary significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control, and period-to-\nperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, especially given our limited operating history. Accordingly, the\nresults for any one quarter are not necessarily an indication of future performance.\nIf we do not compete effectively, our results of operations could be harmed.\nWe may fail to compete for business partners and financial partners against any of our current or future competitors. Furthermore,\nthe COVID-19 pandemic has affected and may continue to affect our ability to compete effectively. Consumer finance, wealth\nmanagement and insurance are emerging industries in China. We enable our business and financial partners to provide innovative\nconsumer finance, wealth management and insurance services to the users. With respect to consumer finance enablement, OneConnect\nshares a similar business model where it provides technology enablement services to business partners and financial partners, and we\ncompete with respect to acquiring partners and customers. Other independent platforms also provide such enablement services to\npartners as one segment of their business. With respect to wealth management and robo-advisory enablement, we compete with\ncompanies such as Yingmi.cn. We also compete across consumer finance, wealth management and insurance with platforms affiliated\nwith major internet companies and business ecosystems in China, such as Lexin, 360 DigiTech and Quant Group. In addition, our\nbusiness and financial partners may develop their own in-house capabilities that compete with the services we currently provide. Some of\nour larger competitors have substantially broader product or service offerings and greater financial resources to support their spending on\nsales and marketing. Current or potential competitors may have substantially greater brand recognition and may have more financial,\nresearch, marketing and distribution resources than we do. Our competitors may introduce platforms with more effective features, or\nservices or solutions with competitive pricing or better performance. In addition, some of our competitors may have more resources to\ndevelop or acquire new technologies and react quicker to the changing demands of business partners and financial partners."

The Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for Internet\nPlatforms mainly cover five aspects, including general provisions, monopoly agreements, abusing market dominance, concentration of\nundertakings, and abusing administrative powers to eliminate or restrict competition. The Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for Internet\nPlatforms prohibit certain monopolistic acts of internet platforms to preserve market competition and safeguard interests of users and\nundertakings participating in the internet platform economy, including without limitation, prohibiting platforms with dominant position\nfrom abusing their market dominance, such as discriminating customers in terms of pricing and other transactional conditions using big\ndata and analytics, coercing counterparties into exclusivity arrangements, using technology means to block competitors’ interface,\nfavorable positioning in search results of goods displayed, using bundle services to sell services or products, and compulsory collection\nof unnecessary user data. As the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for Internet Platforms were newly promulgated, it is uncertain to estimate its\nspecific impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We cannot assure you that our business\noperations comply with such regulations and authorities’ requirements in all respects. If any non-compliance is raised by relevant\nauthorities and determined against us, we may be subject to fines and other penalties and need to adjust some of our business practice,\nwhich could be costly. Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law amended in June 2022, promulgated by the Standing Committee of the\nNational People’s Congress of the PRC, requires that transactions which are deemed concentrations and involve parties with specified\nturnover thresholds must be cleared by the Ministry of Commerce before they can be completed. Due to the enhanced implementation of\nthe Anti-Monopoly Law, we may be under heightened regulatory scrutiny, which will increase our compliance costs and subject us to\nheightened risks and challenges.\nOur business model is unproven.\nWe work with business partners and financial partners on our platforms and enable them to provide financial services to end users\nefficiently and effectively. This is a relatively new and unproven business model in the financial services industry, and it has evolved, and\nmay continue to evolve, over time. Our business model differs significantly from that of traditional financial service providers and other\ninternet online lending solutions providers in several ways, including our focus on business to business services. The success of our\nbusiness model depends on its scalability and on our ability to acquire more business partners and financial partners and achieve higher\ntransaction volumes on our platforms. If we are unable to efficiently acquire partners, address the business needs of our partners or offer\na superior user experience to end users, our results of operation would likely suffer."

The Internet Finance Guidelines purport, among other things, to require internet finance service providers to\ncomply with certain anti-money laundering requirements, including the establishment of a customer identification program, the\nmonitoring and reporting of suspicious transactions, the preservation of customer information and transaction records, and the provision\nof assistance to the public security department and judicial authority in investigations and proceedings in relation to anti-money\nlaundering matters. The Administrative Measures for Internet Finance Service Providers Regarding Anti-Money Laundering and Counter\nTerrorism Financing (Trial Version), or the Administrative Measures Regarding AML and CTF, require internet finance service providers\nto comply with certain anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing requirements, including establishing an internal control\nsystem for anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing, establishing a customer identification program, monitoring terrorist\norganizations and terrorists, monitoring and reporting suspicious transactions and preserving customer information and transaction\nrecords. The Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Publicly-offered Securities Investment Fund Distributors, originally\npromulgated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, in August 2020, require independent fund sales institutions\nto comply with certain anti-money laundering requirements, including providing fund managers with necessary information for anti-\nmoney laundering, such as clients’ statutory basic identity information, as well as assistance in performing such relevant duties as anti-\nmoney laundering, counter-terrorism financing and due diligence on tax-related information in terms of non-resident financial accounts.\nThe Notice on Anti-Money Laundering Operations of the Insurance Industry requires insurance brokerage agencies to establishing anti-\nmoney laundering internal control systems and provide assistance to public security departments and judicial authorities in\ninvestigations. There is no assurance that our anti-money laundering policies and procedures will protect us from being exploited for\nmoney laundering purposes or that we will be deemed to be in compliance with applicable anti-money laundering implementing rules, if\nand when adopted, given that our anti-money laundering obligations in the Internet Finance Guidelines, the Administrative Measures\nRegarding AML and CIF, the Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Publicly-offered Securities Investment Fund\nDistributors and the Notice on Anti-Money Laundering Operations of the Insurance Industry are not specified. Measures for the\nImplementation of Anti-Money Laundering in the Securities and Futures Sector (Amended in 2022) requires Securities and futures\noperators shall fulfill their anti-money laundering obligations establish sound anti-money laundering internal control systems,\ninformation reporting systems, client risk rating systems and work confidentiality systems, training and publicity systems. Any new\nrequirement under money laundering laws could increase our costs, and may expose us to potential sanctions if we fail to comply.\nFurthermore, our financial partners are required to have their own appropriate anti-money laundering policies and procedures as\nstipulated in the applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and our other funding sources may also be required to comply\nwith the applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations. If we or any of our financial partners or other funding sources fail to\ncomply with applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations, our reputation could suffer and we could become subject to\nregulatory intervention, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any\nnegative perception of technology enablement platforms for the financial service industry, such as those that arise from any failure of\nother internet finance service providers to detect or prevent money laundering activities, could compromise our image or undermine the\ntrust and credibility we have established. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of\noperations might be materially and adversely affected.\nFailure to protect confidential information of our end users and our network against security breaches could damage our reputation\nand brands and substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of end users’ personal data. The highly automated nature\nof our platforms may make them attractive targets and potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, physical or electronic\nbreak-ins or similar disruptions. While we have taken steps to protect confidential information that we have access to, our security\nmeasures could be breached. Any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to our platforms could cause\nconfidential information to be stolen and used for criminal purposes. Security breaches or unauthorized access to confidential\ninformation could also expose us to liability related to the loss of the information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and negative\npublicity. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in\nour software are exposed and exploited, our relationships with our business partners and financial partners could be severely damaged,\nand we could incur significant liability. Because techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently\nand generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to\nimplement adequate preventative measures."

See “Item 4. Information on the\nCompany—B. Business Overview—Regulations—Regulations Relating to Value-added Telecommunication Service.” Failure to comply\nwith the regulations relating to value-added telecommunications services may result in fines and other administrative sanctions. As\nsuggested by Beijing Administration of Telecommunication, which is the competent regulatory authority of Beijing Hongdian, Beijing\nHongdian does not need value-added telecommunications service licenses for its operation. However, the regulatory authorities may have\nwide discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations regarding value-added telecommunications businesses\nand it is possible that the regulatory authorities may adjust their former interpretation and make new requirements so that Beijing\nHongdian may have to obtain value-added telecommunications service license for its operations in the future. As of the date of this\nannual report, Beijing Hongdian has not obtained a license for its operations on its websites or mobile applications. There is a lack of\nfurther interpretations or explicit and detailed laws and regulations regarding the value-added telecommunications service license for a\nmobile applications provider. However, to the extent that the PRC regulatory authorities require value-added telecommunication service\nlicenses to be obtained for the operation of our mobile applications, we may be subject to the sanctions described above if we do not\nobtain such licenses, and our business, financial condition and results of operations maybe materially and adversely affected.\nLimitations on micro finance companies and online lending information intermediaries may adversely affect our access to funding.\nCircular 141 requires online micro finance companies to suspend the funding of micro-loans that are unrelated to the circumstances\nof their use and to gradually reduce the volume of their existing business relating to such loans and to complete rectifications within a\ngiven period of time. Circular 141 also prohibits online lending information intermediaries from facilitating loans with no designated use\nof loan proceeds. Although we now require the end users of our personal and business installment loans to specify the intended use of the\nloan proceeds, and the intended use is stipulated in the loan agreement between the borrower and the lender, it is unclear whether\npersonal and business installment loans that we have facilitated through our solutions would be deemed to be loans with no designated\nuse of loan proceeds and thus subject to the foregoing requirement of Circular 141. If such personal and business installment loans were\ndeemed to be loans with no designated use of loan proceeds, we would need to take measures to track the actual use of loans, and our\nfinancial partners would also need to take measures to track the actual use of loans and may require us to cooperate with them and\nupgrade our system, both of which could cause us to incur substantial additional expenses. If we were unable to effectively implement\nthe foregoing or other rectification measures, we might need to reduce or even cease the funding and facilitation of such personal and\nbusiness installment loans. If that were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and\nadversely affected.\nIn addition, we historically engaged in internet-based microcredit business through our subsidiary Ganzhou Aixin Network Micro\nFinance Co., Ltd. (formerly known as Ganzhou Jimu Micro Finance Co., Ltd.), or Ganzhou Aixin Micro Finance, which holds an internet\nmicro lending license to operate small loan business. However, the regulatory regime and practice with respect to network microcredit\ncompanies are evolving in recent years and subject to uncertainties. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—\nRegulations—Regulations Relating to Microfinance Industry.” Therefore, we cannot assure you that we would not be subject to any\nrectification requirements or administrative penalties due to any non-compliance, nor can we assure you that we will be able to satisfy\nrectification requirements, if any, and maintain or renew the license. If we are unable to maintain or renew the microcredit license or\nobtain any other requisite approvals, licenses or permits, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and\nadversely affected. For example, in November 2020, the CBIRC and PBOC released the Interim Measures for the Administration of\nNetwork Microfinance Companies Business (Draft) to solicit public comments. The draft measures make it clear that a network\nmicrofinance business shall be carried out mainly in the provincial administrative areas to which the entity is registered and shall not be\ncross-provincial without prior approval. The registered capital of a company operating a network microfinance business within a\nprovince shall not be less than RMB1 billion and shall be a one-time paid-in monetary capital. The registered capital of a company\noperating a network microfinance cross-provinces shall not be less than RMB5 billion and shall be a one-time paid-in monetary capital.\nThe draft measures would establish a three-year transition period, and those operating cross-provincial network microfinance businesses\nwithout approval will be phased-out. We cannot assure you that Ganzhou Aixin Micro Finance Co., will be able to maintain or renew its\nmicrofinance license if the draft measures are implemented."

As of December 31, 2019, we had\nRMB748.4 million in current amounts due from Jimu Group and RMB117.6 million in non-current amounts. Since Jimu Group became\ninsolvent and announced its exit from the online lending platform business in February 2020, we determined that it was probable that the\namounts due from Jimu Group were not collectible or recoverable. As of December 31, 2019, we made a provision of RMB856.0 million\nfor the amount due from Jimu Group. We made an additional provision of RMB7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a\nreversal of RMB6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and an addition of RMB1.6 million (US$0.2 million) for the year\nended December 31, 2022. See “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Transactions and Agreements with Jimu\nGroup—Cash Advances and Loan Agreements” for more details. The loss of this capital may further impair our ability to invest in\nfacilities, hardware, software and technological systems, retain talent, or expand our business. Our total current assets decreased from\nRMB526.9 million as of December 31, 2021 to RMB389.2 million (US$56.4 million) as of December 31, 2022. And we had net current\nliabilities of RMB136.8 million (US$19.8 million), including convertible loan of RMB113 million (US$16.4 million) as of December 31,\n2022. Our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and it is uncertain if we will be able to reduce or\neliminate our net losses for the foreseeable future. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going\nconcern. To alleviate the pressure of capital liquidity, we have obtained approval of certain lines of credit from third parties and is\nnegotiating with the investor to convert the convertible loan into shares. Moreover, from January 1, 2022 onwards, we have taken\nmeasures to improve operating efficiency and implement cost reduction. Actions primarily include downsizing staff to cope with the\ndecrease in business volume and revenue, standardizing our finance and operation policies, enhancing internal controls and creating a\nsynergy of our resources. However, there can be no assurance that these plans and arrangements will be sufficient to fund our ongoing\ncapital expenditures, working capital, and other requirements.\nDue to the unpredictable nature of the capital markets and the industries in which we operate, there can be no assurance that we will\nbe able to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us, or at all, if and when required, especially if we experience unfavorable\noperating results. If adequate capital is not available to us as required, our ability to fund our operations, expand our business, take\nadvantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our infrastructure or respond to competitive pressures could be\nsignificantly limited, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we do raise additional\nfunds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our shareholders could be significantly\ndiluted. These newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders.\nOur financial information included in this annual report may not be representative of our financial condition and results of\noperations if we had been operating as a stand-alone company.\nWe entered into various transaction agreements in connection with our pre-IPO reorganization in December 2017 and completed the\nreorganization in March 2018. We made numerous estimates, assumptions and allocations in our historical financial statements because\nwe did not operate as a stand-alone company from an accounting perspective prior to the completion of the reorganization. In particular,\nour consolidated balance sheets include those assets and liabilities that are specifically identifiable to our business, and our consolidated\nstatements of operations include all costs and expenses related to us, including costs and expenses allocated from Jimu Group to us.\nAlthough we believe that the assumptions underlying our historical financial statements and the above allocations are reasonable, our\nhistorical financial statements may not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows as if we had\noperated as a stand-alone company during those periods. Therefore, you should not view our historical results as indicators of our future\nperformance. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” and the notes to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in this annual report for our historical cost allocation.\nJimu Group’s insolvency may materially and adversely affect the strength of our brands.\nHistorically, we have benefited significantly from the fact that we and Jimu Group operated as a single entity to develop our\nbusinesses and achieve market recognition. Our business, including Dumiao, Polaris and Hongdian, was previously operated under the\nJimu umbrella brand. Our services historically have been associated with Jimu Group, and they may continue to be commonly associated\nwith Jimu Group. We used to benefit from Jimu Group’s strong brand recognition in China, which provided us credibility and a broad\nmarketing reach. Jimu Group’s insolvency and exit from the online lending platform business in February 2020 will likely have an\nadverse impact on the effectiveness of our marketing as well as our reputation and brands."

Negative publicity about China’s consumer finance industry in general may also\nhave a negative impact on our reputation, regardless of whether we have engaged in any inappropriate activities. The PRC government is\nin the process of developing and implementing a regulatory framework to govern the consumer finance market.

Furthermore, any negative development or perception of the consumer finance industry as a whole,\neven if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents or as result of conduct by other market players, could compromise our image,\nundermine our credibility and negatively impact our ability to attract new business and financial partners. Negative developments in the\nconsumer finance industry, such as widespread customer defaults, fraudulent behavior, the closure of other online consumer finance\nplatforms, or incidents indirectly resulting from any particular customer’s accumulation of large amounts of debt or inability to repay\ndebt, may also lead to tightened regulatory scrutiny of the sector and limit the scope of permissible business activities that may be\nconducted by online consumer finance platforms. For instance, there have been a number of reports since 2015 of business failures,\naccusations of fraud and unfair dealing regarding certain companies in the consumer finance industry in China.

This depends largely on the effectiveness of our customer acquisition strategy, our marketing\nefforts, our cooperation with our business partners and the success of the channels we use to promote our platforms. If any of our current\nuser acquisition strategies or marketing channels become less effective, more costly or no longer feasible, we may not be able to attract\nnew partners and users in a cost-effective manner or convert potential partners and users into using our financial services and solutions.\nOur efforts to build our brands have caused us to incur expenses, and it is likely that our future marketing efforts will require us to\nincur additional expenses.

As a result, it may be difficult to determine what actions or omissions may be deemed to be in violations of\napplicable laws and regulations in certain circumstances.\nNetwork operators in China are subject to numerous laws and regulations, and have the obligations to, among others, (i) establish\ninternal security management systems that meet the requirements of the classified protection system for cybersecurity, (ii) implement\ntechnical measures to monitor and record network operation status and cybersecurity incidents, (iii) implement data security measures\nsuch as data classification, backups and encryption, and (iv) submit for cybersecurity review under certain circumstances.\nOn November 7, 2016, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress issued the Cyber Security Law, which imposes\nmore stringent requirements on operators of “critical information infrastructure,” especially in data storage and cross-border data transfer.\nOn November 14, 2021, the CAC published a discussion draft of the Administrative Measures for Internet Data Security, or the Draft\nMeasures for Internet Data Security, which provides that data processors conducting the following activities shall apply for cybersecurity\nreview: (i) merger, reorganization or division of Internet platform operators that have acquired a large number of data resources related to\nnational security, economic development or public interests affects or may affect national security; (ii) listing abroad of data processors\nprocessing over one million users’ personal information; (iii) listing in Hong Kong which affects or may affect national security; or\n(iv) other data processing activities that affect or may affect national security. There have been no clarifications from the authorities as of\nthe date of this annual report as to the standards for determining such activities that “affects or may affect national security.” The CAC\nhas solicited comments on this draft until December 13, 2021, but there is no timetable as to when it will be enacted. As such, substantial\nuncertainties exist with respect to the enactment timetable, final content, interpretation and implementation. The Draft Measures for\nInternet Data Security, if enacted as proposed, may materially impact our capital raising activities. Any failure to obtain such approval or\nclearance from the regulatory authorities could materially constrain our liquidity and have a material adverse impact on our business\noperations and financial results, especially if we need additional capital or financing.\nOn December 28, 2021, the CAC, jointly with other 12 governmental authorities, published the Measures for Cybersecurity Review,\nwhich became effective on February 15, 2022.

Certain internet platforms in China have been reportedly subject to\nheightened regulatory scrutiny in relation to cybersecurity matters. As of the date of this annual report, we have not been informed by\nany PRC governmental authority of any requirement that we file for a cybersecurity review. However, if we are deemed to be a critical\ninformation infrastructure operator or a company that is engaged in data processing and holds personal information of more than one\nmillion users, we could be subject to PRC cybersecurity review.\nThe interpretation, application and enforcement of Measures for Cybersecurity Review are also subject to substantial uncertainties.\nIf we are found to be in violation of cybersecurity requirements in China, the relevant governmental authorities may, at their discretion,\nconduct investigations, levy fines, request app stores to take down our apps and cease to provide viewing and downloading services\nrelated to our apps, prohibit the registration of new users on our platform, or require us to change our business practices in a manner\nmaterially adverse to our business. Any of these actions may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe interpretation and application of these cybersecurity laws, regulations and standards are still uncertain and evolving, especially\nthe Draft Measures for Internet Data Security.

We could be materially and adversely affected if transactions were\nredirected, misappropriated or otherwise improperly executed, if personal information were disclosed to unintended recipients or if an\noperational breakdown or failure were to occur in the processing of transactions, whether as a result of human error, purposeful sabotage\nor fraudulent manipulation of our operations or systems. In addition, the manner in which we store and use certain personal information\nand interact with partners and users through our platforms is governed by various PRC laws. It is not always possible to identify and\ndeter misconduct or errors by employees, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in\ncontrolling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses. If any of our employees take, convert or misuse funds, documents or data or fail to\nfollow protocols when interacting with partners and users, we could be liable for damages and subject to regulatory actions and penalties.\nWe could also be perceived to have facilitated or participated in the illegal misappropriation of funds, documents or data, or the failure to\nfollow protocols, and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability."

As an open platform, we\nhave access to data from users, business partners, financial partners and third-party data partners. We synthesize multiple sources of data\nwith our data analytics capability, which drives our credit assessment engine. We cannot ensure the accuracy and timeliness of the\nvarious sources of data that we use.\nWhile we strive to predict the likelihood of default of a user through our credit assessment models, we may not accurately predict a\nuser’s actual creditworthiness because we may receive outdated, incomplete or inaccurate data. While we verify information obtained\nfrom third parties through data source credential evaluation and online and offline test evaluations in an effort to ensure reliability and\nefficacy, such measures may not turn out to be effective in eliminating low quality and inaccurate data. Low quality or inaccurate data\ncould materially affect the accuracy and validity of our assessment capability, services and solutions, which could adversely affect our\nreputation and financial performance.\nIn addition, there is a risk that, following the date we obtain and review the information, a user’s personal circumstances may have\nchanged. The user may have become delinquent in the payment of an outstanding obligation, defaulted on a pre-existing debt obligation,\ntaken on additional debt or otherwise had their ability to repay the loan reduced. We cannot ensure that the data that we use is always up\nto date, and this may cause us to inaccurately price loans and lead to a higher loss rate.\nWe have obligations to verify information relating to users and detecting fraud. If we fail to perform such obligations to meet the\nrequirements of relevant laws and regulations, we may be subject to liabilities.\nOur business of facilitating the offer of financial products by our partners to users constitutes an intermediary service, and our\ncontracts with partners and users are intermediation contracts under the Civil Code of PRC. Under the Civil Code of PRC, an\nintermediary that intentionally conceals any material information or provides false information in connection with the conclusion of the\nproposed contract and so harms the client’s interests may not claim any service fee for its intermediary services and is liable for any\ndamage incurred by the users. Therefore, if we fail to verify the truthfulness of the information provided by or in relation to our users and\nto actively detect fraud, we could be subject to liability as an intermediary under the Civil Code of PRC, and our results of operations and\nfinancial condition could be materially and adversely affected."

Our collection activities are highly automated, conducted through\ndigital means such as payment reminder notifications in our app, reminder text messages, voice messages and e-mails and supplemented\nby direct phone calls.

If our third-party service providers’ collection methods are not effective and we\nfail to respond quickly and improve our collection methods, our delinquent loan collection rate may decrease and our financial partners\nmay suffer loss, which may affect our business and reputation. Our service fees also depend on the collectability of the loans that we\nfacilitate. If we experience an unexpected significant increase in the number of users who fail to repay their loans or an increase in the\nprincipal amount of the loans that are not repaid, we will be unable to collect our entire service fee for such loans and our revenue could\nbe materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be held responsible for illegal or unethical practices by third parties that we use to collect delinquent loans.\nWe refer delinquent accounts that are overdue to third party collection service providers, including one service provider in which we\nown an 18.7% equity interest.

In the\ncourse of management’s preparation and our independent registered public accounting firm’s auditing our consolidated financial\nstatements for the year ended December 31, 2022, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified one material\nweakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, in accordance with the standards established by the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board of the United States, or the PCAOB. As defined in the standards established by the\nPCAOB, a “material weakness” is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that\nthere is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or\ndetected on a timely basis. The material weakness that has been identified relates to our lack of sufficient financial reporting and\naccounting personnel with appropriate knowledge of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements to properly address complex U.S.\nGAAP technical accounting issues and to prepare and review financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP\nand reporting requirements set forth by the SEC. This material weakness, if not timely remedied, may lead to significant misstatements in\nour consolidated financial statements in the future.\nFollowing the identification of the material weakness, we have taken measures and plan to continue to take measures to remedy the\nmaterial weakness. For example, we engaged a consulting firm with extensive U.S. GAAP experiences to strengthen our internal control\nover financial reporting. For details, see “Item 15. Controls and Procedures—Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.” However, the\nimplementation of these measures may not fully address these deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, and we cannot\nconclude that they have been fully remedied. Our failure to correct these control deficiencies or our failure to discover and address any\nother control deficiencies could result in inaccuracies in our financial statements and impair our ability to comply with applicable\nfinancial reporting requirements and related regulatory filings on a timely basis. Moreover, ineffective internal control over financial\nreporting could significantly hinder our ability to prevent fraud.\nIf we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer material misstatements in our financial\nstatements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial\ninformation. This could in turn limit our access to capital markets, harm our results of operations, and lead to a decline in the trading\nprice of our ADSs. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse\nof corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which we list, regulatory investigations and civil or\ncriminal sanctions. We may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods.\nIf the PCAOB, is unable to inspect our auditors as required under the Holdings Foreign Companies Accountable Act, the SEC will\nprohibit the trading of our ADSs. A trading prohibition may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment. Additionally,\nthe inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of our auditors deprives our investors of the benefits of such inspections.\nOn April 21, 2020, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and PCAOB Chairman William D. Duhnke III, along with other senior SEC staff,\nreleased a joint statement highlighting the risks associated with investing in companies based in or have substantial operations in\nemerging markets including China. The joint statement emphasized the risks associated with lack of access for the PCAOB to inspect\nauditors and audit work papers in China and higher risks of fraud in emerging markets.\nOn May 18, 2020, Nasdaq filed three proposals with the SEC to (i) apply minimum offering size requirement for companies\nprimarily operating in “Restrictive Market”, (ii) adopt a new requirement relating to the qualification of management or board of director\nfor Restrictive Market companies, and (iii) apply additional and more stringent criteria to an applicant or listed company based on the\nqualifications of the company’s auditors.\nOn May 20, 2020, the U.S. Senate passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act requiring a foreign company to certify it\nis not owned or controlled by a foreign government if the PCAOB is unable to audit specified reports because the company uses a\nforeign auditor not subject to PCAOB inspection. On December 2, 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives approved the Holding\nForeign Companies Accountable Act. On December 18, 2020, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act was signed into law. On\nJune 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the Accelerating HFCA Act,\nwhich was enacted into law on December 29, 2022, amending the HFCA Act and requiring the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities\nfrom trading on any U.S. stock exchange if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three\nconsecutive years."

As\nof the date hereof, Marcum Asia CPAs LLP is not included in the list of PCAOB identified firms in 2021 Determinations.\nOn August 26, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it had signed a Statement of Protocol (the “SOP”) with the China Securities\nRegulatory Commission and the Ministry of Finance of China. The SOP, together with two protocol agreements governing inspections\nand investigations (together, the “SOP Agreement”), establishes a specific, accountable framework to make possible complete\ninspections and investigations by the PCAOB of audit firms based in mainland China and Hong Kong, as required under U.S. law.\nOn December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it was able to conduct inspections and investigations completely of PCAOB-\nregistered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2022. The PCAOB vacated its previous 2021\nDeterminations accordingly.\nOur auditors, Marcum Asia CPAs LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that issued the audit report included\nelsewhere in the annual report, an auditor of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a U.S. – based accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB, is subject to laws in the United States pursuant which the PACOB conducts regular inspections to assess its\ncompliance with the applicable professional standards. Our auditor is headquartered in New York, New York and is not included in the\nlist of PCAOB identified firms in the 2021 Determinations. As a result, we do not expect to be identified as a “Commission-Identified\nIssuer” under the HFCAA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 after we file our annual report on Form 20-F for such fiscal year.\nHowever, whether the PCAOB will continue to conduct inspections and investigations completely to its satisfaction of PCAOB-\nregistered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong is subject to uncertainty and depends on a number\nof factors out of our, and our auditor’s, control, including positions taken by authorities of the PRC. The PCAOB is expected to continue\nto demand complete access to inspections and investigations against accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong\nin the future and states that it has already made plans to resume regular inspections in early 2023 and beyond.\nThe PCAOB is required under the HFCAA to make its determination on an annual basis with regards to its ability to inspect and\ninvestigate completely accounting firms based in the mainland China and Hong Kong. Should the PCAOB again encounter impediments\nto inspections and investigations in mainland China or Hong Kong as a result of positions taken by any authority in either jurisdiction,\nthe PCAOB will make determinations under the HFCAA as and when appropriate. If the PCAOB determines in the future that it no\nlonger has full access to inspect and investigate completely accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong and if we use an\naccounting firm headquartered in one of these jurisdictions to issue an audit report on our financial statements filed with the SEC by\nthen, we may be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer following the filing of the annual report on Form 20-F for the relevant\nfiscal year.\nThere can be no assurance that we would not be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer for any future fiscal year. If, in the\nfuture, we become identified by the SEC for two consecutive years as a “Commission-Identified Issuer” whose registered public\naccounting firm is determined by the PCAOB that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by one or\nmore authorities in China, the SEC may prohibit our securities from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-\ncounter trading market in the United States. If our securities are prohibited from trading in the United States, there is no certainty that we\nwill be able to list on a non-U.S. exchange or that a market for our securities will develop outside of the United States. Such a prohibition\nwould substantially impair your ability to sell or purchase our securities when you wish to do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated\nwith delisting would have a negative impact on the price of our securities. Also, such a prohibition would significantly affect our ability\nto raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and\nprospects."

This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters\nand additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If we fail to address and comply with\nthese regulations and any subsequent changes, we may be subject to penalty and our business may be harmed.\nWe have limited insurance coverage, which could expose us to significant costs and business disruption.\nWe maintain various insurance policies to safeguard against risks and unexpected events.

To comply with PRC laws\nand regulations, we set up a series of contractual arrangements entered into among Sky City (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd., or Sky City\nBeijing, Pintec (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd., or Pintec Beijing, our variable interest entities, and their shareholders to conduct our\noperations in China. For a detailed description of these contractual arrangements, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—C.\nOrganizational Structure—Contractual Arrangements with Our Variable Interest Entities.” As a result of these contractual arrangements,\nwe exert control over our variable interest entities and their subsidiaries and consolidate their operating results in our financial statements\nunder U.S. GAAP.\nForeign ownership of internet-based businesses, such as distribution of online information and other value-added telecommunication\nservices, are subject to restrictions under current PRC laws and regulations. For example, as provided in the Special Management\nMeasures for Foreign Investment Access (Negative List) (2021 version), or the 2021 Negative List, foreign investors are generally not\nallowed to own more than 50% of the equity interests in a value-added telecommunication service provider with certain exceptions\nrelating to e-commerce business, and any such foreign investor must have experience in providing value-added telecommunications\nservices overseas and maintain a good track record in accordance with the Provisions on the Administration of Foreign Invested Telecom\nEnterprise. Under current PRC laws and regulations, foreign-invested companies engaged in the onshore insurance brokerage business\nare subject to stringent requirements compared with Chinese domestic enterprises. Specifically, according to the Service Guide for the\nEstablishment and Examination and Approval of Insurance Brokers, published by the CBIRC in September 2021, foreign shareholders of\na Chinese Insurance Broker shall be (i) foreign insurance brokers with more than 30 years of experience in establishing commercial\ninstitutions in WTO member countries; and (ii) have total assets of more than US$200 million at the end of the year preceding the\ninvestment application in a Chinese brokerage business. However, on December 3, 2021, the Notice of the CBIRC General Office on\nClarifying Relevant Measures for the Opening up of the Insurance Intermediary Market, or the Clarifying Notice, was released and\nprovided that overseas insurance brokerage companies with actual business experience and complying with the relevant provisions of the\nCBIRC are allowed to invest in and establish insurance brokerage companies in China to engage in insurance brokerage business. The\nrelevant requirements that an investor that intends to establish a foreign-funded insurance brokerage company in China shall have more\nthan 30 years of business experience in any WTO member country, have established a representative office in China for two\nconsecutive years and have total assets of not less than US $200 million in the year prior to the application shall no longer be\nimplemented. How these requirements will be interpreted and implemented is still unclear. Our PRC subsidiaries and their subsidiaries\nmay not in practice meet all the requirements of actual business experience. Therefore, even though the insurance brokerage industry\nfalls within the permitted category under the Catalogue of Industries for Encouraging Foreign Investment and the 2021 Negative List, we\nopted for a variable interest entities structure instead of direct ownership. Myfin Insurance Broker Co., Ltd., or Beijing Myfin, a\nsubsidiary of one of our variable interest entities, Pintec Jinke (Beijing) Technology Information Co., Ltd., or Beijing Jinke, has obtained\nthe license for insurance brokerage issued by the Beijing Bureau of the CBIRC, which allows Beijing Myfin to conduct onshore\ninsurance brokerage business within the territory of the PRC and will remain valid until June 2025. Current PRC regulations relating to\nforeign investments in the onshore insurance brokerage business in China do not contain detailed explanations and operational\nprocedures, and are subject to interpretations by relevant governmental authorities in China. However, most of these regulations have not\nbeen interpreted by the relevant authorities in the context of a corporate structure similar to ours. Therefore, there are substantial\nuncertainties regarding the applicability of these regulations to our business. Moreover, new regulations may be adopted and\ninterpretations of existing regulations may develop and change, which may materially and adversely affect our ability to conduct our\nonshore insurance brokerage business."

Our subsidiaries may not\nin practice meet all the requirements. As a result, it is difficult for our PRC subsidiaries or their subsidiaries, as foreign-invested\ncompanies and subsidiaries of foreign-invested companies to apply for a fund distribution license. Our variable interest entity Beijing\nHongdian has obtained the license relating to the publicly raised securities investment fund distribution business issued by the CSRC,\nwhich allows Beijing Hongdian to conduct both publicly raised securities investment fund distribution business and privately-raised\ninvestment fund distribution business. Current PRC regulations relating to foreign investments in the fund distribution business in China\ndo not contain detailed explanations and operational procedures, and are subject to interpretations by relevant governmental authorities in\nChina. However, most of these regulations have not been interpreted by the relevant authorities in the context of a corporate structure\nsimilar to ours. Therefore, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the applicability of these regulations to our business.

For example, in October 2019,\nthe CSRC issued the Notice on the Pilot Launch of Investment Advisory Business for Public Offered Securities Investment Fund, or the\nPilot Notice, which provides specific guidance for the conduct of securities investment fund advisory business. Institutions shall file with\nthe CSRC to operate securities investment fund advisory business and the CSRC shall form an expert evaluation committee to evaluate\nthe pilot implementing plan and preparation work of the relevant institutions and decide the qualification of such institutions. In addition,\nthe securities regulatory bureaus of Beijing have issued the Circular of Regulating Fund Investment Recommendation Activities, or the\nRecommendation Circular, in 2021, which requires that a fund sales agency shall not provide any investment recommendations for fund\nportfolio strategies without the fund investment advisory licenses. The Recommendation Circular further prohibits institutions from\ndeveloping new business of making recommendations for fund portfolio strategies in violation of the requirements of the Pilot Notice.\nSpecifically, they shall not display or launch new fund portfolio strategies, provide existing fund portfolio strategies to new clients, or\nallow existing clients to make additional fund portfolio strategy investments. Moreover, the Recommendation Circular sets different\nrectification timelines for institutions with and without fund investment advisory licenses. Asset Management Association of China\nissued the Measures for Registration and Filing of Private Investment Funds on February 24, 2023, which would come into effect on\nMay 1, 2023 and emphasizes that a fund sales agency should fulfill investor suitability obligations and not mislead consumers and clearly\nreveal investment risks. Although we have updated the Xuanji Intelligence Investment app to comply with the requirements of the\nRecommendation Circular to the best we can, including suspending (i) registration by new users and (ii) acceptance of funds from any\nexisting users, we cannot guarantee you that we will not be subject to more similar rectification requests from the governmental\nauthorities or that we will fully comply with all applicable rules and regulations at all times.\nIn the opinion of our PRC counsel, Shihui Partners, the ownership structures of Sky City Beijing, Pintec Beijing, and our variable\ninterest entities, currently do not result in any violation of the applicable PRC laws or regulations currently in effect; and the contractual\narrangements among Sky City Beijing, Pintec Beijing and our variable interest entities and their shareholders, are governed by PRC laws\nor regulations, and are currently valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with the applicable PRC laws or regulations currently in\neffect, and do not result in any violation of the applicable PRC laws or regulations currently in effect, except that the equity pledge under\n(i) the equity pledge agreement entered into among Pintec Beijing, Beijing Hongdian and its shareholders and (ii) the equity pledge\nagreement entered into among Pintec Beijing, Xinshun Dingye and Xinshun Dingye’s shareholder would not be deemed validly created\nuntil it is registered with the competent government authorities. However, Shihui Partners has also advised us that there are substantial\nuncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current or future PRC laws and regulations, and there can be no assurance\nthat the PRC government will ultimately take a view that is consistent with the opinion of our PRC counsel.\nIt is uncertain whether any new PRC laws, regulations or rules relating to the “variable interest entity” structure will be adopted or if\nadopted, what they would provide. In March 2019, the National People’s Congress passed the PRC Foreign Investment Law, which\nbecame effective as of January 1, 2020. For the effect of the PRC Foreign Investment Law on us, see “—Risks Relating to Doing\nBusiness in China—Substantial uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation and implementation of the PRC Foreign Investment\nLaw and how it may impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations.”"

For a description of these contractual arrangements, see “Item 4.

For example, our\nvariable interest entities or their shareholders may fail to fulfill their contractual obligations with us, by, among other things, failing to\nmaintain our website and use the domain names and trademarks in a manner as stipulated in the contractual arrangements, or taking other\nactions that are detrimental to our interests.\nIf we had direct ownership of our variable interest entities, we would be able to exercise our rights as shareholders to effect changes\nin their board of directors, which in turn could implement changes, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations, at the management\nand operational level. However, under the current contractual arrangements, we rely on the performance by our variable interest entities\nand their shareholders of their obligations under the contractual arrangements to exercise control over our variable interest entities and\ntheir subsidiaries. The shareholders of our variable interest entities may not act in the best interests of our company or may not perform\ntheir obligations under these contracts. Such risks exist throughout the period in which we intend to operate certain portion of our\nbusiness through the contractual arrangements with our variable interest entities and their shareholders. Although we have the right to\nreplace any shareholder of such entities under the contractual arrangements, if any of these shareholders is uncooperative or any dispute\nrelating to these contracts remains unresolved, we will have to enforce our rights under these contracts through the operations of PRC\nlaws and arbitration, litigation and other legal proceedings, the outcome of which will be subject to uncertainties in the PRC legal\nsystem. Therefore, our contractual arrangements with our variable interest entities and their shareholders may not be as effective in\nensuring our control over the relevant portion of our business operations as direct ownership would be.\nAny failure by our variable interest entities or their respective shareholders to perform their obligations under our contractual\narrangements with them would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have entered into a series of contractual arrangements with our variable interest entities and their shareholders. For a description\nof these contractual arrangements, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—C.

We may also\nhave to rely on legal remedies under PRC laws, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, and claiming damages,\nwhich we cannot assure you will be effective under PRC laws. For example, if the shareholders of our variable interest entities were to\nrefuse to transfer their equity interests in such entities to us or our designee when we exercise the purchase option pursuant to these\ncontractual arrangements, or if they were otherwise to act in bad faith toward us, then we may have to take legal action to compel them to\nperform their contractual obligations."

The legal system in the PRC is not as developed as in some other jurisdictions, such as the\nUnited States. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements.\nMeanwhile, there are very few precedents and little formal guidance as to how contractual arrangements in the context of a variable\ninterest entity should be interpreted or enforced under PRC laws. There remain significant uncertainties regarding the ultimate outcome\nof such arbitration should legal action become necessary. In addition, under PRC laws, rulings by arbitrators are final and parties cannot\nappeal the arbitration results in court unless such rulings are revoked or determined unenforceable by a competent court. If the losing\nparties fail to carry out the arbitration awards within a prescribed time limit, the prevailing parties may only enforce the arbitration\nawards in PRC courts through arbitration award recognition proceedings, which would require additional expenses and delay. In the\nevent that we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, or if we suffer significant delay or other obstacles in the process of\nenforcing these contractual arrangements, we may not be able to exert effective control over our variable interest entities and their\nsubsidiaries, and our ability to conduct our business may be negatively affected.

Our financial position could be materially adversely affected if our variable\ninterest entities’ tax liabilities increase or if they are required to pay late payment fees and other penalties.\nWe may lose the ability to use and benefit from assets held by our variable interest entities that are material to the operation of our\nbusiness if the entity goes bankrupt or becomes subject to a dissolution or liquidation proceeding.\nOur variable interest entities hold certain assets that are material to the operation of our business, including, among others,\nintellectual properties, hardware and software. Beijing Hongdian holds the license relating to the publicly raised securities investment\nfund distribution business. Beijing Myfin, a subsidiary of one of our variable interest entities, holds our license for insurance brokerage\nbusiness. Under the contractual arrangements, our variable interest entities may not, and the shareholders of our variable interest entities\nmay not cause them to, in any manner, sell, transfer, mortgage or dispose of their assets or their legal or beneficial interests in the\nbusiness without our prior consent. However, in the event these shareholders breach these contractual arrangements and voluntarily\nliquidate our variable interest entities, or our variable interest entities declare bankruptcy and all or part of their assets become subject to\nliens or rights of third-party creditors, or are otherwise disposed of without our consent, we may be unable to continue some or all of our\nbusiness activities, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our variable\ninterest entities undergo a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding, the independent third-party creditors may claim rights to some\nor all of these assets, thereby hindering our ability to operate our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Doing Business in China\nChanges in China’s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial conditions and results of operations.\nSubstantially all of our operations are located in China. Accordingly, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations may be influenced to a significant degree by political, economic and social conditions in China generally and by continued\neconomic growth in China as a whole.\nThe Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the amount of\ngovernment involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the\nChinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state\nownership of productive assets and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of\nproductive assets in China are still owned by the government. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in\nregulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over China’s\neconomic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary\npolicy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies."

      "text": "Table of Contents\n49\nWhile the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically\nand among various sectors of the economy. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth\nand guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect\non us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital\ninvestments or changes in tax regulations. The growth rate of the Chinese economy has gradually slowed since 2010, and the impact of\nCOVID-19 on the Chinese economy may continue. Any prolonged slowdown in the Chinese economy may reduce the demand for our\nproducts and services and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nUncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to us.\nThe PRC legal system is based on written statutes and prior court decisions have limited value as precedents. Since these laws and\nregulations are relatively new and the PRC legal system continues to evolve, the interpretations and the enforcement of many laws,\nregulations and rules are updated from time to time. For example, the enforcement of laws and rules and regulations in China can change\nquickly and there are risks that such changes of laws and rule and regulations in China may influence our operations at time, which could\nresult in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our ADSs.\nIn particular, PRC laws and regulations concerning the consumer finance and wealth management industries, as well as the SME\ntechnical services industry, are developing and evolving. Although we have taken measures to comply with the laws and regulations that\nare applicable to our business operations, and avoid conducting any noncompliant activities under the applicable laws and regulations,\nthe PRC government authority may promulgate the other new laws and regulations regulating the consumer finance and wealth\nmanagement industries, as well as the SME technical services industry, in the future. We cannot assure you that our practice would not be\ndeemed to violate any new PRC laws or regulations relating to consumer finance and wealth management, as well as the SME technical\nservices. Moreover, developments in the consumer finance and wealth management industries, as well as the SME technical services\nindustry, may lead to changes in PRC laws, regulations and policies or in the interpretation and application of existing laws, regulations\nand policies that may limit or restrict wealth management platforms, online mutual fund distribution platforms and technology platforms\nenabling financial services provider like us, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operations.\nFrom time to time, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights. However, since PRC\nadministrative and court authorities have certain discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, it may be\ndifficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy. Furthermore, the\nPRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published in a timely manner) that\nmay have retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the\nviolation. Such uncertainties, including uncertainty over the scope and effect of our contractual, property (including intellectual property)\nand procedural rights, could materially and adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations.\nThe Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities and may\nintervene or influence our operations at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations and the value of our\nADSs.\nThe Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese\neconomy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations,\nincluding those relating to securities regulation, data protection, cybersecurity and mergers and acquisitions and other matters. The\ncentral or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that\nwould require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations.\nGovernment actions in the future could significantly affect economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof, and could\nrequire us to materially change our operating activities or divest ourselves of any interests we hold in Chinese assets. Our business may\nbe subject to various government and regulatory interference in the provinces in which we operate. We may incur increased costs\nnecessary to comply with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply. Our operations could\nbe adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to our business or industry."

The Opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities\nactivities, and the need to strengthen the supervision over overseas listings by Chinese companies. Effective measures, such as promoting\nthe construction of relevant regulatory systems, will be taken to deal with the risks and incidents of China-related overseas listed\ncompanies. As of the date of this annual report, we have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, or sanctions from PRC government\nauthorities in connection with the Opinions.\nOn June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China (the “SCNPC”), promulgated the PRC Data\nSecurity Law, which became effective in September 2021. The PRC Data Security Law imposes data security and privacy obligations on\nentities and individuals carrying out data activities, and introduces a data classification and hierarchical protection system based on the\nimportance of data in economic and social development, and the degree of harm it will cause to national security, public interests, or\nlegitimate rights and interests of individuals or organizations when such data is tampered with, destroyed, leaked, illegally acquired or\nused. The PRC Data Security Law also provides for a national security review procedure for data activities that may affect national\nsecurity and imposes export restrictions on certain data an information.\nIn early July 2021, regulatory authorities in China launched cybersecurity investigations with regard to several China-based\ncompanies that are listed in the United States. The Chinese cybersecurity regulator announced on July 2 that it had begun an investigation\nof Didi Global Inc. (NYSE: DIDI) and two days later ordered that the company’s app be removed from smartphone app stores. On\nJuly 5, 2021, the Chinese cybersecurity regulator launched the same investigation on two other internet platforms, China’s Full Truck\nAlliance of Full Truck Alliance Co. Ltd. (NYSE: YMM) and Boss of KANZHUN LIMITED (Nasdaq: BZ).\nOn August 17, 2021, the State Council promulgated the Regulations on the Protection of the Security of Critical Information\nInfrastructure (the “Regulations”), which took effect on September 1, 2021. The Regulations supplement and specify the provisions on\nthe security of critical information infrastructure as stated in the Cybersecurity Review Measures. The Regulations provide, among\nothers, that protection department of certain industry or sector shall notify the operator of the critical information infrastructure in time\nafter the identification of certain critical information infrastructure.\nOn August 20, 2021, the SCNPC promulgated the Personal Information Protection Law of the PRC (the “Personal Information\nProtection Law”), which became effective in November 2021. As the first systematic and comprehensive law specifically for the\nprotection of personal information in the PRC, the Personal Information Protection Law provides, among others, that (1) an individual’s\nconsent shall be obtained to use sensitive personal information, such as biometric characteristics and individual location tracking,\n(2) personal information operators using sensitive personal information shall notify individuals of the necessity of such use and the\nimpact on the individual’s rights, and (3) where personal information operators reject an individual’s request to exercise his or her rights,\nthe individual may file a lawsuit with a People’s Court.\nOn November 14, 2021, the CAC promulgated the draft Regulations on the Administration of Cyber Data Security (Draft for\nComments) (the “Draft CAC Regulation”), which has not yet become effective. The Draft CAC Regulation provides that data processors\nthat conduct the following activities must apply for cybersecurity review: (1) merger, reorganization or spin-off of online platform\noperators holding a large amount of data resources related to national security, economic development or public interests, which may\nhave an adverse effect on national security; (2) data processors that handle personal information of more than one million users intending\nto list their securities on a foreign stock exchange; (3) data processors intending to list their securities on a stock exchange in Hong Kong\nwhich may have an adverse effect on national security; and (4) other data processing activities that may have an adverse effect on\nnational security."

According to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, critical information\ninfrastructure operators that intend to purchase internet products and services which may have an adverse effect on national security must\napply for cybersecurity review. Meanwhile, online platform operators holding personal information of over one million users that intend\nto list their securities on a foreign stock exchange must apply for cybersecurity review.\nGiven that the above mentioned newly promulgated laws, regulations and policies were recently promulgated or issued, and have not\nyet taken effect (as applicable), their interpretation, application and enforcement are subject to substantial uncertainties. We are of the\nview that such requirement for cybersecurity review under the Draft CAC Regulation, if effective in the current form, and revised\nCybersecurity Review Measures, are not applicable to us, primarily because, as of the date of the annual report: (1) we have not received\nany notice or determination from competent PRC governmental authorities identifying us as a critical information infrastructure operator;\n(2) we do not hold or process personal information of over one million users; and (3) we have not received any investigation, notice,\nwarning, or sanctions from applicable government authorities in relation to national security. However, the relevant PRC government\nagencies could reach a different conclusion, applicable laws, regulations or interpretations could change and we could be required to\nobtain such approvals in the future.\nSee “—Recent regulatory development in China may exert more oversight and control over listings and offerings that are conducted\noverseas.

The\nChinese government may exercise certain oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business and may influence our\noperations at time, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our ADSs.\nAs a business operating in China, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the PRC, which can be complex and evolve rapidly.\nThe PRC government has the power to exercise certain oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business, and the regulations to\nwhich we are subject may change from time to time. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of new and existing\nlaws and regulations in the PRC are sometimes uncertain. In addition, these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied\ninconsistently by different agencies or authorities, and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. New laws, regulations, and\nother government directives in the PRC may also be costly to comply with, and such compliance or any associated inquiries or\ninvestigations or any other government actions may:\n·\nDelay or impede our development,\n·\nResult in negative publicity or increase our operating costs,\n·\nRequire significant management time and attention, and\n·\nSubject us to remedies, administrative penalties and even criminal liabilities that may harm our business, including fines\nassessed for our current or historical operations, or demands or orders that we modify or even cease our business\npractices.\nThe promulgation of new laws or regulations, or the new interpretation of existing laws and regulations, in each case that restrict or\notherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we conduct our business and could require us to change certain aspects of\nour business to ensure compliance, which could decrease demand for our products or services, reduce revenues, increase costs, require us\nto obtain more licenses, permits, approvals or certificates, or subject us to additional liabilities. To the extent any new or more stringent\nmeasures are required to be implemented, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as well\nas materially decrease the value of our ADSs."

Recently, the PRC government is enhancing supervision over companies seeking listings overseas and some specific\nbusiness or activities such as the use of variable interest entities and data security or anti-monopoly. The PRC government may adopt\nnew measures that may affect our and the variable interest entities’ operations or may exert more oversight and control over offerings\nconducted outside of China and foreign investment in China-based companies, and we may be subject to challenges brought by these\nnew laws, regulations and policies. However, since these laws, regulations and policies are relatively new and the PRC legal system\ncontinues to evolve, the interpretations and the enforcement of many laws, regulations and rules are updated from time to time.\nFurthermore, as we may be subject to additional, yet undetermined, laws and regulations, compliance may require us to obtain additional\npermits and licenses, complete or update registrations with relevant regulatory authorities, adjust our business operations, as well as\nallocate additional resources to monitor developments in the relevant regulatory environment.

The interpretation and application of the\nregulations remain unclear, and our offshore offerings may ultimately require approval of the CSRC. If the CSRC approval is required, it\nis uncertain whether we can or how long it will take us to obtain the approval and, even if we obtain such CSRC approval, the approval\ncould be rescinded. Any failure to obtain or delay in obtaining the CSRC approval for any of our offshore offerings, or a rescission of\nsuch approval if obtained, would subject us to sanctions imposed by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory authorities, which could include\nfines and penalties on our operations in China, restrictions or limitations on our ability to pay dividends outside of China, and other\nforms of sanctions that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations."

These opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities and the\nsupervision on overseas listings by China-based companies and proposed to take effective measures, such as promoting the construction\nof relevant regulatory systems to deal with the risks and incidents faced by China-based overseas-listed companies.\nUpon an approval by the State Council, the CSRC released new regulations for the filing-based administration of overseas securities\noffering and listing by domestic companies on February 17, 2023. These regulations, which came into effect on March 31, 2023, include\nthe Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies or the Trial Measures, and five\nsupporting guidelines. The Trial Measures not only stipulate that both direct and indirect overseas securities offering and listing activities\nare subject to regulations, but also clearly define the circumstances where provisions for direct and indirect overseas securities offering\nand listing by domestic companies apply. Specifically, where a domestic company seeks to indirectly offer and list securities on overseas\nmarkets, the issuer shall designate a major domestic operating entity, which shall, as the domestic responsible entity, file with the CSRC.\nAny overseas securities offering and listing made by an issuer that meets both of the following conditions will be determined to be\nindirect: (i) 50% or more of the issuer’s operating revenue, total profit, total assets or net assets as documented in its audited consolidated\nfinancial statements for the most recent accounting year is accounted for by domestic companies; and (ii) the main parts of the issuer’s\nbusiness activities are conducted in the PRC, or its main places of business are located in the PRC, or the senior managers in charge of its\nbusiness operation and management are mostly PRC citizens or domiciled in the PRC. The determination as to whether an overseas\nsecurities offering and listing by domestic companies is indirect, shall be made on a substance basis over form basis. According to the\nTrial Measures and the Officials from Relevant Department of CSRC Answered Reporter Question Regarding the Trial Measures, the\nexisting domestic companies that have completed overseas offering and listing before the effective date of the Trial Measures, or\nMarch 31, 2023, such as us, shall not be required to perform filling procedures for the completed overseas issuance and listing. However,\nfrom the effective date of the regulation, any of our subsequent securities offering in the same overseas market shall be subject to the\nfiling with the CSRC within three working days after the offering is completed, and any of our subsequent securities offering and listing\nin other overseas markets in future shall be subject to the filing with the CSRC within 3 working days after the relevant application is\nsubmitted overseas. See “Regulations—Regulations Relating to M&A and Overseas Listings.”\nIf it is determined that any approval, filing or other administrative procedure from other PRC governmental authorities is required\nfor any future offering or listing, we cannot assure that we or the VIEs can obtain the required approval or accomplish the required filings\nor other regulatory procedures in a timely manner, or at all. Any such failure would subject us to sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC\nregulatory authorities. These regulatory authorities may impose restrictions and penalties on the operations in China, significantly limit\nor completely hinder our ability to launch any new offering of our securities, limit our ability to pay dividends outside of China, delay or\nrestrict the repatriation of the proceeds from future capital raising activities into China, or take other actions that could materially and\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, as well as the trading price of our ADSs.\nFurthermore, the PRC government authorities may further strengthen oversight and control over listings and offerings that are conducted\noverseas. Any such action may adversely affect our operations and significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue\nto offer securities to you and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\nOn December 27, 2021, the NDRC and the Ministry of Commerce jointly issued the 2021 Negative List, which became effective on\nJanuary 1, 2022. Pursuant to the Special Administrative Measures, if a PRC company engaging in the prohibited business stipulated in\nthe 2021 Negative List seeks an overseas offering and listing, it shall obtain the approval from the competent governmental authorities.\nBesides, the foreign investors of the issuer shall not be involved in the company’s operation and management, and their\nshareholding percentages shall be subject, mutatis mutandis, to the relevant regulations on the domestic securities investments by foreign\ninvestors. As the 2021 Negative List is relatively new, there remain substantial uncertainties as to the interpretation and implementation\nof these new requirements, and it is unclear as to whether and to what extent listed companies like us will be subject to these new\nrequirements.

If it is determined in the future that approval and filing from the CSRC or other regulatory authorities or other\nprocedures, including the cybersecurity review under the Measures for Cybersecurity Review and the Draft Measures for Internet Data\nSecurity, are required for our offshore offerings, it is uncertain whether we can or how long it will take us to obtain such approval or\ncomplete such filing procedures and any such approval or filing could be rescinded or rejected.

Consequently, if investors engage in market trading or other activities in anticipation of and\nprior to settlement and delivery, they do so at the risk that settlement and delivery may not occur. Any uncertainties or negative publicity\nregarding such approval requirement could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, reputation, and\nthe trading price of our listed securities.\nIt may be difficult for overseas regulators to conduct investigation or collect evidence within China.\nShareholder claims or regulatory investigation that are common in the United States generally are difficult to pursue as a matter of\nlaw or practicality in China. For example, in China, there are significant legal and other obstacles to providing information needed for\nregulatory investigations or litigations initiated outside China. Although the authorities in China may establish a regulatory cooperation\nmechanism with the securities regulatory authorities of another country or region to implement cross-border supervision and\nadministration, such cooperation with the securities regulatory authorities in the Unities States may not be efficient in the absence of\nmutual and practical cooperation mechanism. Furthermore, according to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law, which became effective\nin March 2020, no overseas securities regulator is allowed to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within the\nPRC territory. While detailed interpretation of or implementation rules under Article 177 have yet to be promulgated, the inability for an\noverseas securities regulator to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within China may further increase the\ndifficulties you face in protecting your interests.\nThe custodians or authorized users of our controlling non-tangible assets, including chops and seals, may fail to fulfill their\nresponsibilities, or misappropriate or misuse these assets.\nUnder the PRC law, legal documents for corporate transactions, including agreements and contracts are executed using the chop or\nseal of the signing entity or with the signature of a legal representative whose designation is registered and filed with relevant PRC\nmarket regulation administrative authorities.\nIn order to secure the use of our chops and seals, we have established internal control procedures and rules for using these chops and\nseals. In any event that the chops and seals are intended to be used, the responsible personnel will submit a formal application, which will\nbe verified and approved by authorized employees in accordance with our internal control procedures and rules. In addition, in order to\nmaintain the physical security of our chops, we generally have them stored in secured locations accessible only to authorized employees.\nAlthough we monitor such authorized employees, the procedures may not be sufficient to prevent all instances of abuse or negligence.\nThere is a risk that our employees could abuse their authority, for example, by entering into a contract not approved by us or seeking to\ngain control of one of our subsidiaries or our affiliated entities or their subsidiaries. If any employee obtains, misuses or misappropriates\nour chops and seals or other controlling non-tangible assets for whatever reason, we could experience disruption to our normal business\noperations. We may have to take corporate or legal action, which could involve significant time and resources to resolve and divert\nmanagement from our operations, and we may not be able to recover our loss due to such misuse or misappropriation if the third party\nrelies on the apparent authority of such employees and acts in good faith."

Even before the\noutbreak of COVID-19, the global macroeconomic environment was facing numerous challenges. The growth rate of the Chinese\neconomy had already been slowing since 2010. There is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary\nmonetary and fiscal policies which had been adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world’s leading\neconomies, including the United States and China. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the imposition of broad economic sanctions on\nRussia could raise energy prices and disrupt global markets. Unrest, terrorist threats and the potential for war in the Middle East and\nelsewhere may increase market volatility across the globe. There have also been concerns about the relationship between China and other\ncountries, including the surrounding Asian countries, which may potentially have economic effects. In particular, there is significant\nuncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and China with respect to trade policies, treaties, government\nregulations and tariffs. Economic conditions in China are sensitive to global economic conditions, as well as changes in domestic\neconomic and political policies and the expected or perceived overall economic growth rate in China. Recently, the Russia-Ukraine\nconflict has caused, and continues to intensify, significant geopolitical tensions in Europe and across the world. This conflict and the\nimposition of broad economic sanctions on Russia could raise energy prices and disrupt global markets.

There have also been concerns about\nthe relationship between China and other countries, including the surrounding Asian countries, which may potentially have economic\neffects. Any severe or prolonged slowdown in the global or Chinese economy may materially and adversely affect our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nSubstantial uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation and implementation of the PRC Foreign Investment Law and how it\nmay impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations.\nIn March 2019, the National People’s Congress passed the PRC Foreign Investment Law, which became effective as of January 1,\n2020. The PRC Foreign Investment Law replaced the Law on Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures, the Laws on Sino-Foreign Contractual\nJoint Ventures and the Law on Foreign-Capital Enterprises to become the legal foundation for foreign investment in the PRC. The\nForeign Investment Law embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line with\nprevailing international practice and the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign and domestic\ninvestments. Meanwhile, the Implementation Regulations on the Foreign Investment Law, which was promulgated by the State Council\nin December 2019 and came into effect on January 1, 2020, further clarified and elaborated the relevant provisions of the Foreign\nInvestment Law.\nWe set up a series of contractual arrangements among our subsidiaries in the PRC, our variable interest entities and their\nshareholders to obtain the necessary licenses and permits in the industries that are currently subject to foreign investment restrictions in\nChina. See “—Risks Relating to Our Corporate Structure” and “Item 4. Information on the Company—C. Organizational Structure.”\nWhile the PRC Foreign Investment Law stipulates certain forms of foreign investment, it does not explicitly stipulate the variable interest\nentity structure as a form of foreign investment.\nNotwithstanding the above, the PRC Foreign Investment Law stipulates that foreign investment includes “foreign investors investing\nin China through any other methods under laws, administrative regulations, or provisions prescribed by the State Council”. Therefore, it\nis possible that future laws, administrative regulations, or provisions prescribed by the State Council may stipulate the variable interest\nentity structure as a form of foreign investment, in which case it is uncertain whether our contractual arrangements will be recognized as\nforeign investment, whether our contractual arrangements will be deemed to be in violation of the foreign investment access\nrequirements and whether any further actions shall be taken to our contractual arrangements.\nIf our contractual arrangements are regarded as invalid and illegal, or if we are not able to complete any actions that might be\nrequired to prevent them from being regarded as invalid or illegal, we would not be able to (i) continue our business in China through our\ncontractual arrangements with our variable interest entities and their subsidiaries, (ii) receive the economic benefits of our variable\ninterest entities and their subsidiaries under such contractual arrangements, or (iii) consolidate the financial results of our variable interest\nentities and their subsidiaries. Were this to occur, our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely\naffected and the market price of our ADSs would decline."

For example, the PRC Foreign Investment Law imposes certain information reporting requirements on foreign\ninvestors or the applicable foreign investment entities. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulations\n—Regulations Relating to Foreign Investment.”\nWe rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we\nmay have, and any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect on\nour ability to conduct our business.\nWe are a holding company, and we rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiaries for our cash and\nfinancing requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders and service any\ndebt we may incur. If our PRC subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict\ntheir ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. In addition, the PRC tax authorities may require our PRC subsidiaries to\nadjust its taxable income under the contractual arrangements it currently has in place with our variable interest entities and their\nsubsidiaries, in a manner that would materially and adversely affect their ability to pay dividends and other distributions to us.\nUnder PRC laws and regulations, our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China may pay dividends only out of their respective\naccumulated after-tax profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a wholly foreign-\nowned enterprise is required to set aside at least 10% of its accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain statutory\nreserve funds, until the aggregate amount of such funds reaches 50% of its registered capital. At its discretion, a wholly foreign-owned\nenterprise may allocate a portion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to certain optional reserve funds. These\nstatutory and optional reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends.\nIn response to the persistent capital outflow and the Renminbi’s depreciation against the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2016, the\nPeople’s Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, have implemented a series of capital control\nmeasures, including stricter vetting procedures for China-based companies to remit foreign currency for overseas acquisitions, dividend\npayments and shareholder loan repayments. The PRC government may continue to strengthen its capital controls and our PRC\nsubsidiaries’ dividends and other distributions may be subjected to tighter scrutiny in the future. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC\nsubsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments\nor acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nPRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of\ncurrency conversion may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of our initial public offering to make loans to or make\nadditional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to\nfund and expand our business.\nAny funds we transfer to our PRC subsidiaries, either as a shareholder loan or as an increase in registered capital, are subject to\nfiling or registration with the relevant governmental authorities in China. In addition, any foreign loan procured by our PRC subsidiaries\nis required to be registered with SAFE, or its local branches, and each of our PRC subsidiaries may not procure loans which exceed its\nstatutory limit. Any medium or long-term loan to be provided by us to our variable interest entities must be recorded and registered by\nthe National Development and Reform Committee and SAFE or its local branches. We may not complete such recording or registrations\non a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future capital contributions or foreign loans by us to our PRC subsidiaries. If we fail to\ncomplete such recording or registration, our ability to use the proceeds of our initial public offering and to capitalize our PRC operations\nmay be negatively affected, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. In addition, SAFE\nregulations prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from using Renminbi funds converted from its foreign exchange capital for expenditure\nbeyond their business scope, securities, investment (except for guarantee products issued by banks), providing loans to non-affiliated\nenterprises or constructing or purchasing real estate not for their own use. These regulations may significantly limit our ability to transfer\nto and use in China the net proceeds from our initial public offering, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations. On October 23, 2019, the SAFE promulgated the Notice for Further Advancing the Facilitation of Cross-border\nTrade and Investment, or SAFE Circular 28, which allows all foreign-invested companies to use Renminbi converted from foreign\ncurrency-denominated capital for equity investments in China, as long as the equity investment is genuine, does not violate applicable\nlaws, and complies with the negative list on foreign investment. However, since SAFE Circular 28 is newly promulgated, it is unclear\nhow SAFE and competent banks will carry this out in practice."

The\nRenminbi has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably. The value of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar\nand other currencies is affected by changes in China’s political and economic conditions and by China’s foreign exchange policies,\namong other things. We cannot assure you that Renminbi will not appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in\nthe future. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between\nRenminbi and the U.S. dollar in the future.\nSubstantially all of our revenue and costs are denominated in Renminbi and our reporting currency is Renminbi. Significant\nrevaluation of the Renminbi may have a material and adverse effect on your investment. For example, to the extent that we need to\nconvert U.S. dollars we receive from our initial public offering into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against\nthe U.S. dollar would reduce the Renminbi amount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert our\nRenminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of paying dividends or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the\nRenminbi would reduce the U.S. dollar amount available to us.\nVery limited hedging options are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not\nentered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to\nenter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to\nhedge our exposure adequately or at all. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control\nregulations that restrict our ability to convert Renminbi into foreign currency.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may limit our ability to utilize our operating revenues effectively and affect the value of\nyour investment.\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the\nremittance of currency out of China. We receive substantially all of our operating revenues in Renminbi. Under our current corporate\nstructure, our holding company in the Cayman Islands relies on dividend payments from our PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and\nfinancing requirements we may have. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as\nprofit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval\nfrom SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. Therefore, our PRC subsidiaries are able to pay dividends in foreign\ncurrencies to us without prior approval from SAFE, subject to the condition that the remittance of such dividends outside of the PRC\ncomplies with certain procedures under PRC foreign exchange regulation, such as the overseas investment registrations by the beneficial\nowners of our company who are PRC residents. But approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required\nwhere Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of\nloans denominated in foreign currencies.\nAs a result, we need to obtain SAFE approval to use cash generated from the operations of our PRC subsidiaries and variable\ninterest entities to pay off their respective debt in a currency other than Renminbi owed to entities outside China, or to make other capital\nexpenditure payments outside China in a currency other than Renminbi. The PRC government may at its discretion further restrict access\nto foreign currencies in the future for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining\nsufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our\nshareholders, including holders of our ADSs."

The requirement of employee benefit plans has not\nbeen implemented consistently by the local governments in China given the different levels of economic development in different\nlocations. Companies operating in China are also required to withhold individual income tax on our PRC-based employees’ salaries\nbased on the actual salary of each employee upon payment. As of the date of this annual report, we have made employee benefit\npayments and withheld individual income tax for all employees based in the PRC. However, as the interpretation and implementation of\nlabor-related laws and regulations are still uncertain and evolving in China, with respect to the underpaid employee benefits, we may be\nrequired by the relevant governmental authorities to make additional contributions to these plans as well as to pay late fees and fines;\nwith respect to the under withheld individual income tax, we may be required by the relevant governmental authorities to make\nadditional withholding and pay late fees and fines. If we are subject to late fees or fines in relation to the aforementioned additional\nemployee benefits and individual income tax, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nPRC regulations establish complex procedures for some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors, which could make it\nmore difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.\nThe Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, originally adopted\nby six PRC regulatory agencies in 2006, and some other regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions established additional\nprocedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex,\nincluding requirements in some instances that the Ministry of Commerce be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in\nwhich a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise. Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law requires that the anti-monopoly\nlaw enforcement agency shall be notified in advance of any concentration of undertaking if certain thresholds are triggered. On\nFebruary 7, 2021, the Anti-Monopoly Committee of the State Council published the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for Internet Platforms,\nwhich stipulates that any concentration of undertakings involving variable interest entities shall fall within the scope of anti-monopoly\nreview. If a concentration of undertakings meets the criteria for declaration as stipulated by the State Council, an operator shall report\nsuch concentration of undertakings to the anti-monopoly law enforcement agency under the State Council in advance. Therefore, our\npotential acquisitions of other entities that we may make in the future (whether by ourselves, our subsidiaries or through our variable\ninterest entities) and that meets the criteria for declaration may be required to be reported to and approved by the anti-monopoly law\nenforcement agency, and we may be subject to penalties, including but not limited to a fine of no more than RMB500,000 if we fail to\ncomply with such requirement. In addition, the Provisions on the Implementation of the Safety Review System for Merger and\nAcquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors issued by the Ministry of Commerce that became effective on September 1,\n2011 specify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors that raise “national defense and security” concerns and mergers and\nacquisitions through which foreign investors may acquire de facto control over domestic enterprises that raise “national security”\nconcerns are subject to strict review by the Ministry of Commerce, and the rules prohibit any activities attempting to bypass a security\nreview, including by structuring the transaction through a proxy or contractual control arrangement. In the future, we may grow our\nbusiness by acquiring complementary businesses. Complying with the requirements of the above-mentioned regulations and other\nrelevant rules to complete such transactions could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval\nfrom the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could\naffect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share."

In addition, such PRC residents or entities must update their SAFE registrations when the offshore special purpose vehicle\nundergoes material events relating to any change of basic information (including change of such PRC residents or entities, name and\noperation term), increases or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, or mergers or divisions. In 2015, SAFE\nreleased the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Simplifying and Improving the Policies of Foreign\nExchange Administration Applicable to Direct Investment, or Circular 13, which has amended Circular 37 by requiring PRC residents or\nentities to register with qualified banks rather than SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment or control of an\noffshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing.\nIf our shareholders who are PRC residents or entities do not complete their registration as required, our PRC subsidiaries may be\nprohibited from distributing their profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to us, and we may be\nrestricted in our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with the SAFE registration\ndescribed above could result in liability under PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions.\nMr. Hao Dong, Mr. Yuyang Li, Mr. Wei Wei and Mr. Jun Dong, who directly or indirectly hold shares in our Cayman Islands holding\ncompany and who are known to us as being PRC residents, have completed the foreign exchange registrations in accordance with\nCircular 37. However, we may not be informed of the identities of all the PRC residents or entities holding direct or indirect interest in\nour company, nor can we compel our beneficial owners to comply with the requirements of Circular 37. As a result, we cannot assure you\nthat all of our shareholders or beneficial owners who are PRC residents or entities have complied with, and will in the future make or\nobtain any applicable registrations or approvals required by, Circular 37. Failure by such shareholders or beneficial owners to comply\nwith Circular 37, or failure by us to amend the foreign exchange registrations of our PRC subsidiaries, could subject us to fines or legal\nsanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities and limit our PRC subsidiaries’ ability to make distributions or pay\ndividends to us or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nAny failure to comply with PRC regulations regarding the registration requirements for employee stock incentive plans may subject\nthe PRC plan participants or us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions.\nPursuant to Circular 37, PRC residents who participate in stock incentive plans in overseas non-publicly-listed companies may\nsubmit applications to SAFE or its local branches for the foreign exchange registration with respect to offshore special purpose vehicles.\nIn the meantime, our directors, executive officers and other employees who are PRC citizens, subject to limited exceptions, and who\nhave been granted stock options by us, may follow the Notices on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic\nIndividuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plan of Overseas Publicly Listed Companies, promulgated by SAFE in 2012. PRC citizens\nand non-PRC citizens who reside in China for a continuous period of no less than one year who participate in any stock incentive plan of\nan overseas publicly listed company, subject to a few exceptions, are required to register with SAFE through a domestic qualified agent,\nwhich could be the PRC subsidiaries of such overseas listed company, and complete certain other procedures. In addition, an overseas\nentrusted institution must be retained to handle matters in connection with the exercise or sale of stock options and the purchase or sale\nof shares and interests. We and our directors, executive officers and other employees who are PRC citizens or who reside in the PRC for\na continuous period of no less than one year and who have been granted stock options have been subject to these regulations since our\ncompany became an overseas listed company upon the completion of our initial public offering. Failure to complete the SAFE\nregistrations may subject them to fines and legal sanctions, and may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital into our PRC\nsubsidiaries and limit our PRC subsidiaries’ ability to distribute dividends to us.

Under\nthese circulars, our employees working in China who exercise stock options or are granted restricted shares will be subject to PRC\nindividual income tax. Our PRC subsidiaries have obligations to file documents related to employee stock options or restricted shares\nwith relevant tax authorities and to withhold individual income taxes of those employees who exercise their share options. If our\nemployees fail to pay or we fail to withhold their income taxes according to relevant laws and regulations, we may face sanctions\nimposed by the tax authorities or other PRC governmental authorities. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview\n—Regulations—Regulations Relating to Foreign Currency Exchange—Share Option Rules.”\nIf we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC income tax purposes, such classification could result in unfavorable tax\nconsequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders or ADS holders.\nUnder the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, enterprises that are registered in countries or regions outside the\nPRC but have their “de facto management bodies” located within China may be considered as PRC resident enterprises and are therefore\nsubject to PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on their worldwide income. For detailed discussions of applicable laws,\nregulations and implementation rules, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulations—Regulations\nRelating to Tax—Enterprise Income Tax.”\nWe believe none of our entities outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. See “Item 4. Information on the\nCompany—B. Business Overview—Regulations—Regulations Relating to Tax.” However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is\nsubject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term “de facto\nmanagement body.” As substantially all of our management members are based in China, it remains unclear how the tax residency\nrule will apply to our case. If the PRC tax authorities determine that Pintec Technology Holdings Limited or any of our subsidiaries\noutside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, then Pintec Technology Holdings Limited or such\nsubsidiary could be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 25% on its worldwide income, which could materially reduce our net income. In\naddition, we will also be subject to PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. Furthermore, if the PRC tax authorities determine\nthat we are a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, dividends that we pay and gains realized on the sale or other\ndisposition of our ADSs or ordinary shares may be subject to PRC tax, at a rate of 10% in the case of non-PRC enterprises or 20% in the\ncase of non-PRC individuals (in each case, subject to the provisions of any applicable tax treaty), if such dividends or gains are deemed\nto be from PRC sources. It is unclear whether non-PRC shareholders of our company would be able to claim the benefits of any tax\ntreaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. Any such tax\nmay reduce the returns on your investment in the ADSs or ordinary shares.\nWe may not be able to obtain certain tax benefits for dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries to us through our Hong Kong\nsubsidiaries.\nPursuant to the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, if a non-resident enterprise has not set up an organization\nor establishment in the PRC, or has set up an organization or establishment but the income derived has no actual connection with such\norganization or establishment, it will be subject to a withholding tax on its PRC-sourced income at a rate of 10%. Pursuant to the\nArrangement between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax\nEvasion on Income, the withholding tax rate on dividends paid by a PRC enterprise to a Hong Kong enterprise is reduced to 5% from a\nstandard rate of 10% if the Hong Kong enterprise directly holds at least 25% of the PRC enterprise. There are also other conditions for\nenjoying the reduced withholding tax rate according to other relevant tax rules and regulations. See “Item 4. Information on the\nCompany—B. Business Overview—Regulations—Regulations Relating to Tax—Dividend Withholding Tax.” We cannot assure you that\nour determination regarding our qualification to enjoy the preferential tax treatment will not be challenged by the relevant PRC tax\nauthority that or we will be able to complete the necessary filings with the relevant PRC tax authority and enjoy the preferential\nwithholding tax rate of 5% under the Double Taxation Arrangement with respect to dividends to be paid by our PRC subsidiaries to Sky\nCity Hong Kong Limited and Next Hop Hong Kong Limited, our Hong Kong subsidiaries."

As a result, the gain derived from such transfer, which means the equity\ntransfer price minus the cost of equity, will be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10%. Under the terms of Circular 7, a\ntransfer which meets all of the following circumstances shall be directly deemed as having no reasonable commercial purposes: (i) over\n75% of the value of the equity interests of the offshore holding company are directly or indirectly derived from PRC taxable properties;\n(ii) at any time during the year before the indirect transfer, over 90% of the total properties of the offshore holding company are\ninvestments within PRC territory, or in the year before the indirect transfer, over 90% of the offshore holding company’s revenue is\ndirectly or indirectly derived from PRC territory; (iii) the function performed and risks assumed by the offshore holding company are\ninsufficient to substantiate its corporate existence; and (iv) the foreign income tax imposed on the indirect transfer is lower than the PRC\ntax imposed on the direct transfer of the PRC taxable properties.\nWe face uncertainties as to the reporting and other implications of certain past and future transactions where PRC taxable assets are\ninvolved, such as offshore restructuring, sale of the shares in our offshore subsidiaries or investments.

A number of Chinese\ncompanies have listed or are in the process of listing their securities on U.S. stock markets. The securities of some of these companies\nhave experienced significant volatility, including price declines in connection with their initial public offerings. The trading performances\nof these Chinese companies’ securities after their offerings may affect the attitudes of investors toward Chinese companies listed in the\nUnited States in general and consequently may impact the trading performance of our ADSs, regardless of our actual operating\nperformance.\nIn addition to market and industry factors, the price and trading volume for our ADSs may be highly volatile for factors specific to\nour own operations, including the following:\n·\nvariations in our revenues, earnings and cash flow;\n·\nannouncements of new investments, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures by us or our competitors;\n·\nannouncements of new services and expansions by us or our competitors;\n·\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n·\ndetrimental adverse publicity about us, our services and solutions, or the industries in which we operate;"

If the Parent does not maintain\ncompliance, Nasdaq could commence suspension or delisting procedures in respect of our ADSs. The commencement of suspension or\ndelisting procedures by an exchange remains at the discretion of such exchange and would be publicly announced by the exchange. If a\nsuspension or delisting were to occur, there would be significantly less liquidity in the suspended or delisted securities. In addition, our\nability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing would be greatly impaired. Furthermore, with respect to any\nsuspended or delisted ADSs, we would expect decreases in institutional and other investor demand, analyst coverage, market making\nactivity and information available concerning trading prices and volume, and fewer broker-dealers would be willing to execute trades\nwith respect to such ADSs."

If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, then we could lose visibility in the\nfinancial markets, institutional investors may not be willing to invest in our ADSs, and it would be more difficult for us to raise\nadditional capital through the capital markets. If analysts publish critical or negative research or reports about our business or industry or\notherwise recommend that investors not purchase our ADSs, the trading volume and market price for our ADSs would likely decline.\nThe sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of our ADSs could adversely affect their market price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our ADSs in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect\nthe market price of our ADSs and could materially impair our ability to raise capital through equity offerings in the future. We have\n507,239,098 Class A ordinary shares and 50,939,520 Class B ordinary shares outstanding as of March 31, 2023, including 238,629,685\nClass A ordinary shares represented by ADSs. All of our ADSs are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. The lockup agreement that our directors and executive officers and all of our\npre-IPO shareholders signed with the underwriters of our initial public offering expired on April 23, 2019, and these shareholders, and\nthe remaining Class A ordinary shares are available for sale subject to volume and other restrictions under Rule 144 and Rule 701 under\nthe Securities Act. To date, the trading volume of our ADSs on the Nasdaq Global Market has been low, so sales of even relatively small\namounts of our ADSs in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our ADSs. We cannot predict what effect, if any,\nmarket sales of securities held by our significant shareholders or any other shareholder or the availability of these securities for future\nsale will have on the market price of our ADSs.\nOur dual-class share structure with different voting rights will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage\nothers from pursuing any change of control transactions that holders of our Class A ordinary shares and ADSs may view as\nbeneficial.\nWe have a dual-class share structure. Our ordinary shares consist of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares, and our\nADSs represent Class A ordinary shares. In respect of matters requiring the votes of shareholders, holders of Class B ordinary shares are\nentitled to fifteen votes per share, subject to certain conditions, while holders of Class A ordinary shares are entitled to one vote per\nshare. Each Class B ordinary share is convertible into one Class A ordinary share at any time by the holder thereof, while Class A\nordinary shares are not convertible into Class B ordinary shares under any circumstances. Upon any sale of Class B ordinary shares by a\nholder thereof to any person other than our three core founders, Mr. Wei Wei, Mr. Jun Dong and Ms. Xiaomei Peng, or to any entity\nwhich is not affiliated with any of the three core founders, such Class B ordinary shares are automatically and immediately converted\ninto the same number of Class A ordinary shares. Each Class B ordinary share beneficially owned by any core founder is automatically\nconverted into one Class A ordinary share if at any time the core founder ceases to be a director or employee of our company or ceases to\nhave the capability to make business decisions on behalf of our company due to health reasons.\nAs of March 31, 2023, two of our three core founders, Mr. Jun Dong and Mr. Wei Wei, beneficially owned all of our issued Class B\nordinary shares. These Class B ordinary shares constitute approximately 9.4% of our total issued and outstanding share capital and 60.2%\nof the aggregate voting power of our total issued and outstanding share capital due to the disparate voting powers associated with our\ndual-class share structure. See “Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees—E. Share Ownership.” As a result of the dual-\nclass share structure and the concentration of ownership, holders of Class B ordinary shares will have considerable influence over\nmatters such as decisions regarding mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, election of directors and\nother significant corporate actions. Such holders may take actions that are not in the best interest of us or our other shareholders. This\nconcentration of ownership may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could have the effect of\ndepriving our other shareholders of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and may\nreduce the price of our ADSs. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage others\nfrom pursuing any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transactions that holders of Class A ordinary shares and ADSs\nmay view as beneficial."

As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in\nthe foreseeable future. Therefore, you should not rely on an investment in our ADSs as a source for any future dividend income.\nOur board of directors has complete discretion as to whether to distribute dividends. Even if our board of directors decides to declare\nand pay dividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, will depend on, among other things, our future results of\noperations and cash flow, our capital requirements and surplus, the amount of distributions, if any, received by us from our subsidiary,\nour financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Accordingly, the return on\nyour investment in our ADSs will likely depend entirely upon any future price appreciation of our ADSs. There is no guarantee that our\nADSs will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased the ADSs. You may not realize a return on your\ninvestment in our ADSs and you may even lose your entire investment in our ADSs.\nWe may be classified as a passive foreign investment company, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to\nU.S. Holders of our ADSs or ordinary shares.\nA non-U.S. corporation, such as our company, will be classified as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes for any taxable year, if either (i) 75% or more of its gross income for such taxable year consists of certain types of\n“passive” income or (ii) 50% or more of the value of its assets (determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such taxable year\nproduce or are held for the production of passive income. Passive income generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rents,\nannuities, net gains from the sale or exchange of property producing such income and net foreign currency gains. For this purpose, cash\nand assets readily convertible into cash are categorized as passive assets and the company’s unbooked intangibles associated with active\nbusiness activity are taken into account as non-passive assets.\nIn addition, we will be treated as owning a proportionate share of the assets and earning a proportionate share of the income of any\nother corporation in which we own, directly or indirectly, 25% or more (by value) of the stock. Although the law in this regard is unclear,\nwe treat our variable interest entities as being beneficially owned by us for U.S. federal income tax purposes because we control their\nmanagement decisions, we are entitled to substantially all of the economic benefits associated with these entities, and, as a result, we\nconsolidate their results of operations in our U.S. GAAP financial statements.\nWe believe our income from and assets used in the installment-sale business are treated as passive under the PFIC provisions. Based\non our current income and assets and the value of our ADSs, it is likely that we were classified as a PFIC for our taxable year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. Accordingly, U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the advisability of making a mark-to-market\nelection (as described in “Item 10. Additional Information—E. Taxation—U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—Passive Foreign\nInvestment Company Considerations”). Even if we are not currently a PFIC, changes in the nature of our income or assets, or\nfluctuations in the market price of our ADSs, may cause us to become a PFIC for future taxable years. In estimating the value of our\ngoodwill and other unbooked intangibles, we have taken into account our market capitalization, which may fluctuate over time. Among\nother factors, if our market capitalization declines, we may continue to be classified as a PFIC for our taxable year ending December 31,\n2022. Under circumstances where revenues from our installment sale business or other activities that produce passive income increase\nrelative to our revenues from activities that produce non-passive income or where we determine not to deploy significant amounts of\ncash for working capital or other purposes, our risk of becoming classified as a PFIC may substantially increase. In addition, if it were\ndetermined that that we are not the beneficial owner of our variable interest entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be\ntreated as a PFIC for our taxable year ending December 31, 2022 and in future taxable years.\nIf we are classified as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder (as defined in “Item 10. Additional Information—E.\nTaxation—U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) holds our ADSs or ordinary shares, such U.S. Holder may incur significantly\nincreased U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of our ADSs or ordinary shares and on the receipt\nof distributions on our ADSs or ordinary shares to the extent such gain or distribution is treated as an “excess distribution” under the U.S.\nfederal income tax rules. If we are so classified during a U.S. Holder’s holding period, our ADSs or ordinary shares will generally\ncontinue to be treated as shares in a PFIC for all succeeding taxable years during which such U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or ordinary\nshares, even if we cease to be a PFIC, unless certain elections are made.

These provisions could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an\nopportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of\nour company in a tender offer or similar transaction. Our board of directors has the authority, without further action by our shareholders,\nto issue preferred shares in one or more series and to fix their designations, powers, preferences, privileges, and relative participating,\noptional or special rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights,\nterms of redemption and liquidation preferences, any or all of which may be greater than the rights associated with our ordinary shares.\nPreferred shares could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal\nof management more difficult. If our board of directors decides to issue preferred shares, the price of our ADSs may fall and the voting\nand other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares and ADSs may be materially and adversely affected.\nYou may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through U.S. courts may be limited,\nbecause we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law and conduct our operations primarily in emerging markets.\nWe are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Our corporate affairs are governed by our\nmemorandum and articles of association, the Companies Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands and the common law of the Cayman\nIslands. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities\nof our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common\nlaw of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from the\ncommon law of England, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding, on a court in the Cayman Islands.\nThe rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established\nas they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a\nless developed body of securities laws than the United States. Some U.S. states, such as Delaware, have more fully developed and\njudicially interpreted bodies of corporate law than the Cayman Islands. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to\ninitiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the United States.\nShareholders of Cayman Islands exempted companies like us have no general rights under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate\nrecords or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of these companies. Our directors have discretion under our articles of association to\ndetermine whether or not, and under what conditions, our corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders, but are not obliged to\nmake them available to our shareholders. This may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts\nnecessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest.\nCertain corporate governance practices in the Cayman Islands, which is our home country, differ significantly from requirements for\ncompanies incorporated in other jurisdictions such as the United States. As a foreign private issuer, we are permitted under the Nasdaq\nStock Market Rules to follow home country corporate governance practices. Specifically, we do not have a majority of independent\ndirectors serving on our board of directors. We may also continue to rely on this and other exemptions available to foreign private issuers\nin the future, and to the extent that we choose to do so, our shareholders may be afforded less protection than they otherwise would under\nthe Nasdaq Stock Market Rules’ corporate governance listing standards applicable to U.S. domestic issuers. See “—Risks Relating to\nOur ADSs—As an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, we are permitted to adopt certain home country practices for\ncorporate governance matters that differ significantly from the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards. These practices may\nafford less protection to shareholders than they would enjoy if we complied fully with the corporate governance listing standards.”"

Additionally, our public shareholders may have limited rights and few\npractical remedies in emerging markets where we operate, as shareholder claims that are common in the United States, including class\naction based on securities law and fraud claims, generally are difficult or impossible to pursue as a matter of law or practicality in many\nemerging markets, including China. For example, in China, there are significant legal and other obstacles for the SEC, the DOJ and other\nU.S. authorities to obtaining information needed for shareholder investigations or litigation. Although the competent authorities in China\nmay establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authorities of another country or region to implement\ncross-border supervision and administration, the regulatory cooperation with the securities regulatory authorities in the United States has\nnot been efficient in the absence of a mutual and practical cooperation mechanism.

Holders of our ordinary shares other than the Depositary are not subject to\nthis discretionary proxy.\nYou may not receive dividends or other distributions on our ordinary shares and you may not receive any value for them, if it is illegal\nor impractical to make them available to you.\nThe depositary of our ADSs has agreed to pay you the cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on Class A\nordinary shares or other deposited securities underlying our ADSs, after deducting its fees and expenses. You will receive these\ndistributions in proportion to the number of Class A ordinary shares your ADSs represent. However, the Depositary is not responsible if\nit decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any holders of ADSs. For example, it would be unlawful to\nmake a distribution to a holder of ADSs if it consists of securities that require registration under the Securities Act but that are not\nproperly registered or distributed under an applicable exemption from registration. the Depositary may also determine that it is not\nfeasible to distribute certain property through the mail.

Information on the Company\nA.\nHistory and Development of the Company\nWe commenced our business in June 2015 as a business unit within our predecessor, Jimu Holdings Limited, formerly known as\nPintec Holdings Limited, which is a British Virgin Islands holding company. Our predecessor had launched a peer-to-peer lending\nbusiness in July 2012. We refer to this business as the Jimu business. Beginning in 2015, our predecessor started to diversify its business\nby offering various lending and wealth management solutions to business partners, financial partners and end users. It launched Dumiao,\nour lending solutions platform, in June 2015 and commenced a wealth management business by launching the Hongdian platform in\nSeptember 2015 and the Polaris platform in June 2016. In 2016, in order to focus on developing an independent technology platform that\nenables financial services as its core competency, the shareholders initiated a restructuring and reorganization of Pintec Holdings Limited\nby separating our business and the Jimu business and consolidating them into separate entities. Our holding company in the Cayman\nIslands, Pintec Technology Holdings Limited, was incorporated in March 2017.\nWe have been operating our financing solutions business separately from Jimu Group’s peer-to-peer funding business since\nJune 2015, and we have been operating our company substantially as a stand-alone company since September 2016.

We connect\nbusiness partners and financial partners on our open platform and enable them to provide financial services to end users efficiently and\neffectively. We empower our business partners by providing them with the capability to add a financing option to their product offerings.\nWe help our financial partners adapt to the new digital economy by enabling them to access the online population that they could not\notherwise reach efficiently or effectively. Further, in 2021, we commenced a new offering of technological services to small and\nmedium-sized enterprises, or the SMEs, whereby we utilize our proven “SaaS + Fintech” model as a holistic solution to accelerate the\ndigitization of SMEs, encompassing technology-based credit services and solutions to the manufacturing process and operations of these\nSMEs. Commencing from April 2022, we have not engaged new customers for our loan facilitation business, and currently we only\nprovide loan facilitation business to our existing customers. Moreover, starting from 2022, leveraging our extensive technology platform,\nstrong brand recognition as well as sound credit ratings, we have further upgraded our business model to provide loan services and\ndigital solutions to MSMEs, as a direct lender, facilitator and enabler. We will continue to deliver exceptional digitization services,\ndiversified financial products, and best-in-class solutions with innovative technology, in order to further solidify the relationships with\nour partners and satisfy the needs of our clients.\nOur Network of Partners\nWe refer to those partners who provide access to end users as our business partners, and those partners who provide financial\nproducts as our financial partners. Partners that are financial partners in one context may be business partners in another. For example, a\nfinancial service provider that provides loans to consumers through our online consumer finance platform is a financial partner in that\nrole, but the same financial service provider would also be a business partner if its customers registered on Hongdian to purchase wealth\nmanagement products.\nWe have rapidly expanded our scale and built a valuable, diverse and broad network of both business and financial partners since our\ninception to 2018. In 2019, we deepened our cooperation with certain business partners that have a large number of online visitors and\nhigh-quality end users. Our solutions combine diversity on both sides, enabling us to meet a wide range of needs and creating a strong\nnetwork effect for our business and financial partners as well as for their users. In 2020, we optimized our product matrix by focusing on\ndeveloping high-quality products with case scenarios for renowned business partners such as Ctrip and BestPay. In 2021, we expanded\nour technical services to focus on better empowering the SME ecosystem, by leveraging our advanced technology in big data, artificial\nintelligence, and cloud-based infrastructure. Specifically, we plan to utilize our “SaaS + Fintech” model as a total solution in order to\naccelerate the digitization of SMEs, encompassing technology-based credit services and solutions to the manufacturing process and\noperations of the SMEs. We believe that the optimization of our product structure has helped boost the overall quality of our partnership\nbase and further incentivized financial institutions to cooperate with us through profit-sharing partnership models. In 2022, as an\nintegrated financial service provider for the ecosystem of MSMEs, we commenced to offer small loans and derivative financial services\nto micro and small enterprises, solo entrepreneurs and individuals through our extensive offline micro and small loan network, granting\nour customers easier access to funds and improving their liquidity throughout operations."

We provide point-of-sale lending solutions to 25 business partners, including\nBestPay. In addition, we provide personal installment lending solutions to 14 business partners, including Ctrip and BestPay, and SME\nlending solutions to 19 business partners. As of December 31, 2022, we provided wealth management solutions to ten business partners,\nincluding Xiaomi.

The extent of our cooperation ranges\nfrom channel partnership and user acquisition to end-to-end full-service solutions. As the end users of our business partners may become\npotential borrowers for the loans that we facilitate, we are also very selective in choosing business partners in order to ensure our service\nquality and to optimize risks.\nOur Financial Partners\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had established cooperations with 130 financial partners, including 19 lending solutions partners, 77\nwealth management partners and 34 insurance solution partners.\nLending solutions partners\nLending solutions partners provide the funds for the loans that we facilitate. Commencing from January 31, 2021, almost all of the\nloans that we facilitated have been funded by our self-owned lending solution partners (which are our subsidiaries/consolidated affiliated\nentities).\nJimu Box, which is the online consumer finance platform operated by Jimu Group, used to be the single largest funding source for\nloans facilitated through our platform since our inception to 2018.

We have not been receiving\nany further funding from Jimu Box since February 15, 2020. Since then, we ceased cooperating with any other online consumer finance\nplatforms. For our relationship with Jimu Box and the Jimu Group in general, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—C.\nOrganizational Structure—Our Relationship with Jimu Group.”\nHistorically, a number of financial partners provided funding directly to borrowers for loans that we facilitated, including Fullerton\nCredit and Orange Finance. Financial partners providing non-structured direct funding were the funding source for 83%, 65%, and 8% of\nthe outstanding loans facilitated through our platform as of December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Ganzhou Aixin Micro\nFinance, a licensed micro finance company which we acquired from Jimu Group in March 2019, also provides financing for loans. We\nhave also entered into strategic business cooperation with Fullerton Credit, a group of micro loan companies wholly owned by Fullerton\nFinancial Holdings Pte. Ltd. As of the date of this annual report, Shanghai Anquying Technology Co., Ltd. (“Shanghai Anquying”) has\nentered into an equity transfer agreement with AF Management Services Pte. Ltd. (“AFMS”) to sell the five percent of the equity\ninterests held by Shanghai Anquying in Fullerton Credit (Chongqing) Ltd. to AFMS for a total consideration of RMB35 million.\nWe have historically worked with a variety of financial partners on trusts and other structured finance since 2017. In 2020, we\nworked with Yunnan Trust on trusts and other structured finance. The trusts are administered by third-party trust companies, and they\ninvest in personal and business installments loans that we recommend. We purchased subordinated tranches to provide credit support.\nThe financing receivables due from the borrowers of the personal and business installment loans and the loan payables to the third-party\ninvestors of the trust units were recorded on our balance sheet as financing receivables and funding debts, respectively. Trusts and other\nstructured finance were an important source of funding for us in 2018 and 2019. We ceased working with any financial partners on trusts\nand other structured finance in 2021. Commencing from May 2020, we ceased using trusts and other structured finance as the funding\nsource for the loans we facilitated."

Our partners can adopt our\nsolutions to provide financial services as a white label solution, through co-branding or under our own brands, allowing them to leverage\nour expertise while focusing on their own core businesses.\nPoint-of-sale Financing Solutions\nWe offer point-of-sale financing solutions to our business partners on their platforms or on our own platform under the “Dumiao”\nbrand.\nOur point-of-sale financing solutions enable our business partners to make installment purchase loans available to their customers.\nOur point-of-sale lending solutions facilitate the purchase of online travel products and services such as air tickets and hotel room\nreservations on travel sites such as Qunar and Ctrip, and mobile devices and services such as Best Pay provided to China Telecom’s\ncustomers. Our business partners typically integrate our lending solutions in the payment stage of a transaction, offering end users\ninstallment payment options when they satisfy our pre-screening procedures and certain criteria stipulated by our business partners. An\nend user who selects the installment payment option is guided through the application process and can use the approved credit line to\nfinance his purchase from our business partner. End users have the option to choose different combinations of terms which are agreed\nwith our business partners, and our system will automatically calculate monthly payments and service fees. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, the\ntotal volume of point-of-sale installment loans we facilitated was approximately RMB0.3 billion, RMB25.6 million, and RMB5.6 million\n(US$0.8 million), respectively. Our point-of-sale lending solutions function as a virtual credit card featuring a one-month interest free\nperiod and flexible installment terms. We believe such features are attractive to end users and enhance user experience. The weighted\naverage APR for point-of-sale installment loans outstanding more than a month was 11.5% of the principal amount in 2022. The\napplication process of point-of-sale installment loan products are easy and simple, supported by intuitive user interface.

Our personal\ninstallment loan solutions enable our business partners to make unsecured personal credit available to their customers. All loans are\nfunded by our lending solutions partners and end users access the loans through the mobile apps or websites of our business partners. We\nhelp our lending solutions partners determine the amount of the credit line for each customer based on the result of our credit assessment.\nThe initial credit line is typically between RMB500 (US$72.5) and RMB100,000 (US$14,498.6). As end users start building their credit\nhistory with us, they will gradually get access to higher credit lines and more favorable credit terms. Normally, each drawdown on the\ncredit line must be individually approved, but we can provide solutions to our lending solutions partners that permit end users to draw\ndown multiple loans without additional approval as long as the aggregate outstanding balance of the loans does not exceed the approved\ncredit limit. The loan proceeds are transferred to the user’s bank account when the loan is drawn down. We charge our financial partners\ntechnical service fees. In 2022, approximately 4,397 customers were approved for personal installment loan credit lines with an average\ncredit limit of approximately RMB10,165.0 (US$1,473.8) through solutions that we provided to lending solutions partners. The\naggregate amount of credit lines approved was RMB60.3 billion, RMB61.9 billion and RMB61.9 billion (US$9.0 billion), respectively,\nand the amount outstanding was RMB0.3 billion, RMB132.9 million and RMB3.1 million (US$0.45 million) as of December 31,\n2020,2021 and 2022, respectively.\nWe ceased facilitating offline personal installment loans in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nBusiness Installment Loan Solutions\nWe offer business installment loan solutions to our business partners on their platforms or on our own platform. Our business\ninstallment loan solutions enable our business partners to arrange financing for their customers. These business partners are typically\nonline platforms that provide goods and services to sole proprietors and to SMEs and possess significant data about their customers\nwhich can aid credit assessment. These borrowers include both online merchants and owners of traditional enterprises in various\nindustries such as manufacture, retail and wholesale, dining, transportation and other service industries. Such businesses usually have\nannual sales turnover up to RMB70 million (US$11 million). Loans are intended to be used for business purposes such as to expand\noperations, purchase inventory or meet day-to-day operational cash flow needs. The business installment loan products are unsecured and\nrepayable in installments ranging from three months to 24 months, with loan size ranging from RMB1,000 (US$157) to RMB1,000,000\n(US$156,922). Because we build our end-to-end solution and credit assessment system for business installment loans specifically to\nevaluate SME creditworthiness on the basis of our massive big data storage, an application is typically approved within 15 minutes, as\ncompared to a few days or weeks by traditional financial institutions. The total volume of business installment loans we facilitated was\napproximately RMB122.8 million, RMB76.7 million and RMB124.5 million (US$18.0 million) for the years ended December 31,\n2020,2021 and 2022, respectively."

Prior to 2020, we solicited businesses for our insurance solutions primarily through\ncross-selling among different retail credit channels. In 2020, upon strategically shifting to follow a market-oriented approach in\npromoting our insurance solutions instead of relying on cross-selling, we experienced a decline in the related revenues. However, our\nrevenues from provision of insurance solutions grew substantially in 2021 and 2022, primarily due to our continued efforts to improve\nand diversify our product offerings as well as our marketing strategies. Commencing from early 2022, we have expanded our insurance\nsolutions coverage to include insurance products such as high-end life and health insurance products as well as property and casualty\ninsurance products, and we expect such expansion to bring sustainable value growths to our businesses.

Benefiting\nfrom China’s effective epidemic control and prevention work, the spread of COVID-19 has been gradually contained. We experienced a\nhigher level of delinquency in our overall portfolio in early 2020 during the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, we were\nstill in a favorable position compared with our peers, because (i) our business comes from consumption scenarios, which makes the\noverall traffic relatively high-quality, and (ii) we were able to quickly adjust our traffic operations, customer screening and risk\nmanagement strategies in response to the outbreak.\nRisk Management Team\nWe have established strong risk management expertise with nine independent risk management functions spanning functions such as\naudit, regulatory compliance and risk management research and development. Our management team has significant experience in the\ncredit industry with expertise in risk management, fraud detection and prevention, and data analytics. We have also built risk\nmanagement-related performance metrics into our business unit and employee review procedures.\nTechnology\nThe success of our business depends on our strong technological capabilities that support us in delivering innovative and effective\nfinancial solutions to our partners, providing a seamless user experience, making accurate credit assessments, protecting information and\nincreasing our operational efficiency. Diversified data collection and aggregation and robust credit assessment through advanced\ntechnologies have strengthened our risk management capability, creating value for our business and financial partners.\nThe entire loan underwriting procedure, including application, verification, authorization, granting credit, execution of agreements,\nrelease of funds and collection of repayment, can be completed automatically without human intervention for a substantial majority of\nour loan applications. Our user-friendly interactive interface allows the user to complete the entire loan application and loan repayment\nprocess by himself. Highly optimized stream computing methods for data reporting, retrieval and indexing allow the entire loan\napplication and credit approval procedure to be completed within 10 seconds for a majority of our loan applications. Our management\nsystem provides completely automatic control and routing of application volume, data reporting and retrieval volume, indexing\ndistribution, approval amount, credit grade distribution, loan disbursement amounts and loan repayment amounts and enables the healthy\nand stable operation of the system.\nR&D Lab\nOur R&D lab is the source of our continued innovations. It not only supports our existing business and enhances our product and\nservice offerings, but also incubates new technological and business initiatives that allow us to continue to evolve. We have teams within\nthe R&D Lab working on artificial intelligence, robotic process automation, data source assessments and other projects of possible\napplication to our business.\nOur R&D lab is empowered by a team of experienced engineers dedicated to research and development. As of December 31, 2022,\nwe had 14 technology employees, representing approximately 16.9% of our total employees. Our engineers are based in our headquarters\nin Beijing and our offices in Shanghai. We recruit most of our engineers from prestigious universities and hire experienced laterals from\nwell-established internet and software companies. We compete aggressively for engineering talent to help us address challenges and\nmaintain our technology advantages over our competitors. We have continued to invest significantly in research and development. In\n2022, we incurred RMB16.0 million (US$2.3 million) in research and development expenses, primarily consisting of salaries and\nbenefits (including share-based compensation) for our research and development team."

Data Lake is a dynamic data pool that is constantly evolving with increasing credit bureau data, transactional\ndata, behavioral data, social data and demographic data accumulated on our platforms and additional data accessed from third parties.\nOur extensive database has over 10,000 variables for users, covering a wide range of information pertinent to a user’s creditworthiness.\nBy tapping into the ecosystems of our partners, we have accumulated a large amount of data that has been authorized and released by\nusers. We also source, aggregate, process and analyze voluminous structured and unstructured data from over 50 internal and external\ndata sources in multiple formats, including credit assessment agencies, payment companies, e-commerce platforms and mobile carriers.\nOur strong data-mining capabilities also enable us to collect a large amount of data concerning prospective customers. We apply big\ndata analytics and machine learning to the entire value chain of consumer finance, from credit decision to payment channel to collection\nservices. Leveraging our research and development team, we have developed a number of proprietary automated programs that are\ncapable of searching, aggregating and processing massive amounts of data from the internet in a short period of time. New analytical\nmethods allow us to process these large amounts of untapped data, for example through statistical modelling of past behaviors and\npatterns.\nWe value data privacy of users and have stringent data protection and retention policies. We do not share end users’ data with third\nparties without end users’ prior consent.\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\nTechnology has revolutionized the way that financial services are provided, particularly through the application of advanced\nartificial intelligence. We apply our artificial intelligence technology in multiple areas, such as fraud detection, credit risk pricing and\nasset allocation, which leads to improved operational efficiencies and enables us to provide significant value to our partners.\nWe have integrated a variety of advanced analytical and modelling techniques into our risk management and credit assessment\nsystems by applying artificial intelligence, including machine learning. For example, we make use of social network analysis techniques\nto discover connections between loan applicants and known or suspected fraud rings and leverage the special characteristics of social\nnetworks in our anti-fraud and risk management models to reduce the rate of fraud. We have constructed a real-time online dynamic risk\nmodelling system which, unlike traditional credit score card technology, is able to implement continual updates to our automated models\nbased on the newest risk metrics, and at the same time implement mechanical learning algorithms online, and based on the real-time\nresults of the model, automatically distribute application volume and ensure the stability and highly efficient operation of the model, and\ntimely and reliably control risk. Building on our modelling technology, we carry out automatic clustering based on differences in the\nuser’s personal characteristics, and we use different collections of characteristics between clusters to construct mechanical learning\nmodels to determine user risk and greatly raise the predictive power of the risk management model.\nThe robo-advisory services for our wealth management solutions are also based on machine learning technologies. We adopt modern\nportfolio theory as the main allocation methodology and use a supervised learning method to estimate market return. Machine learning\nregression algorithms are used to forecast future prices and therefore market return within a defined time period, while market condition\nclassification algorithms classify the market along a spectrum of bullishness and bearishness. Market risk is measured by an estimated\ncovariance matrix. Our algorithms link investor characteristics including risk preference, life cycle stage, and source of income to\ninvestment constraints for true personalization. Rebalancing decisions are made dynamically as inputs change.\nOur Cloud-based Infrastructure\nWe depend on cloud-based services for computing power for our customer-facing systems and services. Cloud-based technology\nallows us to process large amounts of complicated data in-house, which significantly reduces cost and improves operational efficiency.\nOur business is growing at a tremendous pace and we need to scale up services to fit our needs and customize the applications that we\nuse. Our cloud-based services allow us to maintain flexibility in managing our IT resources with improved manageability and less\nmaintenance, so that we can more rapidly adjust resources to meet any fluctuating or unpredictable business demand."

We also maintain a real-time backup system in a leased facility where we host most of our hardware, and a remote\nbackup system at a separate facility. Our IT department monitors the performance of our websites, technology systems and network\ninfrastructure to enable us to respond promptly to potential problems. We also continuously review, improve and iterate our data privacy\npolicies and security foundation.\nAs of the date of this annual report, we have not received any claim from any third party against us on the ground of infringement of\nsuch party’s right to data protection as provided by applicable laws and regulations in China and other jurisdictions, and we have not\nexperienced any material data loss or breach incidents."

In October 2017, we formed a joint venture named PIVOT Fintech Pte. Ltd. together with FWD Group and certain angel\ninvestors to provide robo-advisory services in Southeast Asia. In April 2018, we formed a joint venture named Avatec.ai (S) Pte. Ltd.\ntogether with United Overseas Bank Limited to offer credit services and solutions primarily in Southeast Asian countries. In addition, we\nset up Pintec Solutions Pte. Ltd. in Singapore in November 2018 as the international headquarters for our international business\ndevelopment. In April 2019, we acquired Infrarisk Pty Limited, an Australia-based SaaS company providing systems to lenders for\nmanaging the credit risk origination process. In 2020, we established a new portfolio of Fintechs, including Wagepay and Janko Loans, to\nprovide automated credit service in Australia while leveraging open banking technologies. This move further validates that our lending\ntechnology stack is applicable to a wide variety of international markets. Furthermore, the Overseas Finance business unit was\nestablished to devise a holistic strategy to extend our financing service offerings globally. In September 2021, we disposed 85.0% of our\nequity interests in FT Synergy Pte. Ltd. (formerly known as Pintec Solutions Pte. Ltd.), while retaining the remaining 15.0%. In\nDecember 2021, we established a wholly-owned subsidiary Pintec Australia Pty Ltd (“Pintec Australia”) in Australia, which holds 50.0%\nof equity interests in Wagepay Pty Ltd, 50.0% of equity interests in Janko Loans Pty Ltd, 15.6% of equity interests in Leasgo Pty Ltd and\n100.0% of equity interests in Suppy Pty Ltd. In May 2022, we approved the deconsolidation of Pintec Australia through the disposal of\nits 100% equity interest to recoup certain expenses incurred in relation to Pintec Australia and therefore eliminate its negative financial\nimpacts on the Company. We expect to provide individuals and small businesses with timely access to low-cost credit through AI, data\nand automation technologies.\nCompetition\nConsumer finance, wealth management and insurance are emerging industries in China. We enable our business and financial\npartners to provide innovative consumer finance, wealth management and insurance services to their customers. With respect to\nconsumer finance enablement, OneConnect shares a similar business model with us where it provides technology enablement services to\nbusiness partners and financial partners, and we compete with respect to acquiring partners and customers. Some independent platforms\nalso provide such enablement services to partners as one segment of their business. With respect to wealth management and robo-\nadvisory enablement, we compete with companies such as Yingmi.cn. We also compete across consumer finance, wealth management\nand insurance with platforms affiliated with major internet companies and business ecosystems in China, such as Lexin, 360 DigiTech\nand QuantGroup. In addition, our business and financial partners may develop their own in-house capabilities that compete with the\nservices we currently provide. Some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product or service offerings and greater\nfinancial resources to support their spending on sales and marketing. We believe that our ability to compete effectively for business\npartners, financial partners and end users depends on many factors, including the variety of our modules and solutions, the diversity of\nour products, user experience with our solutions, the effectiveness of our risk management and the strength the partnership with our\nfinancial and business partners.\nFurthermore, as our business continues to grow rapidly, we face significant competition for highly skilled personnel, including\nmanagement, engineers, product managers and risk management personnel. The success of our growth strategy depends in part on our\nability to retain existing personnel and add additional highly skilled employees.\nIntellectual Property\nWe seek to protect our proprietary technology, including our risk management technologies and technology infrastructure, through a\ncombination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure by confidentiality and non-compete\nagreements. We have applied for five patents and have registered 48 copyrights with the PRC National Copyright Administration. We\nhave eight registered domain names that are currently used in our business and operations, including pintec.com, idumiao.com,\nixuanji.com and hongdianfund.com.

      "text": "Table of Contents\n93\nRegulations Relating to Insurance Brokerage\nThe primary regulation governing insurance intermediary services is the PRC Insurance Law, originally enacted in 1995. According\nto the PRC Insurance Law, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (which was integrated into the CBIRC with other governmental\ndepartments in April 2018) is the regulatory authority responsible for the supervision and administration of the PRC insurance companies\nand the intermediaries in the insurance sector, including insurance agencies and brokers.\nThe principal regulations governing insurance brokerage are the Provisions on the Supervision and Administration of Insurance\nBrokers, promulgated by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission in February 2018. According to these regulations, an insurance\nbroker refers to an entity that receives commissions for providing intermediary services to policyholders and insurance companies to\nfacilitate their entering into insurance contracts. An insurance broker established in China must meet the qualification requirements\nspecified by the CBIRC and obtain a license from the CBIRC or its local branches to operate insurance brokerage business.\nOn March 12, 2002, the Circular of China Insurance Regulatory Commission on Distributing the Contents Related to Insurance\nIndustry in the Legal Documents of China’s Accession to WTO, or the Circular 12, became effective and provided that foreign\nshareholders of a Chinese insurance broker shall (i) be foreign insurance brokers with more than 30 years of experience in establishing\ncommercial institutions in WTO member countries; (ii) have established a representative office in China for two successive years; and\n(iii) have total assets of more than US$200 million at the end of the year preceding the investment application in a Chinese brokerage\nbusiness. On October 30, 2019, the Opinions of the State Council on Furthering Effective Use of Foreign Capital was promulgated,\nwhich became effective the same day. The State Council presented several opinions to further the effective use of foreign capital,\nincluding canceling the years of business operation and the total assets requirements for foreign insurance brokerage institutions to\noperate insurance brokerage business. According to the Service Guide for the Establishment and Examination and Approval of Insurance\nBrokers, published by the CBIRC in September 2021, foreign shareholders of a Chinese Insurance Broker shall be (i) foreign insurance\nbrokers with more than 30 years of experience in establishing commercial institutions in WTO member countries; and (ii) have total\nassets of more than US$200 million at the end of the year preceding the investment application in a Chinese brokerage business.\nHowever, on December 3, 2021, the Notice of the CBIRC General Office on Clarifying Relevant Measures for the Opening up of the\nInsurance Intermediary Market was released and provided that overseas insurance brokerage companies with actual business experience\nand complying with the relevant provisions of the CBIRC are allowed to invest in and establish insurance brokerage companies in China\nto engage in insurance brokerage business. The relevant requirements that an investor that intends to establish a foreign-funded insurance\nbrokerage company in China shall have more than 30 years of business experience in any WTO member country, have established a\nrepresentative office in China for two consecutive years and have total assets of not less than US $200 million in the year prior to the\napplication as prescribed in the Circular 12 shall no longer be implemented.\nOn December 26, 2022, the CBIRC issued the Administrative Measures for the Protection of Consumers’ Rights and Interests by\nBanking and Insurance Institutions, or the Administrative Measures, which became effective on March 1, 2023. The Administrative\nMeasures require banking and insurance institutions to establish and improve systems and mechanisms for the protection of consumer’s\nrights and interests, including mechanisms for review, disclosure, consumer appropriateness management, traceability of sales practices,\nprotection of consumers’ information, list-based management of the partners, complaint handling, diversified resolution of conflicts and\ndisputes, internal training, internal assessment and internal audit. The Administrative Measures also specify the following consumers’\nrights that the banking and insurance institutions shall protect: (i) right to know; (ii) right to choices on their own; (iii) right to a fair\ntransaction; (iv) right to property safety; (v) right to lawful claim; (vi) right to education; (vii) right to respect; and (viii) right to\ninformation security. Further, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission and its local offices may take regulatory\nmeasures against the institutions if any issue regarding consumer protection was found and may impose administrative penalties in case\nof violation of the Administrative Measures.\nThe subsidiary of one of our variable interest entities, Beijing Myfin, has obtained a license for insurance brokerage from the Beijing\nBureau of the CBIRC and is thus qualified to conduct an insurance brokerage business within the territory of the PRC. Such license will\nremain valid until June 2025."

A member institution of the Asset\nManagement Association of China which has registered with the CSRC and obtained a license for a publicly raised securities investment\nfund sales business can be entrusted by managers of privately raised investment funds to raise privately raised investment funds.\n“Raising” refers to the promotion, sale, purchase and redemption of privately raised investment fund units and other related activities.\nOn March 28, 2018, the Office of the Leading Group for the Special Rectification for Internet Financial Risks issued the Notice on\nStrengthening the Rectification and Conducting Review and Acceptance of Asset Management Business Conducted through the Internet,\nalso known as Circular 29. Circular 29 emphasized that an asset management business conducted through the internet is subject to the\noversight of financial regulatory authorities and the relevant licensing requirements. Any public issuance or sales of asset management\nproducts through the internet would be deemed to be a financing business and the relevant asset management licenses or permits would\nbe required to conduct such a business. Internet asset management platforms are not allowed to publicly raise funds through “directed\ncommission plans”, “directed financing plans”, “wealth management plans”, “asset management plans”, “credit asset transfers” or\nsimilar products, or to act as an agent for any types of trading exchanges to sell asset management products.\nIn addition, the securities regulatory bureaus of Beijing has issued the Circular of Regulating Fund Investment Recommendation\nActivities, or the Recommendation Circular, in 2021, which requires that a fund sales agency shall not provide any investment\nrecommendations for fund portfolio strategies without the fund investment advisory licenses. The Recommendation Circular further\nprohibits institutions from developing new business of making recommendations for fund portfolio strategies in violation of the\nrequirements of the Pilot Notice. Specifically, they shall not display or launch new fund portfolio strategies, provide existing fund\nportfolio strategies to new clients, or allow existing clients to make additional fund portfolio strategy investments. Moreover, the\nRecommendation Circular sets different rectification timelines for institutions with and without fund investment advisory licenses."

The\nAdministrative Measures on Telecommunications Business Operating Licenses, promulgated by the MIIT in 2009 and most recently\namended in 2017, set forth more specific provisions regarding the types of licenses required to operate value-added telecommunications\nservices, the qualifications and procedures for obtaining such licenses and the administration and supervision of such licenses. Under\nthese regulations, a commercial operator of value-added telecommunications services must obtain a value-added telecommunications\nservice license from the MIIT or its provincial level counterparts.\nAccording to the Provisions on the Administration of Foreign-Invested Telecommunications Enterprises, originally issued by the\nState Council in 2001 and amended in 2016, foreign-invested value-added telecommunications enterprises must be in the form of sino-\nforeign equity joint ventures. The regulations restrict the ultimate capital contribution percentage held by foreign investors in a foreign-\ninvested value-added telecommunications enterprise to 50% or less and require the primary foreign investor in a foreign-invested value-\nadded telecommunications enterprise to have a good track record and operational experience in the value-added telecommunications\nindustry. Furthermore, on March 29, 2022, the State Council issued the Decision of the State Council to Amend and Repeal Certain\nAdministrative Regulations, effective on May 1, 2022, which amended the Administration of Foreign-Invested Telecommunications\nEnterprises issued in 2001. According to the currently effective rules, foreign investors who are involved in a business providing value-\nadded telecommunications will no longer be subject to the requirement to have a good track record and operational experience in the\nvalue-added telecommunications industry. In addition, the amended rules simplify the application process for telecommunication\nbusiness operation permits and shorten the review period.\nIn 2006, the Ministry of Information Industry (which was integrated into the MIIT with other governmental departments in 2008)\nissued the Notice of the Ministry of Information Industry on Strengthening the Administration over Foreign Investment in the Operation\nof Value-Added Telecommunications Business.

These\nregulations were enacted to regulate mobile application information services and application distribution services which engage in\nInternet application stores and others. Application providers and application distribution platforms are required to obtain relevant\nqualifications pursuant to PRC laws and regulations. The amended provisions also outline the requirements for application providers,\nwhich include, among others, (i) verifying user identity information; (ii) obtaining an internet news and information services license or\nother administrative licenses for information services; and (iii) establishing a mechanism for examining the content of the information. In\nparticular, the amended provisions stipulate the obligations in relation to cyber security, data security and personal information\nprotection, emphasizing the necessity for personal information collection and that users shall not be denied the use of the basic function\nservices of certain applications merely on account of their refusal to provide unnecessary personal information.\nOur Dumiao platform, which are operated by Shanghai Anquying Technology Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of one of our variable interest\nentities, may be required to obtain a telecommunication service license for our mobile applications in accordance with the Regulations\nfor Administration of Mobile Internet Application Information Services and other relevant laws and regulations.See “Item 3. Key\nInformation—D. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We may be required to obtain value-added telecommunication service\nlicenses by the PRC regulatory authorities.”\nRegulations Relating to Loan Interest\nThe Civil Code of PRC, which was promulgated by the National People’s Congress in May 2020 and became effective in\nJanuary 2021, requires that the interest rates charged under a loan agreement must not violate applicable provisions of the PRC laws and\nregulations. In addition, under the Civil Code of PRC, the interest shall not be deducted from the proceeds of the loan in advance; and if\nthe interest is deducted from the proceeds in advance, the loan shall be repaid and the interest shall be calculated based on the actual loan\namount.\nIn accordance with the Provisions on Several Issues Concerning Laws Applicable to Trials of Private Lending Cases issued by the\nSupreme People’s Court in August 2015 and effective in September 2015, or the 2015 Private Lending Judicial Interpretations,\nagreements between a lender and a borrower on loans with annual interest rates below 24% are valid and enforceable. With respect to\nloans with annual interest rates between 24% and 36%, if the interest on the loans has already been paid to the lender, and so long as such\npayment has not damaged the interest of the state, the community or any third parties, the courts will likely turn down the borrower’s\nrequest to demand the return of the interest payment. If the annual interest rate of a private loan is higher than 36%, the obligations to pay\ninterest payment in excess of the maximum interest rate allowed will be invalidated.\nIn December 2020, the Supreme People’s Court issued the Decision on Amending the Provisions of the Supreme People’s Court on\nSeveral Issues the Application of Law in the Trial of Private Lending Cases (second revisions in the year of 2020), or the Private Lending\nJudicial Interpretation Amendment, which amended several provisions of the 2015 Private Lending Judicial Interpretation including the\nupper limit of judicial protection for private lending interest rates. The Private Lending Judicial Interpretation Amendment provides that\nwhere the lender requests the borrower to pay interest in accordance with the interest rate agreed upon in the agreement, the people’s\ncourt shall support such request, except where the interest rate agreed by both parties exceeds four times of the LPR at the time of the\nestablishment of the agreement, or the Quadruple LPR Limit. The one-year Loan Prime Rate refers to the one-year loan market quoted\ninterest rate issued by the National Bank Interbank Funding Center which was authorized by the People’s Bank of China, on the 20th of\neach month since August 20, 2019. According to the Private Lending Judicial Interpretation Amendment, the upper limit of interest rates\nof 24% and 36% provided in the 2015 Private Lending Judicial Interpretation, are replaced by the Quadruple LPR Limit. Moreover, if the\nlender and the borrower agree on both the overdue interest rate and the liquidated damages or other fees, the lender may choose to claim\nany or all of them, but the portion in total exceeding the Quadruple LPR Limit shall not be supported by the people’s court.\nIn addition, the Supreme People’s Court issued the Official Reply to Issues on the Application of the Interpretations of the Supreme\nPeople’s Court of New Private Lending, or the Official Reply on the Application of Interpretations of New Private Lending, in\nDecember 2020, which became effective in January 2021. The Official Reply on the Application of Interpretations of New Private\nLending confirms that any disputes arising from the relevant financial business conducted by the microcredit companies, financing\nguarantee companies, regional equity market, pawn enterprises, financial leasing companies, business factoring companies and local\nassets management companies that are supervised by the local financial supervision governmental authorities, shall not apply to the\nInterpretations of the Supreme People’s Court of New Private Lending."

Announcement No.3 requires all loan products to list their annualized interest rates expressly.\nSpecifically, (i) all lending institutions are required to display the annualized rate of each loan product prominently on the website,\nmobile app, poster, and any other channels where the product is marketed, and specify the annualized rate in the loan contract. Daily\nand monthly interest rates may also be displayed if necessary, but not more prominently than the annualized interest rates; (ii) lending\ninstitutions include but are not limited to depository financial institutions, automobile finance companies, consumer finance companies,\nmicro-lending companies, and internet platforms that advertise or display loan services; (iii) the annualized rate of a loan should be\ncalculated as the annualized ratio of total costs (to the borrower) to the outstanding principal amount. The costs include interest and other\nfees and charges directly related to the loan. The amount of principal should be specified in the loan contract or other loan certificates. If\nthe loan is repaid in installments, the outstanding principal amount should be the balance after each repayment; and (iv) the calculation of\nthe annualized interest rate may be based on compound interest or simple interest. The calculation based on compound interest is\nequivalent to that of the internal rate of return, and the simple-interest approach should be specified as such.\nRegulations Relating to Cooperation with Institutional Funding Partners\nThe PRC laws and regulations governing our cooperation with institutional funding partners are developing and evolving.\nIn December 2017, the National Internet Finance Rectification Office and the National Online Lending Rectification Office jointly\nissued the Circular 141, outlining the general features and the principal requirements on “cash loan” businesses conducted by internet\nmicro finance companies, banking financial institutions and online lending information intermediaries. “Cash loans” are generally\ndescribed as a loan that is unrelated to the circumstances of its use, with no designated use for the loan proceeds, no qualification\nrequirement for the borrower and no collateral for the loan. The definition of a cash loan under Circular 141 is vague and subject to\nfurther regulatory interpretation. The principal requirements with respect to “cash loan” businesses are (i) no organizations or individuals\nmay conduct a lending business without obtaining approvals for the lending business; (ii) the annualized all-in borrowing costs to\nborrowers charged in the form of interest and various fees are subject to the limit on interest rate for private lending as set forth in the\nProvisions on Several Issues Concerning Laws Applicable to Trials of Private Lending Cases issued by the Supreme People’s Court in\n2015; (iii) all relevant institutions shall follow the “know-your-customer” principle to assess and determine the borrower’s eligibility,\ncredit limit, and cooling-off period with prudence, and a loan to a borrower without any source of income is prohibited; (iv) all relevant\ninstitutions shall improve their internal risk control and use a data-driven risk management model with prudence; and (v) relevant\ninstitutions and their third-party collection service providers may only use lawful means of collection, and shall not use illegal or\ninappropriate means of collection such as threats, intimidation or harassment. With respect to internet micro finance companies, Circular\n141 requires the regulatory authorities to suspend the approval of the establishment of internet micro finance companies and the approval\nof any micro finance business across provincial lines. Circular 141 also specifies that internet micro finance companies may not provide\ncampus loans, and should suspend the funding of internet micro loans unrelated to the circumstances of their use, gradually reduce the\nvolume of the existing business relating to such loans and take rectification measures within a given period. Further requirements on\ninternet micro finance companies will be detailed in a rectification implementation plan that is to be issued by the national financial\nregulator. Circular 141 also sets forth several requirements on the banking financial institutions participating in “cash loan” businesses,\nincluding that: (i) extension of loans jointly with any third-party institution that have not obtained approvals for the lending business, or\nfunding to such institutions for the purpose of extending loans in any form, is prohibited; (ii) with respect to a loan business conducted in\ncooperation with a third-party institution, outsourcing of the core business (including the credit assessment and risk control) is\nprohibited, and any credit enhancement service whether or not in disguised form (including the commitment to bear the risk of default)\nprovided by any third-party institutions with no guarantee qualification shall be prohibited, and (iii) such banking financial institutions\nmust require and ensure that the third-party institutions shall not collect any interests or fees from the borrowers. In addition, Circular\n141 emphasizes several requirements applicable to online lending information intermediaries. For example, it is prohibited to facilitate\nany loans to students or other persons without repayment source or repayment capacity, or loans with no designated use of proceeds. Also\nit is not permitted to charge upfront fees to the borrowers. Any violation of Circular 141 may result in a variety of penalties, including\nsanctions, rectification and revocation of license, an order to cease business operation, and criminal liabilities."

The guidelines prohibit certain monopolistic conducts of internet platforms to protect market competition, safeguard\ninterests of users and operators who participate in internet platform economics, including without limitation, prohibiting platforms with\ndominant position from abusing their market dominance (such as discriminating customers in terms of pricing and other transactional\nconditions using big data and analytics, coercing counterparties into exclusivity arrangements, using technology methods to block\ncompetitors’ interface, tying or attaching unreasonable trading conditions, compulsory collection of unnecessary user data). In addition,\nthe guidelines also reinforce the requirement of antitrust merger review for internet platform related transactions to safeguard market\ncompetition.\nRegulations Relating to Internet Information Security and Privacy Protection\nInternet information in China is regulated from a national security standpoint. The Decisions on Preserving Internet Security,\noriginally enacted by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress in 2000, subject violators to potential criminal\npunishment in China for any effort to: (i) gain improper entry into a computer or system of strategic importance, (ii) disseminate\npolitically disruptive information, (iii) leak state secrets, (iv) spread false commercial information or (v) infringe intellectual property\nrights. The Ministry of Public Security has promulgated measures that prohibit the use of the internet in ways which, among other things,\nresult in a leak of state secrets or a spread of socially destabilizing content. If an internet information service provider violates these\nmeasures, the Ministry of Public Security and its local branches may revoke its operating license and shut down its websites.\nIn recent years, PRC government authorities have enacted laws and regulations on internet use to protect personal information from\nany unauthorized disclosure. Under the Several Provisions on Regulating the Market Order of Internet Information Services, which was\nissued by the MIIT and became effective in 2012, an internet information service provider may not collect any user personal information\nor provide any such information to third parties without the consent of the user. An internet information service provider must expressly\ninform the users of the method, content and purpose of the collection and processing of such users’ personal information and may only\ncollect such information necessary for the provision of its services. An internet information service provider is also required to properly\nmaintain the user personal information, and in case of any leak or likely leak of the user’s personal information, the internet information\nservice provider must take immediate remedial measures and, in severe circumstances, immediately report to the telecommunications\nauthority. In addition, pursuant to the Decision on Strengthening the Protection of Online Information issued by the Standing Committee\nof the National People’s Congress in 2012 and the Order for the Protection of Telecommunication and Internet User Personal Information\nissued by the MIIT in 2013, any collection and use of user personal information must be subject to the consent of the user, abide by the\nprinciples of legality, rationality and necessity and be within the specified purposes, methods and scopes. An internet information service\nprovider must also keep such information strictly confidential, and is further prohibited from divulging, tampering or destroying any such\ninformation, or selling or providing such information to other parties. An internet information service provider is required to take\ntechnical and other measures to prevent the collected personal information from any unauthorized disclosure, damage or loss. Any\nviolation of these laws and regulations may subject the internet information service provider to warnings, fines, confiscation of illegal\ngains, revocation of licenses, cancellation of filings, closedown of websites or even criminal liabilities.\nMoreover, pursuant to the Ninth Amendment to the Criminal Law issued by the Standing Committee of the National People’s\nCongress in August 2015, any internet service provider that fails to fulfill the obligations related to internet information security\nadministration as required by applicable laws and refuses to rectify upon orders, shall be subject to criminal penalty for (i) any\ndissemination of illegal information on a large scale, (ii) any severe effects due to the leakage of the client’s information, (iii) any serious\nloss of criminal evidence or (iv) any other severe situation arising from a violation of the applicable laws or regulations. Any individual\nor entity that sells or provides personal information to others in violation of applicable law, or that steals or illegally obtains any personal\ninformation, is subject to criminal penalties in severe situations. In addition, the Interpretations of the Supreme People’s Court and the\nSupreme People’s Procuratorate of the PRC on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Handling Criminal Cases of\nInfringing Personal Information, issued in May 2017 and effective in June 2017, clarified certain standards for the conviction and\nsentencing of criminals in relation to personal information infringement.\nIn November 2016, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress released the Internet Security Law, which took effect\nin June 2017. The Internet Security Law requires network operators to perform certain functions related to internet security protection\nand the strengthening of network information management. For instance, under the Internet Security Law, network operators of key\ninformation infrastructure generally shall, during their operations in the PRC, store the personal information and important data collected\nand produced within the territory of the PRC."

The Trademark Office of the State Administration for Industry & Commerce is responsible for the registration and\nadministration of trademarks throughout the PRC. The Trademark Law has adopted a “first-to-file” principle with respect to trademark\nregistration. In addition, on January 13, 2023, the China National Intellectual Property Administration, or the CNIPA, issued the Draft\nRevision to the Trademark Law of the People’s Republic of China, or the Draft of Trademark Law, for public comments. The Draft of\nTrademark Law stipulate that: (i) an application for registration is applied may not be identical to a prior trademark for the same kind of\ncommodity that the applicant has applied for earlier, has been registered, or has been deregistered, revoked or invalidated by public\nnotice within one year before the date of application; (ii) Applicants shall not apply for trademark registration in bad faith; (iii) A\ntrademark registrant shall, within the 12-month period from expiry of every five-year period with effect from the date of approval of\ntrademark registration, explain to the CNIPA the use of the said trademark on the approved commodities or a proper reason for non-use\nof the said trademark.\nDomain Name.

These measures have adopted a “first-to-file” principle with respect to the registration of domain\nnames.\nRegulations Relating to Tax\nEnterprise Income Tax\nEnterprise income tax is calculated based on taxable income, which is determined under the Enterprise Income Tax Law,\npromulgated by the National People’s Congress and implemented in 2008, and the implementation rules promulgated by the State\nCouncil and implemented at the same time. The Enterprise Income Tax Law was further amended in February 2017 and again in\nDecember 2018 and the implementation rules to the Enterprise Income Tax Law were amended in April 2019. The Enterprise Income\nTax Law imposes a uniform enterprise income tax rate of 25% on all resident enterprises in the PRC, including both foreign-invested\nenterprises and domestic enterprises, unless they qualify for certain exceptions. The income tax rate of an enterprise that has been\ndetermined to be a high and new technology enterprise may be reduced to 15% with the approval of relevant tax authorities. Sky City\nBeijing is qualified as a “high and new technology enterprise” under the Enterprise Income Tax Law and is eligible for a preferential\nenterprise income tax rate of 15% from 2022 to 2024, so long as it obtains approval from the relevant tax authority.\nIn addition, enterprises registered in countries or regions outside the PRC which have their “de facto management bodies” located\ninside the PRC may be considered PRC resident enterprises and therefore be subject to enterprise income tax in the PRC at the rate of\n25% on their worldwide income. The implementation rules of the Enterprise Income Tax Law define “de facto management bodies” as\n“establishments that carry out substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations,\npersonnel, accounting, properties, etc. of an enterprise.” However, the only detailed guidance currently available for the definition of “de\nfacto management body” as well as the determination and administration of tax residency status of offshore-incorporated enterprises is\nset forth in the Notice Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Overseas Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident\nEnterprises on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies, or Circular 82, originally promulgated by the State Administration of Taxation\nin 2009, and the Administrative Measures for Enterprise Income Tax of Chinese-Controlled Overseas Incorporated Resident Enterprises\n(Trial Version), or Bulletin No. 45, originally issued by the State Administration of Taxation in 2011. Circular 82 and Bulletin No. 45\nprovide guidance on the administration as well as determination of the tax residency status of a Chinese-controlled offshore-incorporated\nenterprise, defined as an enterprise that is incorporated under the law of a foreign country or territory and that has a PRC company or\nPRC corporate group as its primary controlling shareholder.\nAccording to Circular 82, a Chinese-controlled offshore-incorporated enterprise will be regarded as a PRC resident enterprise by\nvirtue of having its “de facto management body” in China and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its global income only if\nall of the following conditions are met:\n·\nthe primary location of the day-to-day operational management and the places where the “de facto management bodies”\nperform their duties are in the PRC;\n·\ndecisions relating to the enterprise’s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval of\norganizations or personnel in the PRC;"

It also\nspecifies that when provided with a copy of Recognition of Residential Status from a resident Chinese-controlled offshore-incorporated\nenterprise, a payer does not need to withhold income tax when paying certain PRC-sourced income such as dividends, interest and\nroyalties to such Chinese-controlled offshore-incorporated enterprise.\nIncome Tax for Share Transfers\nAccording to the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Several Issues Concerning the Enterprise Income Tax on\nIndirect Property Transfer by Non-Resident Enterprises, or Circular 7, promulgated by the State Administration of Taxation in 2015 and\namended in 2017, if a non-resident enterprise transfers the equity interests of a PRC resident enterprise indirectly by transfer of the\nequity interests of an offshore holding company (other than a purchase and sale of shares issued by a PRC resident enterprise in a public\nsecurities market) without a reasonable commercial purpose, the PRC tax authorities have the power to reassess the nature of the\ntransaction and the indirect equity transfer will be treated as a direct transfer. As a result, the gain derived from such transfer, which\nmeans the equity transfer price less the cost of equity, will be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10%. Under the terms of\nCircular 7, a transfer which meets all of the following circumstances shall be directly deemed as having no reasonable commercial\npurposes: (i) over 75% of the value of the equity interests of the offshore holding company are directly or indirectly derived from PRC\ntaxable properties; (ii) at any time during the year before the indirect transfer, over 90% of the total properties of the offshore holding\ncompany are investments within PRC territory, or in the year before the indirect transfer, over 90% of the offshore holding company’s\nrevenue is directly or indirectly derived from PRC territory; (iii) the function performed and risks assumed by the offshore holding\ncompany are insufficient to substantiate its corporate existence; and (iv) the foreign income tax imposed on the indirect transfer is lower\nthan the PRC tax imposed on the direct transfer of the PRC taxable properties.\nThere is uncertainty as to the application of Circular 7. Circular 7 may be determined by the PRC tax authorities to be applicable to\nour prior private equity financing transactions that involved non-resident investors, if any of such transactions is determined by the tax\nauthorities to lack reasonable commercial purpose. As a result, we and our non-resident investors in such transactions may be at risk of\nbeing taxed under Circular 7."

Pursuant to the\nArrangement between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax\nEvasion on Income, the withholding tax rate in respect to the payment of dividends by a PRC enterprise to a Hong Kong enterprise,\nwhich is the beneficial owner of such dividends, is reduced to 5% from a standard rate of 10% if the Hong Kong enterprise directly holds\nat least 25% share ownership in the PRC enterprise. Pursuant to the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on the Issues\nconcerning the Application of the Dividend Clauses of Tax Agreements, or Circular 81, promulgated by the State Administration of\nTaxation in 2009, a Hong Kong resident enterprise, which is the beneficial owner of applicable dividends, must meet the following\nconditions, among others, in order to enjoy the reduced withholding tax: (i) it must be a company as provided in the tax treaty, (ii) it must\ndirectly own the required percentage of equity interests and voting rights in the PRC resident enterprise and (iii) it must have directly\nowned such percentage in the PRC resident enterprise throughout the 12 months prior to receiving the dividends. The Administrative\nMeasures for Non-Resident Taxpayers to Enjoy Treatments under Tax Treaties, also known as Circular 60, promulgated by the State\nAdministration of Taxation in 2015 and amended in June 2018, provides that non-resident enterprises are not required to obtain pre-\napproval from the relevant tax authority in order to enjoy the reduced withholding tax rate. Instead, non-resident enterprises and their\nwithholding agents may, by self-assessment and on confirmation that the prescribed criteria to enjoy the tax treaty benefits are met,\ndirectly apply the reduced withholding tax rate, and file necessary forms and supporting documents when performing tax filings, which\nwill be subject to post-tax filing examinations by the relevant tax authorities.\nIn February 2018, the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Notice on Issues Related to the “Beneficial Owner” in Tax\nTreaties, according to which, when determining the applicant’s status as the “beneficial owner”, as stipulated in the Arrangement between\nMainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion on Income\nand Circular 81, regarding tax treatment in connection with dividends in the tax treaties, several factors will be taken into account,\nincluding whether the applicant is obligated to pay more than 50% of its income in twelve months to residents in a third country or\nregion, whether the business operated by the applicant constitutes the actual business activities, and whether the counterparty country or\nregion to the tax treaties does not levy any tax or grants a tax exemption on the relevant income or levies tax at an extremely low rate,\nand the tax treatment will be analyzed according to the actual circumstances of the specific cases. In October 2019, the State\nAdministration of Taxation promulgated the Administrative Measures for Non-Resident Taxpayers to Enjoy Treatment under Tax\nTreaties, or Circular 35, which became effective as of January 1, 2020 and superseded Circular 60 on the same date. In contrast to\nCircular 60, Circular 35 provides that where non-resident taxpayers determine on their own that they meet the conditions for enjoying the\ntreatment under tax treaties, they may automatically enjoy such treatment when filing tax returns or filing tax returns for tax withheld by\nwithholding agents, provided that they collect and retain relevant materials for reference, subject to further determination by the tax\nauthorities.\nAccordingly, Sky City Hong Kong Limited and Next Hop Hong Kong Limited, our wholly owned subsidiaries in Hong Kong, may\nbe able to enjoy the 5% withholding tax rate for the dividends they receive respectively from Pintec (Ganzhou) Technology Co., Ltd. and\nAnxunying (Tianjin) Commercial Factoring, their wholly-owned subsidiaries in China, if they satisfy the conditions prescribed under\nCircular 81, the Notice on Issues Related to the “Beneficial Owner” in Tax Treaties, the Arrangement between Mainland China and the\nHong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion on Income and other relevant tax\nrules and regulations. However, according to Circular 81, if the relevant tax authorities consider the transactions or arrangements we\nhave are for the primary purpose of enjoying a favorable tax treatment, the relevant tax authorities may adjust the favorable withholding\ntax in the future.\nRegulations Relating to Foreign Currency Exchange\nForeign Currency Exchange\nThe principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Regulations of the People’s Republic of China on\nForeign Exchange Control, originally promulgated by the State Council in 1996. Under these regulations, the Renminbi is freely\nconvertible for current account items, including trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions and other current exchange\ntransactions, but not for capital account items, such as direct investments, loans, repatriation of investments and investments in securities,\nunless the prior approval of SAFE is obtained and prior registration with SAFE is made."

It also permitted for multiple capital accounts for the same entity to be opened in different provinces, which had\nnot been possible previously. In addition, the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Issuing the Provisions on the\nForeign Exchange Administration of Domestic Direct Investment of Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents, promulgated by\nSAFE in 2013 and amended in October 2018 and October 2019, specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over\ndirect investment by foreign investors in the PRC shall be conducted by way of registration and banks shall process foreign exchange\nbusiness relating to the direct investment in the PRC based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches.\nIn 2015, SAFE released the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming the Administrative Approach\nRegarding the Settlement of the Foreign Exchange Capitals of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or Circular 19. This notice, which became\neffective in 2015 was amended in December 2019, has made certain adjustments to some regulatory requirements on the settlement of\nforeign exchange capital of foreign-invested enterprises and lifted some foreign exchange restrictions. However, Circular 19 continues to\nprohibit foreign-invested enterprises from among other things, using Renminbi fund converted from its foreign exchange capitals for\nexpenditure beyond its business scope, providing entrusted loans or repaying loans between non-financial enterprises.\nIn June 2016, SAFE issued the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming and Standardizing the\nAdministrative Provisions on Capital Account Foreign Exchange Settlement, or Circular 16. Compared to Circular 19, Circular 16\nprovides that, in addition to foreign exchange capital, foreign debt funds and proceeds remitted from foreign listings should also be\nsubject to the discretional foreign exchange settlement. In addition, it also lifted the restriction, that foreign exchange capital under the\ncapital accounts and the corresponding Renminbi capital obtained from foreign exchange settlement should not be used for repaying the\ninter-enterprise borrowings (including advances by the third party) or repaying bank loans in Renminbi that have been sub-lent to the\nthird party.\nIn January 2017, SAFE issued the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Promoting the Reform of\nForeign Exchange Administration and Improving Authenticity and Compliance Review, or Circular 3, which stipulates several capital\ncontrol measures with respect to the outbound remittance of profit from domestic entities to offshore entities, including (i) under the\nprinciple of genuine transaction, banks shall check board resolutions regarding profit distribution, the original version of tax filing\nrecords and audited financial statements; and (ii) domestic entities shall hold income to account for previous years’ losses before\nremitting profits. Moreover, pursuant to Circular 3, domestic entities shall make detailed explanations of the sources of capital and\nutilization arrangements, and provide board resolutions, contracts and other proof when completing the registration procedures in\nconnection with an outbound investment.\nForeign Exchange Registration of Overseas Investment by PRC Residents\nThe Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on the Administration of Foreign Exchange Involved in Overseas\nInvestment, Financing and Return on Investment Conducted by Residents in China via Special-Purpose Companies, or Circular 37,\npromulgated by SAFE in 2014, requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct\nestablishment or indirect control of an offshore entity for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, referred to in Circular 37 as a\n“special purpose vehicle,” using such PRC residents’ onshore or offshore assets or equity interests. Circular 37 further requires\namendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or\ndecrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that\na PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of\nthat special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent\ncross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital\ninto its PRC subsidiary. Furthermore, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in\nliability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange controls."

In addition, under the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Issues Related to Foreign Exchange\nAdministration in Domestic Individuals’ Participation in Equity Incentive Plans of Companies Listed Abroad, issued by SAFE in 2012,\nPRC residents who are granted shares or share options by companies listed on overseas stock exchanges under share incentive plans are\nrequired to (i) register with SAFE or its local branches, (ii) retain a qualified PRC agent, which may be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas\nlisted company or another qualified institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct SAFE registration and other procedures with\nrespect to the share incentive plans on behalf of the participants, and (iii) retain an overseas institution to handle matters in connection\nwith their exercise of share options, purchase and sale of shares or interests and funds transfers.\nRegulations Relating to Dividend Distribution\nUnder our current corporate structure, our Cayman Islands holding company may rely on dividend payments from Pintec (Ganzhou)\nTechnology Co., Ltd. and Anxunying (Tianjin) Commercial Factoring Co., Ltd., our WFOEs incorporated in China, to fund any cash and\nfinancing requirements we may have. The principal legislation with respect to payment or distribution of dividends by WFOEs include\nthe Company Law, originally promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress in 1999 and most recently\namended in October 2018, and the PRC Foreign Investment Law. Under these laws, WFOEs in the PRC may pay dividends only out of\naccumulated profits, after setting aside annually at least 10% of accumulated after-tax profits as statutory reserve fund, if any, unless\nthese reserves have reached 50% of the registered capital of the enterprises. These statutory reserve funds may not be distributed as cash\ndividends. A wholly foreign-owned enterprise may allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to certain optional reserve funds at its\ndiscretion. Profit of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise may not be distributed before its losses for the previous accounting years have\nbeen made up. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year.\nRegulations Relating to M&A and Overseas Listings\nSix PRC regulatory agencies, including the CSRC, jointly adopted the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic\nEnterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules. The M&A Rules became effective in 2006. Among other things, they require\noffshore special purpose vehicles formed for overseas listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domestic companies and controlled\nby PRC companies or individuals to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock\nexchange.\nOn July 6, 2021, the relevant PRC government authorities issued Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down Illegal Securities Activities in\nAccordance with the Law. These opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities and the\nsupervision on overseas listings by China-based companies and proposed to take effective measures, such as promoting the establishment\nof relevant regulatory systems to deal with the risks and incidents faced by China-based overseas-listed companies.\nOn December 27, 2021, the NDRC and the Ministry of Commerce jointly issued the 2021 Negative List, which became effective on\nJanuary 1, 2022. Pursuant to such Special Administrative Measures, if a domestic company engaging in the prohibited business stipulated\nin the 2021 Negative List seeks an overseas securities offering and listing, it shall obtain the approval from the competent governmental\nauthorities. Besides, foreign investors of such company shall not be involved in the company’s operation and management, and their\nshareholding percentage shall be subject to the relevant regulations on the domestic securities investments by foreign investors."

If an employer fails to enter into a written employment\ncontract with an employee for more than a month but less than a year from the date on which the employment relationship is established,\nthe employer must rectify the situation by entering into a written employment contract with the employee and paying the employee twice\nthe employee’s salary for the period from the day following the lapse of one month from the date of establishment of the employment\nrelationship to the day prior to the execution of the written employment contract. If an employer fails to conclude a written labor contract\nwith a worker within one year of the date when it employs the worker, it will be deemed to have concluded an open-ended labor contract\nwith the worker. All employers must compensate their employees with wages equal to at least the local minimum wage.

Effective April 1, 2019, Jimu Group required that we provide credit\nenhancement for the loans we facilitated that were funded through Jimu Box.

In particular, in March 2019, the National People’s Congress passed the PRC Foreign Investment Law, which became effective\nas of January 1, 2020. Notwithstanding the above, the PRC Foreign Investment Law stipulates that foreign investment includes “foreign\ninvestors investing in China through any other methods under laws, administrative regulations, or provisions prescribed by the State\nCouncil”. Therefore, it is possible that future laws, administrative regulations, or provisions prescribed by the State Council may stipulate\nthe variable interest entity structure as a form of foreign investment. Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities may in the future take a\nview that is contrary to the above opinion of our PRC counsel. If the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the\nstructure for operating our internet-based businesses such as distribution of online information, insurance brokerage, fund distribution\nand other value-added telecommunications services do not comply with PRC government restrictions on foreign investment in these\nareas, we could be subject to severe penalties, including being prohibited from continuing operations. See “Item 3. Key Information—D.\nRisk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Corporate Structure” and “—Risks Relating to Doing Business in China.”\nD.   Property, Plant and Equipment\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Beijing, China, where we leased office space with an area of approximately 493.2 square\nmeters as of December 31, 2022. We lease our premises from unrelated third parties under three operating lease agreements. The three\nleases will expire in November 2023, June 2024 and October 2024, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we also leased office space in\nSichuan province, China, with an area of approximately 431.6 square meters. We also lease office space in Ganzhou, Jiangxi province,\nthe lease of which will expire in December 2023. Our servers are primarily hosted at internet data centers owned by major domestic\ninternet data center providers. We believe that our existing facilities are generally adequate to meet our current needs, but we expect to\nseek additional space as needed to accommodate future growth.\nIn December 2020, we purchase a commercial property with a total construction area of approximately 15,700 square meters located\nin Yinchuan, Ningxia province, China. The state-owned construction land use right in relation to this property will expire in April 2044.\nWe currently have no plan to sell or lease it, subject to future changes in market conditions.\nItem 4A.   Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.\nItem 5.   Operating and Financial Review and Prospects\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon, and should be read in conjunction with,\nour audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report. This report contains forward-looking\nstatements. See “Forward-Looking Information.” In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the information provided\nunder the caption “Item 3.

We caution you that our businesses and financial\nperformance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.\nA.   Operating results\nOverview\nWe are a Nasdaq-listed group providing technology-enabled financial and digital services to the ecosystem of MSMEs. We connect\nbusiness partners and financial partners with our solutions and enable them to provide financial services to users efficiently and\neffectively.\nWe generate our revenues primarily from technical service fees and installment service fees. We generate technical service fee\nrevenue by providing online credit assessment and referral services, post-lending management services, risk control services and,\nhistorically, financial guarantee services. We generate installment service fee revenue through the point-of-sale installment payment\nservices that we provide to the users of the business partners’ platforms or the provision of personal and business installment loans to\nborrowers through trust arrangements. Historically, installment service fees are recognized on a gross basis, with the interest from the\nborrower recognized as revenue and the corresponding funding cost recognized as cost of revenues. We does not use outsourcing funding\nsince 2022 and no such funding cost incurred during the period. As of December 31, 2022, we bore credit risk in connection with a small\nfraction of the loans that we facilitate. See “—Funding Sources and Credit Risk.”"

In 2020, 2021 and 2022, we processed approximately 4.8 million, 1.2 million and\n0.1 million loan applications, respectively, and facilitated a total of approximately RMB1.8 billion, RMB0.8 billion and RMB0.2 billion\n(US$0.03 billion) in loans, respectively. Due to the continued effect from the difficult environment in the second half of 2018, our\nrevenues decreased since 2019 and recorded RMB378.3 million in 2020, RMB173.2 million in 2021 and RMB74.6 million (US$10.8\nmillion) in 2022, respectively.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nConsumer Finance Market\nThe consumer finance market in China has grown rapidly in recent years, as Chinese consumers have been more willing to incur\ndebt to support their lifestyle. Consumption growth has been outpacing gross domestic product growth since 2008. We expect that\ncontinued growth in the consumer finance market will create favorable conditions for our company to continue to grow, provided that\nPRC government fiscal and economic policies remain broadly supportive of growth in debt-financed consumption. In addition,\nmacroeconomic conditions affect consumers’ willingness to incur debt more generally, though not necessarily in a straightforward way.\nFor example, consumers may be willing to incur more debt when they are confident about their future, but they may also feel compelled\nto incur debt when they suffer a reduction or interruption in their income. Adverse economic conditions would likely cause defaults to\nincrease.\nSME Financing Market\nThe SME Financing Market in China has been developing in recent years, in particular after the COVID-19 outbreak, as the SMEs\nin China are increasingly in need of funds and financial solutions during the pandemic. In addition, the PRC government is in support of\nthe development of SME financing market, deeming it a viable solution for difficulties confronted by the SMEs in China. The use of\ntechnology for the provision of financial services, or FinTech, is playing an important role in the complex landscape of SME financing.\nWe commenced offering the SMEs technical services in 2021. Specifically, we utilize our proven “SaaS + Fintech” model as a total\nsolution in order to accelerate the digitization of SMEs, encompassing technology-based credit services and solutions to the\nmanufacturing process and operations of these SMEs. Further adverse changes in the economic conditions in the PRC, however, may\ncause defaults by SMEs to increase.\nAbility to Collaborate with Business Partners\nThe growth of our business will depend in part on our ability to expand into new verticals and increase penetration in existing\nverticals to increase the number of our business partners, in particular business partners with large user bases. We acquire substantially\nall of our users through our business partners, not only the users who borrow point-of-sale installment loans when buying goods or\nservices from our business partners but also the users who borrow personal installment loans. Whether and how quickly we can acquire\nnew business partners, whether in new verticals or in existing verticals, and especially business partners with large user bases, will have a\nsignificant impact on the rate of growth of our revenues.\nAbility to Collaborate with Financial Partners\nThe growth of our business will depend on our ability to seek sufficient funding sources for the loans that we facilitate. Jimu Box\nwas the funding source for 4.0%, 0.2% and 0.3% of the outstanding loans facilitated through our platform as of December 31, 2020,\n2021 and 2022, respectively. We did not have any further funding from Jimu Box since February 15, 2020. We are likely to need more\ncapital as we acquire additional financial partners, expand our business in both domestic and international markets, and explore other\nfunding product types."

If we are unable to\nprevent fraud or price risk properly, our partners may choose not to continue to use our solutions and we may find it difficult to attract\nnew partners. Furthermore, while our business model is to connect business and financial partners and enable them to provide financial\nservices to end users, we do bear credit risk under most of our funding arrangements. We generally enjoy a larger proportion of the\nprofits when we bear credit risk, but if our risk management capabilities are not effective, we may suffer higher-than-expected losses.\nTherefore, we must continually improve our risk management and risk-based pricing capability.\nMargin Contribution and Product Mix\nOur gross margin for point-of-sale lending solutions has historically been lower compared to the gross margin for our personal\ninstallment loans. The relatively low fees we charge for point-of-sale lending solutions are an inducement for business partners to share\ntraffic with us. Our success in attracting users of point-of-sale installment loans to borrow personal installment loans or to engage in\nother transactions that we facilitate will play a significant role in our ability to achieve profitability. In addition, our success in further\ndiversifying our product mix and generating revenues from wealth management and other products will further increase our growth\npotential. However, if we cannot manage our product mix to continue to attract new users through point-of-sale installment loans while\nsimultaneously maintaining or improving our overall gross margins by cross-selling other services to our users, our overall margin and\nmay not trend higher as expected and our ability to achieve profitability may be negatively affected.\nRegulations\nThe PRC government is in the process of developing and implementing a regulatory framework to govern the consumer finance\nmarket. We expect that the regulatory framework will remain unclear for some time to come. If the PRC governmental authorities adopt\nstringent regulations on financial service providers in this market, our business and financial partners may be unable or unwilling to\nadopt our solutions. If the authorities impose specific requirements (including licensing requirements) on us, it may be difficult or costly\nfor us to comply. Regulations may be adopted in a way that favor competing business models or that disadvantage the consumer finance\nindustry as a whole in comparison to more traditional forms of offline lending.\nImpact of COVID-19\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and a series of challenges we encountered, including changes in market conditions, market\nregulations, external partners and management members, our loan volume in 2020 decreased by 83.2% compared with 2019, and further\ndecreased in 2021 by 59.2% compared with that of 2020. Our loan volume in 2022 continued to decreased by 75% compared with that of\n2021, primarily because we continued to vigilantly manage our risk profile amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result facilitated\nfewer loans in 2022. During 2022, the government adopted stricter quarantine and lockdown policies in China’s major cities such\nBeijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou in response to the increases in COVID-19 infection cases. We have taken measures in response to the\noutbreak to protect our employees, including temporarily closing our offices, facilitating remote working arrangements for our\nemployees and cancelling business meetings and travel, which may adversely impact to our business to a certain extent. Furthermore, in\npart in response to the challenges, we are now shifting our business focus by increasing the digital-centric services and substantially\nreducing our risk-sharing services.\nHowever, in December, 2022, China has declared to treat COVID-19 as a Category B disease, and relevant authorities have since\neased quarantine measures on infection cases and ceased identifying close contacts or designating high-risk and low-risk geographic\nareas. We are nonetheless continuously evaluating any potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our business has been\nmaterially adversely affected by the outbreak of COVID-19.”"

Pintec Technology Holdings Limited was incorporated in the Cayman Islands as a holding company for our business\nin March 2017. Pursuant to our pre-IPO reorganization, all of the shares of Pintec Technology Holdings Limited were issued to the\nshareholders of Jimu Group’s holding company such that Pintec Technology Holdings Limited had the same shareholders, in the same\nproportions and with the same rights, as Jimu Group’s holding company did immediately prior to our initial public offering. One of the\ndirectors on our board, namely, Jun Dong, also sits on the board of Jimu Holdings Limited.\nPreviously, our business was carried out by various subsidiaries and variable interest entities of Jimu Group’s holding company.\nThese subsidiaries have been transferred to Pintec Technology Holdings Limited as part of our pre-IPO reorganization, and our business\nis now carried out by our own subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities. Our consolidated financial statements included\nelsewhere in this annual report include the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows that were directly attributable to us\nthroughout the periods presented. See “—Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates—Basis of Presentation and\nCombination.”\nIn the past, our business shared certain facilitation and servicing, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses with\nthe peer-to-peer funding business of Jimu Group, as well as the services of a number of employees. In preparation for our initial public\noffering, Jimu Group began to establish separate functions for the two businesses. We have been operating our financing solutions\nbusiness separately from Jimu’s peer-to-peer funding business since June 2015, and we have been operating our company substantially as\na stand-alone company since September 2016. We no longer share any employees or administrative, accounting or legal functions with\nJimu Group. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include both our direct expenses and allocations for various facilitation\nand servicing, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses incurred by Jimu Group that are related to the financing\nsolutions business. These allocations were made based on the actual amount incurred and borne by Jimu Group on behalf of us. See “—\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates—Reorganization.”\nJimu Box, the online consumer finance platform operated by Jimu Group, was the single largest funding source for loans facilitated\nthrough our platform in the past. Jimu Box was the funding source for 4.0%, 0.2% and 0.3% of the outstanding loans facilitated through\nour platform as of December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. We did not have any further funding from Jimu Box since\nFebruary 15, 2020.\nJimu Box was previously involved in providing credit enhancement to individual investors for loans that we have referred and\nfunded through Jimu Group, but it discontinued this practice in 2018. Effective April 1, 2019, Jimu Group required that we provide credit\nenhancement for the loans we facilitated that were funded through Jimu Box. We and Jimu Group entered into a supplement to the\ninformation service cooperation agreement in December 2019, pursuant to which both parties agree to settle all transactions under the\ninformation service cooperation agreement occurring prior to January 1, 2020, and that we will not bear any guarantee obligation for\ntransactions occurring after January 1, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had RMB851.2 million in current amounts due from Jimu Group and RMB7.4 million in non-current\namounts. As of December 31, 2021 we had RMB846.3 million in current amounts and nil in non-current amounts due from Jimu Group.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had RMB857.1 million in current amounts due from Jimu Group and nil in non-current amounts. Since\nJimu Group became insolvent and announced its exit from the online lending platform business in February 2020 pursuant to relevant\nregulations, there are significant outstanding balances on its platform unpaid to investors that have priority over any other debts,\nincluding the balance due to us. We determined that it was not probable for the amounts due from Jimu Group to be collected or\nrecovered and made provisions accordingly. See “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Transactions and\nAgreements with Jimu Group” for more details.\nWe have acted as a business counterparty with Jimu Group including loan borrower referrals and collection channel. For purpose of\nrepayments to Jimu Box’s online platform lenders, the repayments from borrowers in connection with the remaining loans funded by\nJimu Box has been collected through us and repaid to Jimu Box’s online lenders through custody bank account of Jimu Group. As the\ncustody bank account of Jimu Group established for online lending platform business has been frozen following its insolvency and exit\nfrom online lending platform business in February 2020, in order to facilitate Jimu Box’s platform unwinding plan, we entered into an\nagreement with Jimu Group, under which we are obligated to transfer principal and interest collected from the borrowers to the party\ndesigned by Jimu Group for purpose of Jimu Box’s online borrowers’ repayment to lenders. In September 2020, we paid\nRMB100.0 million to the party designated by Jimu Group according to the agreement and plan to do so for all collected amount of\nrelated loans. As of December 31, 2022, we had RMB294.2 million due to Jimu Group."

For a description of the terms of these agreements, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—\nC. Organizational Structure—Our Relationship with Jimu Group.”\nFunding Sources and Credit Risk\nOur goal is to act as a financial solutions provider and to reduce the credit risk we take on the loan products that we facilitate.\nHowever, independent financial solution providers that bear minimal credit risks, such as ourselves, have generally experienced\nunfavorable market conditions in China. To address the market challenges, in 2019, we had credit risk for a higher proportion of our\nfunding than we did at the time of our initial public offering. Starting from 2020, aligned with our strategic shift of business focus\ntowards providing digital-centric services, we have gradually reduced a significant portion of our technical services using a risk-sharing\nmodel, leading to lower credit risk (without taking into account the impact of COVID-19). In 2022, we continued to vigilantly manage\nour risk profile, aiming to further refine our asset quality.\nPersonal and business installment loans. We facilitate personal and business installment loans by entering into financing service\nagreements with borrowers and financial partners. We provide online credit assessment and referral services, post-lending management\nservices and, historically, financial guarantee services under these arrangements. For regulatory and commercial strategy reasons, we are\nin the process of amending our agreements with our lending solutions partners so that we no longer have contractual relationships with\ntheir borrowers.\nIn 2016, Jimu Box was the sole lending solutions partner to enter into these financing service agreements with us, and it provided\npeer-to-peer matching services to the borrowers. In 2017, other lending solutions partners also began to provide funds for the personal\nand business installment loans that we facilitate. In 2018 and 2019, we continued to diversify our funding partners and deepened our\ncooperation with several existing lending solution partners. Our reliance on Jimu Group as a lending solutions partner declined to a\nsignificant extent. In February 2020, Jimu Box announced its exit from the online lending platform business and its plans to transform\ninto a micro finance company, starting from when it ceased providing funding to us until its successful transition. As a result, our credit\nrisk for funding through Jimu Box was minimal in 2021, and we expect that our credit risk for funding through Jimu Box will be minimal\nfor the foreseeable future.\nPreviously, under most funding arrangements, the financial partner bore the credit risk for personal and business installment loans,\nand we did not bear credit risk ourselves. However, we did fund some personal and business installment loans through trust structures\nwhere we retained some liability or through our own online micro finance license that we acquired in March 2019 where we retained full\nliability. In some circumstances we provided credit enhancement through our subsidiaries or consolidated variable interest entities for\npersonal and business installment loans. In both of these latter cases, we did bear credit risk.\nWe historically have cooperated with two independent guarantee companies to provide credit enhancement services to the end users\nof our financial partners. In our cooperation with these independent guarantee companies, they will provide guarantees to the end users\nof our financial partners, but if they fail to perform their obligations to provide guarantees, we will provide supplementary guarantees to\nthem. As of the date of this annual report, we only cooperated with one of the aforementioned independent guarantee companies, and we\nhad ceased providing credit enhancement through our variable interest entities for loans that we facilitated with any financial partners.\nWe currently do not expect to cooperate with additional independent guarantee companies due to our strategic shift of business\nfocus towards providing digital-centric services and optimizing our product matrix and organizational structure.\nPoint-of-sale installment loans. We facilitate the purchase of online products and services by providing point-of-sale lending\nsolutions to our business partners. They integrate our lending solutions in the payment stage of a transaction, offering users installment\npayment options when they satisfy our pre-screening procedures and the criteria mutually agreed between us and our business partners.\nTo meet the requirements of our business partners for quick settlement of purchases on their platforms, in some cases we finance the\npurchase by the end users initially ourselves, in which case the corresponding financing receivables are recorded on our balance sheet."

In 2017, we began to securitize a significant proportion of our financing\nreceivables through public or private asset-backed securities. In 2018, we stopped funding financing receivables from our provision of\npoint-of-sale lending solutions using funds received from individual investors through Jimu Box. Instead, we significantly expanded our\nuse of trusts and other structured finance as compared to 2017. We also entered into an unsecured general loan with an individual in early\n2018. Later in 2018, we entered into two loan agreements with a shareholder allowing us to make early repayment on that loan due to an\nindividual. See “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Shareholder Loans.” In 2019 and 2020, point-of-sale\nlending solutions were mainly funded through direct institutional funding arrangements, which resulted in the decrease in financing\nreceivables. In 2021, the trust arrangement was ended and we relied more on financing for loans ourselves, which resulted in an increase\nin financing receivables.\nWe historically bore credit risk for most of the point-of-sale installment loans that we facilitated. Beginning in 2018, we have begun\nto negotiate settlement arrangements between our business partners and financial partners that do not result in the recognition of financial\nreceivables on our balance sheet. Therefore, we do not bear credit risk on some of the point-of-sale installment loans that we have\nfacilitated since 2018. As of the date of this annual report, we ceased bearing credit risk on any of the new point-of-sale installment loans\nthat we facilitated.\nBalance sheet. The financing receivables on our balance sheet are generated primarily from our use of trust arrangements and other\nstructured finance products in 2020. As of December 31, 2022, we had ended the trust arrangement and recorded short-term financing\nreceivables, net, of RMB87.1 million (US$12.6 million) and long-term financing receivables, net, of nil primarily from our own fund.\nFunding debts represent the proceeds from individual investors through Jimu Box and other financial partners, the asset-backed\nsecuritized debts, the consolidated trusts or the unsecured general loan from an individual lender and a shareholder that we use to fund\nour financing receivables. We had short-term funding debts of nil and long-term funding debts of nil as of December 31, 2022.\nWe maintain a provision for credit losses based on delinquency levels and historical charge offs of the underlying on-and-off balance\nsheet loans, where applicable, using an established systematic process on a pooled basis within each credit risk level of the borrowers.\nFor each credit risk level, we estimate the expected loss rate based on the delinquency status of the financial assets to be within that level:\ncurrent, 1 to 30 days past due, 31 to 60 days past due, 60 to 90 days past due, or 91 days or greater past due. These loss rates in each\ndelinquency status are based on average historical loss rates of financial assets subject to credit losses associated with each of the\nabovementioned delinquency categories. The expected loss rate of the specific delinquency status category within each risk level will be\napplied to the outstanding balances of the applicable financial assets within that level to determine the provision for credit losses for each\nreporting period. We had a provision for credit losses related to financing receivables of RMB22.4 million (US$3.2 million) for the year\nended December 31, 2022.\nFor those off-balance-sheet loans where we provide a financial guarantee to the financial partner who funds the loans, we account\nfor the financial guarantee at fair value on the balance sheet as a financial guarantee liability. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum\npotential future payment that we could be required to make would be RMB11.2 million (US$1.6 million) We expect our financial\nguarantee liabilities to decrease in 2022 as we reduce the risk-sharing services and gradually cease to provide financial guarantees for\nloans that are funded through financial partners."

We also receive fees contingent on future events, such as\npenalty fees for early repayments as well as fees for collection services for late payments. Prior to 2018, we bore minimal credit risk for\nproviding technical services. Independent financial solution providers that bear minimal credit risks, such as ourselves, have generally\nexperienced unfavorable market conditions in China. In 2018, we began to share the credit risks for off-balance-sheet loans with select\nfinancial partners due to market challenges. Revenues from our risk-sharing model accounted for approximately 41.9%, 23.5% and\n18.7% of our technical service fees for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nWe generate installment service fee revenue through the point-of-sale installment loan services and personal and business\ninstallment loan services that we provide on our business partners’ platforms. For the point-of-sale installment loan services, we pay the\nfull amount of the order that a qualified customer makes on the partner’s platform and collect the original order amount plus the\ninstallment service fee in installments from the customer. Installment service fee revenue is recognized ratably by applying the effective\ninterest rate. Installment service fee revenue is not recorded when reasonable doubt exists as to the full or timely collection of installment\nservice fee or principal. We also receive fees contingent on future events, such as penalty fees for late payments. These contingent fees\nare recognized when the event occurs and the payment is made by the customer as that is when collectability is reasonably assured.\nWealth management service fees primarily consist of commission fees charged to third-party asset management companies for their\nuse of our online wealth management platform and insurance brokerage service fees primarily distributing insurance product as broker to\ninsurance companies. For commission fees charged to third-party asset management companies, we earn commissions which are\ngenerally determined as a percentage based on the fees charged to customers by the asset management companies through our online\nwealth management platform. Transaction service commissions are recognized on a net basis when the services are rendered, which\noccurs when the underlying transaction is executed. For insurance brokerage service fees charged to third-party insurance companies, we\nearn service fees determined as a percentage of premiums paid by the insured. The commission rate is based on the bill provided by the\ninsurance company, and it is also under tight regulation of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (“CBIRC”).\nBrokerage services revenue is recognized on a gross basis when the insurance policy is signed and the premium is collected by insurance\ncompany.\nCost of Revenues\nThe following table sets forth our cost of revenues, both in absolute amount and as a percentage of total revenues, for the years\nindicated.\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2020\n2021\n2022\n    \nRMB\n%\nRMB\n%\nRMB\nUS$\n%\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nCost of revenues:\n \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n  \nFunding cost\n \n (16,525) \n (4.4) \n (583) \n (0.3) \n (22) \n (3) \n (0.0)\n(Provision)/Reversal for credit losses\n \n (45,090)   (11.9) \n 1,934  \n 1.1    (22,382)   (3,245)   (30.0)\nOrigination and servicing cost\n   (100,760)   (26.6)   (94,186) \n (54.4)   (41,291)   (5,987)   (55.5)\n(Cost on)/Recover of guarantee\n   (100,347)   (26.5) \n 4,689  \n 2.7  \n 1,082  \n 157  \n 1.5\nService cost charged by the related party\n \n (23,052) \n (6.1) \n (1,574) \n (0.9) \n (75) \n (11) \n (0.1)\nTotal cost of revenues\n   (285,774)   (75.5)   (89,720) \n (51.8)   (62,688)   (9,089)   (84.1)\nCost of revenues mainly consists of interest we pay on funding debts, provisions that we make for credit losses, costs that are paid to\nour data partners for data used in credit assessments, user acquisition costs relating to revenue from lending solutions, reimbursement for\ndefaulted loans to financial partners related to the portion of the loans for which we shared credit risks, and other costs such as salaries\nand benefits of employees engaged in operating key systems and providing collection services, bandwidth costs, server custody costs,\ncustomer service support costs, fees paid to third-party payment channels, and service costs charged by Jimu Group."

We do not manage our\nbusiness with the intent of maximizing each of these margins separately, since different solutions serve different purposes within our\noverall business strategy. We tolerate a relatively low margin on our point-of-sale installment loan solutions because they are especially\nuseful in acquiring new business partners: they have a particularly obvious value proposition; in that they help our business partners\nincrease their own sales. High-quality business partners bring high-quality end users, which in turn makes our lending solutions more\nvaluable to our financial partners.\nThat being said, we do aim for a positive gross margin on each of our solutions. On a partner-by-partner basis, our gross margin\ntends to rise as our relationship with a business partner develops. This is both because the proportion of higher-margin personal and\nbusiness installment loan solutions grows as our relationship with a partner matures and because a partner who comes to recognize the\nmutually beneficial nature of our relationship is more likely to negotiate mutually beneficial terms. More favorable terms with our\nbusiness partners and end users have been one of the significant reasons for the improvement in our gross margin since 2016.

      "text": "Table of Contents\n131\nYear ended December 31, 2022 compared with year ended December 31, 2021\nRevenues\nOur total revenue decreased by 57.0% from RMB173.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to RMB74.6 million (US$10.8\nmillion) in the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in total loan volume from RMB0.8\nbillion in 2021 to RMB0.2 billion (US$0.03 billion) in 2022.\nTechnical service fees. Technical service fees decreased by 55.3% from RMB115.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to\nRMB51.6 million (US$7.5 million) in the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a decrease in the off-balance sheet loan\ntransactions from RMB0.5 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021 to RMB0.2 billion (US$0.03 billion) in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 as we shifted business focus towards providing digital-centric services and reduced a significant portion of our\ntechnical services using a risk-sharing model.\nInstallment service fees. Installment service fees decreased by 16.6% from RMB16.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021\nto RMB14.1 million (US$2.1 million) in the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in revenues from installment service fees in\n2022 was primarily due to a decrease in on-balance-sheet point-of-sale loans and personal loan.\nWealth management service fees and others. Wealth management service fees and others decreased by 78.4% from RMB41.0\nmillion in the year ended December 31, 2021 to RMB8.9 million (US$1.3 million) in the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease\nwas primarily due to a significant decrease in our transaction volume in insurance brokerage business in 2022, resulting in a decrease of\napproximately 31.0 million in commission fees earned from insurance brokerage service.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues decreased by 30.1% from RMB89.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to RMB62.7 million (US$9.1\nmillion) in the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFunding cost. Funding cost, consisting primarily of interest expenses, decreased by 96.2% from RMB0.6 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 to RMB22.1 thousand (US$3.2 thousand) in the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to\nthe end of the trust arrangement and reflected the change that our loan did not use funding from financial partners during 2022.\n(Provision)/Reversal for credit losses. Reversal for credit losses changed 1257.3% from reversal for credit losses of RMB1.9 million\nin the year ended December 31, 2021 to provision for credit losses of RMB22.4 million (US$3.2 million) in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The significant increase in provision for credit losses in 2022 was primarily attributable to the bad debt expense\naccrued for financing receivables from a business installment loan borrower based on comprehensive consideration of credit risk.\nOrigination and servicing cost. Origination and servicing cost decreased by 56.2% from RMB94.2 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 to RMB41.3 million (US$6.0 million) in the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the decreased cost of\ninsurance brokage services and collection services. Origination and servicing cost as a percentage of the total revenue had a slight\nincrease for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021, which was primarily due to a significant decrease in the revenue of\ntechnical services, especially collection services which had a relatively lower gross margin.\nRecover on guarantee. Recover on guarantee decreased by 76.9% from RMB4.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to\nRMB1.1 million (US$0.2 million) in the year ended December 31, 2022, as we purposely and gradually ceased providing credit\nenhancement for loans that we facilitated with any financial partners from 2020 in order to refine the overall quality of our off-balance-\nsheet loans, which lead to the increase of reimbursement for defaulted loans being outpaced by the recovery of reimbursement for\ndefaulted loans in 2021 and 2022.\nService cost charged by the related party. Service cost charged by the related party decreased by 95.2% from RMB1.6 million in\nthe year ended December 31, 2021 to RMB0.1 million (US$0.01 million) in the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily because we\nceased our cooperation model with Jimu Group under which Jimu Group used to provide credit enhancement for the borrowers since the\nbeginning of 2019, resulting in a further decrease in the loan balance and related costs under such model through 2020 to 2022."

We had a gross margin of 48.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021 and a gross margin\nof 15.9% in the year ended December 31, 2022. Our gross margin significantly decreased in 2022 from 2021, primarily due to the\nprovision for credit losses significantly increased while the revenue from installment service fees decreased.\nOperating expenses\nTotal operating expenses decreased by 39.7% from RMB154.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to RMB93.4 million\n(US$13.5 million).\nSales and marketing expenses.

The British Virgin Islands do not impose a withholding tax on dividends.\nAustralia\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, we had subsidiaries incorporated in Australia which were subject to an\nincome tax rate of 30%. We have disposed all of our equity interests in these subsidiaries as of the date of this annual report.\nHong Kong\nIn accordance with the relevant tax laws and regulations of Hong Kong, a company registered in Hong Kong is subject to income\ntaxes within Hong Kong at the applicable tax rate on taxable income. In March 2018, the Hong Kong government introduced a two-\ntiered profit tax rate regime by enacting the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No.3) Ordinance 2018, the Ordinance. Under the two-tiered\nprofits tax rate regime, the first HK$2 million of assessable profits of qualifying corporations is taxed at 8.25% and the remaining\nassessable profits at 16.5%. The Ordinance is effective from the year of assessment 2018-2019. According to the policy, if no election has\nbeen made, the whole of the taxpaying entity’s assessable profits will be chargeable to profits tax at the rate of 16.5% or 15%, as\napplicable. Because we did not elect the preferential tax treatment, all of our subsidiaries registered in Hong Kong are subject to income\ntax at a rate of 16.5%. Our Hong Kong subsidiaries did not have assessable profits that were derived from Hong Kong during the years\nended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022. Payments of dividends by our Hong Kong subsidiaries to us are therefore not subject to\nwithholding tax in Hong Kong.\nPRC\nOur PRC subsidiaries and our variable interest entities, which are considered PRC resident enterprises under PRC tax law, are\nsubject to enterprise income tax on their worldwide taxable income as determined under PRC tax laws and accounting standards at a rate\nof 25%. In addition, our variable interest entities and PRC subsidiaries are subject to value added taxes, or VAT, on the services they\nprovide at the rate of 6% or 3%, depending on whether the entity is a general taxpayer or small-scale taxpayer, plus related surcharges,\nless any deductible VAT they have already paid or borne.\nDividends paid by our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China to our intermediary holding companies in Hong Kong will be\nsubject to a withholding tax rate of 10%, unless they qualify for a special exemption.

According to the National Bureau of Statistics of\nChina, the year-over-year percent changes in the consumer price index for December 2020, 2021 and 2022 were increases of 0.2%, 1.5%\nand 2.0%, respectively. Although we have not been materially affected by inflation in the past, we may be affected by higher rates of\ninflation in China in the future."

Out of our significant accounting policies, which are described in\n“Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022,\nincluded elsewhere in this Annual Report, certain accounting policies are deemed “critical,” as they require management’s highest degree\nof judgment, estimates and assumptions. While management believes its judgments, estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are\nbased on information presently available and actual results may differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and\nconditions.\nAn accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that\nare highly uncertain at the time such estimate is made, and if different accounting estimates that reasonably could have been used, or\nchanges in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and\nassumptions. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own\nhistorical experiences and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates\nis an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from our expectations as a result of changes in our\nestimates. Some of our accounting policies require a higher degree of judgment than others in their application and require us to make\nsignificant accounting estimates.\nThe following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our\nconsolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this annual report. When reviewing our financial statements, you\nshould consider (i) our selection of critical accounting policies, (ii) the judgments and other uncertainties affecting the application of such\npolicies and (iii) the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions.\nRevenue recognition\nWe are principally engaged in providing lending solutions through our online technology platform. We earn revenues by providing:\n(i) a lending solution that assists borrowers to obtain loans from third party investors and certain financial partners. We provide lending\nsolutions but do not provide loans by ourselves. For these services, we earn technical service fees; (ii) a lending solution for borrowers\nwho want to finance their online purchases from third parties, or Business Partners, or who have personal or business installment loan\nrequests. We provide financing for these borrowers and earn installment service fees (including interests); (iii) a wealth management and\ninsurance product distribution solutions for asset management and insurance companies, respectively, to facilitate the sale of their\nproducts. We earn wealth management services fees and commission on financial products distributed through our platform that were\nsold by these asset management, and earn insurance brokerage commission revenue determined as a percentage of premiums paid by the\ninsured. We are not a party to the financial products or insurance products sold.\nRevenue recognition under ASC 606, “Revenue from contracts with Customers” in Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022\nFor technical service fees and wealth management service fees, we recognize revenue pursuant to ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts\nwith Customers (“ASC 606”). In accordance with ASC 606, revenues from contracts with customers are recognized when control of the\npromised services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for\nthose services, reduced by Value Added Tax (“VAT”). To achieve the core principle of this standard, we applied the following five steps:\n(1) Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer;\n(2) Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;"

Installment service fee revenue is not recorded when reasonable doubt exists as to the full, timely collection of installment\nservice fee or principal. We also receive miscellaneous fees, such as penalty fees for late payments, which are contingent fees and are\nrecognized when the event occurs and the payment is made by the customer as that is the point in time collectability is reasonably\nassured.\nEarly repayment fees charged by us are recognized when the early repayment occurs and the payments of the fees are made by the\nborrowers. We also charge fees for collection services related to defaulted payments. These fees are recognized when the contingent\nevents occur and the payments of the fee are made by the borrowers as collectability is reasonably assured.\nTechnical service fees\nUnder ASC 606, we consider the online credit assessment, referral service, risk control service and post-lending management\nservice, collectively, and guarantee service as two separate services, of which, the guarantee service is accounted for at fair value in\naccordance with ASC 460, Guarantees. Revenue from the guarantee service is recognized once we are released from the underlying risk.\n(see Note 2(r) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report).\nWe identify one performance obligation under ASC 606, as the online credit assessment, referral service, risk control service and\npost-lending management service are not distinct.\nWe determine the transaction price of technical service to be the service fees chargeable from the borrowers or institutional financial\npartners, net of value-added tax and excluding the transaction price allocated to guarantee liabilities.\nRevenues from technical services are recognized over time since the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits\nprovided by our technical service as it is performed. For technical service fees charged to borrowers, we recognize revenue during the\nservice period. For technical service fees charged to other financial partners, we apply the invoice practical expedient and recognize\nrevenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice.\nWealth management service fee and others\nWe earn wealth management service fee from commission on financial products distributed through our platform that were sold by\nthese asset management, and providing brokerage service for insurance companies.\nFor wealth management service fee and others, the only performance obligation is to distribute the wealth management on our\nplatforms for the third-party asset management companies. We recognize commissions on a net basis as we are not the primary obligor,\nas we do not have the ability to establish the price nor do we bear the credit risk. The revenue is recognized at a point in time when the\nperformance obligation is satisfied, which occurs when the underlying transaction is executed.\nWe provide insurance brokerage service primarily distributing insurance products as broker to insurance companies and earns\nbrokerage commission revenue determined as a percentage of premiums paid by the insured. The commission rate is based on the bill\nprovided by the insurance company, and it is also under tight regulation of the CBIRC. As our performance obligation under brokerage\nservice is to sell the insurance policy on behalf the insurance companies, the brokerage services revenue is recognized at the point in time\nwhen the insurance policy is signed and the premium is collected by insurance company."

Each portfolio of respective financial asset subject to credit\nlosses within each credit risk level consists of individually small amount of on-and-off-balance sheet loans. In the consideration of above\nfactors, we determine that each portfolio of respective financial asset subject to credit losses within each credit risk level is homogenous\nwith similar credit characteristics.\nOur provision for credit losses of financial assets is calculated separately within each credit risk level of the borrowers. For each\ncredit risk level, we estimate the expected loss rate based on delinquency status of the respective financial assets within that level:\ncurrent, 1 to 30, 31 to 60, 60 to 90, 91 days or greater past due. These loss rates in each delinquency status are based on average historical\nloss rates of financial assets subject to credit losses associated with each of the abovementioned delinquency categories. The expected\nloss rate of the specific delinquency status category within each risk level will be applied to the applicable outstanding balances of\nrespective financial assets within that level to determine the provision for credit losses for each reporting period. In addition, we consider\nother general economic conditions, if any, when determining the provision for credit losses.\nWe had a reversal of provision for credit losses related to financing receivables of RMB1.9 million for the year ended December 31,\n2021, and provision for credit losses of RMB45.1 million and RMB22.4 million (US$3.2 million) related to financing receivables for\nthe years ended December 31, 2020 and 2022, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, a 10% increase in our estimate of the\nprovision for credit losses related to financing receivables would increase our pre-tax loss by approximately 1.15%.\nFinancial guarantee\nFinancial guarantee liabilities\nFor on-and-off-balance sheet loans funded by certain financial partners, we are obligated to compensate the financial partners for the\nprincipal and interest of the defaulted loans in the event of borrowers’ default. In general, any unpaid principal and interest are paid by us\nwhen the borrower does not repay as scheduled.\nWe historically had provided guarantee to individual investors for loans that we had referred and funded through Jimu Group before\nDecember 2019 and Jimu Group announced its exit from the online lending platform business in February 2020. We are obligated to\ncompensate certain institutional financial partners for defaults on principal and interest repayments. We recognize a stand ready\nobligation for our guarantee exposure in accordance with ASC 460.\nAt the inception of each loan subject to the guarantee provided, we recognize the guarantee liability at fair value in accordance with\nASC460-10, which incorporates the expectation of potential future payments under the guarantee and takes into both non-contingent and\ncontingent aspects of the guarantee. The liability recorded based on ASC 460 is determined on a loan-by-loan basis. As the risk of the\nguarantee liability is relieved, it is recognized into the consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive loss by a systematic and\nrational amortization method over the term of the loan, within the “Technical service fees” line item.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, revenues recognized related to releasing of guarantee liabilities were\nRMB138.5 million, RMB27.0 million and RMB9.7 million (US$1.4 million), respectively.\nThe ASC 450 component is a contingent liability determined based on probable loss considering the actual historical performance\nand current conditions, representing the obligation to make future payouts under the guarantee liability in excess of the stand-ready\nliability. The ASC 450 contingent component is determined on a collective basis and loans with similar risk characteristics are pooled\ninto cohorts for purposes of measuring incurred losses. At all times the recognized liability (including the stand ready liability and\ncontingent liability) is at least equal to the probable estimated losses of the guarantee portfolio. The ASC 450 contingent component,\nincluding the net payouts by us when borrower defaults, is recognized as cost on guarantee, in the consolidated statement of operations\nand comprehensive income/(loss). As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the maximum potential future payment we could be required to\nmake were RMB30.3 million and RMB11.2 million (US$1.6 million), respectively."

Financial guarantee assets are reduced upon the receipt of the service fee payment from the borrowers and\nfinancial partners.\nWe assess the realization of the financial guarantee assets collectively depending on factors such as delinquency rate, size, and other\nrisk characteristics of the portfolio and records an allowance for amounts that it estimates will not be realized. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, we recorded a reversal of RMB8.1 million in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. For the year\nended December 31, 2021, we recorded a reversal of RMB0.4 million in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a reversal of RMB171.0 thousand (US$24.8 thousand) in the statement of operations and\ncomprehensive loss.\nAs of December 31, 2022, a 10% increase in our estimate of financial guarantee assets and liabilities would increase our total assets\nand liabilities by approximately 0.1% and 0.1%, respectively.\nImpairment of long-term investment\nLong-term investments represent equity investments in privately held companies accounted for equity method, and equity\ninvestments without readily determinable fair values.\nFor equity investments in privately held companies accounted for equity method, we make assessment of whether an investment is\nimpaired based on performance and financial position of the investee as well as other evidence of market value at each reporting date.\nSuch assessment includes, but is not limited to, reviewing the investee’s cash position, recent financing, as well as the financial and\nbusiness performance. We recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and fair value in the\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss if any. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, we\nrecognized impairment loss on equity investment accounted for using the equity method of RMB15,908, nil and RMB36,600,\nrespectively.\nFor equity investments without readily determinable fair values, we make assessment of whether an investment is impaired based on\nperformance and financial position of the investee as well as other evidence of market value at each reporting date. Such assessment\nincludes, but is not limited to, reviewing the investee’s cash position, recent financing, as well as the financial and business performance.\nWe recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and fair value in the consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive loss if any. No impairment was recognized on equity investment without readily determinable fair values\nfor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021. In 2022, we recognized impairment loss of RMB50,000.\nShare-based compensation expenses\nAll share-based awards granted to employees, including restricted ordinary shares and share options, are measured at fair value on\ngrant date. Share-based compensation expense is recognized using the straight-line method or graded vesting method, net of estimated\nforfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period.\nPrior to the Reorganization, all the options and restricted ordinary shares were granted by Jimu Group with its own underlying\nshares. The Binomial option pricing model is used to estimate fair value of the share options and restricted ordinary shares. The\ndetermination of estimated fair value of share-based payment awards on the grant date using an option pricing model is affected by the\nfair value of Jimu Group’s ordinary shares as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These\nvariables include the expected value volatility of Jimu Group’s shares over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected\nemployee share option exercise behaviors, a risk-free interest rate and any expected dividends. Shares of Jimu Group, which do not have\nquoted market prices, were valued based on the income approach. Determination of estimated fair value of Jimu Group’s shares requires\ncomplex and subjective judgments due to their limited financial and operating history, unique business risks and limited public\ninformation on companies in China similar to Jimu Group."

With respect to the Pintec options and Jimu Group options held\nby the employees of us, we determined to recognize share-based compensation expense in its consolidated financial statements the\nremaining unrecognized compensation cost pertaining to the unvested options of Jimu Group which are retained by the employees of us,\nin addition to the cost pertaining to the unvested options issued by us to our employees in connection with the equity restructuring.\nIncremental fair value, if any, for unvested awards would be recognized prospectively in the consolidated financial statements of us.\nAfter the completion of Reorganization, all the options and restricted ordinary shares were granted by us with our own underlying\nshares.

Cumulative share-\nbased compensation expenses for the options that have satisfied the service condition, amounting to RMB94.8 million, were recorded\nupon the completion of the IPO.\nDeferred income tax\nDeferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported\namounts in the consolidated financial statements, net operating loss carry forwards and credits. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nmeasured using enacted rates expected to apply to taxable income in which temporary differences are expected to be reversed or settled.\nThe effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and\ncomprehensive income/(loss) in the period of the enactment of the change.\nDeferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some\nportion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider positive and negative evidence when determining whether a\nportion or all of our deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature,\nfrequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry-forward periods,\nour experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and our tax planning strategies. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is\ndependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income within the carry-forward periods provided for in the tax law and\nduring the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. When assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, we have\nconsidered possible sources of taxable income including (i) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, (ii) future taxable\nincome exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry-forwards, (iii) future taxable income arising from implementing tax\nplanning strategies, and (iv) specific known trends of profits expected to be reflected within the industry.\nValuation allowances\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we provided a full valuation allowance of RMB234.3 million and RMB246.2 million,\nrespectively, for the deferred tax assets of Shanghai Anquying, the net income of which dropped significantly during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, and we consider it more likely than not that Shanghai Anquying could not generate sufficient pre-tax profit\nin the next five consecutive years and the deferred tax assets will not be utilized in the future."

Major Shareholders and\nRelated Party Transactions—Transactions and Agreements with Jimu Group—Cash Advances and Loan Agreements” for more details.\nIn December 2019, we acquired a controlling stake in Shenzhen Xinyuhao Technology Co., Ltd., or Shenzhen Xinyuhao, for a\nconsideration of RMB200,000 and subsequently injected capital of RMB199.9 million. In the same month, Shenzhen Xinyuhao\npurchased financing receivables from an unrelated third party for RMB200.0 million, which Jimu Group provided an unconditional\ncommitment to repurchase within six months. The financing receivables were long overdue loans from Jimu Group’s platform and\nrecovery through collection is remote. In January 2020, Shenzhen Xinyuhao required Jimu Group to repurchase these financing\nreceivables. However, Jimu Group failed to perform its commitment to repurchase the financing receivables. Since Jimu Group is\ninsolvent and announced its exit from the online lending platform business in February 2020, we determined that these amounts are\nunrecoverable. As of December 31, 2022, we had RMB857.1 million in current amounts due from Jimu Group and nil in non-current\namounts, and we made a provision of RMB857.1 million for the amount due from Jimu Group."

Pursuant to the agreements, we issued a warrant to an\nentity designated by Ningxia Fengyin to purchase, in a private placement, up to 320,036,576 of our Class A ordinary shares at par value\nUS$0.000125 per share. The warrant is exercisable immediately and will expire on the third anniversary of the closing date, i.e.,\nOctober 22, 2020. If the warrant is exercised before its expiration date, we will be released from the obligation of paying the\ncorresponding portion of the consideration. The un-released portion of the debt bears an annual interest rate of 8.75%, and the interest is\npayable quarterly. By closing the acquisition on the closing date, we obtained control over Chuanxi Technology, which has no operations,\nas well as RMB400.0 million (US$61.3 million) in its bank account. To secure the debt due to Ningxia Fengyin, on December 2, 2020,\nwe pledged 100% of the equity interest of Ganzhou Aixin Micro Finance to Ningxia Fengyin. In November 2020, we paid transaction\nservice fee of RMB4.0 million to Guangdong Huawen Industry Group Co., Ltd., one of our related parties, as agreed. Since the warrant\nis not detachable from the debt and is not a derivative, and no cash conversion features and beneficial conversion features are contained\nin the instrument, the debt and the warrant were accounted together as a liability equal to the proceeds received in entirety. Such\nacquisition to obtain cash in the amount of RMB400.0 million is in substance an issuance of a convertible debt with a principal of\nRMB400.0 million for a term of three years at an annual interest rate of 8.75% that is convertible to our Class A ordinary shares.\nIn 2021, we did not enter into new arrangement which may cause significant cash out flow in future.\nDuring 2022, we repaid RMB306,000 of convertible loan and proceeds another RMB19,000 from purchaser of convertible loan as\nof December 31, 2022. In December 2022, we entered into a loan agreement with a certain party to obtain a long-term loan of HKD300\nmillion with annual interest rate of 7%, and all principal plus interest accrued due and payable upon September 30, 2025. In the first\nquarter of 2023, we have repaid RMB19,000 of convertible loan and proceeds another RMB5,000 from the purchaser of convertible loan.\nThe remaining balance of convertible loan is RMB99,000 as of the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements. We have also\nrepaid RMB232,202 of long-term loan and the remaining balance of long-term loan is RMB4,553 as of the issuance date of the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nThe financing receivables that are recorded on our balance sheet in connection with most of our point-of-sale installment loans and\nsome of our personal installment loans currently remain on our balance sheet until they are paid in full or written off. See “—Funding\nSources and Credit Risk.” Consequently, access to capital is a potential constraint on the growth of our business. See “Item 3. Key\nInformation—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not be able to obtain additional capital when desired, on\nfavorable terms or at all.” Independent financial solution providers that bear minimal credit risks, such as ourselves, have generally\nexperienced unfavorable market conditions in China. To address the market challenges, in 2019, we had credit risk for a higher\nproportion of our funding than we did at the time of our initial public offering. Starting from 2020, aligned with our strategic shift of\nbusiness focus towards providing digital-centric services, we have gradually reduced a significant portion of our technical services using\na risk-sharing model, leading to lower credit risk (without taking into account the impact of COVID-19), and this trend continued in 2021\nand 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we ceased providing guarantees through our variable interest entities for loans that we facilitated\nwith any financial partners. We may require additional financing to continue to expand our operations.\nWe experienced net loss of RMB296,140, RMB108,820 and RMB196,557 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022,\nand net cash used in operating activities of RMB32,182 and RMB10,518 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had net current liabilities of RMB136,791, including convertible loan of RMB113,000. Our operating\nresults for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and it is uncertain if we will be able to reduce or eliminate our net losses\nfor the foreseeable future. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have obtained approval of certain lines of credit from third parties and is negotiating with the investor to convert the convertible\nloan into shares. Moreover, from January 1, 2022 onwards, we have taken measures to improve operating efficiency and implement cost\nreduction. Actions primarily include downsizing staff to cope with the decrease in business volume and revenue, standardizing our\nfinance and operation policies, enhancing internal controls and creating a synergy of our resources. However, there can be no assurance\nthat these plans and arrangements will be sufficient to fund our ongoing capital expenditures, working capital, and other requirements.\nTherefore, we may also decide to enhance our liquidity position or increase our cash reserve through additional capital and finance\nfunding. The issuance and sale of additional equity would result in further dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness\nwould result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations. We cannot assure\nyou that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all."

See “Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees—B.\nCompensation”\nTransactions and Agreements with Jimu Group\nWe and Jimu Group have a high degree of overlap in shareholders, and we and Jimu Group’s holding company share two board\nmembers until August 2020. Jimu Group was also our largest single funding partner from 2016 to 2018.\nReorganization Agreements\nWe entered into a series of agreements with Jimu Group with respect to our pre-IPO reorganization and the relationship between us\nand Jimu Group after the reorganization. For a description of these contractual arrangements, see “Item 4. Information on the Company\n—C. Organizational Structure—Our Relationship with Jimu Group.”\nCash Advances and Loan Agreements\nIn the normal course of business, we collect payments on those loans from borrowers for Jimu Group. In addition to payments we\nmade to Jimu Group in the ordinary course of business, we made a series of cash advances to Jimu Group in 2018 and 2019, in both U.S.\ndollars and Renminbi, that were not documented contemporaneously by loan agreements.\nWe entered into two loan agreements with Jimu Group on July 19, 2019, to formally document the amounts due from Jimu Group\nthat were attributable to the cash advances we made to Jimu Group outside of the ordinary course of business. The first loan agreement\nwas denominated in U.S. dollars and had a principal amount of US$21.4 million. This U.S. dollar-denominated loan bears interest at an\nannual simple(non-compounding) rate of 3.5%. Jimu Group was required to repay the principal and interest amounts payable under the\noriginal loan agreement on a daily basis over the 215 days from July 1, 2019 through January 31, 2020."

This Renminbi-\ndenominated loan bears interest at an annual simple(non-compounding)rate of 11%. The second supplement also allows the offset of loan\nprincipal against the guarantee deposit payable by us from July 2019 through January 2020, and provided for repayment on a monthly\nbasis over the 24 months from February 2020 through January 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the principal amount due under the U.S. dollar-denominated loan agreement was US$18.4 million, and\nthe principal amount due under the Renminbi-denominated loan agreement was RMB154.6 million. As of December 31, 2019, we had\nRMB866.0 million in amounts due from Jimu Group, including the amounts due under these loans, as compared to RMB4.5 million in\namounts due to Jimu Group. Jimu Group failed to repay the amount due under the U.S. dollar-denominated loan by the maturity date.\nSince Jimu Group became insolvent and announced its exit from the online lending platform business in February 2020 pursuant to\nrelevant regulations, there are significant outstanding balances on its platform unpaid to investors that have priority over any other debts,\nincluding the balance due to us. We determined that it was not probable for the amounts due from Jimu Group to be collected or\nrecovered. In 2019, we made a provision of RMB856.0 million for the amount due from Jimu Group. We made an additional provision of\nRMB7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We made reversal of provision of RMB6.7 million (US$1.1 million) for the year\nended December 31, 2021. We made an additional provision of RMB1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nStrategic Cooperation Agreement\nWe entered into a strategic cooperation agreement with Jimu Group on December 31, 2017. Pursuant to the agreement, we collect\nasset management fees on behalf of Jimu Group as part of a loan project referral program set up between us. The strategic cooperation\nagreement was supplemented on July 19, 2019. The supplement allows us to withhold asset management fees relating to loans made on\nor before December 31, 2018, collected in the amount equivalent to the outstanding amount due from Jimu Group under the\nabovementioned U.S. dollar-denominated loan in the event that Jimu Group fails to fully and timely repay the principal and interest as it\nfalls due under that loan. The supplement also allows us to deduct the asset management fees collected against the outstanding amount\ndue from Jimu Group under the abovementioned U.S. dollar-denominated loan upon Jimu Group’s failure to fully and timely repay the\nprincipal and interest due under that loan within 60 days after maturity and apply them to amounts due under the U.S. dollar-\ndenominated loan agreement.\nPurchase of Ganzhou Aixin Micro Finance\nIn March 2019, we acquired 100% of the equity of Ganzhou Aixin Micro Finance from Jimu Group at a cost of RMB230 million.\nThe purchase price was supported by a fairness opinion issued by a third-party valuer. Because Ganzhou Aixin Micro Finance holds a\nlicense to operate a small loan business, we believe that we can develop and operate pilot programs for new service offerings to\ncomplement our existing services offerings through this entity. The addition of small loan services to our service scope will also allow us\nto further enhance our data collection capabilities and provide our partners and customers with more robust financial solutions going\nforward. The amount due from us to Jimu Group for this acquisition was netted against the amount that was due to us under the first\nsupplement of the second loan agreement described above under “—Cash Advances and Loan Agreements”."

      "text": "Table of Contents\n160\nInformation Service Cooperation Agreement\nWe entered into an information service cooperation agreement with Jimu Group on July 19, 2019. Pursuant to the agreement, we are\nrequired to maintain a guarantee deposit with Jimu Group and reimburse Jimu Group for defaulted loans we have facilitated that are\nfunded through Jimu Box, up to a cap. The guarantee deposit must be maintained at an amount equal to 12% of the average outstanding\nbalance of loans we have facilitated that are funded through Jimu Box, excluding loans originated before 2019. The guarantee only\ncovers those loans that are not recorded on our balance sheet. If the deposit falls below 12% at the end of any calculation period then we\nmust deposit additional amounts with Jimu Group to raise it to 12%, and similarly, if the deposit exceeds 12% then Jimu Group must\nrefund the excess to us. The cap on our reimbursement of Jimu Group for defaulted loans in any given month is 1.5% of the average\naggregate balance of loans that (i) were facilitated by us, excluding loans originated before 2019, (ii) were funded through Jimu Box and\n(iii) were outstanding during the month in question, regardless of the vintage or tenor or due date of the loans. The average aggregate\nbalance for the month in question is calculated as the outstanding balance at the beginning of the month plus the outstanding balance at\nthe end of the month, divided by two. There is no catch-up or claw-back mechanism for months where the aggregate amount of defaulted\nloans is less than the cap on our reimbursement obligation. Our initial deposit under the information service cooperation agreement was\nRMB165.3 million, representing 12% of the loans which we had facilitated and which Jimu Group had funded since January 1, 2019 and\nwhich remained outstanding on April 30, 2019, excluding amounts that were in default. In lieu of paying the initial deposit in cash, we\nreduced the amount that would be due to us from Jimu Group under the Renminbi-denominated loan agreement described above under\n“—Cash Advances and Loan Agreements”. The arrangements under the information service cooperation agreement make the terms of\nJimu Group’s business relationship with us more similar to the terms of its business relationship with its other partners than had\npreviously been the case. Because we will be taking on some of the credit risk that Jimu Group had previously borne, we will also\nreceive a larger share of the fees from borrowers than previously. We and Jimu Group entered into a supplement to the information\nservice cooperation agreement in December 2019, pursuant to which we and Jimu Group agree to settle all transactions occurring prior to\nJanuary 1, 2020 under the information service cooperation agreement, and we do not bear any repayment obligations for transactions\noccurring after January 1, 2020 under the information service cooperation agreement."

Once our register of members has been updated, the shareholders\nrecorded in the register of members should be deemed to have legal title to the shares set against their name.\nIf the name of any person is entered in or omitted from our register of members without sufficient cause, or if there is any default or\nunnecessary delay in entering on the register the fact of any person having ceased to be a member of our company, the person or member\naggrieved (or any member of our company or our company itself) may apply to the Cayman Islands Grand Court for an order that the\nregister be rectified, and the Court may either refuse such application or it may, if satisfied of the justice of the case, make an order for\nthe rectification of the register.\nOrdinary Shares. Our ordinary shares are divided into Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Holders of our Class A\nordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares have the same rights except for voting and conversion rights. Each Class B ordinary share\nshall entitle the holder thereof to fifteen (15) votes on all matters subject to vote at our general meetings, and each Class A ordinary share\nshall entitle the holder thereof to one (1) vote on all matters subject to vote at our general meetings. However, beginning from the earlier\nof (i) the date when Mr. Wei Wei, Mr. Jun Dong and Ms. Xiaomei Peng no longer beneficially own, on an aggregate basis, at least 40%\nof the total Class B ordinary shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the initial public offering, as\nadjusted for share splits, share dividends, recapitalizations and the like, or (ii) the seventh anniversary of October 29, 2018, each Class B\nordinary share will entitle its holder to only one vote, rather than fifteen. Our ordinary shares are issued in registered form and are issued\nwhen registered in our register of members.\nConversion. Each Class B ordinary share is convertible into one Class A ordinary share at any time by the holder thereof. Class A\nordinary shares are not convertible into Class B ordinary shares under any circumstances. Upon any sale of Class B ordinary shares by a\nholder thereof to any person other than our three core founders, Mr. Wei Wei, Mr. Jun Dong and Ms. Xiaomei Peng, or any entity which\nis not affiliated with any of the three core founders, such Class B ordinary shares are automatically and immediately converted into the\nsame number of Class A ordinary shares. Each Class B ordinary share beneficially owned by any core founder is automatically converted\ninto one Class A ordinary share, if at any time the core founder ceases to be a director or employee of our company or ceases to have the\ncapability to make business decisions on behalf of our company due to health reasons."

Holders of\nordinary shares shall, at all times, vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote by the members at any such general\nmeeting.

Further, weighted voting provisions have been held to be valid as a matter\nof English common law and therefore it is expected that such would be upheld by a Cayman Islands court.\nAn ordinary resolution to be passed by the shareholders requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes attached to the\nordinary shares cast by those shareholders who are present in person or by proxy at a general meeting, while a special resolution requires\nthe affirmative vote of no less than two-thirds of the votes attached to the ordinary shares cast by those shareholders who are present in\nperson or by proxy at a general meeting of which notice specifying the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution has been\nduly given. Both ordinary resolutions and special resolutions may also be passed by a unanimous written resolution signed by all the\nshareholders of our company entitled to vote, as permitted by the Companies Act and our memorandum and articles of association. A\nspecial resolution will be required for important matters such as a change of name or making changes to our memorandum and articles of\nassociation.\nTransfer of Ordinary Shares\nAny of our shareholders may transfer all or any of his or her ordinary shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common\nform or any other form approved by our board of directors.\nHowever, our board of directors may, in its absolute discretion, decline to register any transfer of any ordinary share which is not\nfully paid up or on which our company has a lien. Our board of directors may also decline to register any transfer of any ordinary share\nunless:\n●\nthe instrument of transfer is lodged with us, accompanied by the certificate for the ordinary shares to which it relates and\nsuch other evidence as our board of directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the\ntransfer;\n●\nthe instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of shares;\n●\nthe instrument of transfer is properly stamped, if required;\n●\nthe ordinary shares transferred are free of any lien in favor of us;\n●\nany fee related to the transfer has been paid to us; and"

If our assets available for distribution are insufficient to repay all of the paid-up capital, the assets will be distributed so that the\nlosses are borne by our shareholders proportionately. We are a “limited liability” company registered under the Companies Act, and\nunder the Companies Act, the liability of our members is limited to the amount, if any, unpaid on the shares respectively held by them.\nOur memorandum of association contains a declaration that the liability of our members is so limited.\nCalls on Ordinary Shares and Forfeiture of Ordinary Shares\nOur board of directors may from time to time make calls upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on their ordinary shares. The\nordinary shares that have been called upon and remain unpaid are subject to forfeiture.\nRedemption, Repurchase and Surrender of Ordinary Shares\nWe may issue shares on terms that such shares are subject to redemption, at our option or at the option of the holders thereof, on\nsuch terms and in such manner as may be determined, before the issue of such shares, by our board of directors or by a special resolution\nof our shareholders.

The rights of the holders of shares shall not be \ndeemed to be materially adversely varied by the creation or issue of shares with preferred or other rights including, without limitation, \nthe creation of shares with enhanced or weighted voting rights.\nGeneral Meetings of Shareholders and Shareholder Proposals\nAs a Cayman Islands exempted company, we are not obliged by the Companies Act to call shareholders’ annual general meetings.\nOur memorandum and articles of association provide that we may (but are not obliged to) in each year hold a general meeting as our\nannual general meeting in which case we shall specify the meeting as such in the notices calling it, and the annual general meeting shall\nbe held at such time and place as may be determined by our directors."

In addition, the Companies Act differs from laws applicable to United States corporations and their shareholders. Set\nforth below is a summary of the significant differences between the provisions of the Companies Act applicable to us and the laws\napplicable to companies incorporated in the United States and their shareholders.\nMergers and Similar Arrangements\nThe Companies Act permits mergers and consolidations between Cayman Islands companies and between Cayman Islands\ncompanies and non-Cayman Islands companies. For these purposes, (a) “merger” means the merging of two or more constituent\ncompanies and the vesting of their undertaking, property and liabilities in one of such companies as the surviving company and (b) a\n“consolidation” means the combination of two or more constituent companies into a combined company and the vesting of the\nundertaking, property and liabilities of such companies to the consolidated company. In order to effect such a merger or consolidation,\nthe directors of each constituent company must approve a written plan of merger or consolidation, which must then be authorized by (a) a\nspecial resolution of the shareholders of each constituent company, and (b) such other authorization, if any, as may be specified in such\nconstituent company’s articles of association. The written plan of merger or consolidation must be filed with the Registrar of Companies\ntogether with a declaration as to the solvency of the consolidated or surviving company, a list of the assets and liabilities of each\nconstituent company and an undertaking that a copy of the certificate of merger or consolidation will be given to the members and\ncreditors of each constituent company and that notification of the merger or consolidation will be published in the Cayman Islands\nGazette. Dissenting shareholders have the right to be paid the fair value of their shares (which, if not agreed between the parties, will be\ndetermined by the Cayman Islands court) if they follow the required procedures, subject to certain exceptions. Court approval is not\nrequired for a merger or consolidation which is effected in compliance with these statutory procedures."

The convening of the meetings\nand subsequently the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands. While a dissenting shareholder has the\nright to express to the court the view that the transaction ought not to be approved, the court can be expected to approve the arrangement\nif it determines that:\n●\nthe statutory provisions as to the required majority vote have been met;\n●\nthe shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question and the statutory majority are acting bona fide\nwithout coercion of the minority to promote interests adverse to those of the class;\n●\nthe arrangement is such that may be reasonably approved by an intelligent and honest man of that class acting in respect of\nhis interest; and\n●\nthe arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Companies Act.\nWhen a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of 90% of the shares affected within four months, the offeror may, within a\ntwo-month period commencing on the expiration of such four-month period, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such\nshares on the terms of the offer. An objection can be made to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands but this is unlikely to succeed in the\ncase of an offer which has been so approved unless there is evidence of fraud, bad faith or collusion.\nIf an arrangement and reconstruction is thus approved, the dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal\nrights, which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of Delaware corporations, providing rights to receive\npayment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares.\nShareholders’ Lawsuits\nIn principle, we will normally be the proper plaintiff and as a general rule a derivative action may not be brought by a minority\nshareholder. However, based on English authorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority in the Cayman Islands, the\nCayman Islands court can be expected to apply and follow the common law principles (namely the rule in Foss v. Harbottle and the\nexceptions thereto) which permit a minority shareholder to commence a class action against, or derivative actions in the name of, a\ncompany to challenge the following:\n●\nan act which is illegal or ultra vires;\n●\nan act which, although not ultra vires, could only be effected duly if authorized by a special or qualified majority vote that\nhas not been obtained; and\n●\nan act which constitutes a fraud on the minority where the wrongdoers are themselves in control of the company."

Our memorandum and articles of\nassociation provide that our directors and officers shall be indemnified against all actions, costs, charges, expenses, losses and damages\nincurred or sustained by such director or officer, other than by reason of such person’s own dishonesty, willful default or fraud, in or\nabout the conduct of our company’s business or affairs or in the execution or discharge of his duties, powers, authorities or discretions,\nincluding without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, any costs, expenses, losses or liabilities incurred by such director or officer\nin defending (whether successfully or otherwise) any civil proceedings concerning our company or its affairs in any court whether in the\nCayman Islands or elsewhere. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law\nfor a Delaware corporation. In addition, we intend to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors and senior executive\nofficers that will provide such persons with additional indemnification beyond that provided in our memorandum and articles of\nassociation.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons\ncontrolling us under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against\npublic policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions in the Memorandum and Articles of Association\nSome provisions of our memorandum and articles of association may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our\ncompany or management that shareholders may consider favorable, including provisions that authorize our board of directors to issue\npreferred shares in one or more series and to designate the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such preferred shares\nwithout any further vote or action by our shareholders.\nHowever, under Cayman Islands law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers granted to them under our memorandum\nand articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time, for a proper purpose and for what they believe in good faith to be\nin the best interests of our company.\nDirectors’ Fiduciary Duties\nUnder Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This\nduty has two components: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care\nthat an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of and\ndisclose to shareholders, all material information reasonably available regarding a significant transaction. The duty of loyalty requires\nthat a director act in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He or she must not use his or\nher corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of\nthe corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a director, officer or controlling shareholder and not\nshared by the shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are presumed to have been made on an informed basis, in good faith\nand in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this presumption may be rebutted by\nevidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director, a director\nmust prove the procedural fairness of the transaction and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation.\nAs a matter of Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands company is in the position of a fiduciary with respect to the\ncompany and therefore he owes the following duties to the company—a duty to act in good faith in the best interests of the company, a\nduty not to make a personal profit based on his or her position as director (unless the company permits him to do so), a duty not to put\nhimself in a position where the interests of the company conflict with his or her personal interest or his or her duty to a third party and a\nduty to exercise powers for the purpose for which such powers were intended. A director of a Cayman Islands company owes to the\ncompany a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously considered that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his or her\nduties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his or her knowledge and experience. However,\nEnglish and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these\nauthorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands."

The Delaware General Corporation Law does\nnot provide shareholders an express right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of shareholders, but in keeping with common\nlaw, Delaware corporations generally afford shareholders an opportunity to make proposals and nominations provided that they comply\nwith the notice provisions in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws. A special meeting may be called by the board of directors or any\nother person authorized to do so in the governing documents, but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings.\nCayman Islands law provides shareholders with only limited rights to requisition a general meeting, and does not provide\nshareholders with any right to put any proposal before a general meeting. However, these rights may be provided in a company’s articles\nof association. Our memorandum and articles of association provides that, on the requisition of any two or more shareholders holding\nshares representing in aggregate not less than one-third of the total voting rights in the paid up capital of our company, the board shall\nconvene an extraordinary general meeting.\nHowever, our memorandum and articles of association do not provide our shareholders with any right to put any proposals before\nannual general meetings or extraordinary general meetings not called by such shareholders. As an exempted Cayman Islands company,\nwe are not obliged by law to call shareholders’ annual general meetings.\nCumulative Voting\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the corporation’s\ncertificate of incorporation specifically provides for it. Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority\nshareholders on a board of directors since it permits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a\nsingle director, which increases the shareholder’s voting power with respect to electing such director. Cayman Islands law does not\nprohibit cumulative voting, but our articles of association do not provide for cumulative voting. As a result, our shareholders are not\nafforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a Delaware corporation.\nRemoval of Directors\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for cause\nwith the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise.\nUnder our memorandum and articles of association, directors may be removed by ordinary resolution of our shareholders.\nTransactions with Interested Shareholders\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute applicable to Delaware public corporations\nwhereby, unless the corporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of\nincorporation or bylaws that is approved by its shareholders, it is prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations with an\n“interested shareholder” for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder\ngenerally is a person or a group who or which owns or owned 15% or more of the target’s outstanding voting stock or who or which is an\naffiliate or associate of the corporation and owned 15% or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock within the past three years.\nThis has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would\nnot be treated equally. The statute does not apply if, among other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an\ninterested shareholder, the board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person\nbecoming an interested shareholder. This encourages any potential acquirer of a Delaware corporation to negotiate the terms of any\nacquisition transaction with the target’s board of directors.\nCayman Islands law has no comparable statute. As a result, we cannot avail ourselves of the types of protections afforded by the\nDelaware business combination statute. However, although Cayman Islands law does not regulate transactions between a company and\nits significant shareholders, it does provide that such transactions must be entered into bona fide in the best interests of the company and\nfor a proper corporate purpose and not with the effect of constituting a fraud on the minority shareholders."

Only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of\ndirectors may it be approved by a simple majority of the corporation’s outstanding shares. Delaware law allows a Delaware corporation\nto include in its certificate of incorporation a supermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board.\nUnder Cayman Islands law, a company may be wound up by either an order of the courts of the Cayman Islands or by a special\nresolution of its members or, if the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, by an ordinary resolution of its members.

There are no other taxes likely to be material to investors levied by the\ngovernment of the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands is not party to any double tax treaties which are applicable to any payments\nmade by our company.\nPeople’s Republic of China Taxation\nAlthough we are incorporated in the Cayman Islands, we may be treated as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes under\nthe Enterprise Income Tax Law. The Enterprise Income Tax Law provides that an enterprise established under the laws of a foreign\ncountry or region but whose “de facto management body” is located in the PRC is treated as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax\npurposes. The implementing rules of the Enterprise Income Tax Law merely define the “de facto management body” as the\n“organizational body which effectively manages and controls the production and business operation, personnel, accounting, properties\nand other aspects of operations of an enterprise.” Based on a review of the facts and circumstances, we do not believe that Pintec\nTechnology Holdings Limited or any of our subsidiaries in the British Virgin Islands or Hong Kong should be considered a PRC resident\nenterprise for PRC tax purposes. However, there is limited guidance and implementation history of the Enterprise Income Tax Law. If\nPintec Technology Holdings Limited were to be considered a PRC resident enterprise, then PRC income tax at a rate of 10% would\ngenerally be applicable to any gain realized on the transfer of our ADSs or ordinary shares by investors that are“non-resident enterprises”\nof the PRC and to any interest or dividends payable by us to such investors. See “Item 3D. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks\nRelating to Doing Business in China—If we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC income tax purposes, such classification\ncould result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders or ADS holders.”\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\nThe following discussion is a summary of U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to the ownership and\ndisposition of our ADSs or ordinary shares by a U.S. Holder (as defined below) that holds our ADSs or ordinary shares as “capital assets”\n(generally, property held for investment). This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),\nU.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (“Regulations”), published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”),\ncourt decisions and other applicable authorities, all as currently in effect as of the date hereof and all of which are subject to change or\ndiffering interpretations (possibly with retroactive effect).\nThis discussion does not describe all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be applicable to U.S. Holders in light of\ntheir particular circumstances or U.S. Holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law, such as:\n●\nbanks, insurance companies and other financial institutions;\n●\ntax-exempt entities;\n●\nreal estate investment trusts;\n●\nregulated investment companies;\n●\ndealers or traders in securities;\n●\ncertain former citizens or residents of the United States;\n●\npersons that elect to mark their securities to market;\n●\npersons holding our ADSs or ordinary shares as part of a “straddle,” conversion or other integrated transaction;\n●\npersons that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar; and"

Each U.S. Holder is urged to consult its tax advisor concerning the\nU.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income and other tax considerations associated with an investment in our ADSs or ordinary shares\nin light of its particular situation.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of our ADSs or ordinary shares that is, for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes:\n●\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;\n●\na corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created in or organized under\nthe laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;\n●\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or\n●\na trust that (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more U.S.\npersons or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable Regulations to be treated as a “United States Person” within\nthe meaning of the Code.\nIf a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds our ADSs or\nordinary shares, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner\nand the activities of the partnership. A partner in a partnership holding our ADSs or ordinary shares is urged to consult its tax advisor\nregarding in the tax considerations generally applicable to it of the ownership and disposition of our ADSs or ordinary shares.\nThe discussion below assumes that the representations contained in the Deposit Agreement are true and that the obligations in the\nDeposit Agreement and any related agreement have been and will be complied with in accordance with its terms. If a U.S. Holder holds\nADSs, such U.S. Holder should be treated as the beneficial holder of the underlying ordinary shares represented by those ADSs for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Considerations\nAnon-U.S. corporation, such as our company, will be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year,\nif either (i) 75% or more of its gross income for such taxable year consists of certain types of “passive” income or (ii) 50% or more of the\nvalue of its assets (determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such taxable year produce or are held for the production of\npassive income. Passive income generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rents, annuities, net gains from the sale or exchange of\nproperty producing such income and net foreign currency gains. For this purpose, cash and assets readily convertible into cash are\ncategorized as passive assets and the company’s unbooked intangibles associated with active business activity are taken into account as\nnon-passive assets.\nIn addition, anon-U.S. corporation will be treated as owning its proportionate share of the assets and earning its proportionate share\nof the income of any other corporation in which it owns, directly or indirectly, 25% or more (by value) of the stock. Although the law in\nthis regard is unclear, we treat our variable interest entities as being beneficially owned by us for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nbecause we control their management decisions, we are entitled to substantially all of the economic benefits associated with these\nentities, and, as a result, we consolidate their results of operations in our U.S. GAAP financial statements."

Based\non our current income and assets and the value of our ADSs, it is likely that we were classified as a PFIC for our taxable year ended\nDecember 31, 2020. Accordingly, U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the advisability of making a mark-to-market\nelection (as described below under “—Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules”). Even if we are not currently a PFIC, changes in the\nnature of our income or assets, or fluctuations in the market price of our ADSs, may cause us to become a PFIC for future taxable years.\nIn estimating the value of our goodwill and other unbooked intangibles, we have taken into account our market capitalization, which may\nfluctuate over time. Among other factors, if our market capitalization declines, we may continue to be classified as a PFIC for our\ntaxable year ending December 31, 2021 or future taxable years. Under circumstances where revenues from our installment-sale business\nor other activities that produce passive income increase relative to our revenues from activities that produce non-passive income or where\nwe determine not to deploy significant amounts of cash for working capital or other purposes, our risk of becoming classified as a PFIC\nmay substantially increase. In addition, if it were determined that we are not the beneficial owner of our variable interest entities for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, we may be treated as a PFIC for our taxable year ending December 31, 2021 and in future taxable years.\nDividends\nSubject to the discussion below under “—Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,” any cash distributions (including\nconstructive distributions and any amount of any PRC tax withheld) paid on our ADSs or ordinary shares out of our current or\naccumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, will generally be includible in the gross\nincome of a U.S. Holder as dividend income on the day actually or constructively received by such U.S. Holder, in the case of ordinary\nshares, or by the Depositary, in the case of ADSs. Because we do not intend to determine our earnings and profits on the basis of U.S.\nfederal income tax principles, any distribution we pay will generally be reported as dividend income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. Dividends received on our ADSs or ordinary shares will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to\ncorporations under the Code.\nIndividuals and certain other non-corporate U.S. Holders will be subject to tax at the lower capital gain tax rate applicable to\n“qualified dividend income” on dividends paid on our ADSs or ordinary shares, provided that certain conditions are satisfied, including\nthat (i) the ADSs or ordinary shares on which the dividends are paid are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United\nStates or, in the event that we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC tax law, we are eligible for the benefits of\ntheU.S.-PRC income tax treaty (the “Treaty”), (ii) we are neither a PFIC nor treated as such with respect to a U.S. Holder (as discussed\nbelow) for the taxable year in which the dividend was paid or the preceding taxable year and (iii) certain holding period requirements are\nmet. Our ADSs are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, which is an established securities market in the United States, and we believe\nthat our ADSs should qualify as readily tradable, although there can be no assurances in this regard. Because we do not expect our\nordinary shares will be listed on an established securities market, we do not expect that the dividends we pay on our ordinary shares that\nare not represented by ADSs will meet the conditions required for such reduced tax rates, unless we are deemed to be a PRC resident\nenterprise (as described above) and are eligible for the benefits of the Treaty. Assuming we are eligible for such benefits and the other\nrequirements are met, dividends we pay on our ordinary shares, regardless of whether such shares are represented by the ADSs, would be\neligible for the reduced rates of taxation applicable to qualified dividend income. As discussed above under “—Passive Foreign\nInvestment Company Considerations,” however, it is likely that we were classified as a PFIC for our taxable year ended December 31,\n2020. Accordingly, we do not expect that dividends paid on our ADSs or ordinary shares will meet the conditions required for such\nreduced tax rates.\nFor U.S. foreign tax credit purposes, dividends will generally be treated as income from foreign sources and will generally constitute\npassive category income. In the event that we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC tax law, a U.S. Holder may be\nsubject to PRC taxes on dividends paid on our ADSs or ordinary shares. A U.S. Holder may be eligible, subject to a number of complex\nlimitations, to claim a foreign tax credit in respect of any nonrefundable foreign withholding taxes imposed on dividends received on our\nADSs or ordinary shares. A U.S. Holder who does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit on foreign tax withheld may instead claim a\ndeduction, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in respect of such withholding, but only for a taxable year in which such U.S. Holder\nelects to do so for all creditable foreign income taxes. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. Each U.S. Holder is urged\nto consult its tax advisor regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under its particular circumstances."

Any capital gain or loss will be long-term if the ADSs or ordinary shares have been held for more than one year and will\ngenerally be U.S.-source gain or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. The deductibility of a capital loss may be subject to limitations.\nIn the event that gain from the disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares is subject to tax in the PRC because we are deemed to be a\nPRC resident enterprise, and such gain is deemed to be U.S.-source gain, a U.S. Holder may not be able to credit such tax against its U.S.\nfederal income tax liability unless such U.S. Holder has other income from foreign sources in the appropriate category for purposes of\nthe foreign tax credit rules. However, a U.S. Holder that is eligible for the benefits of the Treaty may be able to elect to treat such gain as\nPRC-source gain. Each U.S. Holder is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the tax considerations if a foreign tax is imposed on a\ndisposition of our ADSs or ordinary shares, including the availability of the foreign tax credit under such U.S. Holder’s particular\ncircumstances.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules\nIf we are classified as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder owns our ADSs or ordinary shares, and unless the \nU.S. Holder makes a  “mark-to-market” election (as described below), such U.S. Holder will generally be subject to special tax rules that \nhave a generally penalizing effect, regardless of whether we remain a PFIC, on (i) any excess distribution that we make to such U.S. \nHolder (which generally means any distribution paid during a taxable year to such U.S. Holder that is greater than 125% of the average \nannual distributions paid in the three preceding taxable years or, if shorter, such U.S. Holder’s holding period for our ADSs or ordinary \nshares) and (ii) any gain realized on the sale or other disposition, including a pledge, of our ADSs or ordinary shares. Under the PFIC \nrules:\n●\nthe excess distribution or gain will be allocated ratably over a U.S. Holder’s holding period for the ADSs or ordinary\nshares;\n●\namounts allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable years in each U.S. Holder’s holding period prior to the first\ntaxable year in which we are classified as a PFIC will be taxable as ordinary income; and\n●\namounts allocated to each of the other taxable years will be subject to tax at the highest tax rate in effect applicable to such\nU.S. Holder for that year, and such amounts will be increased by an additional tax equal to interest on the resulting tax\ndeemed deferred with respect to such years.\nIf we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or ordinary shares and any of our subsidiaries\n(including any variable interest entity or subsidiary thereof) is also a PFIC, such U.S. Holder will be treated as owning a proportionate\namount (by value) of the shares of the lower-tier PFIC and would be subject to the rules described above on certain distributions by a\nlower-tier PFIC and a disposition of shares of a lower-tier PFIC even though such U.S. Holder may not receive the proceeds of those\ndistributions or dispositions."

Marketable stock is stock that is traded in other than de minimis quantities on at least 15 days\nduring each calendar quarter (“regularly traded”) on a qualified exchange (such as the Nasdaq Global Market) or other market as defined\nin applicable Regulations. We believe that a U.S. Holder may make a mark-to-market election with respect to our ADSs, but not our\nordinary shares, provided that our ADSs remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Market and that our ADSs are regularly traded. We\nanticipate that our ADSs should qualify as being regularly traded, but no assurances may be given in this regard. If a U.S. Holder makes\nthis election, such U.S. Holder will generally (i) include as ordinary income for each taxable year that we are a PFIC the excess, if any, of\nthe fair market value of our ADSs held at the end of the taxable year over the adjusted tax basis of such ADSs and (ii) deduct as an\nordinary loss the excess, if any, of the adjusted tax basis of our ADSs over the fair market value of such ADSs held at the end of the\ntaxable year, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. A U.S.\nHolder’s adjusted tax basis in our ADSs would be adjusted to reflect any income or loss resulting from the mark-to-market election.

These rules also impose penalties if a U.S.\nHolder is required to submit such information to the IRS and fails to do so.\nIn addition, U.S. Holders may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and backup withholding with respect to dividends on\nand proceeds from the sale or other disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares. Information reporting will apply to payments of\ndividends on, and to proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, ADSs or ordinary shares by a paying agent within the United States to\na U.S. Holder, other than U.S. Holders that are exempt from information reporting and properly certify their exemption. A paying agent\nwithin the United States will be required to withhold at the applicable statutory rate, currently 24%, in respect of any payments of\ndividends on, and the proceeds from the disposition of, ADSs or ordinary shares within the United States to a U.S. Holder (other than\nU.S. Holders that are exempt from backup withholding and properly certify their exemption) if the U.S. Holder fails to furnish its correct\ntaxpayer identification number or otherwise fails to comply with applicable backup withholding requirements. U.S. Holders who are\nrequired to establish their exempt status generally must provide a properly completed IRS FormW-9.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a U.S. Holder’s U.S.\nfederal income tax liability. A U.S. Holder generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by\nfiling the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS in a timely manner and furnishing any required information.

The change was automatically made on the books of the depositary and no physical action by\nADS holders was required. “Deposited Securities” as of any time shall mean Shares at such time deposited or deemed to be deposited\nunder the Deposit Agreement, including without limitation, Shares that have not been successfully delivered upon surrender of the ADSs,\nand any other securities, cash or other property received by the Depositary or the Custodian in respect of the Deposited Securities and at\nthat time held under the Deposit Agreement. the Depositary’s office is located at 240 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10286.\nPersons depositing or withdrawing shares or ADS\n                            holders must pay:                            \n  \nFor:\n$5.00 (or less) per 100 ADSs (or portion of 100 ADSs)\n  \nIssuance of ADSs, including issuances resulting from a distribution\nof shares or rights or other property\n  \nCancellation of ADSs for the purpose of withdrawal, including if the\nDeposit Agreement terminates\n$0.05 (or less) per ADS\n  \nAny cash distribution to ADS holders\nA fee equivalent to the fee that would be payable if securities distributed to you\nhad been Shares and the Shares had been deposited for issuance of ADSs\n  \nDistribution of securities distributed to holders of Deposited\nSecurities (including rights) that are distributed by the Depositary to\nADS holders\n$0.05 (or less) per ADS per calendar year\n  \nDepositary services\nRegistration or transfer fees\n  \nTransfer and registration of shares on our Share register to or from\nthe name of the Depositary or its agent when you deposit or\nwithdraw Shares\nExpenses of the Depositary\n  \nCable and facsimile transmissions (when expressly provided in the\nDeposit Agreement)\n  \nConverting foreign currency to U.S. dollars\nTaxes and other governmental charges the Depositary or the custodian has to\npay on any ADSs or shares underlying ADSs, such as stock transfer taxes,\nstamp duty or withholding taxes\n  \nAs necessary\nAny charges incurred by the Depositary or its agents for servicing the\nDeposited Securities\n  \nAs necessary"

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and acting chief financial\nofficer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBased on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nAttestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis annual report on Form 20-F does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to\nrules of the SEC where domestic and foreign registrants that are “emerging growth companies” which we are, are not required to provide\nthe auditor attestation.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting\nPrior to our initial public offering in October 2018, we were a private company with limited accounting personnel and other\nresources with which to address our internal controls. In the course of management’s preparation and our independent registered public\naccounting firm’s auditing of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, we and our\nindependent registered public accounting firm identified one material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. As\ndefined in the standards established by the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a “material weakness” is a deficiency, or\ncombination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, in accordance with the\nstandards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board of the United States.\nThe material weakness that has been identified relates to our lack of sufficient financial reporting and accounting personnel with\nappropriate knowledge of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements to properly address complex U.S. GAAP technical accounting\nissues and prepare and review financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP and reporting requirements set\nforth by the SEC.\nWe have implemented and plan to implement a number of measures to address this material weakness:\n●\nwe hired a consulting firm with U.S. GAAP experience to strengthen our financial reporting function;\n●\nwe are in the process of establishing clear roles and responsibilities for accounting and financial reporting staff to address\naccounting and financial reporting issues, and we added additional professionals for our financial reporting team in 2019;\nand\n●\nwe are continuing to further expedite and streamline our reporting process and develop our U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting\nprocess to allow early detection, prevention and resolution of potential financial reporting and U.S. GAAP issues, and have\nestablished an ongoing program to provide sufficient and appropriate training for financial reporting and accounting\npersonnel, especially training related to U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements.\nWe plan to establish due diligence procedures for investment transactions, including credit assessment procedures to ascertain the\nfinancial position of investment targets and other parties involved in the investment transactions, and improve post-investment\nmanagement activities to address this material weakness."

Had we\nperformed a formal assessment of our internal control over financial reporting or had our independent registered public accounting firm\nperformed an audit of our internal control over financial reporting, additional control deficiencies may have been identified. See “Item 3.\nKey Information—D.

These conditions raise substantial doubt about\nthe Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1(e). The\nconsolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The\nCompany is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our\naudit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an\nopinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding\nthe amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit\nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Marcum Asia CPAs LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2019.\nNew York, NY\nMay 12, 2023"

Each power of attorney will remain in force during the period when the nominee shareholder continues to be shareholder of the\nVIEs. Each nominee shareholder has waived all the rights which have been authorized to the Company’s relevant PRC subsidiaries under\neach power of attorney. The powers of attorney are irrevocable and remain in force continuously upon execution.\nExclusive business cooperation agreements —The Company’s relevant PRC subsidiaries and the VIEs entered into exclusive business\ncooperation agreements under which the VIEs engage the Company’s relevant PRC subsidiaries as their exclusive provider of technical\nservices and business consulting services. The VIEs shall pay services fees to the Company’s relevant PRC subsidiaries, which are\ndetermined by the Company’s relevant PRC subsidiaries at its sole discretion. The Company’s relevant PRC subsidiaries shall have\nexclusive and proprietary rights and interests in all rights, ownership, interests and intellectual properties arising from the performance of\nthe agreement. During the term of the agreement, the VIEs shall not accept any consultations and/or services provided by any third party\nand shall not cooperate with any third party for the provision of identical or similar services without prior consent of the Company’s\nrelevant PRC subsidiaries. These agreements will remain in effect for ten years, but can be terminated by the Company’s relevant PRC\nsubsidiaries with 30 days’ advance written notice. These agreements can be extended at the sole discretion of the Company’s relevant\nPRC subsidiaries.\nEquity pledge agreements —Pursuant to the relevant equity pledge agreements, the nominee shareholders of the VIEs have pledged all\nof their equity interests in the VIEs to the Company’s relevant PRC subsidiaries as collateral for all of the VIEs’ payments due to the\nCompany’s relevant PRC subsidiaries and to secure the VIEs’ obligations under the above agreement. The nominee shareholders shall\nnot transfer or assign the equity interests, the rights and obligations in the equity pledge agreement or create or permit to create any\npledges which may have an adverse effect on the rights or benefits of the Company’s relevant PRC subsidiaries without the Company’s\nrelevant PRC subsidiaries’ written consent. The Company’s relevant PRC subsidiaries are entitled to transfer or assign in full or in part\nthe equity interests pledged. In the event of default, the Company’s relevant PRC subsidiaries as the pledgee, will be entitled to request\nimmediate payment of the unpaid service fee and other amounts due to the Company’s relevant PRC subsidiaries, and/or to dispose of\nthe pledged equity. These equity pledge agreements will remain effective until the variable interest entities and their shareholders\ndischarge all their obligations under the contractual arrangements.\nExclusive option agreements —The nominee shareholders of the VIEs have granted the Company’s relevant PRC subsidiaries the\nexclusive and irrevocable option to purchase from the nominee shareholders, to the extent permitted under PRC laws and regulations,\npart or all of their equity interests in these entities for a purchase price equal to the actual capital contribution paid in the registered\ncapital of the VIEs by the nominee shareholders for their equity interests. The Company’s relevant PRC subsidiaries may exercise such\noption at any time. In addition, the VIEs and their nominee shareholders have agreed that without prior written consent of the Company’s\nrelevant PRC subsidiaries, they shall not sell, transfer, mortgage or dispose of any assets or equity interests of the VIEs or declare any\ndividend. These agreements will remain effective for ten years and can be extended at the sole discretion of the Company’s relevant PRC\nsubsidiaries."

However, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit the Company’s ability to enforce\nthe contractual arrangements. If the legal structure and contractual arrangements were found to be in violation of PRC laws and\nregulations, the PRC government could, among others:\n●\nrevoke the Group’s business and operating licenses;\n●\nrequire the Group to discontinue or restrict its operations;\n●\nrestrict the Group’s right to collect revenues;\n●\nblock the Group’s websites;\n●\nrequire the Group to restructure the operations, re-apply for the necessary licenses or relocate the Group’s businesses, staff and\nassets;\n●\nimpose additional conditions or requirements with which the Group may not be able to comply; or\n●\ntake other regulatory or enforcement actions against the Group that could be harmful to the Group’s business.\nThe Company’s ability to conduct its business may be negatively affected if the PRC government were to carry out of any of the\naforementioned actions. As a result, the Company may not be able to consolidate its VIE in its consolidated financial statements as it may\nlose the ability to exert effective control over the VIE and their respective shareholders and it may lose the ability to receive economic\nbenefits from the VIE. The Company, however, does not believe such actions would result in the liquidation or dissolution of the\nCompany, its PRC subsidiary and VIE.\nThe interests of the shareholders of VIE may diverge from that of the Company and that may potentially increase the risk that they would\nseek to act contrary to the contractual terms, for example by influencing VIE not to pay the service fees when required to do so. The\nCompany cannot assure that when conflicts of interest arise, shareholders of VIE will act in the best interests of the Company or that\nconflicts of interests will be resolved in the Company’s favor. The Company believes the shareholders of VIE will not act contrary to any\nof the contractual arrangements and the exclusive option agreements provide The Company with a mechanism to remove the current\nshareholders of VIE should they act to the detriment of The Company. The Company relies on certain current shareholders of VIE to\nfulfill their fiduciary duties and abide by laws of the PRC and act in the best interest of the Company. If the Company cannot resolve any\nconflicts of interest or disputes between the Company and the shareholders of VIE, the Company would have to rely on legal\nproceedings, which could result in disruption of its business, and there is substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal\nproceedings."

Relevant PRC laws and regulations restrict the VIE from transferring a portion of its\nnet assets, equivalent to the balance of its paid-in capital, capital reserve and statutory reserves, to the Group in the form of loans and\nadvances or cash dividends. As the VIEs and VIEs’ subsidiaries are incorporated as limited liability companies under the PRC Company\nLaw, the creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the Group for the liabilities of the VIEs and the VIEs’ subsidiaries.\nCurrently there is  no  contractual arrangement that could require the relevant PRC subsidiaries or the Group to provide additional\nfinancial support to the Group’s VIEs and VIEs’ subsidiaries. As the Group is conducting certain businesses in the PRC through the VIEs\nand VIEs’ subsidiaries, the Group may provide additional financial support on a discretionary basis in the future, which could expose the\nGroup to a loss. The COVID-19 pandemic lasted for the past three years had a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial\nposition and results of its operation. As the government declared to treat COVID-19 as Category B disease and dropped all quarantines\nand travel restrictions in December, 2022, the adverse impact of pandemic is expected to materially reduce in the future but uncertainty\nof such changes is unpredictable pending on the further development of the pandemic. The financial statements do not include any\nadjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n(e)\nGoing Concern\nThe Group experienced net loss of RMB296,140, RMB108,820 and RMB196,557 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and\n2022, and net cash used in operating activities of RMB32,182 and RMB10,518 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had net current liabilities of RMB136,791, including convertible loan of\nRMB113,000. The Group’s operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and it is uncertain if the Company\nwill be able to reduce or eliminate its net losses for the foreseeable future. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Group’s\nability to continue as a going concern."

Actions primarily include downsizing staff to cope with the decrease in business volume and revenue,\nstandardizing the Group’s finance and operation policies throughout the Group, enhancing internal controls and creating a synergy of the\nGroup’s resources. However, there can be no assurance that these plans and arrangements will be sufficient to fund the Group’s ongoing\ncapital expenditures, working capital, and other requirements.\n2.\nSummary of significant accounting policies\n(a)\nBasis of presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Significant accounting policies\nfollowed by the Group in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are summarized below.\n(b)\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries, the VIEs for which the Company\nis the ultimate primary beneficiary, and the subsidiaries of the VIEs.\nAll significant intercompany transactions and balances between the Company, its consolidated subsidiaries and the consolidated VIEs\nhave been eliminated upon consolidation.\n(c)\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Group to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the\nbalance sheet dates, and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and disclosed in the consolidated financial\nstatements and accompanying notes.\nSignificant accounting estimates reflected in the Group’s consolidated financial statements include provision for doubtful accounts and\ncredit losses, valuation and recognition of share-based compensation expenses, uncertain tax positions, valuation allowance of deferred\ntax assets, fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, impairment of long-lived assets including goodwill,\nimpairment of long-term investment, the fair value of financial guarantee liabilities under ASC 460, the useful lives of property,\nequipment and software and intangible assets, and fair values of the debt instruments issued with warrants. Changes in facts and\ncircumstances may result in revised estimates.\n(d)\nBusiness combination\nBusiness combinations are recorded using the acquisition method of accounting. The assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any\nnon-controlling interests of the acquiree at the acquisition date, if any, are measured at their fair values as of the acquisition date.\nGoodwill is recognized and measured as the excess of the total consideration transferred plus the fair value of any non-controlling\ninterest of the acquiree and fair value of previously held equity interest in the acquiree, if any, at the acquisition date over the fair values\nof the identifiable net assets acquired. Common forms of the consideration made in acquisitions include cash and common equity\ninstruments. Consideration transferred in a business acquisition is measured at the fair value as of the date of acquisition. Acquisition-\nrelated expenses and restructuring costs are expensed as incurred."

The management considers the term deposits in bank as\nheld to maturity investments and intend to withdraw within one year, and thus classify as short-term investments. These investments are\nstated at principal plus accrued interests. Accrued interests are reflected in interest income, net in the consolidation statements of\noperation and comprehensive loss and recognized as interest income during liquidation."

When determining the fair value measurements for assets and\nliabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Group considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it\nwould transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.\nAccounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the\nuse of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based\nupon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Accounting guidance establishes three levels of inputs\nthat may be used to measure fair value:\n●\nLevel 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices, in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n●\nLevel 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable\nfor the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical asset or\nliabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which\nsignificant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.\n●\nLevel 3 applies to asset or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the\nmeasurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n(k)\nFinancing receivables, net\nThe Group generates financing receivables by providing the following:\n(1)  Point-of-sale installment services to users of third-party online travel websites and other e-commerce websites (the “Business\nPartners”).\nWhen a user, who qualifies for point-of-sale installment services makes an online purchase using a point-of-sale installment loan, the\nGroup pays the sales price to the Business Partner and collects the sales price from the user with interest and fees.Upon paying the sales\nprice to the Business Partners, the Group promptly obtains financing for the sales price by factoring the receivable due from the user. The\nGroup does not derecognize the receivable from users upon factoring and accounts for the transaction as secured borrowings according to\nASC860-10, because the Group has control over the receivables during the factoring period.\n(2) Personal and business installment loans to borrowers where the Group uses its own cash to fund the loan."

By the end of 2020, the\nTrusts arrangement was ended.\nThe Trusts are considered as variable interest entities under ASC 810. As the Group has power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact economic performance of the Trusts that could potentially be significant to the Trusts, and the Group is obligated to\nrepurchase any loans that are delinquent for more than a specified number of days, accordingly, the Group is considered as the primary\nbeneficiary of the Trusts and has consolidated the Trusts’ assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows in the Group’s\nconsolidated financial statements.\nThe financing receivables due from the borrowers of the personal and business installment loans and the loans payable to the third-party\ninvestors of the trust units are measured at amortized cost and recorded on the Group’s consolidated balance sheets as financing\nreceivables and funding debts, respectively.\n(4) Accrued interest income on financing receivables\nAccrued interest income on financing receivables is calculated based on the contractual interest rate of the loan and recorded as\ninstallment service fees as earned. Financing receivables are placed on non-accrual status upon reaching 90 days past due in operating\nentities in PRC, and 60 days past due in in operating entities in Australia. When a financing receivable is placed on non-accrual status,\nthe Group stops accruing interest as of such date. The Group does not resume accrual of interest after a loan has been placed on non-\naccrual basis.\nThe Company charges off the accrued interest receivable against the related allowance when management determines that full repayment\nof a loan is not probable. Generally, charge-off occurs after the 90th day of delinquency in operating entities in PRC, and the 60th day of\ndelinquency in operating entities in Australia. All accrued but unpaid interest as of such date is charged off against the provision for\ncredit loss. The primary factor in making such determination is the assessment of potential recoverable amounts from the delinquent\ndebtor.\n(5) Non-accrual financing receivables and charged-off financing receivables\nThe Group considers a financing receivable to be delinquent when a monthly payment is one day past due. When the Group determines it\nis probable that full repayment of a loan will not be made, the remaining unpaid principal balance is charged off against the allowance for\ncredit losses. Generally, charge-offs occur after 90 days of delinquency in operating entities in PRC, and 60 days in operating entities in\nAustralia. Installment service fees for nonaccrual financing receivables is recognized upon the collection of cash.\n(l)\nAccounts receivable, net\nAccounts receivables are stated at the historical carrying amount net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Group reviews the\naccounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes allowances when there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances. In\nevaluating the collectability of individual accounts receivable balances, the Group considers several factors, including the age of the\nbalance, the customer’s payment history, and current credit worthiness, and current economic trends. For accounts receivable from\nindividuals, the balances are charged off after 90 days of delinquency. Accounts receivable were RMB36,854 and RMB18,627 as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022.\n(m)\nLong-term investments\nLong-term investments represent the Group’s equity investments in privately held companies accounted for equity method, and equity\ninvestments without readily determinable fair values."

Under the equity method, the Group initially\nrecords its investment at cost. The difference between the cost of the equity investment and the amount of the underlying equity in the net\nassets of the equity investee is recognized as equity method goodwill or as an intangible asset as appropriate, which is included in the\nequity method investment on the consolidated balance sheets. The Group subsequently adjusts the carrying amount of the investment to\nrecognize the Group’s proportionate share of each equity investee’s net income or loss into consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive loss after the date of acquisition. The Group makes assessment of whether an investment is impaired based on\nperformance and financial position of the investee as well as other evidence of market value at each reporting date. Such assessment\nincludes, but is not limited to, reviewing the investee’s cash position, recent financing, as well as the financial and business performance.\nThe Group recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and fair value in the consolidated statements\nof operations and comprehensive loss if any. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Group recognized impairment\nloss on equity investment accounted for using the equity method of RMB15,908, nil and RMB36,600, respectively.\n(2) Equity investments without readily determinable fair values\nBeginning on January 1, 2018, the Group’s equity investments without readily determinable fair values, which do not qualify for the\nexisting practical expedient in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”), to estimate fair value using the\nnet asset value per share (or its equivalent) of the investment (“NAV practical expedient”), and over which the Group does not have the\nability to exercise significant influence through the investments in common stock or in substance common stock, are accounted for under\nthe measurement alternative upon the adoption of ASU2016-01 (the “Measurement Alternative”). Under the Measurement Alternative,\nthe carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. All gains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, are\nrecognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Group makes assessment of whether an investment\nis impaired based on performance and financial position of the investee as well as other evidence of market value at each reporting date.\nSuch assessment includes, but is not limited to, reviewing the investee’s cash position, recent financing, as well as the financial and\nbusiness performance. The Group recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and fair value in the\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss if any. No impairment was recognized on equity investment without\nreadily determinable fair values for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Group\nrecognized impairment loss of RMB50,000.\n(n)\nProperty, equipment and software, net\nProperty, equipment and software are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment.

Intangible assets with useful\nlives are amortized using the straight-line approach over the estimated economic useful lives of the assets as follows:\nCategory\n    \nEstimated useful life\nMicrocredit license\n17 years\nSoftware copyright\n2 years\nCustomer database\n5.5 years\nCustomer relationship\n10 years\nTrademark\n5.5 years\nCredit investigation license\nindefinite\nThe enterprise credit investigation license acquired from acquisition of Qilehui is recognized as an intangible asset with indefinite life\nand evaluated for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired. Such\nimpairment test compares the fair values of asset with its carrying value and an impairment loss is recognized if and when the carrying\namounts exceed the fair value.\n(p)\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business\ncombination.\nGoodwill is not depreciated or amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of December 31 of each balance sheet date\nand in between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired. The\nCompany first has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting\nunit is less than its carrying amount.\nIf the Company decides, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less\nthan its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is mandatory. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative\nimpairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. A goodwill\nimpairment charge will be recorded for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, but not to exceed the\ncarrying amount of goodwill. Application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the\nidentification of reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. The judgment in estimating the fair value of\nreporting units includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions. Changes in\nthese estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit. Goodwill of RMB37,593\nwas fully impaired for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the impairment loss was recognized in the consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the carry amount of goodwill was nil."

When these events occur, the Group evaluates the impairment by comparing carrying amount of the assets\nto an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the\nsum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets, the Group recognizes an impairment\nloss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets over their fair value. Fair value is estimated based on various\nvaluation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows. The evaluation of asset impairment requires the\nCompany to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated. These assumptions require significant\njudgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. The Group recorded impairment of long-lived assets of\nRMB31,765, RMB3,096 and nil for the years ended 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\n(r)\nFinancial Guarantee\n(1) Financial guarantee liabilities\nFor the off-balance sheet loans funded by certain financial partners, the Group is obligated to compensate the financial partners for the\nprincipal and interest of the defaulted loans in the event of borrowers’ default. In general, any unpaid principal and interest are paid by\nthe Group when the borrower does not repay as scheduled.\n(i) The Group provided guarantees to individual investors for loans that the Group has referred and funded through Jimu Group before\nDecember  2019 and Jimu Group announced its exit from the online lending platform business in February  2020. (ii)  The Group\nis obligated to compensate certain institutional financial partners for defaults on principal and interest repayments. The Group recognizes\na stand ready obligation for its guarantee exposure in accordance with ASC 460.\nAt the inception of each loan subject to the guarantee provided, the Group recognizes the guarantee liability at fair value in accordance\nwith ASC  460-10, which incorporates the expectation of potential future payments under the guarantee and takes into both non-\ncontingent and contingent aspects of the guarantee. The liability recorded based on ASC 460 is determined on a loan-by-loan basis. As\nthe risk of the guarantee liability is relieved, it is recognized into the consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive loss by a\nsystematic and rational amortization method over the term of the loan, within the “Technical service fees” line item.\nFor the  years ended December  31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, revenues recognized related to releasing of guarantee liabilities were\nRMB138,483, RMB27,035 and RMB9,662 respectively.\nThe ASC 450 component is a contingent liability determined based on probable loss considering the actual historical performance and\ncurrent conditions, representing the obligation to make future payouts under the guarantee liability in excess of the stand-ready liability.\nThe ASC 450 contingent component is determined on a collective basis and loans with similar risk characteristics are pooled into cohorts\nfor purposes of measuring incurred losses. At all times the recognized liability (including the stand ready liability and contingent\nliability) is at least equal to the probable estimated losses of the guarantee portfolio. The ASC 450 contingent component, including the\nnet payouts by the Group when borrower defaults, is recognized as cost on guarantee, in the consolidated statement of operations and\ncomprehensive loss.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the maximum potential future payment the Group could be required to make were RMB30,275 and\nRMB11,158, respectively."

Financial guarantee assets are reduced upon the receipt of the service fee payment from the borrowers and financial\npartners.\nThe Company assesses the realization of the financial guarantee assets collectively depending on factors such as delinquency rate, size,\nand other risk characteristics of the portfolio and records an allowance for amounts that it estimates will not be realized.

The Group earns its revenues by\nproviding the following: (i) A lending solution which assists borrowers to obtain loans from third party investors and certain financial\npartners. The Group provides lending solution but does not provide loan by itself. For these services, the Group earns technical service\nfees. (ii) A lending solution for borrowers who want to finance their on-line purchases from third parties (“Business Partners”) or who\nhave personal or business installment loan requests. The Group provides financing for these borrowers and earns installment service fees\n(including interests). (iii)  A wealth management and insurance product distribution solution for asset management and insurance\ncompanies respectively to facilitate the sale of their products. The Group earns wealth management service and commission on financial\nproducts distributed through the Group’s platform that were sold by these asset management, and earns insurance brokerage commission\nrevenue determined as a percentage of premiums paid by the insured. The Group is not a party to the financial products or insurance\nproducts sold.\nInstallment service fee\nInstallment service fee revenue is recognized over the terms of financing receivables using the effective interest rate method under ASC\n310. Installment service fee revenue is not recorded when reasonable doubt exists as to the full, timely collection of installment service\nfee or principal. The Group also receives miscellaneous fees, such as penalty fees for late payments, which are contingent fees and are\nrecognized when the event occurs and the payment is made by the customer as that is the point in time collectability is reasonably\nassured.\nFor technical service fees and wealth management service fees, the Group recognizes revenue pursuant to ASC 606. In accordance with\nASC 606, revenues from contracts with customers are recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to the Group’s\ncustomers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Group expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services, reduced by\nValue Added Tax (“VAT”). To achieve the core principle of this standard, we applied the following five steps:\n1.\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer;\n2.\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n3.\nDetermination of the transaction price;\n4.\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n5.\nRecognition of the revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied."

For technical service fees charged from borrowers, the Group recognizes revenue\nduring the service period. For technical service fees charged from other financial partners, the Group applies the invoice practical\nexpedient and recognizes revenue in the amount to which the Group has a right to invoice.\nWealth management service fee and others\nThe Group earns wealth management service fee from commission on financial products distributed through the Group’s platform that\nwere sold by these asset management companies, and from providing brokerage service for insurance companies.\nFor wealth management service fee and others, the only performance obligation is to distribute the wealth management products on the\nGroup’s platforms for the third-party asset management companies. The Group recognizes commissions on a net basis as the Group is\nnot the primary obligor, it does not have the ability to establish the price nor does it bear the credit risk. The revenue is recognized at a\npoint in time when the performance obligation is satisfied, which occurs when the underlying transaction is executed.\nThe Group provides insurance brokerage service primarily distributing insurance products as broker for insurance companies and earns\nbrokerage commission revenue determined as a percentage of premiums paid by the insured. The commission rate is based on the bill\nprovided by the insurance companies, and it is also under strict regulation of the CBIRC.

Each portfolio of respective financial asset subject to\ncredit losses within each credit risk level consists of individually small amount of on- and off-balance sheet loans. In the consideration of\nabove factors, the Group determines that each portfolio of respective financial asset subject to credit losses within each credit risk level is\nhomogenous with similar credit characteristics.\nThe Group’s provision for credit losses of financial assets is calculated separately within each credit risk level of the borrowers. For each\ncredit risk level, the Group estimates the expected loss rate based on delinquency status of the respective financial assets within that\nlevel: current, 1 to 30, 31 to 60, 60 to 90, 91 days or greater past due. These loss rates in each delinquency status are based on average\nhistorical loss rates of financial assets subject to credit losses associated with each of the abovementioned delinquency categories. The\nexpected loss rate of the specific delinquency status category within each risk level will be applied to the applicable outstanding balances\nof respective financial assets within that level to determine the provision for credit losses for each reporting period.

The determination of\nestimated fair value of share-based payment awards on the grant date using an option pricing model was affected by the fair value of\nunderlying ordinary shares as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include the\nexpected value volatility over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee share option exercise behaviors, a risk-free\ninterest rate and any expected dividends. Shares that do not have quoted market prices, were valued based on the income approach.\nDetermination of estimated fair value shares that do not have quoted market prices requires complex and subjective judgments due to\ntheir limited financial and operating history, unique business risks and limited public information on similar companies in China.\nForfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

Leases where\nsubstantially all the rewards and risks of ownership of assets remain with the lessor are accounted for as operating leases. Lease renewal\nperiods are considered on a lease-by-lease basis and are generally not included in the initial lease terms. Upon adoption, no right-of-use\nassets nor lease liabilities was recognized as all leases were short-term leases or cancellable leases.\n(z)\nTaxation\nIncome taxes\nCurrent income taxes are provided on the basis of net income (loss) for financial reporting purposes, adjusted for income and expense\nitems which are not assessable or deductible for income tax purposes, in accordance with the regulations of the relevant tax jurisdictions.\nDeferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts\nin the consolidated financial statements, net operating loss carry forwards and credits. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured\nusing enacted rates expected to apply to taxable income in which temporary differences are expected to be reversed or settled. The effect\non deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive\nloss in the period of the enactment of the change."

The Group considers positive and negative evidence when determining\nwhether a portion or all of its deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized. This assessment considers, among other matters,\nthe nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry-\nforward periods, its experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and its tax planning strategies. The ultimate realization of deferred tax\nassets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income within the carry-forward periods provided for in the tax\nlaw and during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. When assessing the realization of deferred tax assets,\nthe Group has considered possible sources of taxable income including (i) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences,\n(ii)  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry-forwards, (iii)  future taxable income arising from\nimplementing tax planning strategies, and (iv) specific known trend of profits expected to be reflected within the industry.\nThe Company’s affiliated entities in the PRC are subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities. According to the PRC Tax\nAdministration and Collection Law, the statute of limitations is three years if the underpayment of taxes is due to computational errors\nmade by the taxpayer or the withholding agent. The statute of limitations is extended to five years under special circumstances, where the\nunderpayment of taxes is more than RMB100 ($15). In the case of transfer pricing issues, the statute of limitation is 10 years. There is no\nstatute of limitation in the case of tax evasion. Accordingly, the PRC entities remain subject to examination by the tax authorities based\non the above.\nUncertain tax positions\nIn order to assess uncertain tax positions, the Group applies a more-likely-than-not threshold and a two-step approach for the tax position\nmeasurement and financial statement recognition. Under the two-step approach, the first step is to evaluate the tax position for\nrecognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained,\nincluding resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount\nthat is more than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Group recognizes interest and penalties, if any, under accrued\nexpenses and other current liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets and under income tax expenses in its consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive loss.\nValue added Tax (“VAT”)\nThe Group is subject to VAT at the rate of 6% depending on whether the entity is a general tax payer, and related surcharges on revenue\ngenerated from providing services. Entities that are VAT general taxpayers are allowed to offset qualified input VAT, paid to suppliers\nagainst their output VAT liabilities. Net VAT balance between input VAT and output VAT is recorded in the line item of tax payable on the\nface of balance sheet. The Group records revenue net of value added tax and related surcharges.\n(aa)\nSegment reporting\nThe Group’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, reviews the consolidated results when making decisions about\nallocating resources and assessing performance of the Group as a whole and hence, the Group has only one reportable segment. The\nGroup does not distinguish between markets or segments for the purpose of internal reporting. The Group’s long-lived assets are\nsubstantially all located in the PRC and substantially all of the Group’s revenues are derived from within the PRC. Therefore, no\ngeographical segments are presented."

The two-class method is used for computing earnings per share in the event the\nGroup has net income available for distribution. Under the two-class method, net income is allocated between ordinary shares and\nparticipating securities based on dividends declared (or accumulated) and participating rights in undistributed earnings as if all the\nearnings for the reporting period had been distributed.\nBasic loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per\nshare is computed using the weighted average number of ordinary shares and potential ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\nPotential ordinary shares include ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding share options and restricted shares using the\ntreasury stock method, and convertible loan under if-convertible method. The computation of diluted net loss per share does not assume\nconversion, exercise, or contingent issuance of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e. an increase in earnings per share\namounts or a decrease in loss per share amounts) on net loss per share. Net loss per ordinary share is computed on Class A Ordinary\nShares and Class  B Ordinary Shares on the combined basis, because both classes have the same dividend rights in the Company’s\nundistributed net income.\n(cc)\nStatutory reserves\nIn accordance with China’s Company Laws and Foreign Investment Enterprises, the Company’s subsidiaries, VIEs and VIEs’\nsubsidiaries in the PRC must make appropriations from their after-tax profit (as determined under the accounting principles generally\nacceptable in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC GAAP”)) to non-distributable reserve funds. The appropriation to the statutory\nsurplus fund must be at least 10% of the after-tax profits calculated in accordance with PRC GAAP. Appropriation is not required if the\nstatutory surplus fund has reached 50% of the registered capital of the respective company. Appropriation to the discretionary surplus\nfund is made at the discretion of the respective company.\nThe use of the statutory surplus fund and discretionary surplus fund are restricted to offsetting of losses or increasing of the registered\ncapital of the respective company. None of these reserves are allowed to be transferred to the Company in terms of cash dividends, loans\nor advances, nor can they be distributed except under liquidation.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, profit appropriation to general reserve fund and statutory surplus fund for the\nGroup’s entities incorporated in the PRC was approximately RMB1,104, RMB516 and RMB716, respectively. No appropriation to other\nreserve funds was made for any of the periods presented.\n(dd)\nComprehensive loss\nComprehensive loss is defined to include all changes in shareholders’ equity/(deficit) of the Group during a period arising from\ntransactions and other events and circumstances excluding transactions resulting from investments by shareholders and distributions to\nshareholders. Accumulated other comprehensive income, as presented on the consolidated balance sheets, consists of accumulated\nforeign currency translation adjustments and unrealized loss of available for sales investment.\n(ee)\nOut-of-period corrections\nDuring 2021, the Group recorded an out-of-period adjustment to correct prior period errors relating to bad debt allowance on accounts\nreceivable of RMB2,903 and impairment of intangible assets of RMB3,096 after an amortization of RMB3,688. During 2022, the Group\nrecorded an out-of-period adjustment to correct prior period errors relating to accounts receivable of RMB6,047. The Group evaluated\nthe impacts of the out-of-period adjustment to correct the errors for year ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and for prior periods, both\nindividually and in the aggregate, and concluded that the adjustments were not material to the consolidated financial statements for\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and for all impacted periods."

Under the JOBS Act, EGC can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the\nJOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses”, which will require the measurement of all\nexpected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, to clarify that\nreceivables arising from operating leases are within the scope of lease accounting standards. Further, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04,\nASU2019-05, ASU2019-10, ASU2019-11and ASU2020-02 to provide additional guidance on the credit losses standard.\nFor the Group as an EGC, the amendments for ASU2016-13 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including\ninterim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASUs is on a modified retrospective basis. The Company adopted ASU2016-13\nfrom January 1, 2023. The Company concluded that the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nRecently issued ASUs by the FASB, except for the ones mentioned above, are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s\nconsolidated results of operations or financial position.\n3.\nConcentration and risks\nConcentration of Business Partners\nThe Group generates the majority of revenues through a limited number of Business Partners. For the years ended December 31, 2020,\n2021 and 2022, the Group generated the  49.9%,  53.8% and  49.8% of its total revenues, respectively, through cooperation with\ntop five Business Partners, among which 28.9%, 28.8% and 17.0% of total revenues were generated through cooperation with Qunar,\nwhich is a large mobile and online travel platform in China. The partnerships with these Business Partners are not on an exclusive basis,\nand the contract durations are short. If these Business Partners change their policies, terminate their partnership or do not renew their\ncooperation agreements with the Group, the business and result of operations of the Group may be materially and adversely affected.\nConcentration of Financial Partners\nThe Group have historically relied on Jimu Group, which was considered as one of the Group’s related parties, for the funding of most of\nthe loans issued by the Group. However, funding from Jimu Box decreased significantly in 2019 when Jimu Box announced its exit from\nthe online lending platform business. Beginning in February  2020, Jimu Box initiated its plans to transition into a micro finance\ncompany. Loans funded by Jimu Box were minimal for the  years ended December  31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, representing\nonly 4.0%, 0.19% and 0.28% of the outstanding loans as of December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively."

The Group records provision for credit losses based on its estimated probable losses against its financing\nreceivables. Apart from the financing receivables, financial instruments that potentially expose the Group to significant concentration of\ncredit risk primarily included in the financial statement line items of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable,\nfinancing receivables, prepayments and other current assets, financial guarantee assets, and amounts due from related parties. The Group\nholds its cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash at reputable financial institutions in the PRC and at international financial institutions\nwith high ratings from internationally recognized rating agencies. Financing receivables, accounts receivable and financial guarantee\nassets are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers in the PRC and Australia and the credit risk with\nrespect to which is mitigated by credit evaluations the Group performs on its customers and its ongoing monitoring process of\noutstanding balances. Receivables due from customers are typically unsecured in the PRC and Australia and the credit risk with respect\nto which is mitigated by credit evaluations the Group performs on its customers and its ongoing monitoring process of outstanding\nbalances.\nAmounts due from related parties, prepayments and other current assets are typically unsecured. In evaluating the collectability of the\nbalance, the Group considers many factors, including the related parties and third parties’ repayment history and their credit-worthiness.\nAn allowance for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.\nForeign currency exchange rate risk\nThe Group’s operating transactions are mainly denominated in RMB. RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currencies. The value of\nthe RMB is subject to changes by the central government policies and to international economic and political developments. In the PRC,\ncertain foreign exchange transactions are required by law to be transacted only through authorized financial institutions at exchange rates\nset by the People’s Bank of China (the “PBOC”). Remittances in currencies other than RMB by the Group in China must be processed\nthrough PBOC or other China foreign exchange regulatory bodies which require certain supporting documents in order to affect the\nremittances.\n4.\nAcquisitions\n(i) Acquisition and disposal of FT Synergy\nOn April 18, 2019, Pintec acquired 100% equity interest of FT Synergy Pty Ltd. (“FT Synergy”) for a purchase price of RMB16,191. FT\nSynergy owns a wholly owned subsidiary Infrarisk Pty Limited (“Infrarisk”), an Australia-based SaaS company providing systems to\nlenders for managing the credit risk origination process. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed and operations of Infrarisk prior to\nthe acquisition were not material. On September 27, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with NCA Development Unit Trust\n(“NCA”), a trusted company incorporated in Australia held by a third party, under which the Company transferred out 85% of its equity\ninterest in subsidiaries including FT Synergy and Infrarisk, and other VIE subsidiaries (collectively “FT Group”) at the consideration\nof nil. (the “Deconsolidation”). Upon the completion of this deconsolidation, the FT Group was deconsolidated since September 30, 2021\nas the control has transferred to NCA, the Group accounts for the remaining 15% of equity interests of FT Group afterward under long-\nterm investment. The Deconsolidation of FT Group was not a strategic shift and would not have major impact on the Group’s business,\ntherefore it was not qualified as discontinued operation. For the year ended December 31, 2021, net loss of RMB5,498 was recognized\nfor the disposal of FT Group.\n(ii) Acquisition of Qilehui\nOn August 31, 2020, the Group acquired 100% equity interest of Qilehui, a company engaged in corporation credit investigation, which\nowns a credit investigation license, with a consideration of RMB10,000  prepaid by the Company in 2019. The assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed and operations of Qilehui prior to the acquisition were not material."

(“Chuanxi\nTechnology”), for total consideration of RMB400,000 (the “Consideration”).\nAs part of the transaction, in October 2020, the Group issued a warrant (the “Warrant”) to Otov Alfa Holding Limited (the “Otov Alfa”),\nan entity designated by Ningxia Fengyin, to subscribe  320,036,576  class A ordinary shares of the Company at par value\nUS$0.000125  per share (the “Warrant Shares”). The Warrant is exercisable immediately and will expire on the third anniversary\nof October 22, 2020. If the Warrant is exercised before its expiration date, the Group will be released from the obligation of paying\ncorresponding portion of the Consideration. The un-released portion of the debt bears an annual interest rate of 8.75%, and the interest is\npayable quarterly. The Group has repaid RMB306,000 of convertible loan and proceeds another RMB19,000 from new issuance of\nconvertible loan as of December 31, 2022. Accrued interest payable was of RMB8,750 and RMB8,127 as of December 31, 2021 and\n2022. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, interest expenses were RMB5,516 and RMB35,000 and RMB21,377,\nrespectively.\nSince the Warrant is not detachable from the debt and is not a derivative, and no cash conversion features and beneficial conversion\nfeatures are contained in the instrument, the debt and the Warrant were accounted as a liability equal to the proceeds received in entirety.\nTo secure the debt due to Ningxia Fengyin, on December 2, 2020, the Group pledged 100% equity interest of Ganzhou Aixin Network\nMicro Finance Co., Ltd, a subsidiary of the Group, to Ningxia Fengyin.

(“Beijing Caissa”) entered into an equity purchase agreement with\nPintec Jinke to invest RMB20,151 in Myfin Insurance, a subsidiary of Pintec Jinke, and obtained 40% equity interest of Myfin Insurance.\nSince the Group retains control of Myfin Insurance, the investment from Beijing Caissa was accounted for as non-controlling interest.\nPursuant to an investment agreement signed in December  2019, Pintec Ganzhou and Yinchuan Xingyin Investment Fund Limited\nPartnership (“Yinchuan Xingyin”) agreed to invest RMB300,000 and RMB200,000 respectively to setup Huatai Ningxia Corporation\nConsulting Limited Partnership (“Huatai Ningxia”), the primary purpose of which is to invest in Pintec Yinchuan, a subsidiary of Pintec\nGanzhou. Pintec Ganzhou and Yinchuan Xingyin paid RMB300,000 and RMB150,000 respectively in December 2019. Since the Group\ncontrolled Huatai Ningxia after the investment, the investment from Yinchuan Xingyin was accounted for as non-controlling interest.\nIn September 2021, the Group set up Janko Loans Pty Ltd (“Janko”) and Wagepay Pty Ltd (“Wagepay”) and hold 50% and 50% equity\ninterest, respectively. Since the Group retains control of Janko and Wagepay by owning majority seats of the board, the investment from\nother shareholders of Janko and Wagepay is accounted for as non-controlling interest. Since May, 2022, Janko and Wagepay were no\nlonger accounted for as non-controlling interest due to the disposal of Pintec Australia Pty Ltd. and its subsidiaries.\n16.\nTaxation\nCayman Islands\nUnder the current laws of the Cayman Islands, the Group is not subject to tax on income or capital gain. Additionally, upon payments of\ndividends to the shareholders, no Cayman Islands withholding tax will be imposed.\nBritish Virgin Islands\nUnder the current laws of the British Virgin Islands, entities incorporated in British Virgin Islands are not subject to tax on their income\nor capital gains.\nAustralia\nUnder the current laws of the Australia, entities incorporated in Australia are subject to income tax rate at 30%.\nHong Kong\nIn accordance with the relevant tax laws and regulations of Hong Kong, a company registered in Hong Kong is subject to income taxes\nwithin Hong Kong at the applicable tax rate on taxable income. In March 2018, the Hong Kong Government introduced a two-tiered\nprofit tax rate regime by enacting the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No.3) Ordinance 2018 (the “Ordinance”). Under the two-tiered\nprofits tax rate regime, the first HK dollar 2 million of assessable profits of qualifying corporations is taxed at 8.25% and the remaining\nassessable profits at 16.5%. The Ordinance is effective from the year of assessment 2018-2019. According to the policy, if no election has\nbeen made, the whole of the taxpaying entity’s assessable profits will be chargeable to Profits Tax at the rate of 16.5% or 15%, as\napplicable. Because the preferential tax treatment is not elected by the Group, all the subsidiaries registered in Hong Kong are subject to\nincome tax at a rate of 16.5%. Payments of dividends by the subsidiary to the Group are not subject to withholding tax in Hong Kong as\nthe Group has no assessable profits during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022.\nPRC\nUnder the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”), the standard enterprise income tax rate for domestic enterprises and foreign\ninvested enterprises is 25%. Effective January 1, 2008, the EIT Law in China unifies the enterprise income tax rate for the entities\nincorporated in China at 25% if they are not eligible for any preferential tax treatment. High and new technology enterprises enjoy a\npreferential tax rate of 15% under the EIT Law."

In addition, Sky City WFOE was qualified as an eligible software enterprise before the income tax year-end\nfinal settlement in 2019. As a result of this qualification, it is entitled to a tax holiday of a full exemption for the  year ended\nDecember 31, 2019, in which its taxable income is greater than zero, followed by a three-year 50% exemption.\nPintec Beijing WFOE is qualified as a “high and new technology enterprise” under the EIT Law and is eligible for a preferential\nenterprise income tax rate of 15% for the period from 2018 to 2020, as long as it obtains approval from the relevant tax authority, and is\nprofitable during the period, it could apply the income tax rate of 15%. However, from 2021, the Company did not apply for renewal as\nthey did not expect to be profitable in the near future. Therefore, they are subject to an income tax rate of 25% from 2021.\nThe EIT Law also provides that an enterprise established under the laws of a foreign country or region but whose “de facto management\nbody” is located in the PRC be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes and consequently be subject to the PRC income tax\nat the rate of  25 % for its global income. The Implementing Rules  of the EIT Law merely define the location of the “de facto\nmanagement body “as” the place where the exercising, in substance, of the overall management and control of the production and\nbusiness operation, personnel, accounting, property, of a non-PRC company is located.” Based on a review of surrounding facts and\ncircumstances, the Group does not believe that it is likely that its operations outside of the PRC should be considered as a resident\nenterprise for the PRC tax purposes for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022.\nWithholding tax on undistributed dividends\nThe EIT law also imposes a withholding income tax of 10% on dividends distributed by a foreign investment enterprise (“FIE”) to its\nimmediate holding company outside China, if such immediate holding company is considered as a non-resident enterprise without any\nestablishment or place within China or if the received dividends have no connection with the establishment or place of such immediate\nholding company within China, unless such immediate holding company’s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that\nprovides for a different withholding arrangement. The Cayman Islands, where the Company is incorporated, does not have such tax\ntreaty with China. According to the arrangement between Mainland China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the\nAvoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion in August 2006, dividends paid by an FIE in China to its immediate\nholding company in Hong Kong will be subject to withholding tax at a rate of no more than 5%. The Group did not record any dividend\nwithholding tax, as the Group’s FIE, the PRC WFOE, has no retained earnings in any of the period presented.\nThe following table sets forth current and deferred portion of income tax expense of the Company’s China subsidiaries, overseas\nsubsidiaries, VIEs, and subsidiaries of the VIEs:\nFor the years ended December 31, \n    \n2020\n    \n2021\n    \n2022\nRMB\nRMB\nRMB\nCurrent income tax expense\n \n2,281  \n5,027  \n1,545\nDeferred income tax expense\n \n46,915  \n1,845  \n977\nIncome tax expense\n \n49,196  \n6,872  \n2,522\nLoss before income tax expense was attributable to the following geographic locations:\n    \nFor the years ended December 31,\n2020\n    \n2021\n    \n2022\nRMB\nRMB\nRMB\nPRC\n \n207,533  \n73,988  \n175,801\nOthers\n \n39,411  \n27,960  \n18,234\nTotal loss before income tax expense\n \n246,944  \n101,948  \n194,035"
