      "text": "Ritchie Bros.\n4\nPART I\nITEM 1:\nBUSINESS\nCompany Overview\nRitchie Bros. Auctioneers Incorporated (“Ritchie Bros.”, the “Company”, “we”, or “us”) (NYSE & TSX: RBA) was founded in 1958\nin Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada and is a world leader in asset management and disposition technologies for commercial assets,\nused equipment and other assets. Our expertise, unprecedented global reach, market insights, and trusted portfolio of brands provide\nus with a unique position within the used equipment market.\nThrough our unreserved auctions, online marketplaces, listings, and private brokerage services, we sell a broad range of primarily used\ncommercial and industrial assets, as well as government surplus. Construction and commercial transportation assets comprise the\nmajority of the equipment sold by GTV dollar value, though we sell a wide variety of assets. Customers selling equipment through our\nsales channels include end users (such as construction companies), equipment dealers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”)\nand other equipment owners (such as rental companies). Our customers participate in a variety of sectors, including construction,\ncommercial transportation, agriculture, energy, and natural resources.\nWe also provide our customers with a wide array of value-added services aligned with our growth strategy to create a global\nmarketplace for used equipment services and solutions. Our other services include equipment financing, asset appraisals and\ninspections, online equipment listings, logistical services, and ancillary services such as equipment refurbishment. We offer our\ncustomers asset technology solutions to manage the end-to-end disposition process of their assets and provide market data intelligence\nto make more accurate and reliable business decisions. Additionally, we offer our customers an innovative technology platform that\nsupports equipment lifecycle management and parts procurement integration with both original equipment manufacturers and dealers,\nas well as a software as a service platform for end-to-end parts procurement, and access to digital catalogs and diagrams.\nWe operate globally with locations in 13 countries, including the U.S., Canada, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and the\nNetherlands, and maintain a presence in 42 countries where customers can sell from their own yards. We employ more than 2,800 full-\ntime employees worldwide.\nProposed Acquisition of IAA\nOn November 7, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, which was subsequently\namended on January 22, 2023 (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which it agreed to acquire IAA, Inc., a leading global digital\nmarketplace connecting vehicle buyers and sellers. IAA stockholders will receive $12.80 in cash and 0.5252 common shares of the\nCompany for each share of IAA common stock they own. Accordingly, the Company will (i) issue approximately 70.3 million shares\nof its common stock to the stockholders of IAA and (ii) pay to the stockholders of IAA approximately $1.7 billion in cash\nconsideration. In addition, the Company will repay approximately $1.2 billion of IAA’s net debt. The acquisition of IAA is expected\nto close in the first half of 2023, subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, including, among other things, (1) the approval of the\nissuance of our common shares by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of our outstanding common shares,\n(2) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of IAA’s common stock, and (3) other\ncustomary closing conditions.\nThe Company plans to fund the proposed acquisition of IAA through a combination of cash, borrowings under its credit facilities and\nproceeds from the sale of debt securities. In connection with the Merger Agreement, the Company entered into a debt commitment\nletter with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to certain terms and conditions, the bridge loan facility in an\naggregate principal amount of up to $2.8 billion and a backstop senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal\namount of up to $750.0 million. On December 9, 2022, the Company subsequently closed an amendment to its existing credit\nagreement with a syndicate of lenders pursuant to which, among other things, the Company obtained (a) amendments to the facility to\nspecifically permit the proposed acquisition of IAA (b) commitments for a term loan A facility in an aggregate principal amount of up\nto $1.8 billion to be used to finance the proposed IAA acquisition and (c) the ability to borrow up to $200.0 million of the revolving\nfacility on a limited conditionality basis to finance the proposed IAA acquisition. The amendment allowed the Company to\npermanently terminate the backstop senior revolving credit commitments and reduce the senior secured bridge facility commitments\nby the amount of the term loan A facility and the amount of the existing term loans under the existing credit agreement."

      "text": "Ritchie Bros.\n5\nOn January 23, 2023, the Company announced that it expects to approve the payment of a one-time special dividend to the Company’s\nshareholders in the amount of $1.08 per share, contingent upon the completion of the merger and consent of the TSX. IAA stockholders\nwill not be entitled to receive the special dividend with respect to any of the Company’s common shares received as consideration. We\nwill not pay the special dividend if the Merger Agreement is terminated or if the merger is not completed. Furthermore, if the Merger\nAgreement is terminated under specified circumstances, the Company or IAA may be required to pay the other a termination amount of\n$189 million or the Company may be required to reimburse IAA for its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the Merger\nAgreement up to an aggregate amount of $5 million.\nWe believe that the proposed acquisition of IAA accelerates our journey to become the trusted global marketplace for insights,\nservices and transaction solutions. The transaction is expected to diversify our customer base by providing the Company with a\nsignificant presence in the vehicle remarketing vertical that has strong industry fundamentals with proven secular growth. We believe\nthat the combination will accelerate our growth and strategic vision to create a next-generation global marketplace for commercial\nassets and vehicles, supported by advanced technologies and data analytics. Additionally, our management team has extensive\nexperience in the automotive and insurance ecosystem, which we believe will help shape the go-forward customer experience. With\nenhanced scale and an expanded addressable market, the Company believes it will be able to drive additional GTV growth through its\nplatforms and auction sites, in turn generating more insights for its customers and expanding the adoption of our other high-margin\ntech-enabled services.\nImpact of Russia-Ukraine Conflict on Our Business\nOn February 24, 2022, the geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe intensified with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, sharply affecting\neconomic and global financial markets. Subsequent economic sanctions on Russia have exacerbated ongoing economic challenges,\nincluding issues such as rising inflation, disruption to global supply chains and increases in hydrocarbon prices.\nThe rise in transportation costs, in part driven by higher fuel costs, has globally impacted both costs and timing of import and export\nof commercial assets between countries and has contributed to higher costs in operating our equipment. Further, increases in natural\ngas prices in Europe may also lead to a slowdown in its economy and as a result may negatively impact the import and export of\nequipment in Eastern Europe, which could affect our operations.\nWe do not have any operations in Russia or Ukraine or any material operations in neighboring countries. We have a limited number of\ndirect customers in the effected region and have sourced a limited number of assets in 2022 from neighboring countries to sell through\nour operations. However, we cannot estimate the extent of the ongoing conflict’s impacts or future developments, including the\ncontinued evolution of military activity and sanctions imposed with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which could adversely affect the\ndomestic economy generally and our business specifically.\nImpact of Inflation on Our Business\nInflation impacted our global business operations in 2022, with the rise of costs in freight, fuel, supplies, labor, non-durable goods and\nconsumables at our yards and in our operations. Our travel costs have also increased, partly due to higher travel activity post\npandemic, increased travel to support our growth strategy and acquisitions, as well as due to inflation. In addition, we have seen an\nincrease in labor costs with the labor market remaining fairly strong. We expect inflationary pressures to continue into 2023 and we\nregularly evaluate operational productivity improvements that may offset these pressures while continuing to drive growth and strong\nfinancial performance.\nThe United States Federal Reserve is also continuing to raise interest rates, contributing to a stronger U.S. dollar, which has had an\nunfavorable impact on the translation of some of our operations to a U.S. dollar presentation currency, particularly in Canada, Europe\nand Australia.\nImpact of COVID-19 and Supply Chain Constraints to Our Business\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic (“COVID-19”). In response,\nwe transitioned all of our traditional live onsite auctions to online bidding utilizing our existing online bidding technology. In 2022,\nwith the lifting of travel restrictions and quarantine requirements we began to return to live in-person onsite bidding at some of our\nauction events, offering both onsite and online bidding, and we significantly improved our ability to move equipment to and from our\nauction sites and across borders. However, we also saw heightened transportation costs, extended lead times and supply chain delays\nand disruptions, negatively impacting our business and the buying and selling behaviours of our customers. Supply of equipment was"

In our operations, we also incurred higher maintenance costs from the delay in\nturnover of our leased vehicle fleets. These impacts were partly due to the impact of COVID -19, but also partly due to other more\nrecent macroeconomic factors such as inflation and the Russian-Ukraine conflict.\nStrategy\nOur strategy to become the trusted global marketplace for insights, services and transaction solutions for commercial assets and\nvehicles will help us address the large and fragmented used equipment marketplace that we operate in today. We believe our strategy\nwill help us unlock significant growth opportunities by building on Ritchie Bros.’ core business and expanding into additional\nservices.

We estimate the used equipment auction segment is $30 billion. Ritchie Bros. is the largest auction company with\napproximately $6.0 billion in GTV volume in 2022. We compete based on breadth, brand reputation, security, technology, and global\nreach of our services, as well as in the variety of contracts and methods and channels of selling equipment. In addition to the auction\nsegment, other major segments include brokers, as well as the retail segment which includes OEMs, OEM dealers, rental companies\nand large strategic accounts. We also compete with private sales – often securing new business from equipment owners who had\npreviously tried selling their equipment privately. Given the fragmentation in the auction market as well as upstream opportunities in\nprivate sales and retail, there is significant opportunity for growth."

We also periodically hire\ncontractors as needed to support our auctions, various businesses, and other projects.\nOf our total full-time employees, 966 people work locally in the field to support our global auction operations (2021: 950) and 421\npeople are focused on sales and solutions for our customers (2021: 394).\nDevelopment and Engagement\nWe believe that our people are our greatest asset and that engaged employees are paramount to the health and success of our business.\nWe invest in a variety of training, development and engagement practices to deliver on our growth agenda and create more leaders.\nIn 2022, we invested $1.4 million in employee development (2021: $1.7 million) and $0.6 million in development for sales employees\n(2021: $1.3 million). All full-time employees are encouraged to have development plans that focus on functional and career growth.\nWe provide all our employees access to instructor-led courses, as well as a library of over 3,000 online courses, videos, books, and\nresources for ongoing personal, functional, and professional growth. In addition, our Tuition Reimbursement program provides tuition\nassistance to eligible employees for professional development courses outside of the organization. We have curated tools and\nresources and developed training programs to provide our leaders and employees with the skills to successfully work remotely and\nmanage the challenges in these uncertain times. We check in with our employees through pulse surveys and communicate through\ndistribution of a weekly newsletter named #RitchieStrong. Our newsletter, which comes directly from our CEO to all of our\nemployees, promotes our successes, highlights our people and encourages social distancing and safety practices.

Employees\nare involved in strategic initiatives and finding ways to better serve our customers and each other.\nHealth & Safety\nOur objective is to keep our people healthy and safe – to send everyone home, every day, the way they came to work.\nAll new employees are required to complete a safety onboarding training that captures our health and safety programs, our policy\nstatement and provides an overview of our global Employee Health and Safety (“EHS”) policies and expectations. Our 2022\ncompletion rate for the safety onboarding program was 93.4% (2021: 98%).\nWe also have a risk management process to support our safety orientation programs and our health and safety commitment which\nensures that our employees are exposed to the lowest possible level of risk. Our risk management process begins with an annual\nreview of all incidents from the prior year to identify trends to see if we need to address findings through changes in our policies and\nprocedures.\nDaily, our employees conduct either a field level hazard assessment or complete a risk identification card to identify risks relating to\nthe performance of their roles. These risk identification cards are monitored by our yard managers and/or our regional operations\nmanagers and corrective actions are taken to ensure that the risk is reduced or eliminated. During 2022 we had over 17,000 (2021:\n14,000) risk identification cards completed by our staff.\nWe also conduct annual online safety training with employees who perform certain operational tasks. In 2022, our completion rate for\nthis training was 91% (2021: 98.5%). In 2022 we switched platforms on which the training was provided, and as a result the online\nsafety training was only available from January to June contributing to the lower completion rate. Additionally, in 2022, managers at\nour sites were also required to complete a series of online courses as part of their professional development. In 2022, we had a\ncompletion rate of over 94% (2021: 94.5%).\nWe also measure our Total Recordable Injury Rate (“TRIR”) which measures the number of reportable incidences per 100 full-time\nworkers during the year. Our annual TRIR goal is to meet or do better by being below the industrial average. TRIR for 2022 was 1.14\n(2021: 1.38), which was below the industrial average.\nEvery region within our organization also has a Safety Steering team that provides feedback on our safety journey and assists in\nidentifying issues or concerns that may arise. Our success in health and safety relies on everyone taking an active role in the\ndevelopment and implementation of our programs, participating in training and providing feedback on our progress in our safety\njourney.\nDiversity & Inclusion\nWe aspire to have a culture that fosters respect, inclusion and opportunity for growth for all, where everyone feels like they belong.\nSpecifically, we want our teams to understand the strength of diversity, the power that comes from an inclusive environment and the\neffect it can have on our teams, customers and stakeholders. Outlined below are the initiatives that demonstrate our dedication to\ndiversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”).\nGender Diversity and Equality\nWe continue to be committed to gender diversity. Representation of women at our most senior executive leadership level is at 33%\n(2021: 40%). We also continue to maintain strong representation of women at the Board of Directors level with four (out of nine)\nBoard members being women, representing 44% (2021: 50%) of the Board. Approximately 36% of our full-time employees are\nwomen and 64% are men, consistent with 2021."

In late 2021, a book club was\nformed to further foster connections and dialogue among its members. In 2022, the BLM Committee made a donation to Title I\nschools in Atlanta to help students, including students from low-income families, expanded the number of profiles on Black History\nMonth and promoted several roundtable discussions.\nIn 2021, we further delivered on our commitment to create a framework to support our employees’ diverse needs by establishing two\nnew ERGs – Pride and SERVE. In 2022, the core teams for each group worked to support and bring awareness about issues facing the\ncommunities of focus for their groups as outlined below.\nThe Pride ERG, which focuses on creating a welcoming and inclusive workplace for Two Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,\nqueer or questioning, and nonbinary (2SLGBTQ+) employees, had a positive impact in 2022 by donating funds to GATE, an\ninternational advocacy organization working towards justice and equality for transgender, gender diverse and intersex communities, in\nhonor of International Transgender Day of Visibility. The Company also made a donation to the Human Rights Watch LGBT\nprogram, which documents and exposes abuses based on sexual orientation and gender identity worldwide, in honor of International\nDay Against Homophobia, Transphobia & Biphobia. The ERG also participated in and celebrated Pride month.\nThe SERVE ERG embraces our proud community of military service members and Veteran colleagues by building awareness and\nproviding resources to past or present military service members and their families. We became the main sponsor for the Lincoln\nMarathon in 2022 a celebration of the Lincoln, Nebraska community, which included sponsorship of a veteran and three members of\nthe National Guard running the marathon. SERVE ERG also honored Memorial Day, Remembrance Day and Veteran Day by sharing\nservice stories of Ritchie Bros. colleagues and family members who have served or are serving in the military throughout the month of\nNovember.\nWe are committed to investing the time and resources needed to ensure we continue to live up to our diversity, equality and inclusion\nvision of having a culture that fosters respect, inclusion and opportunity of growth for all, where everyone feels like they belong."

Our objective is to continue to engage in efforts to maintain community giving as our\nemployees are passionate about having a meaningful impact in their communities.\nIn 2021, we developed a community giving framework centered around supporting local economies and people in the communities in\nwhich we operate. In 2022, we delivered on this framework by launching the #RitchieGives Community Impact platform in Canada\nand the United States to allow employees to sign up for volunteer opportunities and complete charitable donations with the Company\nmatching donations. In Canada, in 2021, we established the Ritchie Bros. Community Impact fund to support causes across Canada\nand in 2022, in the United States, we granted funds to Local Initiatives Support Corporation’s (LISC) Bridges Careers Opportunities\nprogram, which connects unemployed and underemployed people to career and training pathways in heavy machinery related fields in\nthe Los Angeles area, a region of expected growth.\nFlexible Workplace\nCOVID-19 has changed the way we work and, to maintain the health and well-being of all employees, employees who are able to\nwork remotely continued to do so throughout 2022. Flexibility has become the future of work at Ritchie Bros. as we work to support\nemployees’ safety, health and well-being while continuing to meet business needs in a hybrid world.\nEthical Conduct\nOur success and reputation are founded upon our commitment to honesty, integrity, and doing what is right—each element highlighted\nunder our value of Integrity. Our objective is to monitor and facilitate reporting of unethical conduct. We do this by maintaining a\nconfidential and anonymous independent third-party telephone line and web access hotline for anyone to submit concerns regarding\npotential code violations or other ethics-related matters without fear of repercussions. All reported matters are investigated fully and\nreported to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nEnvironmental, Social & Governance\nWe have advanced our commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) matters in 2022 and developed a ESG\nframework to help guide and communicate our high-level goals, targets and performance metrics. We also updated our ESG\ngovernance structure and identified individuals to advance and integrate our ESG objectives.\nEnvironmental\nThe Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing the protection of the environment, health\nand safety, the use, transport and disposal of hazardous substances and control of emissions including greenhouse gases into the\nenvironment. Compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or global\ncompetitive position. However, climate change initiatives and changing laws and regulations governing the environment may affect\nthe supply of, the demand for, and the market values of equipment in the future.\nWe support the transition to a low-carbon world through enabling a circular economy of vehicles and equipment and through our\nefforts to manage our greenhouse gas emissions. We engage our customers to optimize the use and efficiency of equipment, to re-use,\nrefurbish and recycle before disposition, as extending the life of heavy equipment is core to our business model. In turn, we believe\nthis reduces waste and lessens the need to extract natural resources to produce equipment. Our largest sources of emissions are direct\ncombustion of diesel fuel and natural gas, as well as our electricity consumption. During 2022, we invested in developing our baseline\ninventory of our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions and have a target of completing our Scope 3 inventory in 2023 to allow us to\nset reduction targets in 2024 and in the future. In addition, we improved the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations to lessen\nour environmental footprint in delivering our services. We provide virtual ramping which allows large machines to be sold by video\nscreen and eliminates emissions from transportation of equipment across the ramp. We also improved yard lanes and optimized the\nequipment delivery and loadout schedules to minimize equipment movement and idling.\nWe continue our commitment to environmental management by ensuring availability of treatment systems to manage wastewater, a\nrecycling system to promote waste management and air filtration systems when necessary. We also promote environmentally\nconscious facilities including electrification at our sites and corporate offices."

GTV and A&M segment\nrevenues tend to increase during the second and fourth calendar quarters, during which time we generally conduct more business than\nin the first and third calendar quarters. Given the operating leverage inherent in our business model, the second and fourth quarter also\ntend to produce higher operating margins, given the higher volume and revenue generated in those quarters.\nRevenue Mix Fluctuations\nOur revenue is comprised of service revenue and inventory sales revenue. Service revenue from A&M segment activities includes\ncommissions earned at our auctions, online marketplaces, and private brokerage services, and various auction-related fees, including\nlisting and buyer transaction fees. We also recognize fees from our Other Services activities as service revenue. Inventory sales\nrevenue is recognized as part of our A&M activities and relates to revenues earned through our inventory contracts.\nInventory sales revenue can fluctuate significantly, as it changes based on whether our customers sell using a straight or guarantee\ncommission contract, or an inventory contract. Straight or guarantee commission contracts will result in the commission being\nrecognized as service revenue, while inventory contracts will result in the gross transaction value of the equipment sold being recorded\nas inventory sales revenue with the related cost recognized in cost of inventory sold.

Also, engine emission standards in some\njurisdictions limit the operation of certain trucks and equipment in those regions.\n\nDevelopment or expansion of auction sites. Such activities depend upon the receipt of required licenses, permits, and other\ngovernmental authorizations. We are also subject to various local zoning requirements pertaining to the location of our auction\nsites, which vary among jurisdictions.\n\nThe use, storage, discharge, and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. Under such laws, an owner or lessee of, or other\nperson involved in, real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances\nlocated on or in, or emanating from, such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage.

Information in this section may be considered “forward-looking statements.” See “Cautionary\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of certain qualifications regarding such statements.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Acquisition of IAA\nThe pendency of our acquisition of IAA or our failure to complete such acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nOn November 7, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization with IAA (the “Merger Agreement”),\namended on January 22, 2023, providing for our acquisition of IAA. Consummation of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of\nvarious conditions, including, among other things, (1) the approval of the issuance of our common shares by the affirmative vote of a\nmajority of the votes cast by holders of our outstanding common shares, (2) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by holders of a\nmajority of the outstanding shares of IAA’s common stock, and (3) other customary closing conditions.\nThe acquisition may be delayed, and may ultimately not be completed, due to a number of factors, including the failure to satisfy these\nconditions to the completion of the acquisition, or the possibility that a material adverse effect on our business or IAA’s business\nwould permit IAA or us, respectively, not to close the acquisition. There is no assurance that all of the various conditions will be\nsatisfied or waived, or that the acquisition will be completed on the proposed terms, within the expected timeframe, or at all. Also,\npotential litigation filed against us or IAA could prevent or delay the completion of the acquisition or result in the payment of damages\nfollowing completion of the acquisition.\nIn the event that the proposed acquisition is not consummated or is materially delayed for any reason, we will have spent considerable\ntime and resources, and incurred substantial costs related to the acquisition, many of which must be paid even if the acquisition is not\ncompleted. If the acquisition is not completed, our business and shareholders would be exposed to additional risks, including, but not\nlimited to the following: (a) to the extent that the market price of our common shares reflects an assumption that the acquisition will\nbe completed, the price of our common shares could decrease if the acquisition is not completed; (b) investor confidence could\ndecline, litigation could be brought against us, relationships with existing and prospective sellers, customers, service providers,\ninvestors and other business partners may be adversely impacted, we may be unable to retain key personnel, and profitability may be\nadversely impacted due to costs incurred in connection with the pending acquisition; and (c) the requirement that we pay a termination\nfee of $189 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances.\nAlso, during the period prior to the closing of the acquisition, our business will be exposed to certain inherent risks due to the potential\nimpact of the announcement or pendency of the acquisition on our business, financial condition and operating results, including, but\nnot limited to the following: (a) the possibility of disruption to our business and operations, including diversion of management\nattention and resources; (b) the inability to attract and retain key personnel, and the possibility that our current employees could be\ndistracted and their productivity decline, due to uncertainty regarding the pending acquisition; (c) the inability to pursue alternative\nbusiness opportunities or make material changes to our business pending the completion of the acquisition; (d)\nthe amount of the\ncosts, fees, expenses and charges related to the acquisition; and (e) other developments beyond our control, including, but not limited\nto, changes in domestic or global economic conditions, capital markets and interest rates that may affect the timing or success of the\nproposed acquisition.\nWhile the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities.\nWhile the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are generally required to use reasonable efforts to conduct our business in the ordinary\ncourse in all material respects, and are restricted from taking certain actions set forth in the Merger Agreement without IAA’s prior\nconsent. These limitations include, among other things, certain restrictions on our ability to amend our organizational documents,\nacquire other businesses and assets that would reasonably be expected to delay or impair the consummation of the acquisition, dispose\nof certain assets, reclassify or issue certain securities, and pay dividends (other than our regular quarterly dividend). These restrictions"

We may not realize these business\nopportunities and cost synergies to the extent expected or at all. Further, our management might have its attention diverted while\ntrying to integrate operations and corporate and administrative infrastructures. The post-closing integration process could take longer\nthan anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses, tax costs or\ninefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures and policies, any of which could\nadversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees or other third parties, or our ability to achieve the\nanticipated benefits of the transaction, and could harm our financial performance. If we are unable to successfully or timely integrate\nthe operations of IAA’s business with our business, we may incur unanticipated liabilities and be unable to realize the revenue growth,\nsynergies and other anticipated benefits resulting from the proposed transaction, and our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition could be adversely affected.\nWe will incur a substantial amount of debt to complete the acquisition of IAA, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe will incur significant debt to complete the acquisition of IAA, including borrowing up to $2.8 billion under a bridge loan facility,\ninclusive of $1.8 billion of bridge commitments with term A loan commitments, or pursuant to other permanent financing that\nreplaces such facility, which may include the issuance of debt securities and/or one or more senior term loan facilities. On an expected\ncombined company basis, we expect that together with IAA, we would have approximately $3.4 billion of indebtedness, excluding\n$709.8 million of undrawn commitments under our revolving credit facility. Our ability to make payments on our debt, fund our other\nliquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our historical financial\nresults have been, and we anticipate that our future financial results will be, subject to fluctuations. Our ability to generate cash is\nsubject in part to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We\ncannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to\nus in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt, fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital\nexpenditures. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund debt service obligations, we could face substantial\nliquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or\noperations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. The degree to which we are currently\nleveraged and will be leveraged following the completion of the acquisition of IAA could have important consequences for\nshareholders. For example, it could: (a) limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital\nexpenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements; (b) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow\nfrom operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital\nexpenditures, acquisitions, dividends and other corporate purposes; (c) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic or\nindustry conditions; (d) expose us to the risk of increased interest rates for any borrowings at variable rates of interest; (e) limit our\nflexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our industry; and (f) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to\nbusinesses in our industry that have less debt.\nAdditionally, our debt agreements, including any agreements that we may enter into in connection with the proposed acquisition of\nIAA, may contain a number of covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in\nacts that may be in our long-term best interests. Any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could\nresult in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on us.\nSignificant costs have been incurred and are expected to be incurred in connection with the consummation and integration of the\nacquisition of IAA.\nWe expect to incur one-time costs in connection with integrating our operations, products and personnel with those of IAA, in addition\nto costs related directly to completing the acquisition. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred as we integrate our business\nwith IAA following the closing.

The integration of\nour operations with those of acquired businesses, including IAA, is intended to result in financial and operational benefits, including\ncertain tax and run-rate synergies. There can be no assurance, however, regarding when or the extent to which we will be able to\nrealize these and other benefits. Integration may also be difficult, unpredictable and subject to delay because of possible company\nculture conflicts and different opinions on future business development. We may be required to integrate or, in some cases, replace,\nnumerous systems, including those involving management information, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, employee\nbenefits, payroll and regulatory compliance, many of which may be dissimilar. Difficulties associated with the integration of acquired\nbusinesses could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, in connection with acquisitions, we have assumed, and may assume in connection with future acquisitions, certain\npotential liabilities. To the extent such liabilities are not identified by us or to the extent indemnifications obtained from third parties\nare insufficient to cover such liabilities, these liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFor a description of risks related to our pending acquisition of IAA, see “Risks Related to the Proposed Acquisition of IAA” below.\nDamage to our reputation could harm our business.\nOne of our founding principles is that we operate a fair and transparent business, and consistently act with integrity. Maintaining a\npositive reputation is key to our ability to attract and maintain customers, investors and employees. Damage to our reputation could\ncause significant harm to our business. Harm to our reputation could arise in a number of ways, including, but not limited to,\nemployee conduct which is not aligned with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (and associated Company policies around\nbehavioural expectations) or our Company’s core values, safety incidents, failure to maintain customer service standards, loss of trust\nin the fairness of our sales processes, and other technology or compliance failures.\nWe may incur losses as a result of our guarantee and inventory contracts and advances to consignors.\nOur most common type of auction contract is a straight commission contract, under which we earn a pre-negotiated, fixed commission\nrate on the gross sales price of the consigned equipment at auction. We use straight commission contracts when we act as agent for\nconsignors. In recent years, a majority of our annual business has been conducted on a straight commission basis. In certain other\nsituations, we will enter into underwritten transactions and either offer to (a) guarantee a minimum level of sale proceeds to the\nconsignor, regardless of the ultimate selling price of the consignment; or (b) purchase the equipment outright from the seller for sale\nthrough one of our sales channels.\nWe determine the level of guaranteed proceeds or inventory purchase price based on appraisals performed on equipment by our\ninternal personnel. Inaccurate appraisals could result in guarantees or inventory values that exceed the realizable auction proceeds. In\naddition, a change in market values could also result in guarantee or inventory values exceeding the realizable auction proceeds. If\nauction proceeds are less than the guaranteed amount, our commission will be reduced, and we could potentially incur a loss, and, if\nauction proceeds are less than the purchase price we paid for equipment that we take into inventory temporarily, we will incur a loss.\nBecause a majority of our auctions are unreserved, there is no way for us to protect against these types of losses by bidding on or\nacquiring any of the items at such auctions. In addition, we do not hold inventory indefinitely waiting for market conditions to\nimprove. If our exposure to underwritten contracts increases, this risk would be compounded.\nOccasionally, we advance to consignors a portion of the estimated auction proceeds prior to the auction. We generally make these\nadvances only after taking possession of the assets to be auctioned and upon receipt of a security interest in the assets to secure the\nobligation. If we were unable to auction the assets or if auction proceeds were less than amounts advanced, we could incur a loss.\nAdditionally, we have two vendor contracts with the U.S. Government’s Defense Logistics Agency (“DLA”) pursuant to which we\nacquire, manage and resell certain assets of the DLA. Each of the DLA contracts obliges the Company to purchase rolling and non-"

In many cases, the type of assets\npurchased are not what we typically sell through any of our other channels. Although the prices we pay for the non-rolling stock\ninventory are a fraction of the original acquisition value, we may not have the ability to attract buyers for those assets and we may be\nunable to sell those assets on a timely basis or at all. This would have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe availability and performance of our technology infrastructure, including our websites, is critical to our business and\ncontinued growth.\nThe satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our websites, online bidding service, auction management systems,\nenterprise resource planning system, transaction processing systems, network infrastructure and customer relationship management\nsystem are important to our reputation, our business and our continued growth. We currently rely on both our own proprietary\ntechnology and licensed on-premise systems, as well as third-party cloud computing platform providers located in the United States\nand other countries. The technology and systems we rely on may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware\nor software defects or malfunctions, denial of service or ransomware attacks and other cybersecurity events, human error and natural\nevents beyond our control. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our recovery planning may not be sufficient for all\npossible disruptions. Further, licensed hardware, software and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at\nreasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software or cloud\ncomputing platforms or the loss of the functionality of our internet systems could significantly increase our expenses, damage our\nreputation and otherwise result in delays in provisioning of our services. Our business and results of operations would be particularly\nharmed if we were to lose access to or the functionality of our internet systems for any reason, especially if such loss of service\nprevented internet bidders from effectively participating in one of our auctions.\nConsumer behavior is rapidly changing, and if we are unable to successfully adapt to consumer preferences and develop and\nmaintain a relevant and reliable inventory management and multichannel disposition experience for our customers, our financial\nperformance and brand image could be adversely affected.\nOur business continues to evolve into a one-stop inventory management and multichannel disposition company where customers can\nbuy, sell, or list equipment, when, how, and where they choose- both onsite and online, and manage their existing fleets and/or\ninventory using our online inventory management tools. As a result of this evolution, increasingly we interact with our customers\nacross a variety of different channels, including live auction, online, through mobile technologies, including the Ritchie Bros. mobile\napp, social media, and inventory management systems. Our customers are increasingly using tablets and mobile phones to make\npurchases online and to get detailed equipment information for assets that they own or are interested in purchasing. Our customers\nalso engage with us online, including through social media, by providing feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our\nbusiness. Consumer shopping patterns are rapidly changing and our success depends on our ability to anticipate and implement\ninnovations in customer experience and logistics in order to appeal to customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet\ntheir equipment management and disposition needs. Our ability to provide a high quality and efficient customer experience is also\ndependent on external factors over which we may have little or no control, including, without limitation, the reliability and\nperformance of the equipment sold in our marketplaces and the performance of third-party carriers who transport purchased\nequipment on behalf of buyers. If for any reason we are unable to implement our inventory management, data solutions, bidding tools\nand other multichannel initiatives, provide a convenient and consistent experience for our customers across all channels, or provide\nour customers the services they want, when and where they want them at a compelling value proposition, then our financial\nperformance and brand image could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on data provided by third parties, the loss of which could limit the functionality of certain of our platforms and disrupt our\nbusiness.\nOur analytics teams rely on asset, pricing and other data including personal data provided to us by our customers and other third\nparties. Some of this data is provided to us pursuant to third-party data sharing policies and terms of use, under data sharing\nagreements by third-party providers or by customers with consent. If in the future any of these parties could change their data sharing\npolicies and terms of use, including by making them more restrictive, terminating or not renewing agreements, or, if customers revoke\ntheir consent, any of which could result in the loss of, or significant impairment to, our ability to collect and provide useful data or\nrelated services to our customers.\nThese third parties could also interpret our data collection and use policies or practices as being inconsistent with their policies or\nbusiness objectives, or lose confidence in our data protection and privacy practices, which could result in the loss of our ability to"

Any such changes could impair our ability to deliver our analytics service to our customers in the manner currently\nanticipated or at all, impairing the return on investment that our customers derive from using our analytics platform and related\nproducts, as well as adversely affecting our business and our ability to generate revenue.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes in this or other regulations could\nsubstantially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to federal, provincial, state and local laws, rules and regulations governing the internet and e-commerce. Existing and\nfuture laws and regulations may impede the growth of the internet, e-commerce or other services, and increase the cost of doing\nbusiness, including providing online auction services. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data\nprotection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts, and other communications, consumer protection, broadband\nresidential internet access and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not always clear how existing laws governing issues such\nas property ownership, digital, sales and similar taxes, libel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. Changes to\nlaws, rules and regulations and unfavorable resolution of these issues may harm our business and results of operations.\nIf our ability, or the ability of our third party service partners, cloud computing platform providers or third party data center\nhosting facilities, to safeguard the reliability, integrity and confidentiality of our and their information technology systems is\ncompromised, if unauthorized access is obtained to our systems or customers’, suppliers', counterparties' and employees'\nconfidential information, or if authorized access is blocked or disabled, we may incur significant reputational harm, legal\nexposure, or a negative financial impact.\nWe rely on information technology (“IT”) resources to manage and operate our business, including maintaining proprietary databases\ncontaining sensitive and confidential information about our customers, suppliers, counterparties and employees (which may include\npersonal information and credit information) and utilizing approved third-party technology providers to support the management and\noperation of IT systems and infrastructure. As the malicious tools and techniques used to breach, obtain unauthorized access to or\nimpair IT systems and devices and the data processed thereby become more sophisticated and change frequently, the risk of a\ncybersecurity event increases, given that we may not be able to anticipate these malicious tools and techniques or to implement\nadequate preventative and protective measures. Unauthorized parties have in the past, and may also in the future, attempt to gain\naccess to our and our providers’ primary and backup systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into IT systems or\nfacilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving our and their employees or contractors. Although we have policies restricting the\naccess to the personal and confidential information we store, there is a risk that these policies may not be effective in all cases.\nRansomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe, and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss\nof data and income, reputational loss, and diversion of funds. Further, breaches experienced by other companies may also be leveraged\nagainst us and sophisticated actors can mask their attacks, making them increasingly difficult to identify and prevent. There can be no\nassurance that impacts from these incidents will not be material or significant in the future.\nIn addition, our limited control over our customers may affect the security and integrity of our IT systems and create financial or legal\nexposure. For example, our customers may accidentally disclose their passwords, use insecure passwords, or store them on a device\nthat is lost or stolen, providing bad actors with access to a customer’s account and the possible means to redirect customer payments.\nFurther, users on our platforms could have vulnerabilities on their own devices that are entirely unrelated to our systems and platforms\nbut could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to us. Under credit card payment rules and our contracts with credit card\nprocessors, if there is a breach of payment card information used to process transactions, we could be liable to the payment card\nissuing banks for certain fraudulent credit card transactions and other payment disputes with customers, including the cost of issuing\nnew cards and related expenses. If we were liable for a significant number of fraudulent transactions or unable to accept payment\ncards, our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nAlthough we implement, maintain and adjust information security measures to mitigate our risks with respect to IT-related\ncybersecurity incidents, there can be no assurance that these measures will ensure that our operations are not disrupted, that we will\nprevent an attack from occurring in the future, or that our internal controls, for instance relating to user access management, will\nperform as intended to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and data. Any breach of our IT systems may have a material\nadverse impact on our business, the assessment of the performance of our internal control environment, results of operations,\nreputation, stock price and our ability to access capital markets, and may also be deemed to contribute to a material weakness in\ninternal controls over financial reporting."

We may be required\nto make significant expenditures and divert management attention to monitor, detect and prevent security events, to remediate known\nor potential security vulnerabilities, or to alleviate problems caused by any security events. In addition, circumvention of our security\nmeasures may result in the loss or misappropriation of valuable business data, intellectual property or trade secret information,\nmisappropriation of our customers’ or employees’ personal information, damage to our computing infrastructure, networks and stored\ndata, service delays, key personnel being unable to perform duties or communicate throughout the organization, loss of sales,\nsignificant costs for data restoration and other adverse impacts on our business. Further, such a breach may require us to incur\nsignificant expenses to notify governmental agencies, individuals or other third parties pursuant to various privacy and security laws.\nThe costs of mitigating cybersecurity risks are significant and are likely to increase in the future. Our third-party service providers\nmay be vulnerable to interruption or loss of valuable business data and information of our customers and employees (among others).\nData stored by our third party providers might be improperly accessed or unavailable due to a variety of events beyond our control,\nincluding, but not limited to, employee error or negligence, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer\nviruses, hackers and other security issues. Additionally, if any of our third-party technology providers violate applicable laws or our\ncontracts or policies, such violations may also put our customers’ information at risk and could in turn have a material and adverse\neffect on our business. These issues are likely to become costlier as we grow. Our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse\nus for losses caused by security breaches, and we may not be able to fully collect, if at all, under these insurance policies.\nOur future expenses may increase significantly and our operations and ability to expand may be limited as a result of licenses,\nlaws and regulations governing auction sites, environmental protection, international trade and other matters.\nA variety of federal, provincial, state and local laws, rules and regulations throughout the world apply to our business, relating to,\namong other things, tax and accounting rules, the auction business, imports and exports of equipment, property ownership laws,\nlicensing, worker safety, privacy and security of customer information, land use and the use, storage, discharge and disposal of\nenvironmentally sensitive materials. Complying with revisions to laws, rules and regulations could result in an increase in expenses\nand a deterioration of our financial performance. Failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations could result in\nsubstantial liability to us, suspension or cessation of some or all of our operations, restrictions on our ability to expand at present\nlocations or into new locations, requirements for the acquisition of additional equipment or other significant expenses or restrictions.\nThe development or expansion of auction sites depends upon receipt of required licenses, permits and other governmental\nauthorizations. Our inability to obtain these required items could harm our business. Additionally, changes or concessions required by\nregulatory authorities could result in significant delays in, or prevent completion of, such development or expansion. International\nbidders and consignors could be deterred from participating in our auctions if governmental bodies impose additional export or import\nregulations or additional duties, taxes or other charges on exports or imports. Reduced participation by international bidders and\nconsignors could reduce GTV and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder some environmental laws, an owner, operator or lessee of, or other person involved in, real estate may be liable for the costs of\nremoval or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances located on or in, or emanating from, the real estate, and related costs of\ninvestigation and property damage. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner, operator, lessee or other\nperson knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Environmental contamination may exist at\nour owned or leased auction sites, or at other sites on which we may conduct auctions, or properties that we may be selling by auction,\nfrom prior activities at these locations or from neighboring properties. In addition, auction sites that we acquire or lease in the future\nmay be contaminated, and future use of or conditions on any of our properties or sites could result in contamination. The costs related\nto claims arising from environmental contamination of any of these properties could harm our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nThere are restrictions in the United States, Canada, Europe and other jurisdictions in which we do business that may affect the ability\nof equipment owners to transport certain equipment between specified jurisdictions or the salability of older equipment. One example\nof these restrictions is environmental certification requirements in the United States, which prevent non-certified equipment from\nentering into commerce in the United States. In addition, engine emission standards in some jurisdictions limit the operation of certain\ntrucks and equipment in those markets."

Although we actively manage our human\nresource risks, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts. If we fail to attract, develop and retain skilled\nemployees in all areas of our business, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected, and we may not\nachieve our growth or performance objectives.\nThe growth and performance of our business depends to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities of our employees. Many of our\nkey employees have extensive experience with our business. These employees have knowledge and an understanding of our company\nand industry that cannot be readily duplicated. The loss of any key personnel, or the inability to replace any lost personnel with\nequally trained personnel, could impair our ability to execute our business plan and growth strategy, cause us to lose customers and\nreduce our revenues. In addition, the success of our strategic initiatives to expand our business to complimentary service offerings will\nrequire new competencies in many positions, and our management and employees will have to adapt and learn new skills and\ncapabilities. To the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational changes or we are unable to attract new\nemployees who are able to do so, we may be unable to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives. We do not maintain key\nperson insurance on the lives of any of our executive officers or other key personnel. As a result, we would have no way to cover the\nfinancial loss if we were to lose the services of such employees. This uncertainty may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain\nkey employees.\nIf any of our key personnel were to join a competitor or form a competing company, existing and potential customers could choose to\nform business relationships with that competitor instead of us. There can be no assurance that confidentiality, non-solicitation, non-\ncompetition or similar agreements signed by our former directors, officers, or employees will be effective in preventing a loss of\nbusiness.\nFailure to maintain safe sites could materially affect our business and reputation.\nOur employees and customers are often in close proximity with mechanized equipment, moving vehicles and chemical and other\nindustrial substances. Our auction sites and warehouses are, therefore, potentially dangerous places and involve the risk of accidents,\nenvironmental incidents and other incidents which may expose us to investigations and litigation or could negatively affect the\nperception of customer and employee safety, health and security. Even in the absence of any incidents, unsafe site conditions could\nlead to employee turnover or harm our reputation generally, each of which would affect our financial performance. While safety is a\nprimary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation and performance, our failure to implement safety procedures or\nimplement ineffective safety procedures would increase this risk and our operations and results from operations may be adversely\nimpacted.\nIncome and commodity tax amounts, including tax expense, may be materially different than expected, and there is a trend by\nglobal tax collection authorities towards the adoption of more aggressive laws, regulations, interpretations and audit practices.\nOur global operations are subject to tax interpretations, regulations, and legislation in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate,\nall of which are subject to continual change.\nWe accrue and pay income taxes and have significant income tax assets, liabilities, and expense that are estimates based primarily on\nthe application of those interpretations, regulations and legislation, and the amount and timing of future taxable income as well as our\nuse of applicable accounting principles. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that our estimates and reserves are sufficient. The timing\nconcerning the monetization of deferred income tax amounts is uncertain, as they are dependent on our future earnings and other\nevents. Our deferred income tax amounts are valued based upon enacted income tax rates in effect at the time, which can be changed\nby governments in the future."

Our experience indicates that taxation authorities are increasing the frequency and depth of audits and\nreviews. The Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) has been conducting audits for our 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019 taxation years.\nOn February 13, 2023, the CRA issued a proposal letter to Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers (International) Ltd., asserting that one of its\nLuxembourg subsidiaries was resident in Canada from 2010 to 2015 and that its worldwide income should be subject to Canadian\nincome taxation. In the event that the CRA issues a notice of assessment or reassessment and a court of competent jurisdiction makes\na final determination that the income of the Luxembourg subsidiary for 2010 through 2015 was subject to Canadian income tax laws,\nthe Company may ultimately be liable for additional total Canadian federal and provincial income tax, interest and penalties for such\nperiod which could have a material negative effect on our operations. The CRA may also challenge the manner in which the Company\nhas filed its tax returns and reported its income with respect to 2016 to 2020 taxation years and may assert that the income of the\nLuxembourg subsidiary was subject to Canadian income tax because the Luxembourg subsidiary was also resident in Canada during\nthese years. The Company could then incur additional income taxes, penalties and interest which could have a material negative effect\non our operations. In addition, future tax authority determinations, including changes to tax interpretations, regulations, legislation or\njurisprudence, could have a material impact to our financial position. The fact that we operate internationally increases our exposure in\nthis regard given the multiple forms of taxation imposed upon us. Further and more generally, there has been increased political,\nmedia and tax authority focus on taxation in recent years; the intent of which appears to be to enhance transparency and address\nperceived tax avoidance. As such, in addition to tax risk from a financial perspective, our activities may expose us to reputational risk.\nOur substantial international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, including foreign exchange\nrate fluctuations that could harm our results of operations.\nWe conduct business in many countries around the world and intend to continue to expand our presence in international markets,\nincluding emerging markets.\nAlthough we report our financial results in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are generated outside the\nU.S., primarily in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In particular, a significant portion of our revenues are earned, and expenses\nincurred, in the Canadian dollar and the Euro. The results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are translated from local currency\ninto U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign\ncurrency denominated revenues or expenses will result in increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues and expenses. Similarly, if the\nU.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar and the Euro, our translation of foreign currency\ndenominated revenues or expenses will result in lower U.S. dollar denominated revenues and expenses. We do not currently engage in\nforeign currency hedging arrangements on any of our revenues or expenses. Fluctuating currency exchange rates may negatively affect\nour business in international markets and our related results of operations.\nIn addition, currency exchange rate fluctuations between the different countries in which we conduct our operations impact the\npurchasing power of buyers, the motivation of consignors, asset values and asset flows between various countries, including those in\nwhich we do not have operations. These factors and other global economic conditions may harm our business and our results of\noperations.\nOther risks inherent in doing business internationally include, but are not limited to the following: (a) trade barriers, trade regulations,\ncurrency controls, import or export regulations, and other restrictions on doing business freely; (b) local labor, environmental, tax, and\nother laws and regulations, and the potential for adverse changes in such laws and regulations or the interpretations thereof; (c)\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; (d) economic, political, social or labor instability or unrest; (e) terrorism, war,\nhostage-taking, or military repression; (f) corruption; (g) expropriation and nationalization, or difficulties in enforcing or protecting\nour property rights, including with respect to intellectual property; (h) increased exposure to high rates of inflation; and (i)\nunpredictability as to litigation in foreign jurisdictions and enforcement of local laws.\nIf we violate the complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, we may face fines, criminal\nactions or sanctions, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. These risks inherent in our\ninternational operations increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in a material adverse effect on our\noperations or profitability."

These laws and regulations restrict us from providing services to, or otherwise engaging in direct or indirect\ntransactions or dealings with, certain countries, territories, governments, and persons. We have implemented procedures designed to\nmaintain compliance with these laws, including monitoring, on an automatic and manual basis, the identity and location of potential\nsellers and buyers. We can offer no assurances that these procedures will always be effective.\nIf we were to violate applicable export control or sanctions, we could be subject to administrative or criminal penalties which, in\ncertain circumstances, could be material. We could be subject to damages, financial penalties, denial of export privileges,\nincarceration of our employees, other restrictions on our operations, and reputational harm. Further, any action on the part of the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce, OFAC or other applicable regulator against the company or any of our employees for potential violations\nof these laws could have a negative impact on our reputation, business, operating results and prospects.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, or the CFPOA, and similar laws\nassociated with our activities outside of the U.S. could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the CFPOA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. §201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA\nPATRIOT Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010, or the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar other anti-corruption, anti-bribery and\nanti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities or facilitate the buying and selling of equipment, including the\nEU. We face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA, the CFPOA and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws that\nprohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly,\nimproper payments or benefits to foreign government officials, political parties or candidates, employees of public international\norganizations, and private-sector recipients for the corrupt purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person,\nor securing any advantage. In many foreign countries, particularly in countries with developing economies, it may be a local custom\nthat businesses engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA, the CFPOA or other applicable laws and regulations. In addition,\nwe leverage various third parties to sell our solutions and conduct our business abroad. We and our other third-party intermediaries\nmay have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We\nmay be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives,\ncontractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and\nother corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties.\nAny violation of the FCPA, other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in\nwhistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in\nthe case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, which could have a material and adverse effect on\nour reputation, business, operating results and prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement action may result in a materially\nsignificant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nWe are pursuing a long-term growth strategy that may include acquisitions and developing and enhancing an appropriate sales\nstrategy, which requires upfront investment with no guarantee of long-term returns.\nWe continue to pursue a long-term growth strategy, including developing and enhancing an appropriate sales strategy, that\ncontemplates upfront investments, including (i) investments in emerging markets that may not generate profitable growth in the near\nterm, (ii) adding new business and information solutions, and (iii) developing our people. Planning for future growth requires\ninvestments to be made now in anticipation of growth that may not materialize, and if our strategies do not successfully address the\nneeds of current and potential customers, we may not be successful in maintaining or growing our GTV and our financial condition\nand results of operations may be adversely impacted. We may also not be able to improve our systems and controls as a result of\nincreased costs, technological challenges, or lack of qualified employees. A large component of our selling, general and administrative\nexpenses is considered fixed costs that we will incur regardless of any GTV growth. There can be no assurances that our GTV and\nrevenues will be maintained or grow at a more rapid rate than our fixed costs."

      "text": "Ritchie Bros.\n27\nPart of our long-term growth strategy includes growth through acquisitions, which poses a number of risks. We may not be successful\nin identifying appropriate acquisition candidates, consummating acquisitions on satisfactory terms or integrating any newly acquired\nor expanded business with our current operations. Additionally, significant costs may be incurred in connection with any acquisition\nand our integration of such businesses with our business, including legal, accounting, financial advisory and other costs. We may also\nnot realize the anticipated benefits of, and synergies from, such acquisition. We cannot guarantee that any future business acquisitions\nwill be pursued, that any acquisitions that are pursued will be consummated, or that we will achieve the anticipated benefits of\ncompleted acquisitions.\nWe are regularly subject to general litigation and other claims, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of\noperations.\nWe are subject to general litigation and other claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. The outcome and impact of such\nlitigation cannot be predicted with certainty, but regardless of the outcome, these proceedings can have an adverse impact on us\nbecause of legal costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. While the results of these claims have not historically had\na material effect on us, we may not be able to defend ourselves adequately against these claims in the future, and these proceedings\nmay have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may also be subject to intellectual property claims, which are extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant\ndamages, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future. Companies in the internet and technology industries are\nfrequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.\nThird-party intellectual property rights may cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods or block us from\nexpanding our offerings. Any intellectual property claim against us, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to\nsettle or litigate and could divert the attention of our management. Litigation regarding intellectual property rights is inherently\nuncertain due to the complex issues involved, and we may not be successful in defending ourselves in such matters.\nMany potential litigants, including some patent-holding companies, have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to enforcing their\nintellectual property rights. Any claims successfully brought against us could subject us to significant liability for damages, and we\nmay be required to stop using technology or other intellectual property alleged to be in violation of a third party’s rights. We also\nmight be required to seek a license for third-party intellectual property. Such a license may be unavailable or may require us to pay\nsignificant royalties or submit to unreasonable terms, which would increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to\ndevelop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and expense. If we cannot license or develop\ntechnology for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit our service and may be unable to compete\neffectively. Any of these results could harm our business.\nPrivacy concerns and our compliance with current and evolving domestic or foreign laws and regulations regarding the processing\nof personal information and other data may increase our costs, impact our marketing efforts, or decrease adoption and use of our\nproducts and services, and our failure to comply with those laws and regulations may expose us to liability and reputational harm.\nGovernments around the world continue to propose and adopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy,\ndata protection, data sovereignty and the processing of data, generally. Although we monitor the regulatory environment and have\ninvested in addressing these developments, such as through our cybersecurity and privacy readiness programs, these laws may require\nus to incur further compliance costs to make changes to our practices, products and services to enable us or our customers to meet the\nnew legal requirements. In addition, if we are found to have breached any such laws or regulations, we may be subject to enforcement\nactions that require us to change our practices, products and services, which may negatively impact our revenue, as well as expose us\nto liability through new or higher potential penalties and fines for non-compliance, civil and criminal penalties, and litigation for\nalleged violations, as well as adverse publicity that could cause our customers to lose trust in us and negatively impact our reputation\nand business in a manner that harms our financial position. These new or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing\ninterpretations that may change over time resulting in further compliance costs, as well as diversion of resources to monitor and\naddress developments. New and proposed laws and regulations may also be inconsistent among jurisdictions or conflict with other\nlaws and regulations. As a result, these requirements and other potential self-regulatory standards and industry codes of conduct could\nrequire us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to store, transfer and otherwise process data or, in\nsome cases, impact our ability to offer certain services in certain locations, to deploy our software or data solutions, to market to\ncurrent and prospective customers, or to derive insights from customers’ online activity and data globally."

      "text": "Ritchie Bros.\n28\nWe believe that laws and regulations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia the European Union and in other\njurisdictions will be increasingly restrictive in the field of data privacy and protection and will in turn result in an increase in\nregulatory burdens for us to address to continue meeting our customers’ expectations, in particular in relation to the sharing of\npersonal information with third parties, the use of machine learning and big data, and the tracking of online activities for advertising.\nAs our capacity to process large volumes of data increases, customer sentiment towards increased transparency and control and further\ninterpretive guidance from regulatory agencies may require us to change our operations and practices in a manner adverse to our\nbusiness. In this uncertain and shifting regulatory and trust climate, even the perception that the privacy and security of personal\ninformation are not satisfactorily addressed or do not meet regulatory requirements could result in adverse publicity and reputation\nloss.\nOur business continuity plan may not operate effectively in the event of a significant interruption of our business.\nWe have implemented a formal business continuity plan covering most significant aspects of our business that would take effect in the\nevent of a significant interruption to our business, or the loss of key systems as a result of a natural or other disaster. Although we\nhave tested our business continuity plan as part of the implementation, there can be no assurance that it will operate effectively or that\nour business, results of operations and financial condition will not be materially affected in the event of a significant interruption of\nour business. If we were subject to a disaster or serious security breach, it could materially damage our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nOur insurance may be insufficient to cover losses that may occur as a result of our operations.\nWe maintain property and general liability insurance. This insurance may not remain available to us at commercially reasonable rates,\nand the amount of our coverage may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Our auctions generally involve the\noperation of large equipment close to a large number of people, and despite our focus on safe work practices, an accident could\ndamage our facilities, injure auction attendees and harm our reputation and our business. In addition, if we were held liable for\namounts exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage or for claims outside the scope of our coverage, the resulting costs could harm\nour financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business operations, results of operations, cash flows and financial performance may continue to be affected by the COVID-\n19 pandemic.\nSince 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread throughout the world, including in all of the countries in which we\noperate. National, state, provincial and local governments have responded to COVID-19 in a variety of ways, including, without\nlimitation, by declaring states of emergency, restricting people from gathering in groups or interacting within a certain physical\ndistance (i.e., social distancing), and in certain cases, ordering businesses to close or limit operations or people to stay at home.\nAlthough we have recently begun to offer in-person onsite bidding alongside online-only bidding at some of our auction events,\ntransportation costs and supply chain delays remain elevated, and further restrictions or the rollback of reopening measures due to\nhigher infection rates may further disrupt our operations and the operations of our partners and customers. In addition, COVID-19 has\nalso adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, the businesses and needs of our customers including their ability to\nsecure financing. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain at this time and will depend on\nfuture developments, including the severity of evolving variants, availability, efficacy and distribution of various vaccines and\ntreatments for COVID-19, as well as any longer-term effects of the pandemic on the global economy, including in the industries our\ncustomers serve.\nCertain global conditions may affect our ability to conduct successful events.\nLike most businesses with global operations, we are subject to the risk of certain global or regional adverse conditions, such as\npandemics or other disease outbreaks, including COVID-19, or natural disasters including extreme weather or other events, such as\nhurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, forest fires or floods that could hinder our ability to conduct our scheduled auctions, restrict our\ncustomers’ travel patterns or their desire to attend auctions or impact our online operations, including disrupting the internet or mobile\nnetworks or one or more of our service providers. If any of these conditions were to occur, we may not be able to generate sufficient\nequipment consignments to sustain our business or to attract enough bidders to our auctions to achieve world fair market values for the\nitems we sell. This could harm our financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that climate change causes rising sea\nlevels, increased intensity of weather, and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding, the risks noted above may\nincrease."

      "text": "Ritchie Bros.\n29\nFinancial Risk Factors\nIneffective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements, reduce investor confidence,\nand adversely impact our stock price.\nAs a public company, we are required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting. This assessment is required to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting identified by our management. We are also required to have our independent registered public accounting\nfirm issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis.\nAs previously reported, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, we identified two material weaknesses in our internal control\nover financial reporting. These material weaknesses were remediated as of December 31, 2021, and we did not identify any additional\nmaterial weaknesses during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. However, we may identify additional material weaknesses in our\ninternal control over financial reporting in the future, and, if we do, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial\nreporting is effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in\nthe future.\nAny failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial\ncondition or results of operations. If we are unable to conclude in the future that our internal control over financial reporting is effective,\nor if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial\nreporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, our stock price could decline,\nand we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the New York Stock Exchange, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure\nto remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control\nsystems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nWe have substantial indebtedness, and the degree to which we are leveraged may materially and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2022, we have $0.6 billion of total debt outstanding, consisting of:\n\n$114.6 million under an amended and extended credit agreement entered into in December 2022 (the “Credit Agreement”)\nwith a syndicate of lenders;\n\n$500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior unsecured notes issued December 21, 2016 (the “2016 Notes”);\nand\n\nnet of $4.0 million of unamortized debt issue costs.\nThere are no current drawings under our foreign credit facilities, and we can borrow an additional $709.8 million under the Credit\nAgreement.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, as well as any future debt that we may incur, will depend on our\nability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general\neconomic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not generate sufficient\nfunds to service our debt and meet our business needs, such as funding working capital or the expansion of our operations. If we are\nnot able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to take certain actions, including reducing spending on\nmarketing, advertising and new product innovation, reducing future financing for working capital, capital expenditures and general\ncorporate purposes, selling assets or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal\nand interest on our indebtedness. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in our industry,\nincluding both the live and online auction industry, could be impaired.\nThe lenders who hold our debt could also accelerate amounts due in the event that we default, which could potentially trigger a default\nor acceleration of the maturity of our other debt. In addition, our leverage could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our\ncompetitors that are less leveraged. These competitors could have greater financial flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and\nsecure additional financing for their operations. Our leverage could also impede our ability to withstand downturns in our industry or\nthe economy in general. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the Credit Agreement and the\nindentures governing the Notes will limit, but not prohibit, us from incurring additional indebtedness. If we incur any additional"

Subject to restrictions in the Credit Agreement and the\nindenture governing the Notes, we also will have the ability to incur additional secured indebtedness that would be effectively senior\nto the Notes offered hereby, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations. If new indebtedness is added to our\ncurrent debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nOur debt instruments have restrictive covenants that could limit our financial flexibility.\nThe terms of the Credit Agreement and the 2016 Notes indenture contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability\nto engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our ability to borrow under our Credit Agreement is subject to\ncompliance with a consolidated leverage ratio covenant and a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant.\nThe Credit Agreement includes other restrictions that limit our ability in certain circumstances to: incur indebtedness; grant liens;\nengage in mergers, consolidations and liquidations; make asset dispositions, restricted payments and investments; enter into\ntransactions with affiliates; and amend, modify or prepay certain indebtedness. The indentures governing the 2016 Notes contain\ncovenants that limit our ability in certain circumstances to: incur additional indebtedness (including guarantees thereof); incur or\ncreate liens on their assets securing indebtedness; make certain restricted payments; make certain investments; dispose of certain\nassets; allow certain restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us; engage in\ncertain transactions with affiliates; and consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or into other companies.\nOur failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the\nacceleration of substantially all of our funded debt. We do not have sufficient working capital to satisfy our debt obligations in the\nevent of an acceleration of all or a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness.\nOur operating results are subject to quarterly variations.\nHistorically, our revenues and operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter. We expect to continue to experience these\nfluctuations as a result of the following factors, among others, (a) the size, timing, nature and frequency of our auctions; (b) the\nseasonal nature of the auction business in general, with peak activity typically occurring in the second and fourth calendar quarters,\nmainly as a result of the seasonal nature of the construction and natural resources industries; (c) the extent and performance of our\nunderwritten (guarantee and outright purchase) contracts; (d) general economic conditions in the geographical regions in which we\noperate; and (e) the timing of acquisitions and development of auction facilities and related costs.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs when entering new geographies, and variability in the number and size of auctions at new\nsites can cause volatility in our operations. These and other factors may cause our future results to fall short of investor expectations or\nnot to compare favorably to our past results. Further, as our results generally fluctuate from quarter to quarter, period-to-period\ncomparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful indicators of future performance.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, which could harm our reputation and adversely\naffect our growth prospects.\nWe regard our proprietary technologies and intellectual property as integral to our success. We protect our proprietary technology\nthrough a combination of trade secrets, third-party confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, additional contractual restrictions on\ndisclosure and use, and patent, copyright, and trademark laws.\nWe are the registered owners of many Internet domain names internationally. As we seek to protect our domain names in an\nincreasing number of jurisdictions, we may not be successful in doing so in certain jurisdictions. Our competitors may adopt trade\nnames or domain names similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to promote our marketplace and possibly leading to customer\nconfusion. In addition, we could face trade name or trademark or service mark infringement claims brought by owners of other\nregistered or unregistered trademarks or service marks, including trademarks or service marks that may incorporate variations of our\nbrand names. The legal means we use to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property do not afford complete protection\nand may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. We cannot guarantee that: any of\nour present or future intellectual property rights will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or abandoned; our"

Further, although it is our practice to enter into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property\nassignment agreements with our employees and contractors, these agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful\nprotection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the\nagreements.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer, or otherwise obtain\nand use our products or technology. We cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent unauthorized use of our technology or\ninfringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our\nproprietary rights. Effective patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret, and domain name protection is time-consuming\nand expensive to maintain. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to\ndetermine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our\nresources. In addition, our efforts may be met with defenses and counterclaims challenging the validity and enforceability of our\nintellectual property rights or may result in a court determining that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable. If we are unable\nto cost-effectively protect our intellectual property rights, then our business could be harmed. If competitors are able to use our\ntechnology or develop proprietary technology similar to ours or competing technologies, our ability to compete effectively and our\ngrowth prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur use of open source software could subject us to risks, including with respect to the terms of open source licenses.\nSome of the software powering our marketplace incorporates software covered by open source licenses. The terms of many open\nsource licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts and there is a risk that the licenses could be construed in a manner that\nimposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to operate our marketplace. Under certain open source licenses, we\ncould be required to publicly release the source code of our software or to make our software available under open source licenses. To\navoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code, we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to\nre-engineer some or all of our software which could significantly interrupt our operations.\nIn addition, use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software because open source\nlicensors generally do not provide maintenance, warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Open source software may also\npresent risks of unforeseen or unmanaged security vulnerabilities that could potentially unintentionally be introduced into our\nsoftware. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of this software may\nmake it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our technology platform. Any of these risks could\nbe difficult to eliminate or manage and, if not addressed, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nRisk Related to Our Industry\nCompetition could result in reductions in our future revenues and profitability.\nThe global used equipment market, including the auction segment of that market, is highly fragmented. We compete for potential\npurchasers and sellers of equipment with other auction companies and with non-auction competitors such as equipment manufacturers,\ndistributors and dealers, equipment rental companies, and other online marketplaces. When sourcing equipment to sell at our auctions\nor other marketplaces, we compete with other onsite and online auction companies, OEM and independent dealers, equipment brokers,\nother third parties, and equipment owners that have traditionally disposed of equipment in private sales.\nSome of our competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources and name recognition than we do. New\ncompetitors with greater financial and other resources and/or different business models/strategies may enter the equipment auction\nmarket in the future. Additionally, existing or future competitors may succeed in entering and establishing successful operations in"

They may also compete against us through internet-based services and\nother combined service offerings.\nIf commission rates decline, or if our strategy to compete against our many competitors is not effective, our revenues, market share,\nfinancial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. We may be susceptible to loss of business if competing\nselling models become more appealing to customers. If our selling model becomes undesirable or we are not successful in adding\nservices complementary to our existing selling model and business, we may not be successful increasing market penetration over the\nlong-term, which could prevent us from achieving our long-term earnings growth targets.\nDecreases in the supply of, demand for, or market values of used equipment, could harm our business.\nOur revenues could decrease if there is significant erosion in the supply of, demand for, or market values of used equipment, which\ncould adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have no control over any of the factors that affect the\nsupply of or demand for used equipment and the circumstances that cause market values for equipment to fluctuate including, among\nother things, economic uncertainty, the global geopolitical climate, disruptions to credit and financial markets, lower commodity\nprices, and our customers’ restricted access to capital. Recent economic conditions have caused fluctuations in the supply, mix and\nmarket values of used equipment available for sale, which has a direct impact on our revenues.\nIn addition, price competition and the availability of equipment directly affect the supply of, demand for, and market value of used\nequipment. Climate change initiatives, including significant changes to engine emission standards applicable to equipment, may also\nadversely affect the supply of, demand for our market values of equipment.\nRisk Related to Our Organization and Governance\nOur articles, by-laws, shareholder rights plan and Canadian law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or\npreventing a change in control.\nCertain provisions of our articles of amalgamation and by-laws, as well as certain provisions of the Canada Business Corporations Act\n(the “CBCA”) and applicable Canadian securities law, could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in\ncontrol or materially adversely impact the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for our common shares. For instance, our\narticles of amalgamation authorize our board of directors to determine the designations, rights and restrictions to be attached to, and to\nissue an unlimited number of, junior preferred shares and senior preferred shares. In addition, our by-laws contain provisions\nestablishing that shareholders must give advance notice to us in circumstances where nominations of persons for election to our board\nof directors are made by our shareholders other than pursuant to either a requisition of a meeting made in accordance with the\nprovisions of the CBCA or a shareholder proposal made in accordance with the provisions of the CBCA. Among other things, these\nadvance notice provisions set a deadline by which shareholders must notify us in writing of an intention to nominate directors for\nelection to the board of directors prior to any shareholder meeting at which directors are to be elected and set forth the information\nrequired in this notice for it to be valid.\nOur board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan (the “Rights Plan”), pursuant to which we issued one right in respect of\neach common share outstanding. Under the Rights Plan, following a transaction in which any person becomes an “acquiring person”\nas defined in the Rights Plan, each right will entitle the holder to receive a number of common shares provided in the Rights Plan. The\npurposes of the Rights Plan are (i) to provide our board of directors time to consider value-enhancing alternatives to a take-over bid\nand to allow competing bids to emerge; (ii) to ensure that shareholders are provided equal treatment under a take-over bid; and (iii) to\ngive adequate time for shareholders to properly assess a take-over bid without undue pressure. The Rights Plan can potentially impose\na significant penalty on any person commencing a takeover bid that would result in the offeror becoming the beneficial owner of 20%\nor more of our outstanding common shares.\nAny of these provisions, as well as certain provisions of the CBCA and applicable Canadian securities law, may discourage a potential\nacquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders.\nU.S. civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us, our directors, or our officers.\nWe are governed by the CBCA and our principal place of business is in Canada. Many of our directors and officers reside outside of\nthe United States, and all or a substantial portion of their assets, as well as a substantial portion of our assets, are located outside the"

Our auction sites also allow buyers to come\nin advance of the onsite auction and physically inspect the equipment they plan to bid on. Although we lease some auction sites, we\nhave historically preferred to purchase land and construct purpose-built facilities once we have established a base of business and\ndetermined that a region can generate sufficient financial returns to justify the investment.\nWe currently have over 40 locations in our auction site network that are either owned or leased as of the date of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.

The transfer agent for the shares is Computershare Trust\nCompany of Canada, 100 University Avenue, 9th Floor, Toronto, Ontario M5J 2Y1. Our common shares trade on the NYSE and on\nthe TSX under the symbol “RBA”. On February 21, 2023, there were 625 holders of record of our common shares that do not include\nthe shareholders for whom shares are held in a nominee or street name.\nDividend Policy\nWe currently pay a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.27 per common share. We currently intend to continue to declare and pay a\nregular quarterly cash dividend on our common shares; however, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made\nat the discretion of our Board of Directors, after considering our operating results, financial condition, cash requirements, financing\nagreement restrictions and any other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nBecause Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Incorporated is a holding company with no material assets other than the shares of its subsidiaries,\nour ability to pay dividends on our common shares depends on the income and cash flow of our subsidiaries. No financing agreements\nto which our subsidiaries are party currently restrict those subsidiaries from paying dividends.\nPursuant to income tax legislation, Canadian resident individuals who receive “eligible dividends” in 2006 and subsequent years will\nbe entitled to an enhanced gross-up and dividend tax credit on such dividends. All dividends that we pay are “eligible dividends”\nunless indicated otherwise.\nSpecial Dividend\nOn January 23, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to approve the payment of a one-time special dividend to our\nshareholders in the amount of $1.08 per share, contingent upon the closing of the merger with IAA. The special dividend will be\npayable to holders of record of our common shares as of a record date prior to the effective time to be determined with the consent of\nthe TSX and only if the merger is completed. Our shareholders will only be eligible to receive the special dividend if they own their\ncommon shares through the record date determined for the special dividend, which we will publicly announce following\ndetermination. IAA stockholders will not be entitled to receive the special dividend with respect to any of our common shares received\nas consideration in the merger. We will not pay the special dividend if the merger agreement is terminated or the merger is otherwise\nnot completed for any reason.\nComparison of Cumulative Return\nThe following graph compares the cumulative return on a $100 investment in our common shares over the last five fiscal years\nbeginning December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2022, to that of the cumulative return on a $100 investment in the Russell Global\nIndex (“Russell 2000”), the S&P / TSX Composite Index (“S&P/TSX”) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (“DJIA”) for the\nsame period.

Members of or holders of\nan interest in such an entity that holds common shares should consult their own tax advisers regarding the extent, if any, to which the\nCRA will extend the benefits of the Convention in respect of common shares held by such entity.\nGenerally, a U.S. Resident Holder’s common shares will be considered to be capital property of a U.S. Resident Holder provided that\nthe U.S. Resident Holder does not acquire, hold or dispose of the common shares in one or more transactions considered to be an\nadventure or concern in the nature of trade and does not hold the common shares in the course of carrying on a business.\nThis summary is based on the provisions of the Canadian Tax Act and the Convention in effect on the date hereof, all specific\nproposals to amend the Canadian Tax Act and Convention publicly announced by or on behalf of the Minister of Finance (Canada) on\nor before the date hereof (the “Tax Proposals”), and the current published administrative policies of the CRA. It is assumed that the\nTax Proposals will be enacted as currently proposed, and that there will be no other material change to any applicable law or\nadministrative practice, whether by judicial, legislative, governmental or administrative decision or action, although no assurance can\nbe given in these respects. Except as otherwise expressly provided, this summary does not take into account any provincial, territorial\nor foreign tax considerations, which may differ materially from those set out herein.\nThis summary is of a general nature only and it is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any holder\nof common shares, and no representation with respect to Canadian federal income tax consequences to any holder of common shares\nis made herein.

We offered our online global\naudiences similar tools and experiences in our major auction events in Edmonton and Fort Worth.\n\nWe successfully integrated Rouse and SmartEquip businesses acquired in late 2020 and 2021, respectively, with strong synergies\nresulting in positive year-over-year growth.\n\nWe expanded our sales coverage model strategies to accelerate growth.\n\nWe continued to expand our RitchieList customer base by more than 300% and surpassed 75,000 active listings for equipment,\nvehicles and other assets. RitchieList is our first North American listing site which provides our customers with one-stop shop for\ninsights, services and a variety of transaction solutions.\nWe further accelerated our journey against many of our strategic pillars by entering into a Merger Agreement to acquire IAA in\nNovember 2022, subsequently amended in January 2023. The proposed acquisition of IAA is expected to close in the first half of\n2023. IAA is a leading global digital marketplace connecting vehicle buyers and sellers. The proposed acquisition will diversify our\ncustomer base by providing the Company with a significant presence in the vehicle remarketing vertical that has strong industry\nfundamentals with proven secular growth.\nIn addition to the proposed acquisition of IAA, we took several steps to advance our new growth strategy in 2022 highlighted below:\nCustomer Experience\n\nWe continued to improve our digital experience by adding two new valuable tools with the launch of a new podcast and blog to\nhelp keep our customers informed about the equipment market, pricing and volume trends, auction results, inspection tips and\nproviding data-based insights.\n\nWe continued to scale our local satellite yards program with four new satellite yards established in 2022. The program provides\nour sellers with more locations to store and display equipment for potential buyers. It further ensures that we continue to enable\nthe circular economy on a local basis by enabling growth in a low-cost and environmentally friendly way.\n\nWe expanded our complete suite of transaction solutions, services and insights to our customers and consignors in the oil & gas\nindustry with a new dedicated Ritchie Bros. Energy team upon the discontinuation of our Kruse Energy brand.\nBest Employee Experience\n\nWe rolled out online safety trainings for all onsite managers to make sure employees return home every day the way they came to\nwork.\n\nWe enhanced our employee experience in areas of diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) and community given, including launch\nof the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion training to our senior leaders and people leaders, with sessions rolling out to all employees in\n2023.\n\nWe conducted six new hire bootcamp workshops with the launch of a new sales coverage model for North America and for a long\ntail sales team.\n\nWe continue to provide our employees with flexible work arrangements.\n\nWe recognized Juneteenth as a company holiday for employees in the United States and recognized National Day of Truth and\nReconciliation for employees in Canada.\n\nWe continued to have positive community impact from Pride (2SLGBTQ+) and Serve (Military Veterans) Employee Resource\nGroups\n\nWe enhanced our community giving efforts by launching #RitchieGives Community Impact platform which includes providing\nour employees with extensive volunteering opportunities.\nModern Architecture\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, we partnered with Thoughtworks, a global technology consultancy, to accelerate our modernization and\ndigitization journey to deliver our vision of a modern, digital marketplace that is seamless for our customers, employees and\npartners. During the year, our engineering teams, together with Thoughtworks, designed and built certain capabilities in the\ndevelopment of our digital marketplace ecosystem, such as the check-out functionality and delivery of inspection reports."

We saw growth across all regions but most notably in Canada\nand the United States. In Canada, GTV growth was driven by strong performances across several auction events, including\nagricultural events, strong execution by our Canadian strategic accounts teams, higher volume from RBFS from providing escrow\nservices for private brokered transactions, and a higher number of inventory packages sold primarily in the commercial transportation\nsector. In the United States, GTV volume increased primarily from positive performances across numerous auctions and on our online\nmarketplaces mainly due to higher volume of inventory contracts including strong results from our strategic accounts in the rental and\nfinance sectors. We also saw growth from several of our strategic initiatives, including from our local yards and continued investments\nmade in our sales coverage model. These increases were partially offset by the non-repeat of a large dispersal of pipeline construction\nequipment in a single-owner auction event in 2021. In International, Australia saw significant growth from improved market\nconditions and the lifting of border restrictions, as well as from a higher mix of inventory packages and strong performances at several\nauction events. We also saw improved year-over-year performances in Europe mainly offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange\nimpact."

      "text": "Ritchie Bros.\n44\nTotal Revenue\nTotal revenue increased 22% to $1.7 billion as compared to 2021, with total service revenue increasing by 14% and inventory sales\nrevenue increasing by 37%.\nForeign currency fluctuation also had an unfavourable impact on our revenue primarily due to the depreciation of the Euro, the\nAustralian dollar and the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.\nService Revenue\nService revenue is comprised of commissions that are earned on Service GTV, and fees that are earned on total GTV, as well as from\nour other services such as RBFS, Ancillary Services, Rouse, SmartEquip, Mascus, and RB Logistics. In 2022, service GTV increased\n6% to $5.3 billion driven by positive results across all regions due to strong pricing despite the unfavourable supply environment.\nIn 2022, total service revenue increased 14% with fees revenue increasing 26% and commissions revenue increasing 3%. Fees revenue\nincreased 26% with buyer fees growing faster than GTV of 9%, reflecting the increase in certain buyer fee rates implemented in early\n2022. Fees revenue also increased due to higher RBFS revenues on higher funded volumes, the inclusion of fees from SmartEquip\nsince its acquisition on November 2, 2021 and higher revenue from our Rouse business. Commissions revenue increased 3%, slightly\nless than the 6% increase in service GTV, primarily driven by lower straight commission rate performances in Canada from a higher\nproportion of GTV contributed by RBFS from facilitating financing arrangements, as well as the non-repeat of several high\nperforming guarantee contracts. These decreases were partially offset by improved straight commission and guarantee rate\nperformances in the United States.\nInventory Sales Revenue\nInventory sales revenue as a percent of total GTV increased to 11% from 9% in 2021.\nIn 2022, inventory sales revenue increased 37% predominantly in the United States partly due to an increased number of inventory\npackages sourced, including from our strategic accounts team and primarily in the finance and rental sectors. We also saw increased\nvolumes selling through our auction events, including higher volumes from our GovPlanet non-rolling and rolling stock contracts. In\nCanada, we saw improved year-over-year performances from inventory sold mainly in the commercial transportation and construction\nsectors. In International, inventory sales revenue grew in Australia from the overall improvement in market conditions and the lifting\nof border restrictions, as well as from several new auction events. We also saw slightly lower year-over-year performances in Europe\nprimarily due an unfavourable foreign exchange impact, as well as the non-repeat of several inventory contracts.\nUnderwritten Contracts\nWe offer our customers the opportunity to use underwritten commission contracts to serve their disposition strategy needs, entering\ninto such contracts where the risk and reward profile of the terms are agreeable. Our underwritten contracts, as a percentage of total\nGTV, which include inventory and guarantee contracts, increased to 19% in 2022, compared to 18% 2021 primarily due to increased\nGTV signed with inventory contracts.\nOperating Income\nOperating income increased 89% due to the inclusion of a gain of $169.1 million from the sale of the Bolton property in the first\nquarter of 2022. Operating income increased 21%, when excluding the impact of the gain, primarily due to flow through from higher\nrevenue, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses, higher depreciation and amortization expense from the\ninvestments made in developing our new digital marketplace platform and ecosystem and from the intangible assets acquired in\nSmartEquip, and higher acquisition related costs primarily in relation to the proposed acquisition of IAA. Selling, general and\nadministrative expenses increased due to higher short-term incentive expenses driven by strong performance. Building, facilities and\ntechnology costs also increased, mainly due to the amortization of the right-of-use asset of the Bolton property from the sale and lease\nback arrangement completed in the first quarter of 2022, higher costs to support our new local satellite yards, as well as higher costs as\nwe shift to cloud-based solutions to improve customer experiences. Share-based payments also increased as a result of higher expense\nrelating to share-based awards issued to senior executives and higher expense from the premium-priced options and PSUs with market\nconditions granted in late 2021. In addition, we saw higher travel, advertising and promotion costs from increased activity from the\nreturn to global travel to support and promote our various growth initiatives with the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. We also saw\nhigher wages, salaries and benefits expenses from higher headcount to accelerate our growth initiatives and our transformational\njourney to become a trusted global marketplace. We also saw higher professional fees driven by our investment in new modern\narchitecture to support our future marketplace and services strategy. In addition, high inflationary pressures and rising costs have"

These increases were partially offset by a favourable impact\nof foreign exchange.\nIncome Tax Expense and Effective Tax Rate\nWe recorded an income tax expense of $86.2 million in 2022 compared to $53.4 million in 2021. Our effective tax rate was 21.2%\ncompared to 26.0% in 2021. The decrease in the effective tax rate over the comparative period was primarily due to the non-taxable\ngain portion of the sale of the Bolton property and a lower estimate of non-deductible expenses. Partially offsetting this decrease was a\nhigher estimate of income taxes in jurisdictions with higher tax rates and a lower tax deduction for PSU and RSU share unit expenses\nthat exceeded the related compensation expense.\nNet Income\nNet income attributable to stockholders increased 110% to $319.7 million compared to $151.9 million in 2021. The increase was\nprimarily due to the inclusion of a gain of $169.1 million on property, plant and equipment from the sale of the Bolton property. The\nincrease was also due to higher operating income and a lower effective tax rate as discussed above, partially offset by higher interest\nexpense from our 2021 Notes, which included a loss on redemption.\nDiluted EPS\nDiluted EPS attributable to stockholders increased 110% to $2.86 per share compared to $1.36 in 2021. This increase was primarily\ndue to the increase in net income attributable to stockholders as discussed above, combined with an increase in the weighted average\nnumber of dilutive shares outstanding over 2021.\nU.S. Dollar Exchange Rate Comparison\nWe conduct global operations in many different currencies, with our presentation currency being the U.S dollar.

Foreign exchange had an\nunfavourable impact on total revenue and a favourable impact on expenses. These impacts were mainly due to the fluctuations in the\nEuro, Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar exchanges rates relative to the U.S. dollar during the year."

We believe these key operating metrics are useful\nto investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our operational\nstrategies.\nWe define our key operating metrics as follows:\nGross transaction value: Represents total proceeds from all items sold at the Company’s auctions and online marketplaces. GTV is\nnot a measure of financial performance, liquidity, or revenue, and is not presented in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nInventory return: Inventory sales revenue less cost of inventory sold.\nInventory rate: Inventory return divided by inventory sales revenue.\nInventory management system activations: Number of organizations activated on IMS. An organization is considered activated on\nIMS when a customer has signed an annual multi-channel contract and has an IMS instance setup to allow for equipment to be\ndirected to one of our transaction solutions digitally.\nBids per lots sold: Each bid is completed electronically through our real-time online bidding system. A lot is defined as a single asset\nto be sold, or a group of assets bundled for sale as one unit. This metric calculates the total number of bids received for a lot divided\nby the total number of lots sold. GovPlanet business metrics are excluded from this metric as management reviews industrial\nequipment auction metrics excluding GovPlanet.\nTotal lots sold: A single asset to be sold, or a group of assets bundled for sale as one unit. Low value assets are sometimes bundled\ninto a single lot, collectively referred to as “small value lots”. GovPlanet business metrics are excluded from this metric as\nmanagement reviews industrial equipment auction metrics excluding GovPlanet."

The increase in fees was primarily due to\nhigher buyer fee rates implemented in early 2022. These increases were partially offset by lower commissions from lower rates\ncontributed by a higher proportion of GTV in RBFS, lower buyer fees on a lower proportion of small value lots, as well as the non-\nrepeat of several high performing guarantee contracts.\nInventory sales revenue increased 122% mainly driven by strong performances from two large inventory contracts in the commercial\ntransportation sector.\nInternational\nService revenue increased 7% primarily in line with a 5% increase in Service GTV. The remaining increase was primarily due to\nimproved buyer fee rate performance in Australia from a favourable mix of contracts.\nInventory sales revenue decreased 2% mainly due to slightly lower volumes of inventory contracts in Europe, an unfavourable foreign\nexchange impact, as well as lower inventory sales from private treaty transactions in Australia. Offsetting these decreases we saw\nhigher volumes of inventory contracts sold at several auction events throughout Australia."

Building, facilities and technology costs also increased, mainly due to the amortization of the right-of-\nuse asset of the Bolton property from the sale and lease back arrangement completed in the first quarter of 2022, higher costs to\nsupport our new local satellite yards, as well as higher costs as we shift to cloud-based solutions to improve customer experiences.\nShare-based payments also increased as a result of higher expense relating to share-based awards issued to senior executives and\nhigher expense from the premium-priced options and PSUs with market conditions granted in late 2021. In addition, we saw higher\ntravel, advertising and promotion costs from increased activity from the return to global travel to support and promote our various\ngrowth initiatives with the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. We also saw higher wages, salaries and benefits expenses from higher\nheadcount to accelerate our growth initiatives and our transformational journey to become a trusted global marketplace. We also saw\nhigher professional fees driven by our investment in new modern architecture to support our future marketplace and services strategy.\nIn addition, high inflationary pressures and rising costs have further contributed to higher selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThese increases were partially offset by a favourable impact of foreign exchange.\nOther Services Segment\nResults of Other Services segment operations are presented below for the comparative reporting periods.\nYear ended December 31,\n% Change\n(in U.S. dollars $000's, except percentages)\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2022 over 2021\n2021 over 2020\nService revenue\n$\n198,588\n$\n154,633\n$\n126,939\n28 %\n22 %\nAncillary and logistical service expenses\n52,628\n52,301\n59,982\n1 %\n(13)%\nOther costs of services\n10,597\n5,534\n1,314\n91 %\n321 %\nSelling, general and administrative\n73,682\n49,843\n28,037\n48 %\n78 %\nOther services profit\n$\n61,681\n$\n46,955\n$\n37,606\n31 %\n25 %\nOther Services revenue increased 28% to $198.6 million primarily due to higher RBFS revenues of $21.9 million and a full year\nrevenue of $20.5 million recognized for SmartEquip since its acquisition on November 2, 2021. In addition, we saw higher revenue of\n$4.4 million from our Rouse business.\nOther costs of services increased 91% to $10.6 million mainly due to the inclusion of SmartEquip since its acquisition on November 2,\n2021. Selling, general and administrative increased 48% to $73.7 million primarily due to the inclusion of SmartEquip, higher wages,\nsalaries and benefits expenses due to the growth in our RBFS business, and higher headcount in Rouse to support our growth\ninitiatives.\nRBFS revenue increased 47% driven by higher funded volumes and improved rate on fees earned from facilitating financing\narrangements. Our funded volume, which represents the amount of lending brokered by RBFS, increased 38% to $1.0 billion, and\nincreased 44% when excluding the impact of foreign exchange.\nOther Services profit increased 31% to $61.7 million primarily driven by our RBFS business.\nAdditionally, in the first quarter of 2021, we launched a business version of our IMS, which offers our customers asset management\nand disposition services, data analytics, dashboards, branded e-commerce sites and multiple external sales channels to help our\ncustomers achieve optimal returns. We continue to grow the number of organizations activated on IMS. In 2022, the number of\norganizations activated on our IMS increased by 465% compared to 2021.\nAs we evolve to a marketplace, we also facilitate retail and peer-to-peer auction events and equipment sale transactions via our online\ntechnology in exchange for hosting fees. In 2022, customers that used this service disposed of $108.3 million, a 24% decrease as\ncompared to the prior year primarily driven by an unfavourable supply environment."

Our long-term recurring cash requirements include:\n\nDebt principal repayments of $585.5 million, of which $4.4 million is due within one year, as well as associated interest\npayments of $32.3 million due within one year. For more information on our debt, including long term debt principal\nrepayments listed according to maturity, see Note 22 in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nPayments on our operating and finance lease obligations of $185.6 million, of which $27.6 million is due within one year.\nThis includes our Bolton property under a sale leaseback arrangement. For more information on our leases, see Note 26 in\nour consolidated financial statements.\nWe assess our liquidity based on our ability to generate cash and secure credit to fund operating, investing, and financing activities.\nOur liquidity is primarily affected by fluctuations in cash provided by operating activities, significant acquisitions of businesses,\npayment of dividends, our net capital spending1, and repayments of debt. We are also committed under various letters of credit and\nprovide certain guarantees in the normal course of business. We believe our principal sources of liquidity, which include cash flow\nfrom operations and our unused capacity under our revolving credit facilities of $719.8 million, is sufficient to fund our current and\nplanned operating activities.\nCash provided by operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to factors such as differences in the timing\nand amount of tax and employee compensation payments, timing, size and number of auctions during the year, the volume of our\ninventory contracts, the timing of the receipt of auction proceeds from buyers and of the payment of net amounts due to consignors, as\nwell as the location of the auction with respect to restrictions on the use of cash generated therein. Our cash provided by operating\nactivities can also fluctuate depending on the timing and size of our tax installments.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we completed the sale and leaseback of the Bolton property for a total sale consideration and net\nproceeds of approximately $165.0 million. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay our revolving credit facilities. We have also\nleased back the Bolton property while we complete the acquisition and development of a replacement property and auction site located\nin Amaranth, Ontario, Canada over the next two years. We intend to fund the material cash requirement for the acquisition and\ndevelopment of the replacement property from cash flows from ongoing operations.\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, as a result of the Company’s decision to discontinue the phase 2 review by the United Kingdom’s\nCompetition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) in connection with the proposed acquisition of Euro Auctions, the Company redeemed\nall of the 2021 Notes, which were held in escrow, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the original offering price of the notes, plus\naccrued and unpaid interest. As such, on May 4, 2022, the Company paid net proceeds of approximately $931.0 million to its\nbondholders.\n1\nWe calculate net capital spending as property, plant and equipment additions plus intangible asset additions less proceeds on\ndisposition of property, plant and equipment."

The\npreferred shareholders will receive annual dividends on a cumulative basis initially equal to 5.5% of the aggregate principal amount of\n$485.0 million, which will be payable quarterly in arrears in cash or in common shares at our election. The preferred shares are also\nentitled to receive, on an as-converted basis, any regular dividends paid to common shareholders, subject to a $0.27 per share per\nquarter floor. We expect that our net income attributable to common stockholders will decrease as a result of the cumulative\ndividends rights of the senior preferred shares and the rights of the senior preferred shares to participate in the allocation of\nundistributed earnings with common shares and the senior preferred shares. We also expect to use the funds for general corporate\npurposes and to repay certain obligations.\nProposed Acquisition of IAA\nIn connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement in relation to our proposed acquisition of IAA, we have agreed to various\ncovenants and agreements, including, among others, agreements to use reasonable best efforts to conduct our business in the ordinary\ncourse in all material respects between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the proposed acquisition and not to\ntake certain actions described in the Merger Agreement. We do not believe that these provisions will prevent us from meeting our\nongoing costs of operations, working capital needs or capital expenditure requirements. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is\nterminated in certain circumstances, we or IAA, as applicable, would be required to pay the other a termination fee of $189.0 million.\nIn connection with the proposed acquisition of IAA, the Company also entered into a debt commitment letter with certain financial\ninstitutions that committed to provide, subject to certain terms and conditions, a bridge loan facility in an aggregate principal amount\nof up to $2.8 billion and a backstop senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $750.0 million.\nOn December 9, 2022, the Company subsequently closed an amendment to its existing credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders.\nThe amendment allowed the Company to terminate the backstop commitments and replaced an additional $1.8 billion of bridge\ncommitments with new term loan A facility commitment. We plan to fund the cash portion of the proposed IAA acquisition through a\ncombination of (i) cash from the balance sheet, (ii) borrowings under certain credit facilities, (iii) the proceeds from the sale of debt\nsecurities or for any combination for the foregoing.\nIf we were to consider further acquisitions to deliver on our strategic growth drivers, we may seek financing through equity markets or\nadditional debt markets. The issuance of equity securities may result in dilution to our shareholders. Issuance of preferred equity\nsecurities could provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. Further, this additional capital may\nnot be available on reasonable terms, or at all.\nCash Flows\nYear ended December 31,\n% Change\n2022 over\n2021 over\n(in U.S. dollars $000's, except percentages)\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2021\n2020\nCash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n463,055\n$\n317,586 $\n257,872\n46 %\n23 %\nInvesting activities\n77,332\n(214,066)\n(276,722)\n(136)%\n(23)%\nFinancing activities\n(1,258,122)\n960,908\n(111,461)\n(231)%\n(962)%\nEffect of changes in foreign currency rates\n(18,771)\n(8,871)\n16,950\n112 %\n(152)%\nNet (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n(736,506)\n$\n1,055,557 $\n(113,361)\n(170)%\n(1,031)%\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $145.5 million during 2022, mainly due to higher cash inflows from the change\nin operating assets and liabilities and by an increase in our net income. The deferral of cash tax relating to the taxable gain portion of\nthe sale of our Bolton property combined with higher taxable income and lower income tax payments as a result of timing of\ninstallments further contributed to cash inflows. We also saw positive net cash flow related to timing of higher employee\ncompensation payments, prepayment in the fourth quarter of 2021 the first quarter of 2022 interest on the 2021 Notes held in escrow\nand timing, size and number of auctions. These positive impacts are partially offset by the timing of inventory purchases and higher\nadvances on auction contracts.\nNet cash provided by investing activities increased $291.4 million in 2022. This increase was primarily due to minimal cash outflows\nin the current year on acquisitions compared to $171.0 million cash outflow in 2021 for the acquisition of SmartEquip. We also saw"

      "text": "Ritchie Bros.\n54\ncash inflows from the sale of our Bolton property for total net cash proceeds of approximately $165.0 million. These were offset by\ncash outflows for the purchases of property plant and equipment primarily for the purchase of our Maltby auction site in the United\nKingdom, higher issuances of loans receivables in our RBFS business, and higher investments for the development of a new digital\ntechnology platform and modern architecture.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $2.2 billion in 2022. In 2021 we raised financing through the issuance of our 2021\nNotes to fund the Euro Auctions acquisition which were fully redeemed and repaid during the current year, contributing to $1.8 billion\nof the change year-over -year. In addition, we had borrowed $0.2 billion on our long-term revolver loan in 2021 to fund the\nacquisition of SmartEquip which was repaid in the current year using proceeds from the sale of the Bolton property and with cash on\nhand, also contributing to $0.4 billion of the change year-over year.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities. Working capital at December 31, 2022 was $167.8\nmillion, a decrease of $6.0 million compared to 2021.\nDividend Information\nWe declared and paid a regular cash dividend of $0.25 per common share for the quarters ended September 30, 2021, December 31,\n2021, and March 31, 2022. We declared and paid regular cash dividends of $0.27 per common share for the quarter ended June 30,\n2022 and September 30, 2022. We have declared, but not yet paid, a dividend of $0.27 per common share for the quarter ended\nDecember 31, 2022. All dividends that we pay are “eligible dividends” for Canadian income tax purposes unless indicated otherwise.\nReturn on Average Invested Capital\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2022, we updated our calculation of return on average invested capital (“ROIC”) and adjusted\nROIC. Refer to the non-GAAP measures section below, specifically our Adjusted Return and Adjusted ROIC Reconciliation, for\nfurther information.\nROIC increased 720 bps to 15.2% in 2022 from 8.0% in 2021. This increase is primarily due to an increase in net income attributable\nto stockholders over the comparative period, mainly driven by the gain from the sale of the Bolton property. Adjusted ROIC increased\n210 bps to 15.8% in 2022 compared to 13.7% in 2021, primarily due to a higher adjusted return as a result of higher operating income.\nCredit Facilities\nDuring 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders (as amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise\nmodified from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement is comprised of multicurrency revolving facilities (the\n“Revolving Facilities”) and a delayed-draw term loan facility (the “DDTL Facility”, together with the Revolving Facilities, the\n“Facilities”).\nThe Credit Agreement was most recently amended in December 2022 (the “December 2022 Amendment”), which, among other\nthings, (i) permits the proposed merger with IAA, (ii) provides commitments for a term loan A facility (the “TLA Facility”) in an\naggregate principal amount of up to $1.8 billion to be used to finance, in part, the IAA merger, (iii) provides us the ability to borrow\nup to $200.0 million of the Revolving Facilities under the Credit Agreement on a limited conditionality basis to finance, in part, the\nIAA merger, and (iv) provides the ability for us to add a term loan B facility in a future incremental amendment, the proceeds of\nwhich would be used to finance, in part, the proposed IAA acquisition."

      "text": "Ritchie Bros.\n57\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments, Estimates and Assumptions\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP, we must make decisions that impact the reported\namounts and related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the\nassumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, we apply judgments based on our understanding and\nanalysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience.\nThe following discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates is intended to supplement the significant accounting policies\npresented in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary\nData” presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which summarize the accounting policies and methods used in the preparation\nof those consolidated financial statements. The policies and the estimates discussed below are included here because they require more\nsignificant judgments and estimates in the preparation and presentation of our consolidated financial statements than other policies and\nestimates. Actual amounts could differ materially from those estimated by us at the time our consolidated financial statements are\nprepared.\nBusiness Combinations\nAccounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, particularly for the\nvaluation of intangible assets. The fair value of intangible assets are based upon widely-accepted valuation techniques, including\ndiscounted cash flows, multi period excess earnings method, and relief from royalty method, depending on the nature of the assets\nacquired or liabilities assumed. Inherent in each valuation technique are critical assumptions, including future cash flows and growth\nrates, gross margins, attrition rates, royalty rates, discount rates, and terminal value and forecast period assumptions. The discount\nrates used to discount expected cash flows to present values are typically derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis and\nadjusted to reflect inherent risks. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of\nsuch assumptions, estimates or actual results. We have also issued common shares in return for continuing employment services from\ncertain previous unitholders or shareholders which are measured at the fair value on acquisition date and amortized to acquisition-\nrelated costs until restrictions lapse and the common shares have vested.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized, but it is tested annually for impairment as of December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that those assets might be impaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is at the\nsame level or one level below an operating segment. We determined our reporting units to be A&M, Mascus, Rouse and SmartEquip.\nWe have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is\nnecessary. A qualitative assessment involves evaluating factors to determine the existence of events or circumstances that would\nindicate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill belongs is less than its carrying\namount. If the qualitative assessment indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying\namount, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed.\nIf a quantitative impairment test is required, the process is to identify potential impairment by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value\nwith its carrying amount. The reporting unit’s fair value is determined using various valuation methodologies based on an income\napproach or a market approach. In determining the reporting unit’s fair value, management is required to make judgments and\nassumptions relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. Historically, our reporting units have\ngenerated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill.\nA&M reporting unit goodwill\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we performed a qualitative assessment of the A&M reporting unit and we concluded there\nwere no indicators of impairment that existed.\nMascus reporting unit goodwill\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we performed a qualitative assessment of the Mascus reporting unit and we concluded there\nwere no indicators of impairment that existed.\nRouse reporting unit goodwill\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we performed a quantitative assessment of the Rouse reporting unit using an income approach\nbased on discounted cash flows. The fair value of the Rouse reporting unit was measured based on the present value of the cash flows\nthat we expect the reporting unit to generate. In determining our future cash flows, we estimated an annual revenue growth rate"

We estimated a discount rate of 16% reflecting the risk premium, including company specific risk,\non this reporting unit, and a terminal growth rate of 4% for the period beyond ten years, based on our best estimate of the cash flows\nand using market comparatives. As the fair value of the Rouse reporting unit was greater than its carrying amount, we concluded that\nRouse goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2022. An increase of one percentage to the discount rate used would not have\nresulted in goodwill impairment.\nSmartEquip reporting unit goodwill\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we performed a quantitative assessment of the SmartEquip reporting unit using an income\napproach based on discounted cash flows. The fair value of the SmartEquip reporting unit was measured based on the present value of\nthe cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate. In determining our future cash flows, we estimated an annual revenue\ngrowth rate ranging between 3% to 37% and an operating margin ranging between 19% to 62% from 2023 to 2032, based on our best\nestimate of the reporting units’ growth trajectory. We estimated a discount rate of 20% reflecting the risk premium on this reporting\nunit, including company specific risk, on this reporting unit, and a terminal growth rate of 3% for the period beyond ten years, based\non our view of the cash flows and using market comparatives. As the fair value of the SmartEquip reporting unit was greater than its\ncarrying amount, we concluded that SmartEquip goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2022. An increase of one percentage to\nthe discount rate used would not have resulted in goodwill impairment.\nIn the quantitative assessments performed, if estimates for future cash flows, which are driven by reporting units’ ability to generate\nrevenue growth were to decline, the overall reporting units’ fair value would decrease, resulting in potential goodwill impairment\ncharges. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions. As a result,\nthere can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of impairment tests will prove to be an accurate\nprediction of the future.\nIndefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested at least annually for impairment, and between annual tests if indicators of potential\nimpairment exist. To test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if\nit is more likely than not that the carrying amount of our indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative\nassessment is required. Based on our qualitative assessment, we determined there were no potential indicators of impairment of our\nindefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2022.\nLong-lived Assets\nWe test long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, long-lived assets are grouped and\ntested for recoverability at the lowest level that generates independent cash flows. Our assessment concluded that the carrying\namounts of our long-lived assets are recoverable at December 31, 2022.\nRecoverability of Trade Receivables\nOur trade receivables are generally secured by the equipment. Refer to Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements, Trade\nReceivables, regarding the activity in the allowance for expected credit losses.\nCollapse Provision\nUnder our standard terms and conditions for our auction sales, we are not obligated to pay a consignor for an asset that has not been\npaid for by the buyer, provided that the asset has not been released to the buyer. If the buyer defaults on its payment obligation, also\nreferred as a collapse sale, the sale is cancelled and the asset is returned to the consignor or re-sold at a future time. We estimate the\nexpected sales that may collapse at each reporting period relating to service revenue recognized and record a collapse provision for\nexpected cancelled sales. The collapse provision estimate is based on our historical experience with collapses and cancelled sales, our\nknowledge of the customer, data, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of the outcome of such transactions.\nSale Leaseback Transactions\nFrom time to time, we enter into sale leaseback transactions. In 2022, we completed the sale and leaseback of our Bolton property. To\ndetermine the gain on sale, we estimated the present value of relevant market rental payments, the expected lease term in the leaseback\narrangement and our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date of the lease."

      "text": "Ritchie Bros.\n59\nValuation of Inventories\nInventory consists of equipment and other assets purchased for resale in an upcoming onsite auction or online marketplace events. We\ntypically purchase inventory for resale through a competitive process where the consignor or vendor has determined this to be the\npreferred method of disposition through the auction process. We value our inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value\nwhere net realizable value represents the expected sale price upon disposition less make-ready costs and the costs of disposal and\ntransportation.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we reviewed our Inventory to ensure that it is recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable\nvalue. Refer to Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements, Inventory, regarding the activity in inventory write-downs.\nShare-based Compensation\nWe measure the fair value of equity-classified share units as of the grant date. We calculate the fair value of stock options on the grant\ndate using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We calculate the fair value of share units without market conditions on the grant\ndate based on the Company’s share price. We determine the fair value of share units with market conditions using the Monte Carlo\nsimulation model. The fair value of awards expected to vest is expensed over the respective remaining service period, with the\ncorresponding increase to APIC recorded in equity. Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination\nof the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. This estimate may require\ndetermination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model, including the expected life of the share units or stock options,\nvolatility and dividend yield, as well as making assumptions about them.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on temporary\ndifferences (differences between the accounting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities) and non-capital loss, capital loss,\nand tax credit carry-forwards. These are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply when these differences\nreverse. Deferred tax benefits, including non-capital loss, capital loss, and tax credits carry-forwards, are recognized to the extent that\nrealization of such benefits is considered more likely than not.\nLiabilities for uncertain tax positions are recorded based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for\nrecognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be\nsustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit\nas the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of\nexaminations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We also continually assess the\nlikelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the\nperiod in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.\nAdoption of New Standards\nEffective October 1, 2021, we have early adopted ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets\nand Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. The update primarily addresses the accounting for contract assets and\ncontract liabilities from revenue contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. An entity that early adopts in an interim\nperiod should apply the amendments (i) retrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition date occurs on or after\nthe beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period of early application and (ii) prospectively to all business combinations\nthat occur on or after the date of initial application. We have applied the amendments to the SmartEquip acquisition, which was\ncompleted on November 2, 2021.\nFor a discussion of our new and amended accounting standards refer to Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, Significant\nAccounting Policies.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent accounting pronouncements that significantly impact our accounting policies or the presentation of our consolidated financial\nposition or performance have been disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in “Part II, Item 8:\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data” presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K."

      "text": "Ritchie Bros.\n65\nAdjusted Return and Adjusted ROIC Reconciliation\nWe believe that comparing adjusted ROIC on a trailing twelve-month basis for different financial periods provides useful information\nabout the after-tax return generated by our investments. Adjusted ROIC is a measure used by management to determine how\nproductively the Company uses its long-term capital to gauge investment decisions.\nPreviously, we calculated ROIC as net income attributable to stockholders divided by average invested capital. During the quarter\nended September 30, 2022, we updated our calculation of ROIC to better align to industry standards. ROIC is now calculated as\nreported return divided by average invested capital. Reported return is defined as net income attributable to stockholders excluding the\nimpact of net interest expense, tax effected at the Company’s adjusted annualized effective tax rate. We also updated the calculation of\naverage invested capital to include average short-term debt.\nSimilarly, we updated our calculation of adjusted ROIC. Adjusted ROIC is calculated as adjusted return divided by adjusted average\ninvested capital. Adjusted return is defined as reported return, updated as noted above, and adjusted for items that we do not consider\nto be part of our normal operating results, tax effected at the applicable tax rate. Adjusted average invested capital is calculated as\naverage invested capital, updated as noted above, but excludes any long-term debt in escrow.\nThese changes have been applied retrospectively to all periods presented, as applicable. Accordingly, the Company will no longer\nreport adjusted ROIC excluding escrowed debt as one of our non-GAAP measures as previously labeled."

      "text": "Ritchie Bros.\n70\nITEM 7A:\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe conduct operations in local currencies in countries around the world, but we use the U.S. dollar as our presentation currency. As a\nresult, we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risk. We cannot accurately predict the future effects of foreign\ncurrency fluctuations on our financial condition or results of operations, nor quantify their effects on the macroeconomic environment.\nThe proportion of revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in a given period will differ from the annual\nproportion for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was 42%, depending on the size and location of auctions held during the\nperiod. On an annual basis, we expect fluctuations in revenues and operating expenses to largely offset and generally act as a natural\nhedge against exposure to fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar.\nDuring 2022, we recorded a foreign currency translation adjustment of $29.2 million, compared to $21.7 million in 2021. Our foreign\ncurrency translation adjustment arises from the translation of our net assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar to the\nU.S. dollar for reporting purposes. Based on our exposures to foreign currency transactions at December 31, 2022, and assuming all\nother variables remain constant, a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the Canadian dollar and Euro against the U.S. dollar would\nresult in an increase/decrease of approximately $34.7 million in our consolidated comprehensive income, of which $35.2 million\nrelates to our foreign currency translation adjustment and is offset by $0.5 million to our net income.\nWe enter into forward contracts to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks related to certain intercompany balances\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nInterest Rate Risk\nLoans under our syndicated and foreign credit facilities bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either a base rate (or Canadian\nprime rate for certain Canadian dollar borrowings) or floating rate customarily used by the syndicate and depending on the borrowing\ncurrency, including LIBOR, SOFR, SONIA, €STR, EURIBOR, and TIBOR. In either case, an applicable margin is added to the rate.\nAt December 31, 2022, we had a total of $114.6 million in loans (facilities drawn and term loans) bearing floating rates of interest, as\ncompared to $319.1 million at December 31, 2021. Based on the amount owing at December 31, 2022, and assuming all other\nvariables remain constant, a change in the interest rate by 100 bps would result in an increase/decrease of approximately $1.1 million\nin the pre-tax interest we accrue per annum.\nAt December 31, 2022, fixed rate debt (the 2016 Notes) represents 82% of our long-term debt and bears interest at a fixed rate of\n5.375% per annum (2021: 91% of our long-term debt bearing interest at fixed rates between 4.750% and 5.375% per annum). The\nproportion of fixed-to-floating debt is anticipated to change upon consummation of the IAA merger and the related funding of the $1.8\nbillion of new Term Loan A commitments, which are floating rate, and from the issuance of any debt securities and/or additional debt\nfinancing required to complete the proposed acquisition of IAA. We continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk, and while\nwe have not adopted a long-term hedging strategy to protect against interest rate fluctuations associated with our variable rate debt, we\nmay consider hedging specific borrowings if we deem it appropriate in the future."

Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding\nthe amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

As discussed in Note 2(s) to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill\nis tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. The Company’s goodwill is further\ndescribed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAuditing management’s annual goodwill impairment tests related to the SmartEquip and Rouse reporting\nunits involved subjective auditor judgment due to the significant estimation uncertainly in determining\nthe fair values of the reporting units. The fair value estimates were made using discounted cash flow\nmodels. Significant judgment was required in assessing the assumptions used, in particular projected\nrevenue growth rates, projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)\nmargins, terminal growth rates and discount rates.\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over\nthe Company’s goodwill impairment review, including controls over management’s review of the\nsignificant assumptions described above.\nOur substantive procedures to test the Company’s estimated fair values of the SmartEquip and Rouse\nreporting units, included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions\ndiscussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We assessed the projected\nrevenue growth rates, projected EBITDA margins and terminal growth rates used by management by\ncomparing them to current economic and industry trends. We also assessed the Company’s projections\nfor revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins by comparing the projections to actual historic operating\nresults. We performed sensitivity analysis on the projected revenue growth rates, projected EBITDA\nmargins, terminal growth rates and discount rates to evaluate the potential changes in fair values of the\nreporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions. We also involved our valuation\nspecialists to assist in the review of the valuation methodology as well as the evaluation of the\nCompany’s discount rates by comparing the rates against discount rate ranges that were independently\ndeveloped by our valuation specialists using publicly available market data for comparable entities.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nChartered Professional Accountants\nWe have served as the Company‘s auditor since 2013.\nVancouver, Canada\nFebruary 21, 2023"

Auctioneers Incorporated and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Company”, “Ritchie Bros.”, “we”, “us”, or\n“our”) provide a marketplace for insights, services and transaction solutions for commercial assets. The Company offers its customers\nend-to-end transaction solutions for used commercial and other durable assets through its omnichannel platform, which includes\nauctions, online marketplaces, listing services, and private brokerage services. The Company also offers a wide array of value-added\nservices connected to commercial assets as well as asset management software and data as a service solutions to help customers make\nmore accurate and reliable business decisions. Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Incorporated is a company incorporated in Canada under the\nCanada Business Corporations Act, whose shares are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and the Toronto\nStock Exchange (“TSX”).\n2.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\n(a) Basis of Preparation\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“US\nGAAP”) and the following accounting policies have been consistently applied, except as otherwise noted, in the preparation of the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nUnless otherwise indicated, all amounts in the following tables are in thousands except share and per share amounts.\nOn February 24, 2022, the geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe intensified with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, sharply affecting\neconomic and global financial markets. Subsequent economic sanctions of Russia have exacerbated ongoing economic challenges,\nincluding issues such as rising inflation, increasing fuel costs and global supply chain disruption. The Company does not have any\ndirect or significant operations in Russia or Ukraine, or any material operations in neighboring countries and only has limited number\nof direct customers in the effected region. The extent of the ongoing impacts of the conflict on our operational and financial\nperformance, the impact of higher fuel costs globally adding to inflationary pressures, including our ability to execute on our business\nstrategies and initiatives and sustain our operations in Europe and globally, will depend on future developments, including the\ncontinued evolution of military activity and sanctions imposed with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Given the evolving nature of the\ncrisis, the Company cannot currently reasonably estimate the impacts of the conflict on its business operations, results of operations,\ncash flows or financial performance.\nReclassification\nCertain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified from selling, general and administrative expenses to\ncosts of services for certain employee costs related to equipment inspections to conform to the presentation of the current period\nfinancial statements.\n(b) Basis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and non-wholly owned subsidiaries\nin which the Company has a controlling financial interest either through voting rights or means other than voting rights. All inter-\ncompany transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation. Where the Company’s ownership interest in a consolidated\nsubsidiary is less than 100%, the non-controlling interests’ share of these non-wholly owned subsidiaries is reported in the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheets as a separate component of equity or within temporary equity. The non-controlling interests’ share of the\nnet income of these non-wholly owned subsidiaries is reported in the Company’s consolidated income statements as a deduction from\nthe Company’s net earnings to arrive at net income attributable to stockholders of the Company.\nInvestments in entities that the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over, but not control, are accounted for using\nthe equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, investments are stated at initial costs and are adjusted for\nsubsequent additional investments and the Company's share of earnings or losses and distributions."

      "text": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except where noted)\nRitchie Bros.\n79\n2.\nSignificant Accounting Policies (continued)\n(b) Basis of Consolidation (continued)\nThe Company consolidates variable interest entities (“VIEs”) if the Company has (a) the power to direct matters that most\nsignificantly impact the VIEs economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE\nthat could potentially be significant to the VIE. For VIEs where the Company has shared power with unrelated parties, the Company\nuses the equity method of accounting to report their results. The determination of the primary beneficiary involves judgment.\n(c) Revenue Recognition\nRevenues are comprised of:\n\nService revenue, including the following:\ni.\nRevenue from auction and marketplace (“A&M”) activities, including commissions earned at our live and online bidding\nauctions, online marketplaces, and private brokerage services where we act as an agent for consignors of equipment and\nother assets, and various auction-related fees, including listing and buyer transaction fees; and\nii.\nOther services revenue, including revenue from listing services, refurbishment, logistical services, financing, appraisals,\ndata and software subscriptions and other ancillary and transactional service fees; and\n\nInventory sales revenue as part of A&M activities\nThe Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, or upon completion\nof the performance obligation, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or\nservices. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a series of distinct goods or\nservices, to the customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue\nwhen, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The transaction price is reduced by estimates of variable consideration such as\nvolume rebates and discounts. All estimates, which are evaluated at each reporting period, are based on the Company’s historical\nexperience, anticipated volumes, and best judgment. For auctions, revenue is recognized when the auction sale is complete and the\nperformance obligation is satisfied at the end of the auction process. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration\nreceived or receivable and is shown net of value-added tax and duties.\nService Revenues\nCommissions from sales at the Company’s auctions represent the percentage earned by the Company on the gross proceeds from\nequipment and other assets sold at auction. The majority of the Company’s commissions are earned as a pre-negotiated fixed rate of\nthe gross selling price. Other commissions from sales at the Company’s auctions are earned from underwritten commission contracts,\nwhen the Company guarantees a certain level of proceeds to a consignor.\nThe Company accepts equipment and other assets on consignment and stimulates buyer interest through professional marketing\ntechniques by matching sellers (also known as consignors) to buyers through the auction or private sale process. Prior to offering an\nitem for sale on its online marketplaces, the Company also performs inspections.\nFollowing the sale of the item, the Company invoices the buyer for the purchase price of the asset, taxes, and, if applicable, the buyer\ntransaction fee, collects payment from the buyer, and remits the proceeds to the seller, net of the seller commissions, applicable taxes,\nand applicable fees. Commissions are calculated as a percentage of the winning bid price of the property sold at auction. Fees are also\ncharged to sellers for listing and inspecting equipment. Other revenue earned in the process of conducting the Company’s auctions\ninclude administrative, documentation, and advertising fees."

Commission and fee revenue are recognized on the date of the auction sale upon the final acceptance of the\nwinning bid.\nUnder the standard terms and conditions of its auction sales, the Company is not obligated to pay a consignor for property that has not\nbeen paid for by the buyer, provided the property has not been released to the buyer. If the buyer defaults on its payment obligation,\nalso referred to as a collapsed sale, the sale is cancelled in the period in which the determination is made, and the property is returned\nto the consignor or placed in a later event-based or online auction. The Company recognizes a provision for expected collapsed or\ncancelled sales which is the Company’s best estimate of the service revenues relating to transactions which may not complete and\nwhere the buyer may default on its obligation. The Company determines the provision based on historical collapse experience,\ncustomer data and reasonable and supportable forecasts of the outcome of such transactions.\nOnline marketplace commission revenue is reduced by a provision for disputes, which is an estimate of disputed items that are\nexpected to be settled at a cost to the Company, related to settlements of discrepancies under the Company’s equipment condition\ncertification program. The equipment condition certification refers to a written inspection report provided to potential buyers that\nreflects the condition of a specific piece of equipment offered for sale, and includes ratings, comments, and photographs of the\nequipment following inspection by one of the Company’s equipment inspectors.\nThe equipment condition certification provides that a buyer may file a written dispute claim during an eligible dispute period for\nconsideration and resolution at the sole determination of the Company if the purchased equipment is not substantially in the condition\nrepresented in the inspection report. Typically disputes under the equipment condition certification program are settled with minor\nrepairs or additional services, such as washing or detailing the item; the estimated costs of such items or services are included in the\nprovision for disputes.\nCommission revenue is recorded net of commissions owed to third parties, which are principally the result of situations when the\ncommission is shared with a consignor in an auction guarantee risk and reward sharing arrangement.\nUnderwritten commission contracts can take the form of guarantee contracts. Guarantee contracts typically include a pre-\nnegotiated percentage of the guaranteed gross proceeds plus a percentage of proceeds in excess of the guaranteed amount. If actual\nauction proceeds are less than the guaranteed amount, commission is reduced; if proceeds are sufficiently lower, the Company can\nincur a loss on the sale. Losses, if any, resulting from guarantee contracts are recorded in the period in which the relevant auction is\ncompleted. If a loss relating to a guarantee contract held at the period end to be sold after the period end is known or is probable and\nestimable at the financial statement reporting date, the loss is accrued in the financial statements for that period. The Company’s\nexposure from these guarantee contracts fluctuates over time.\nOther services revenue also includes fees for refurbishment, logistical services, financing, appraisals, data and software subscriptions,\nand other ancillary and transactional service fees. Fees are recognized in the period in which the service is provided or the product is\ndelivered to the customer."

Revenue related to inventory contracts is recognized in\nthe period in which the sale is completed, title to the property passes to the purchaser and the Company has fulfilled any other\nobligations that may be relevant to the transaction. In its role as auctioneer, the Company auctions its inventory to equipment buyers\nthrough the auction process. Following the sale of the item, the Company invoices the buyer for the purchase price of the asset, taxes,\nand, if applicable, the buyer transaction fee, and collects payment from the buyer.\nWith the final acceptance of the winning bid, the highest bidder becomes legally obligated to pay the full purchase price, which is the\nwinning bid of the property purchased. Title to the property is transferred in exchange for the winning bid price, and if applicable, the\nbuyer transaction fee plus applicable taxes. In a private treaty transaction where inventory is sold in a private process or inventory\ncontracts are sold on our online marketplaces, commission and fee revenue is recognized on the date the buyer has obtained control of\nthe asset.\n(d) Costs of Services\nCosts of services incurred in earning A&M revenues are comprised of expenses incurred in direct relation to conducting auctions\n(“direct expenses”), earning online marketplace revenue, and earning other fee revenue. Direct expenses include direct labor, buildings\nand facilities charges, travel, advertising and promotion costs and fees paid to unrelated third parties who introduce the Company to\nequipment sellers who sell property at the Company's auctions and marketplaces. Costs of services to operate our online marketplace\nrevenue excludes hosting costs where we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and\nexternal sales to our customers.\nCosts of services incurred to earn online marketplace revenue in addition to the costs listed above also include inspection costs.\nInspections are generally performed at the seller’s physical location. The cost of inspections includes payroll costs and related benefits\nfor the Company’s employees that perform and manage field inspection services, the related inspection report preparation and quality\nassurance costs, fees paid to contractors who perform field inspections, related travel and incidental costs for the Company’s\ninspection service organization, and office and occupancy costs for its inspection services personnel. Costs of earning online\nmarketplace revenue also include costs for the Company’s customer support, online marketplace operations, logistics, and title and\nlien investigation functions.\nCosts of services incurred in earning other fee revenue include ancillary and logistical service expenses, direct labor (including\ncommissions on sales), cloud infrastructure and hosting costs, software maintenance fees, and materials. Costs of services exclude\ndepreciation and amortization expenses.\n(e) Cost of Inventory Sold\nCost of inventory sold includes the purchase price of assets sold for the Company’s own account and is determined using a specific\nidentification basis."

The Company has the option to settle certain share\nunit awards in cash or shares and expects to settle them in shares. The cost of PSUs granted is measured at the fair value of the\nunderlying PSUs at the grant date. If the PSU includes a market condition, the Company assesses the probability of satisfying the\nmarket condition in its estimate of fair value. PSUs vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria or\nmarket conditions. Share-based compensation expense for PSUs with a market condition is recognized regardless of whether the\nmarket condition is satisfied subject to continuing service over the requisite service period.\nThe Company also has a senior executive restricted share unit (“RSU”) plan and an employee RSU plan that provides for the award of\nRSUs to certain senior executives and employees, respectively, of the Company. The Company has the option to settle certain share\nunit awards in cash or shares and expects to settle them in shares. The cost of RSUs granted is measured at the fair value of the\nunderlying RSUs based on the fair value of the Company’s common shares at the grant date. RSUs vest based on the passage of time\nand include restrictions related to employment.\nThe fair value of awards expected to vest under these plans is expensed over the respective remaining service period of the individual\nawards, on an accelerated recognition basis, with the corresponding increase to APIC recorded in equity. At the end of each reporting\nperiod, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the\noriginal estimates, if any, is recognized in earnings, such that the consolidated expense reflects the revised estimate, with a\ncorresponding adjustment to equity. Dividend equivalents on the equity-classified PSUs and RSUs are recognized as a reduction to\nretained earnings over the service period.\nStock Option Plans\nThe Company has three stock option compensation plans that provide for the award of stock options to selected employees, directors\nand officers of the Company. The cost of options granted is measured at the fair value of the underlying option at the grant date. The\nfair value of options expected to vest under these plans is expensed over the respective remaining service period of the individual\nawards, on an accelerated recognition basis, with the corresponding increase to APIC recorded in equity. Upon exercise, any\nconsideration paid on exercise of the stock options and amounts fully amortized in APIC are credited to the common shares.\nLiability-classified Share-based Payments\nThe Company maintains other share unit compensation plans that vest over a period of up to three years after grant. Under those plans,\nthe Company is either required or expects to settle vested awards on a cash basis or by providing cash to acquire shares on the open\nmarket on the employee’s behalf, where the settlement amount is determined based on the average price of the Company’s common\nshares prior to the vesting date or, in the case of deferred share unit (“DSU”) recipients, following cessation of service on the Board of\nDirectors."

The determination of the fair value of the share units under these plans is\ndescribed in Note 25. The fair value of the awards is expensed over the respective vesting period of the individual awards with\nrecognition of a corresponding liability. Changes in fair value after vesting are recognized through compensation expense.\nCompensation expense reflects estimates of the number of instruments expected to vest.\nThe impact of forfeitures and fair value revisions, if any, are recognized in earnings such that the cumulative expense reflects the\nrevisions, with a corresponding adjustment to the settlement liability. Liability-classified share unit liabilities due within 12 months of\nthe reporting date are presented in trade and other liabilities while settlements due beyond 12 months of the reporting date are\npresented in other non-current liabilities.\n(g) Leases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company may have lease agreements with lease and non-lease\ncomponents, which are generally accounted for separately. Additionally, for certain vehicle and equipment leases, management\napplies a portfolio approach to account for the right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and liabilities for assets leased with similar lease terms.\nOperating Leases\nOperating leases are included in other non-current assets, trade and other liabilities, and other non-current liabilities in our\nconsolidated balance sheets if the initial lease term is greater than 12 months. For leases with an initial term of 12 months or less the\nCompany recognizes those lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease\npayments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the\npresent value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, management\nuses the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of\nlease payments. Management uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. The Company includes lease payments for renewal or\ntermination options in its determination of lease term, ROU asset, and lease liability when it is reasonably certain that the Company\nwill exercise these options. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included\nin costs of services and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nFinance Leases\nFinance lease ROU assets and liabilities are included in property, plant and equipment, trade and other liabilities, and other non-\ncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nFinance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the\nlease term. As most of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, management uses the incremental borrowing rate based\non the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Management uses the implicit\nrate when readily determinable. The Company includes lease payments for renewal, purchase options, or termination options in its\ndetermination of lease term, ROU asset, and lease liability when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise these options.\nFinance lease ROU assets are generally amortized over the lease term and are included in depreciation expense. The interest on the\nfinance lease liabilities is included in interest expense."

If the transfer of the asset is a sale, the Company derecognizes the underlying asset and recognizes the gain\non sale of property, plant and equipment. The Company recognizes a lease obligation arising from the leaseback and the\ncorresponding ROU asset. If the fair value of the consideration for the sale of an asset does not equal the fair value of the asset, or if\nthe payments for the lease are not at market rates, the Company will make adjustments to measure the sale proceeds at fair value. Any\nbelow-market terms are accounted for as a prepayment of lease payments and any above-market terms are accounted for as additional\nfinancing provided by the buyer-lessor. If the transaction does not qualify for sale and leaseback accounting treatment, and control of\nthe asset has not transferred, then the asset is not derecognized, and no gain or loss is recorded as the transaction is accounted for as a\nfinancing transaction.\n(h) Derivative Financial Instruments\nDerivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not\ndesignated in a hedging relationship are recorded as part of operating income (expense) or non-operating income (expense) within\nchange in fair value of derivatives in the consolidated income statement depending on the nature of the derivative. Fair values for\nderivative instruments are determined using inputs based on market conditions existing at the balance sheet date as well as the\nsettlement date of the derivative, if applicable. Derivatives embedded in non-derivative contracts are recognized separately unless they\nare closely related to the host contract.\n(i) Fair Value Measurement\nFair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. The Company measures financial instruments or discloses select non-financial assets at fair\nvalue at each balance sheet date. Also, fair values of financial instruments measured at amortized cost are disclosed in Note 12.\nThe Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure\nfair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value are categorized within a\nfair value hierarchy, as disclosed in Note 12, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement or\ndisclosure. This fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level\n1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognized in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company determines\nwhether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization at the end of each reporting period.\nFor the purposes of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature,\ncharacteristics and risks of the assets or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above."

The functional currency for each of the parent\nentity’s subsidiaries is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates, which is usually the currency\nof the country of residency.\nAccordingly, the financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries that are not denominated in United States dollars have been\ntranslated into United States dollars using the exchange rate at the end of each reporting period for asset and liability amounts and\nthe monthly average exchange rate for amounts included in the determination of earnings. Any gains or losses from the translation of\nasset and liability amounts are included in foreign currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nIn preparing the financial statements of the individual subsidiaries, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional\ncurrency are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transaction. At the end of each reporting period,\nmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Foreign currency\ndifferences arising on retranslation of monetary items are recognized in earnings.\n(k)\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents is comprised of cash on hand, deposits with financial institutions, and other short-term, highly liquid\ninvestments with original maturity of three months or less when acquired, that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.\n(l)\nRestricted Cash\nIn certain jurisdictions, local laws require the Company to hold cash in segregated bank accounts, which are used to settle auction\nproceeds payable resulting from live onsite auctions and online marketplace sales conducted in those regions. In addition, the\nCompany also holds cash generated from its online marketplace sales in separate escrow accounts, for settlement of the respective\nonline marketplace transactions as a part of its secured escrow service. Restricted cash balances also include funds held in accounts\nowned by the Company in support of short-term stand-by letters of credit to provide seller security. Non-current restricted cash\nconsists of funds that are restricted as to withdrawal or use for other than current operations and are designated for expenditure in the\nacquisition of non-current assets and in business combinations.\n(m) Trade and Other Receivables\nTrade receivables principally include amounts due from customers as a result of live onsite auction and online marketplace\ntransactions. The recorded amount reflects the purchase price of the item sold, including the Company’s commission. The allowance\nfor credit losses is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The Company\ndetermines the allowance based on historical write-off experience, customer economic data and reasonable and supportable forecasts\nof future economic conditions.\nThe Company reviews the allowance for credit losses regularly and past due balances are reviewed for collectability. Account\nbalances are charged against the allowance when the Company believes that the receivable will not be recovered."

In addition, certain jurisdictions require auctioneers to hold\ntitle to assets and facilitate title transfer on sale. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value where net realizable\nvalue represents the expected sale price upon disposition less make-ready costs and the costs of disposal and transportation. As part of\nits government business, the Company purchases inventory for resale as part of its commitment to purchase certain surplus\ngovernment property (Note 27). The significant elements of cost include the acquisition price, in-bound transportation costs of the\ninventory, and make-ready costs to prepare the inventory for sale that are not selling expenses. Write-downs to the carrying value of\ninventory are recorded in cost of inventory sold on the consolidated income statement.\n(o) Property, Plant and Equipment\nAll property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes all expenditures that are directly\nattributable to the acquisition or development of the asset, net of any amounts received in relation to those assets, including scientific\nresearch and experimental development tax credits.\nThe cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labor, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the\nassets to working condition for their intended use, the costs of dismantling and removing items and restoring the site on which they are\nlocated (if applicable), and capitalized interest on qualifying assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or\nrecognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow\nto the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\nAll repairs and maintenance costs are charged to earnings during the financial period in which they are incurred. Gains and losses on\ndisposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying\namount of the item and are recognized net within operating income on the income statement.\nDepreciation is provided to charge the cost of the assets to operations over their estimated useful lives based on their usage as follows:\nAsset\nBasis\nRate / term\nLand improvements\nDeclining balance\n10 %\nBuildings\nStraight-line\n15 - 30 years\nYard equipment\nDeclining balance\n20 - 30 %\nAutomotive equipment\nDeclining balance\n30 %\nComputer software and equipment\nStraight-line\n3 - 5 years\nOffice equipment\nDeclining balance\n20 %\nLeasehold improvements\nStraight-line\nLesser of lease term or\neconomic life\nNo depreciation is provided on freehold land or on assets in the course of construction or development. Depreciation of property, plant\nand equipment under finance leases is recorded in depreciation expense.\nLegal obligations to retire and to restore property, plant and equipment and assets under operating leases are recorded at\nmanagement’s best estimate in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate can be made, with a corresponding\nincrease in asset carrying value. The liability is accreted to face value over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. The\nCompany does not have any significant asset retirement obligations."

Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets, or\ncomponents of a disposal group, are measured at carrying amount in accordance with the Company’s accounting policies. Thereafter,\nthe assets, or disposal group, are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell and are not depreciated.\nImpairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on re-measurement are recognized in\noperating income on the income statement.\n(q) Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes all\nexpenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition or development of the asset, net of any amounts received in relation to\nthose assets, including scientific research and experimental development tax credits. Costs of internally developed software and\ntechnology assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated economic life of the software product and\ntechnology assets. Costs related to software and technology assets incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility or the\nbeginning of the application development stage of software and technology assets are charged to operations as such costs are incurred.\nOnce technological feasibility is established or the application development stage has begun, directly attributable costs are capitalized\nuntil the software and technology assets are available for use.\nAmortization is recognized in net earnings on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date that\nthey are available for use. The estimated useful lives are:\nAsset\nBasis\nRate / term\nTrade names and trademarks\nStraight-line\n2 - 15 years or indefinite-lived\nCustomer relationships\nStraight-line\n6 - 20 years\nSoftware and technology assets\nStraight-line\n3 - 7 years\nBacklog\nStraight-line\n2 years\nCustomer relationships includes relationships with buyers and sellers.\n(r) Impairment of Long-lived and Indefinite-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, comprised of property, plant and equipment, ROU assets, and intangible assets subject to amortization, are assessed\nfor impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. For the purpose of\nimpairment testing, long-lived assets are grouped and tested for recoverability at the lowest level that generates independent cash\nflows. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of the assets or asset groups is greater than the future projected\nundiscounted cash flows. The impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset or asset\ngroup. Fair value is based on valuation techniques or third party appraisals. Significant estimates and judgments are applied in\ndetermining these cash flows and fair values.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment as of December 31, and between annual tests if indicators of\npotential impairment exist. The Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment to first determine whether the\nquantitative impairment test is necessary. This involves an assessment of qualitative factors to determine the existence of events or\ncircumstances that would indicate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less\nthan its carrying value. If the qualitative assessment indicates it is not more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying\nvalue, a quantitative impairment test is not required. Where a quantitative impairment test is required, the procedure is to compare the\nindefinite-lived intangible asset’s fair value with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized as the difference between the\nindefinite-lived intangible asset’s carrying amount and its fair value."

The Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit\nto first determine whether the quantitative impairment test is necessary. This involves an assessment of qualitative factors to determine\nthe existence of events or circumstances that would indicate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit\nto which goodwill belongs is less than its carrying value. If the qualitative assessment indicates it is not more likely than not that the\nreporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, a quantitative impairment test is not required.\nIf a quantitative impairment test is required, the procedure is to identify potential impairment by comparing the reporting unit’s fair\nvalue with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The reporting unit’s fair value is determined using various valuation approaches\nand techniques that involve assumptions based on what the Company believes a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in\nestimating fair value on the measurement date. An impairment loss is recognized as the difference between the reporting unit’s\ncarrying amount and its fair value. If the difference between the reporting unit’s carrying amount and fair value is greater than the\namount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit, the impairment loss is restricted by the amount of the goodwill allocated to the\nreporting unit.\n(t) Deferred Financing Costs\nDeferred financing costs represent the unamortized costs incurred on the issuance of the Company’s long-term debt. Amortization of\ndeferred financing costs is provided on the effective interest rate method over the term of the facility.

Taxable profit differs from income before income taxes as reported in the consolidated income statement because it excludes (i)\nitems of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and (ii) items that are never taxable or deductible. The\nCompany’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted by the balance sheet date.\nDeferred Tax\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on temporary\ndifferences, which are differences between the accounting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities, and non-capital loss,\ncapital loss, and tax credits carryforwards are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply when these differences\nreverse. Deferred tax benefits, including non-capital loss, capital loss, and tax credits carryforwards, are recognized to the extent that\nrealization of such benefits is considered more likely than not. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates\nis recognized in earnings in the period that enactment occurs. When realization of deferred income tax assets does not meet the more-\nlikely-than-not criterion for recognition, a valuation allowance is provided.\nInterest and penalties related to income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits, are recorded in income tax expense in the income\nstatement.\nLiabilities for uncertain tax positions are recorded based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for\nrecognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be\nsustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit\nas the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company regularly assesses the potential\noutcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. The Company continually\nassesses the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjusts the income tax provision, income taxes payable, and deferred\ntaxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.\n(v) Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing net income attributable to stockholders by the weighted average number of\ncommon shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share has been determined after giving effect to outstanding dilutive stock options\nand share units calculated by adjusting the net income attributable to stockholders and the weighted average number of shares\noutstanding for all dilutive shares.\n(w) Defined Contribution Plans\nThe employees of the Company are members of retirement benefit plans to which the Company matches up to a specified percentage\nof employee contributions or, in certain jurisdictions, contributes a specified percentage of payroll costs as mandated by the local\nauthorities. The only obligation of the Company with respect to the retirement benefit plans is to make the specified contributions.\n(x) Advertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense is included in costs of services and selling, general and administrative\nexpenses on the accompanying consolidated income statements."

The purchase price is determined based on the fair value of the\nassets transferred, liabilities incurred, and equity interest issued, after considering any transactions that are separate from the business\ncombination. The Company allocates the aggregate of the fair value of the purchase consideration transferred to the tangible and\nintangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition with any excess recorded\nas goodwill. The fair value determinations require judgement and may involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets and contingent liabilities. The purchase price allocation may be provisional during a\nmeasurement period of up to one year to provide reasonable time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure the\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any such measurement period adjustments are recognized to the assets and liabilities assumed,\nwith the corresponding offset to goodwill, in the period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Acquisition-related costs\nassociated with the acquisition are expensed as incurred.\n(z) New and Amended Accounting Standards\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract\nLiabilities from Contracts with Customers. The update primarily addresses the accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities\nfrom revenue contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. The update requires that an acquirer recognize and\nmeasure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606 - Revenue from\nContracts with Customers, whereas prior to the adoption of the update, contract assets acquired and contract liabilities assumed in a\nbusiness combination were recognized at fair value on the acquisition date. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments is\npermitted, including adoption in an interim period. An entity that early adopts in an interim period should apply the amendments (1)\nretrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition date occurs on or after the beginning of the fiscal year that\nincludes the interim period of early application and (2) prospectively to all business combinations that occur on or after the date of\ninitial application. The Company early adopted the update as of October 1, 2021 and therefore has applied the amendments to all\nacquisitions completed since January 1, 2021, which includes only the acquisition of SmartEquip, which was completed on November\n2, 2021."

The Company performed a quantitative goodwill assessment of the Rouse and\nSmartEquip reporting units and concluded that the fair value of both reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts.\nSignificant items subject to estimates and judgments in 2022 were made in accounting for the completed sale and leaseback\ntransaction of our Bolton property (Note 18 & Note 26). The Company determined the following estimates in calculating the gain on\nsale: the present value of market rental payments of the Bolton property sold, the expected lease term in the leaseback arrangement\nand the Company’s incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date of the lease.\nAccounting for business combinations also requires estimates with respect to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed. Such estimates of fair value may require valuation methods which use significant estimates and assumptions. At the\nacquisition of SmartEquip, we estimated the fair value of the intangible assets acquired, using valuation methods, which required\nmanagement to make estimates with respect to expected future cash flows and growth rates, gross margins, attrition rates, royalty\nrates, discount rates, terminal value, and forecast period. The Company based these estimates on historical and anticipated results,\nindustry trends, economic analysis, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable, including assumptions as to future\nevents."

Business Combinations\nProposed IAA Acquisition\nOn November 7, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization which was subsequently\namended on January 22, 2023 (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which it has agreed to acquire IAA, Inc. (“IAA”). Under the\nterms of the Merger Agreement, IAA stockholders will receive $12.80 in cash and 0.5252 shares of the Company for each share of\nIAA common stock they own. Pursuant to such terms, the Company will (i) issue approximately 70.3 million shares of its common\nstock to the stockholders of IAA and (ii) pay to the stockholders of IAA approximately $1.7 billion in cash consideration. In addition,\nthe Company will repay approximately $1.2 billion of IAA’s net debt. Certain outstanding equity awards will also be cancelled and\nexchanged into equivalent outstanding equity awards covering the Company’s common shares based on the equity award exchange\nratio. Upon completion of the acquisition, the Company’s shareholders will own approximately 59% of the common shares of the\ncombined company on a fully diluted basis, IAA’s stockholders will own approximately 37%, and Starboard will own approximately\n4% (Note 24).\nThe acquisition of IAA is expected to close in the first half of 2023, subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, including, among\nother things, (1) the approval of the issuance of our common shares by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders\nof our outstanding common shares, (2) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of\nIAA’s common stock, and (3) other customary closing conditions.\nIn connection with the Merger Agreement, the Company entered into a debt commitment letter with certain financial institutions that\ncommitted to provide, subject to certain terms and conditions, a bridge loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $2.8\nbillion and a backstop senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $750.0 million. On December\n9, 2022, the Company subsequently closed an amendment to its existing credit agreement (Note 22) with a syndicate of lenders and\nobtained commitments for term loan A facility in an aggregate amount of up to $1.8 billion to be used to finance the proposed IAA\nacquisition. The amendment also allowed the Company to permanently terminate the backstop senior revolving credit commitments\nand reduce the senior secured bridge facility commitments by the amount of the term loan A facility and the amount of the existing\nterm loans under the existing credit agreement.\nThe Board of Directors of the Company also expects to approve the payment of a one-time special dividend to the Company’s\nshareholders in the amount of $1.08 per share, contingent upon the completion of the merger and consent of the TSX. IAA stockholders\nwill not be entitled to receive the special dividend with respect to any of the Company’s common shares received as consideration. We\nwill not pay the special dividend if the Merger Agreement is terminated or if the merger is not completed. Furthermore, if the Merger\nAgreement is terminated under specified circumstances, the Company or IAA may be required to pay the other a termination amount of\n$189.0 million or the Company may be required to reimburse IAA for its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the Merger\nAgreement up to an aggregate amount of $5.0 million.\nVeriTread Acquisition\nOn January 3, 2023, the Company acquired 8,889,766 units of VeriTread, LLC (“VeriTread”), a Florida limited liability company, for\napproximately $25.0 million from its existing unitholders and acquired another 1,056,338 units through an investment of $3.0 million\ncash. As a result, the Company increased its investment in VeriTread from 11% to 75%. VeriTread is a transportation technology\ncompany that provides an online marketplace solution for open deck transport, connecting shippers and service providers. Also, on\nJanuary 3, 2023, the Company entered into a put/call agreement with one of the minority unitholders of VeriTread for their remaining\nunits. Pursuant to this agreement, the minority unitholder has rights, in certain circumstances, to put its remaining units of VeriTread\nto the Company, subject to VeriTread achieving certain performance targets, and the Company has the right to call the remaining units\nof the minority unitholder upon achievement of certain integration milestones."

At December 31, 2022, the Company had accrued $3.5 million (2021: $3.9 million) for interest and\npenalties.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is subject to audit by the Canadian federal and provincial taxing authorities, by the\nU.S. federal and various state taxing authorities and by the taxing authorities in various foreign jurisdictions. Tax years ranging from\n2014 to 2021 remain subject to examination in Canada, the United States, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.\nThe Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) has been conducting audits of the Company’s 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019 taxation\nyears. If the CRA challenges the manner in which the Company has filed its tax returns and reported its income with respect to any of\nthe audits, the Company will have the option to appeal any such decision. While the Company believes it is, and has been, in full\ncompliance with Canadian tax laws and expects to vigorously contest any proposed assessments or any notice of assessments or\nreassessments received from the CRA, the Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these audits and the final disposition\nof any appeals pertaining to such audits. If the CRA makes an adverse determination and the Company is unsuccessful in appealing\nsuch determination reflected in any assessment or reassessment, then the Company could incur additional income taxes, penalties, and\ninterest, which could have a material negative effect on its operations.\nOn February 13, 2023, the CRA issued a proposal letter to Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers (International) Ltd. asserting that one of its\nLuxembourg subsidiaries was resident in Canada from 2010 through 2015 and that its worldwide income should be subject to\nCanadian income taxation. The Luxembourg subsidiary was in operation from 2010 until 2020. In the event that the CRA issues a\nnotice of assessment or reassessment, the Company expects to vigorously contest such notice as the Company disagrees with the\nassertion regarding Canadian residency. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction makes a final determination that the income\nof the Luxembourg subsidiary for 2010 through 2015 was subject to Canadian income tax laws, the Company may ultimately be liable\nfor additional total Canadian federal and provincial income tax of approximately $26.0 million - $30.0 million, exclusive of interest\nand penalties, for the period specified in the proposal letter. The CRA may also challenge the manner in which the Company has filed\nits tax returns and reported its income with respect to 2016 to 2020 taxation years and may assert that the income of the Luxembourg\nsubsidiary was subject to Canadian income tax because the Luxembourg subsidiary was also resident in Canada during these years.\nThe Company could then incur additional income taxes, penalties and interest which could have a material negative effect on its\noperations."

The fair values of the loan receivables with a maturity date greater\nthan one year are determined by estimating discounted cash flows using market rates. The carrying values of the term loan and long-\nterm revolver loans, before deduction of deferred debt issue costs, approximates their fair values as the interest rates on the loans is\nshort-term in nature.

The change in the valuation of the derivatives due to the range of possible expected settlement dates\nwas not significant to the financial statements.

The Company’s policy is to limit the amount of advances to a\npercentage of the estimated gross auction proceeds from the sale of the related assets, and before advancing funds, require proof of\nowner’s title to and equity in the assets, as well as receive delivery of the assets and title documents at a specified auction site, by a\nspecified date and in a specified condition of repair.\nAdvances against auction contracts are generally secured by the assets to which they relate, as the Company requires owners to\nprovide promissory notes and security instruments registering the Company as a charge against the asset. Advances against auction\ncontracts are usually settled within two weeks of the date of sale, as they are netted against the associated auction proceeds payable to\nthe owner.\nAssets Held for Sale\nBalance, December 31, 2020\n$\n—\nReclassified from property, plant and equipment\n17,779\nDisposal\n(241)\nBalance at December 31, 2021\n$\n17,538\nReclassified from (to) property, plant and equipment\n(10,148)\nDisposal\n(7,067)\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n$\n323\nOn March 17, 2022, the Company completed the sale and leaseback of a parcel of land including all buildings, in Bolton, Ontario,\nCanada for a total sale consideration of $208.2 million Canadian dollars (approximately $165 million) net of closing and transaction\ncosts, and recognized a gain on disposition of property, plant and equipment of $169.1 million. The net book value of the Bolton\nproperty was $7.1 million. The payments for the lease were not considered to be at market rates given an initial two year rent free\nperiod and, accordingly, the Company adjusted the sales proceeds and the gain to fair value. The Bolton property continues to be used\nfor auction operations under the operating leaseback agreement until the completion of the acquisition and development of a\nreplacement property located in Amaranth, Ontario, Canada (Note 26). On February 3, 2023, the Company signed an amendment to its\nagreement to purchase a replacement property, and as a result of the vendor completing its conditions under the agreement, the\nCompany anticipates to close the purchase of the Amaranth property of $22 million in early March 2023 and begin its development.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company also classified vacant land in Casa Grande, Arizona with a net book value of $10.5 million as an\nasset held for sale. During the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the Company assessed that the property no longer met the asset held for\nsale criteria and therefore reclassified the net book value of the property to property, plant and equipment."

Debt (continued)\nLong-term Debt\na)\nTerm Loan and Long-term Revolver Loans\nDuring 2016, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders (as amended and restated, supplemented or\notherwise modified from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement is comprised of multicurrency revolving\nfacilities (the “Revolving Facilities”) and a delayed-draw term loan facility (the “DDTL Facility”, together with the Revolving\nFacilities, the “Facilities”).\nThe Credit Agreement was amended in September 2021 (the “September 2021 Amendment”), which, among other things, (i) extended\nthe maturity date of the Facilities from October 27, 2023 to September 21, 2026, (ii) increased the total size of the Facilities provided\nunder the Credit Agreement to up to $1.0 billion, including $295.0 million of commitments under the DDTL Facility, (iii) reduced the\napplicable margin for base rate loans and LIBOR loans at each pricing tier level, (iv) reduced the applicable percentage per annum\nused to calculate the commitment fee in respect of the unused commitments under the Facilities at each pricing tier level, and (v)\nincluded customary provisions to provide for the eventual replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate.\nImmediately prior to the September 2021 Amendment, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the DDTL Facility was\n$90.0 million ($118.9 million Canadian dollars). In connection with the September 2021 Amendment, the Company refinanced that\namount with the proceeds from a borrowing under the DDTL Facility. Under the terms of the September 2021 Amendment, there were\nno mandatory principal repayments of borrowings under the DDTL Facility until the earlier of when the remaining $205.0 million is\ndrawn or the third quarter of 2022. The Company did not draw on the remaining $205.0 million before it expired on June 28, 2022\nand, therefore, mandatory principal repayments began in the third quarter of 2022. The principal payments are subject to an annual\namortization rate of 5%, payable in quarterly installments, with the balance payable at maturity. As a result of the expiry of the unused\nportion of the DDTL Facility during 2022, the Company wrote off $0.7 million of deferred debt issuance costs included in non-current\nassets to interest expense.\nThe Credit Agreement was amended in December 2022 (the “December 2022 Amendment”), which, among other things, (i) permits\nthe proposed merger with IAA (the “IAA merger”), (ii) provides commitments for a term loan A facility (the “TLA Facility”) in an\naggregate principal amount of up to $1.8 billion to be used to finance, in part, the IAA merger, (iii) provides the Company the ability\nto borrow up to $200.0 million of the Revolving Facilities under the Credit Agreement on a limited conditionality basis to finance, in\npart, the IAA merger, and (iv) provides the ability for the Company to add a term loan B facility in a future incremental amendment,\nthe proceeds of which would be used to finance, in part, the proposed IAA acquisition.\nThe Company incurred total debt issuance costs of $0.8 million in connection with the December 2022 Amendment, of which $0.3\nmillion has been included in non-current assets and $0.5 million in acquisition-related costs.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had unamortized deferred debt issue costs relating to the Facilities and the TLA Facility of\n$4.3 million (2021: $5.7 million)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company made scheduled repayments on the DDTL Facility of $2.2 million (2021: $5.3\nmillion). The Company did not make any voluntary term loan prepayments during the year ended December 31, 2022 (2021: $nil)."

The\nPSU Plans allow the Company to choose whether to settle the awards in cash or in shares. The Company intends to settle by issuance\nof shares.

The majority of these leases are non-cancellable. The Company also has further operating leases for\ncomputer equipment, certain motor vehicles and small office equipment where it is not in the best interest of the Company to purchase\nthese assets.\nThe majority of the Company's operating leases have a fixed term with a remaining life between one month and 17 years, with\nrenewal options included in the contracts. The leases have varying contract terms, escalation clauses and renewal options. Generally,\nthere are no restrictions placed upon the lessee by entering into these leases, other than restrictions on use of property, sub-letting and\nalterations. At the inception of a lease, the Company determines whether it is reasonably certain to exercise a renewal option and\nincludes the options in the determination of the lease term and the lease liability where it is reasonably certain to exercise the option. If\nthe Company's intention is to exercise an option subsequent to the commencement of the lease, the Company will re-assess the lease\nterm. The Company has included certain renewal options in its operating lease liabilities for key property leases for locations that have\nstrategic importance to the Company such as its Corporate Head Office. The Company has not included any purchase options\navailable within its operating lease portfolio in its determination of its operating lease liability.\nOn March 17, 2022, the Company completed the sale and leaseback of its Bolton property, a parcel of land including all buildings, in\nBolton, Ontario (Note 16). The Company intends to lease the Bolton property for a period of 28 months until such time that the\nreplacement property is available for the relocation of the Company’s operations. The lease has an initial rent-free period of two years\nand an option to renew the lease for two additional one-year periods, during which time the lease is cancellable at one month’s notice.\nUpon completion of the sale, the Company recorded a $16.6 million ROU asset representing the right-of-use of the Bolton property\nfor the estimated lease term and a $4.5 million long term lease liability representing the obligation to make lease payments arising\nfrom the operating lease at the end of the initial two-year period."

The Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s CEO and CFO, overseen by the Company’s Board of\nDirectors and implemented by the Company’s management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles, and the requirements of the SEC.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In\nmaking this assessment, management used the criteria described in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (“COSO”).

Auctioneers Incorporated\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Incorporated (the “Company”)\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO\ncriteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”),\nthe consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income,\ncomprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the\nrelated notes, and our report dated February 21, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of\nthe effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control\nover Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based\non our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company\nin accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nand the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such\nother procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention\nor timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nChartered Professional Accountants\nVancouver, Canada\nFebruary 21, 2023"
