      "text": "Dear Fellow Shareholders,\nFrom 2009 through 2021, the world was awash with incredibly cheap  \n(in some cases, nearly free) capital, as friendly stimulus became the antidote \nto every financial problem rearing its ugly head. Even recent geopolitical \ntrauma and a global pandemic were no match for the central bank \nprinting presses of nations around the globe. Modest unemployment and \nnon-existent inflation somehow cohabitated in harmony. In 2021, the \nenvironment was “near perfection” for Jefferies, as well as for many of our \nclients. With 2022 behind us, the dreamy days of easy money and nonstop \n“risk on” as a guiding mantra have passed into the history books. \nBefore we get too melancholy, there are more than a few reasons for us to \nbe optimistic, despite the industry-wide slowdown in 2022 and the litany \nof other crosscurrents we are still facing. At the top of our list is our belief \nthat capital formation is not dead, it is just resting. It is incredibly difficult \nto price risk and capital when interest rate increases have no end in sight. \nThis uncertainty makes everything freeze up and that is what happened in \n2022, with this freeze eventually working its way into the M&A market. \nThe good news is that the pace and slope of interest rate increases appear \nto be declining, which implies, unless something unusual happens, we are \ncloser to the thawing of the capital markets than the initial deep freeze. \nInvestors understand this and will begin acting in anticipation of the new \ninterest rate regime. As long as the stabilized rates aren’t unduly excessive \n(and thus far, it appears they will be navigable), the world will go back to \npricing risk, as well as pursuing new capital formation and increased M&A. \nWe have no crystal ball and don’t know if this will start at some point in \n2023 or 2024, but we are confident it is only a matter of time—it always is. \nJefferies could not be better positioned for this eventuality. \nWe have spent the last five years focusing on two goals: First, to do \neverything in our power to position Jefferies as the best full service \nglobal investment banking firm. Second, to optimize and monetize \nour legacy merchant banking portfolio and return to our shareholders \nany excess capital. In 2022, we finally crossed over to become a \nstraightforward, highly focused and readily understandable pure-play \ninvestment banking firm. \nJANUARY 9, 2023\nCapital formation  \nis not dead, it is  \njust resting. ...  \nAs long as the \nstabilized rates aren’t \nunduly excessive  \n(and thus far, it \nappears they will \nbe navigable), the \nworld will go back \nto pricing risk, as \nwell as pursuing new \ncapital formation and \nincreased M&A. ... \nJefferies could not be \nbetter positioned for \nthis eventuality."

It is easy to think that this confluence \nof events is beyond frustrating and would cause us to question our \noriginal assumptions and strategic direction. For us, this could not be \nfurther from the truth. While part of our team was successfully wrapping \nup some additional legacy asset sales, preparing a major spin-off to \nshareholders and collapsing our holding company structure, the vast \nmajority of our team did such a solid job that Jefferies’ overall results \nin 2022 were incredibly respectable. Not only were we able to deliver a \n10.3% return on adjusted tangible equity in a “really tough year,” but more \nimportantly, we continued to build upon the significant investments in \npeople and infrastructure we have made over the past decades. We \nhave never been more optimistic about our human capital, product \ncapabilities, industry expertise and geographic breadth. Our goal is to \ncontinue to gain market share, further strengthening our “never better” \ncompetitive position, and continue our quest to be the best full service \nglobal investment banking firm.\nJefferies’ 2022 total investment banking revenues, while down 38% from \nan off-the-charts 2021, represented our second-best year ever and were \nsubstantially above 2019 levels. Our advisory net revenues were only \n5% below last year’s all-time record result, while our underwriting net \nrevenues were down 59% due to the IPO and leveraged finance markets \nbeing substantially closed for much of the year, as discussed above. Our \ncombined equities and fixed income revenues were down only 19% versus \n2021 and up meaningfully versus 2019.\nMost significantly, for our fiscal 2022, Jefferies was the #6 largest \ninvestment banking firm in both global M&A, as well as global equity \ncapital markets (excluding China), up from #12 and #13, respectively, \nonly five years ago. We also moved up one spot from the prior year to #7 \nglobally in combined M&A, ECM and leveraged finance, an improvement \nfrom #10 in 2017. It is worth noting that all the competitors ahead of us on \nthese lists are trillion dollar plus global bank holding companies who often \nlead with their balance sheet, while Jefferies leads with ideas, expertise  \nand human capital. \nOur Equities franchise continued to expand in breadth and capability, \nwhile gaining market share across the majority of equity products in \n2022. We achieved a U.S. ranking of #6 and a European ranking of #7 \nfor equity research, while we were ranked #3 best overall in Asia for"

While our Fixed Income business \nwas down for the year, our fourth quarter was up over 71% and we carried \nthat momentum through the first month of fiscal 2023. \nAs mentioned above, monetizing our legacy merchant banking portfolio \nand returning capital to shareholders remains one of our overriding \npriorities, and we made continued progress in 2022. We expect to take a \nfurther important step later this week with our spin-off to shareholders \nof Vitesse Energy (“Vitesse”). In 2022, we returned an aggregate of $1.14 \nbillion to shareholders in the form of $280.1 million in dividends and the \nrepurchase of 25.6 million shares for a total of $859.6 million, or $33.58 \nper share.

Further, our Vitesse spin-off delivers \nto our shareholders an additional estimated more than $500 million of \nour shareholders’ equity. Pro forma for the Vitesse spin-off, we will have \nreturned over $5.5 billion in total capital to shareholders over the last five \nyears, representing over 72% of tangible book value at January 1, 2018.\nOur goal is to continue \nto gain market share, \nfurther strengthening \nour “never better” \ncompetitive position, \nand continue  \nour quest to be the \nbest full service \nglobal investment \nbanking firm."

Everyone who knows \nus is likely tired of hearing our experiences and lessons from all the \nups and downs over the past three-plus decades. In just the 2020s, we \nhave experienced a global pandemic, an active European war, incredible \ntension between the two leading world powers, the storming of the U.S. \nCapitol Building, dramatic declines in the prices of most risk assets, \nraging inflation, a series of massive interest rate increases and the \nfreezing up of the equity and leveraged finance new issue markets.  \nAnd this is just the last three years! \nWe have stopped waiting for a “return to normalcy” because, after being \nbeaten over the head for a combined 55 years at Jefferies, it is crystal \nclear to us that volatility, crosscurrents, surprises and challenges are \nwhat is normal. There is a relatively obscure movie where an aging Jack \nNicholson looks back on his frustrating life and wonders: “What if this \nis as good as it gets?” We accept the complicated world for what it is, \nand we count our lucky stars Jefferies is in a position to confront it with \noutstanding resources and capabilities and find growing opportunity \neverywhere we look. Instead of driving ourselves nuts anticipating what \nwill be thrown next at us, we are continuing to make sure our foundation is \ntremendously secure in terms of capital, risk systems, smart self-imposed \nlimits and diversification by product, service, sector and geography. \nAs important as our financial footing is our cultural foundation \nat Jefferies. A team that is honest, transparent, empowered, \nentrepreneurial, ambitious, diverse and committed will get the job done \nregardless of the environment. With solid diversification of risk and \nopportunity, as well as the right team, we can devote our resources \nexclusively to the benefit of our clients—this will allow Jefferies not \nonly to survive all the turmoil, but to find opportunities within each \nchallenge. Many of our competitors have different approaches to these \nmacro issues, as well as their capital foundation and culture, and often \nthis provides Jefferies with the opportunity to succeed, better serve \nour clients and grow our market share. We have done this consistently \nfor many decades, and our confidence in this approach has only been \nreinforced in recent years."

Every senior leader at Jefferies, including the two of us, \nproudly lives and works in the trenches every single day in partnership with \nour teammates for the benefit of our clients. Jefferies has always attracted \nthe kind of individual who relishes truly adding value by providing great \nadvice and execution tailored to our clients’ needs. We create, innovate  \nand solve the most important problems for our clients, whom we care \ndeeply about. We have said it before, but we cannot say it enough:  \nfor Team Jefferies, everything is personal. \nSo, what happens when an organization grows to over 5,000 people and the \nhierarchy remains incredibly flat? We are not saying we have the same firm \nstructure as we did 10, 20 or 30 years ago, because we clearly have made \nnecessary changes, but those who know us or work at Jefferies realize how \nflat we really are—only an email or phone call away. There are many upsides \nto this structure. Issues get elevated instantly. There is really no place to \nhide at our firm and if you are lazy, political, ineffective or a conniver— \nwe will find you, quickly. In fact, our structure is so well known that for the \nmost part those types of people don’t even bother to apply because they \nknow that they would not last long at Jefferies. \nOn the other hand, if you are special, you will also be identified and \nembraced, and your responsibility and position will rise very quickly \nbecause, quite frankly, we can never have too many of these partners at \nour firm. We admit proudly that we need the help and certainly do not have \nall the answers. Clearly, we provide our people with a lot of guidance and \noversight, but we trust our people more than many of our competitors do \nand we believe our firm is better for this partnership. Promotions are earned \nand celebrated at Jefferies, but rewarding career paths are valued even \nmore highly. As we continue to grow our firm, we will remain cognizant \nthat we must make adjustments to manage our growth, but the underlying \nmessage is that everyone is an active contributor and no task is below \nanyone’s pay grade, continuing to keep us hungry, motivated and humble."

We don’t take for granted any of the people \nwho settle our trades, build or support our technology, monitor our \nrisk, market our brand, keep us in compliance or otherwise support \nour team and business. Jefferies’ ownership mentality and “can do” \nentrepreneurial spirit permeates the entire support team of our firm, \nas much as it does the folks directly touching our clients. This is a \nsecret weapon at Jefferies and we have never been let down, not  \neven once. Going forward, this team will continue to be integral to  \nour collective success. \nPractical and Honest ESG. \nWe embrace ESG as individuals and as a firm not because we want \ncheck marks from graders to tell us that we passed, but because we \nbelieve it is the best way to run a business and live one’s life.

We are grateful that through our \neight Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”), many employees have \ntaken wonderful and deserved leadership roles throughout Jefferies \nand appreciate every day where we are getting better because of their \nefforts and the contagiousness of their drive, personalities and beliefs. \nWe have made great progress as a firm, and we are proud of it. That \nsaid, we also know there are areas where we have room for major \nimprovement, most notably the diversity of our senior operating ranks. \nWe are committed to building a more diverse firm and have long-term \naction plans to achieve specific results, while remaining steadfast in \nhiring the most qualified individuals for each role. We are confident that \nwe will get to where we want to be and are as impatient and focused as \nevery member of our ERGs (and countless others throughout Jefferies) \nwho share with us these same beliefs. \nAnother example is fossil fuels.

We \nhave made tremendous strides in this regard throughout our firm and are \nproud to be leaders. However, it is also clear to us that this switch is not \nan on/off, but rather a dimmer that will take time. For every action there is \na reaction, and a cold turkey stop will cause short-term problems that will \npreclude us from solving the more important long-term issue. That is why \nwe are working with our clients to do our best to finance and implement a \nsmart, long-term transition that is practical, intelligent and sustainable.\nThe point here is that Jefferies is a firm that stands up for what is right \nand we have no issue questioning conventional thinking regardless of \nthe short-term implications. That said, a mature, all-encompassing and \nrealistic view of each issue is required, and then specific action must \nbe charted and we must be held accountable. This approach is more \nnuanced, honest and valuable than contorting to a short-term goal of an \narbitrary checklist. \nBuilding a Distinct, Growing and Durable Firm. \nJefferies has always played the long game and for over 60 years has been \nbuilding a distinct, growing and durable firm around client service and talent. \nOur success reflects the power of continuity of strategy and focus, and is \nborne out by our results and growth over time. Today, our value proposition is \nbuilt on three pillars that set us apart from other leading firms: \nFirst: differentiated insight. Our success is driven by distinct industry, \nmarket and strategic insights. We have in-depth research and investment \nbanking coverage of virtually every industry sector, allowing us to deliver \nunique macro and sector perspectives and analyses. This further translates \nfor our clients to bespoke advice tailored to their needs and challenges and \ninformed by our vast expertise.\nSecond: relationships matter. At Jefferies, every relationship is personal \n—client engagements are partnerships and high-touch. We strive to \ndeploy the full resources of our firm to meet our clients’ needs every \ntime. Similarly, we are built for global collaboration, without borders or \nbureaucracy. This has been true since Jefferies was founded and is why \nwe’ve become one of a handful of investment banking firms that truly \nmatter, with a consistent repeat client base. With our relentless focus on \nclient service first, our clients trust that we care about their business and \ntheir success as much as they do."

      "text": "JEFFERIES 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n15\nRICHARD B. HANDLER\nChief Executive Officer\nBRIAN P. FRIEDMAN\nPresident\nThis relative outperformance has led to sustained AUM increases despite \na difficult fund-raising environment. (We define AUM as assets of funds \nand separately managed accounts managed by us or an affiliated asset \nmanager in which we have an equity interest or with whom we have an \nongoing revenue sharing arrangement.) AUM increased by 22% from \n$23.8 billion to $29.1 billion during fiscal 2022. $2.3 billion of the increase \nwas organic growth from managers that were on the LAM platform at the \nbeginning of the year. The gains were driven in particular by positive flows \ninto CoreCommodity (commodities), Schonfeld (multi-manager) and Point \nBonita (alternative credit trade finance). This continues the trend from \nprior years leading to a 52% increase in management fee related revenue \nto $50.5 million. The growth in AUM suggests a solid base for a continued \nincrease in the coming year.\nWe continued to expand the offerings of alternative strategies on our \nplatform, adding Hildene (opportunistic structured credit), Illuminate  \n(fin-tech focused venture capital), ISO-mts (financial institution niche \ncredit), Pearlstone (European credit) and Tephra (liquid digital assets). \nThese strategies often take a bit of time to get traction and build their \ntrack records but with the offerings that were added in prior years we \nbelieve we are well positioned with a diversified offering for institutional \ninvestors. We also have a strong pipeline of new opportunities as we seek \nto continue to enhance our product offering.\nANNUAL MEETING AND INVESTOR MEETING \nThanks for hearing us out. We look forward to answering any further \nquestions you may have at our upcoming Annual Meeting on March \n29, 2023. We also will hold our annual Jefferies Investor Meeting on \nOctober 17, 2023, at which time you will have the opportunity to hear \nfrom our senior leaders across the Jefferies platform. We thank all of \nyou—our clients and customers, employee-partners, fellow shareholders, \nbondholders, vendors and all others associated with our businesses— \nfor your continued partnership and support.\nSincerely,"

      "text": "JEFFERIES 2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n16\nThe following tables reconcile financial results reported in accordance with \ngenerally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") to non-GAAP financial \nresults. The Shareholder Letter contains non-GAAP financial information to \naid investors in viewing our businesses and investments through the eyes \nof management while facilitating a comparison across historical periods. \nHowever, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, \nand not as a substitute for, reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE ON FORWARD-LOOKING \nSTATEMENTS\nThis letter contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of \nthe safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act \nof 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on current views and include \nstatements about our future and statements that are not historical facts. These \nforward-looking statements are usually preceded by the words “should,” “expect,” \n“intend,” “may,” “will,” “would,” or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements \nmay contain expectations regarding revenues, earnings, operations, and other \nresults, and may include statements of future performance, plans, and objectives. \nForward-looking statements may also include statements pertaining to our \nstrategies for future development of our businesses and products. Forward-\nlooking statements represent only our belief regarding future events, many of \nwhich by their nature are inherently uncertain. It is possible that the actual results \nmay differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results indicated in these \nforward-looking statements. Information regarding important factors, including \nRisk Factors that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from \nthose in our forward-looking statements is contained in reports we file with the \nSEC. You should read and interpret any forward-looking statement together with \nreports we file with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any \nsuch forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent circumstances.\nPast performance may not be indicative of future results. Different types of \ninvestments involve varying degrees of risk. Therefore, it should not be assumed \nthat future performance of any specific investment or investment strategy will be \nprofitable or equal the corresponding indicated performance level(s).\nAppendix\nADDITIONAL SHAREHOLDER LETTER NOTES\nMarket Position Statistics presented within the Shareholder Letter are \nreferenced from several independent sources, as noted below:\nDealogic\n• \u00076th globally in mergers and acquisitions and equity capital markets (excluding \nChina), up from #12 and #13, respectively five years ago\n• \u00077th globally in mergers and acquisitions, equity capital markets and leveraged \nfinance, up from #10 in 2017\n• \u00077th globally in Equity Underwriting; 6th in EMEA and 7th in the U.S.  \nin Equity Underwriting\n• \u0007Global mergers and acquisitions fee pool declined 11% in 2022\n• \u0007Equity capital markets and leveraged finance global fee pool declined by 60% \nCoalition Greenwich 2022 Fixed Income Study\n• \u00071st in net positive business momentum in European Credit  \nfor three years in a row\nResearch II\n• \u0007#6 in U.S. equity research\n• \u0007#7 in European equity research \nAsiamoney\n• \u00073rd best overall combined research and sales\nReconciliation of Return on Adjusted Tangible Equity\n($ millions)\n(Unaudited) \nYear Ended \nNov. 30, 2022\nNet income attributable to common shareholders (GAAP)\n$\n777\nIntangible amortization and impairment expense, net of tax\n8\nAdjusted net income attributable to common shareholders \n(non-GAAP)\n$\n785\n($ millions)\n  \nNov. 30, 2021\nShareholders' equity (GAAP)\n$\n10,554\nLess: Intangible assets, net and goodwill\n(1,898)\nLess: Deferred tax asset\n(328)\nLess: Weighted average year-to-date impact of cash dividends \nand share repurchases\n(671)\nAdjusted tangible shareholders' equity (non-GAAP)\n$\n7,657\nBERKADIA\nReconciliation of Pre-Tax Income to Cash Earnings\n($ millions)\n(Unaudited) \nYear Ended \nNov. 30, 2022\nPre-tax income (GAAP)\n$\n283\nLess: Gains attributable to origination of mortgage \nservicing rights\n(241)\nAmortization, impairment and depreciation\n190\nUnrealized (gains) losses; and all other, net\n27\nCash earnings (non-GAAP)\n$\n259\nCalculation of Tangible Book Value as of January 1, 2018\n($ millions)\n  \n  \nDec. 31, 2017\nShareholders' equity (GAAP)\n$\n10,106\nLess: Intangible assets, net and goodwill\n(2,463)\nTangible book value (non-GAAP)\n$\n7,643\nReturn on adjusted tangible shareholders' equity (non-GAAP)\n10.3%"

We provide underwriting and financial advisory services across most industry\nsectors in the Americas; Europe and the Middle East; and Asia. Our capital markets businesses operate\nacross the spectrum of equities and fixed income products. Related services include prime brokerage,\nequity finance, research and strategy, corporate lending and real estate finance. Investment Banking and\nCapital Markets also includes our corporate lending joint venture (‘‘JFIN Parent LLC’’ or ‘‘Jefferies\nFinance’’), our commercial real estate finance joint venture (‘‘Berkadia Commercial Holding LLC’’ or\n‘‘Berkadia’’) and our automobile lending and servicing activities.\n• Asset Management provides alternate investment management services to investors globally.

During the year ended November 30, 2022 and\nin connection with the merger, we transferred these merchant banking investments primarily to our Asset\nManagement reportable segment. These investments are now managed by the respective segment managers and\nwe have revised our reportable segment presentation accordingly. Additionally, corporate activities are now fully\nallocated to either the Investment Banking and Capital Markets reportable segment or the Asset Management\nreportable segment. Prior year amounts have been revised to conform to the current segment reporting.\nFinancial information regarding our reportable business segments for the years ended November 30, 2022, 2021\nand 2020 is set forth in Note 24, Segment Reporting in our consolidated financial statements included in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K in Part II, Item 8 as updated by Exhibit 99.1 to our Form 8-K filed on October 7,\n2022.

Instrumental to all of this is our culture, which derives from our employees.\nWe have employees located throughout the world. At November 30, 2022, we had 5,381 employees globally\nwith approximately 66.5%, 23.1% and 10.4% of our workforce distributed across the Americas, Europe and the\nMiddle East and Asia, respectively.\nOur employees are predominantly in our Investment Banking and Capital Markets segment or the support\nthereof.

Our workforce is predominately composed of employees in roles\nsuch as investment bankers, salespeople, trading professionals, research professionals and other revenue\nproducing or specialized personnel. During 2022, we hired approximately 1,200 professionals globally.

Additionally, through our Employee Resource Groups,\nemployees have created lasting partnerships by volunteering time to support several of these charitable partners.\nCompetition\nAll aspects of our business are intensely competitive. We compete primarily with large global bank holding\ncompanies that engage in investment banking and capital markets activities as one of their lines of business and\nthat have greater capital and resources than we do. We also compete against other broker-dealers, asset managers\nand boutique firms. We believe the principal factors driving our competitiveness include our ability to provide\ndifferentiated insights to our clients that lead to better business outcomes; to attract, retain and develop skilled\nprofessionals; to deliver a competitive breadth of high quality service offerings; and to maintain a flat, nimble\nand entrepreneurial culture built on immediacy and client service.\nRegulation\nRegulation in the United States. The financial services industry in which we operate is subject to extensive\nregulation. In the U.S., the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of federal securities laws,\nand the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (‘‘CFTC’’) is the federal agency responsible for the\nadministration of laws relating to commodity interests (including futures, commodity options and swaps). In\naddition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (‘‘FINRA’’) and the National Futures Association\n(‘‘NFA’’) are self-regulatory organizations (‘‘SROs’’) that are actively involved in the regulation of financial\nservices businesses (securities businesses in the case of FINRA and commodities/futures businesses in the case\nof the NFA). In addition, broker-dealers that conduct securities activities involving municipal securities are\nsubject to regulation by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (‘‘MSRB’’). In addition to federal\nregulation, we are subject to state securities regulations in each state and U.S. territory in which we conduct\nsecurities or investment advisory activities. The SEC, FINRA, CFTC, NFA and state securities regulators\nconduct periodic examinations of broker-dealers, investment advisors, futures commission merchants (‘‘FCMs’’),\nswap dealers and security-based swap dealers (‘‘SBS dealers’’). The designated examining authority under the\nU.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ‘‘Exchange Act’’) for Jefferies LLC’s activities as a\nbroker-dealer is FINRA, and the designated self-regulatory organization under the U.S. Commodity Exchange\nAct for Jefferies LLC’s non-clearing FCM activities is the NFA. Financial services businesses are also subject to\nregulation and examination by state securities regulators and attorneys general in those states in which they do\nbusiness. In addition, broker-dealers, investment advisors, FCMs, swap dealers and SBS dealers must also\ncomply with the rules and regulation of clearing houses, exchanges, swap execution facilities and trading\nplatforms of which they are a member.\nBroker-dealers are subject to SEC, FINRA, MSRB and, state securities regulations that cover all aspects of the\nsecurities business, including sales and trading methods, trade practices among broker-dealers, use and\nsafekeeping of customers’ funds and securities, capital structure and requirements, anti-money laundering efforts,\nrecordkeeping and the conduct of broker-dealer personnel including officers and employees (although state\nsecurities regulations are, in a number of cases, more limited). Registered investment advisors are subject to,\namong other requirements, SEC regulations concerning marketing, transactions with affiliates, custody of client\nassets, disclosures to clients, conflict of interest, insider trading and recordkeeping; and investment advisors that\nare also registered as commodity trading advisors or commodity pool operators are also subject to regulation by\nthe CFTC and the NFA. FCMs, introducing brokers and swap dealers that engage in commodity options, futures\nor swap transactions are subject to regulation by the CFTC and the NFA, and SBS dealers are subject to\nregulation by the SEC. Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by the SEC, FINRA, CFTC, NFA,\nother SROs of which the broker-dealer is a member, and state securities regulators, or changes in the\ninterpretation or enforcement of existing laws or rules may directly affect the operations and profitability of\nbroker-dealers, investment advisors, FCMs, commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, swap\ndealers and SBS dealers.

To meet this best interest standard, a broker-dealer must satisfy four component obligations including a\ndisclosure obligation, a care obligation, a conflict of interest obligation, and a compliance obligation and both\nbroker-dealers and investment advisors are required to provide disclosures about their standard of conduct and\nconflicts of interest.\nIn addition, certain states, have proposed or adopted measures that would make broker-dealers, sales agents and\ninvestment advisors and their representatives subject to a fiduciary duty when providing products and services to\ncustomers. The SEC did not indicate an intent to pre-empt state regulation in this area, and some of the state\nproposals would allow for a private right of action. Since our Wealth Management division makes\nrecommendations to retail customers, it is required to comply with the obligations imposed under Reg BI and\napplicable state laws.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements. Several of our entities are subject to financial capital requirements that are set\nby regulation. Jefferies LLC is a dually registered broker-dealer and FCM and is required to maintain net capital\nin excess of the greater of the SEC or CFTC minimum financial requirements. As a broker-dealer, Jefferies LLC\nis subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule (the ‘‘Net Capital Rule’’). Jefferies LLC has elected to compute\nits minimum net capital requirement in accordance with the ‘‘Alternative Net Capital Requirement’’ as permitted\nby the Net Capital Rule, which provides that a broker-dealer shall not permit its net capital, as defined, to be less\nthan the greater of 2% of its aggregate debit balances (primarily customer-related receivables) or $250,000\n($1.5 million for prime brokers). Compliance with the Net Capital Rule could limit Jefferies LLC’s operations,\nsuch as underwriting and trading activities, and financing customers’ prime brokerage or other margin activities,\nin each case, that could require the use of significant amounts of capital, limit its ability to engage in certain\nfinancing transactions, such as repurchase agreements, and may also restrict its ability (i) to make payments of\ndividends, withdrawals or similar distributions or payments to a stockholder/parent or other affiliate, (ii) to make\na redemption or repurchase of shares of stock, or (iii) to make an unsecured loan or advance to such shareholders\nor affiliates. As a carrying/clearing broker-dealer, under FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA could impose higher\nminimum net capital requirements than required by the SEC, and could restrict a broker-dealer from expanding\nbusiness or require the broker-dealer to reduce its business activities. If the broker dealer also carries accounts for\nother broker dealers which are engaged in proprietary trading, it may need net capital of $7 million or tentative\nnet capital of $25 million, depending on circumstances. As a non-clearing FCM, Jefferies LLC is also required to\nmaintain minimum adjusted net capital of $1.0 million.\nSEC registered broker-dealers that also register with the SEC as security-based swap dealers engaging in\nprincipal transactions of security-based swaps (‘‘SBS’’) are subject to rules regarding capital, segregation and\nmargin requirements. The SEC rules establish similar standards for an entity registering as a standalone SBS\ndealer. The CFTC and NFA have also adopted swap dealer capital rules. Under the rules there is a minimum net\ncapital requirement for, among others, an entity that acts as a dealer in SBS or swaps, which is the greater of\n$20 million or 2% (that the SEC could, in the future, increase up to 4% or 8%) of a risk margin amount. The risk\nmargin amount for the SEC means the sum of (i) the total initial margin required to be maintained by the SEC-\nregistered SBS dealer at each clearinghouse with respect to SBS or swap transactions cleared for SBS or swap\ncustomers and (ii) the total initial margin amount calculated by the SEC-registered SBS dealer with respect to\nnon-cleared SBS and swaps under the SEC rules. The risk margin amount for the CFTC means the total initial\nmargin amount calculated by the CFTC-registered swap dealer with respect to non-cleared SBS and swaps under\nthe CFTC rules.\nJefferies Financial Services, Inc.

In addition to the specific\nfactors mentioned in this report, we may also be affected by other factors that affect businesses generally, such as\nglobal or regional changes in economic, business or political conditions, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics,\nclimate change, and natural disasters.\nMarket and Liquidity Risks\nOur business is subject to significant credit risk.\nIn the normal course of our businesses, we are involved in the execution, settlement and financing of various\ncustomer and principal securities and derivative transactions. These activities are transacted on a cash, margin or\ndelivery-versus-payment basis and are subject to the risk of counterparty or customer nonperformance. Even\nwhen transactions are collateralized by the underlying security or other securities, we still face the risks\nassociated with changes in the market value of the collateral through settlement date or during the time when\nmargin is extended and collateral has not been secured or the counterparty defaults before collateral or margin\ncan be adjusted. We may also incur credit risk in our derivative transactions to the extent such transactions result\nin uncollateralized credit exposure to our counterparties.\n10"

We may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral\nor return collateral pledged. In certain circumstances, we may, under industry regulations, purchase the\nunderlying securities in the market and seek reimbursement for any losses from the counterparty. However, there\ncan be no assurances that our risk controls will be successful.\nWe are exposed to market risk and our principal trading and investments expose us to risk of loss.\nMarket risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected\nby changes in market conditions. Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our\noperations and activities, including trading account assets and liabilities, loans, securities, short-term borrowings,\ncorporate debt, and derivatives. Market conditions that change from time to time, thereby exposing us to market\nrisk, include fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, relative exchange rates, and price deterioration or\nchanges in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer.\nIn addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell,\nsyndicate, or realize the value of security positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. The inability to\nreduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such\npositions, but also increase capital requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nA considerable portion of our revenues is derived from trading in which we act as principal. We may incur\ntrading losses relating to the purchase, sale or short sale of fixed income, high yield, international, convertible,\nand equity securities, loans, derivative contracts and commodities for our own account. In any period, we may\nexperience losses on our inventory positions as a result of the level and volatility of equity, fixed income and\ncommodity prices (including oil prices), lack of trading volume and illiquidity. From time to time, we may\nengage in a large block trade in a single security or maintain large position concentrations in a single security,\nsecurities of a single issuer, securities of issuers engaged in a specific industry, or securities from issuers located\nin a particular country or region. In general, because our inventory is marked to market on a daily basis, any\nadverse price movement in these securities could result in a reduction of our revenues and profits. In addition,\nwe may engage in hedging transactions that if not successful, could result in losses.\nSee Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Risk Management\nwithin Part II, Item 7. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nA credit-rating agency downgrade could significantly impact our business.\nMaintaining an investment grade credit rating is important to our business and financial condition. If our credit\nratings were downgraded, or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur, our business, financial\nposition and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be\ndamaged, which could adversely affect our client relationships. Additionally, we intend to access the capital\nmarkets and issue debt securities from time to time, and a decrease in our credit ratings or outlook could\nadversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, decrease demand for our\ndebt securities and increase the expense and difficulty of financing our operations. In addition, in connection\nwith certain over-the-counter derivative contract arrangements and certain other trading arrangements, we may be\nrequired to provide additional collateral to counterparties, exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of a\ncredit rating downgrade. Such a downgrade could also negatively impact the prices of our debt securities. There\ncan be no assurance that our credit ratings will not be downgraded.\n11"

      "text": "We may be adversely affected by changes in or the discontinuance of Interbank Offered Rates (‘‘IBORs’’), in\nparticular, London Interbank Offered Rate (‘‘LIBOR’’).\nCentral banks and regulators in a number of major jurisdictions (for example, the U.S., U.K., European Union\n(‘‘EU’’), Switzerland and Japan) have convened working groups to find, and implement the transition to, suitable\nreplacements for IBORs. On January 1, 2022, the publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. Dollar\nLIBOR maturities and all non-U.S. Dollar LIBOR maturities ceased and the remaining U.S. Dollar LIBOR\nmaturities will cease immediately after June 30, 2023. Accordingly, many existing LIBOR obligations will\ntransition to another benchmark after June 30, 2023 or, in some cases, have already transitioned. It is not\npossible to know what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may have on the financial markets\nfor LIBOR-linked financial instruments. Similar developments have occurred with respect to other IBORs.\nWe continue to work towards reducing our exposure to IBOR-referencing contracts, including derivatives,\nsecurities, and other financial products, to meet the industry milestones and recommendations published by\nNational Working Groups (‘‘NWG’’), including the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the ‘‘ARRC’’) in\nthe U.S.\nOn October 23, 2020, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (‘‘ISDA’’) published a new\nsupplement to the ISDA 2006 definitions and the related 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (the ‘‘Protocol’’). These\npublications are intended to facilitate the incorporation of robust rate fallback provisions into both legacy and\nnew derivative contracts with effect from January 25, 2021. A significant portion of our derivative exposures\nhave incorporated the Protocol.\nOur centralized LIBOR transition program continues to make progress with a focus on:\n• continuing to reduce our overall exposure to LIBOR,\n• implementing rate fallback provisions in new LIBOR contracts, where appropriate,\n• continuing to educate and inform clients on LIBOR transition and the necessity to prepare for the\ncessation of LIBOR,\n• assisting clients with discontinuing their issuance or use of LIBOR-linked products within the timelines\nspecified by NWGs,\n• supporting clients in their efforts to remediate contracts linked to LIBOR, including contracts to which\nwe are a party, and\n• planning for the implementation of rate fallback mechanisms across products based on the conventions\nrecommended by NWGs.\nUncertainty regarding IBORs and the taking of discretionary actions or negotiation of rate fallback provisions\ncould result in pricing volatility, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts,\ncompliance, legal and operational costs and risks associated with client disclosures, as well as systems\ndisruption, model disruption and other business continuity issues. In addition, uncertainty relating to IBORs\ncould result in increased capital requirements for us given potential low transaction volumes, a lack of liquidity\nor limited observability for exposures linked to IBORs or any emerging successor rates and operational incidents\nassociated with changes in and the discontinuance of IBORs.\nThe language in our contracts and financial instruments that define IBORs, in particular LIBOR, have developed\nover time and have various events that trigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected. If\na trigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments often give the calculation agent (which may be us)\ndiscretion over the successor rate or benchmark to be selected. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty as to\nhow the financial services industry will address the discontinuance of designated rates in contracts and financial\ninstruments or such designated rates ceasing to be acceptable reference rates. This uncertainty could ultimately\nresult in client disputes and litigation surrounding the proper interpretation of our IBOR-based contracts and\nfinancial instruments. Although we have adhered to the Protocol, it is applicable only to derivatives when both\nparties adhere to the Protocol or otherwise agree for it to apply to their derivatives.\n12"

The spread of COVID-19 has caused illness, quarantines, cancellation of\nevents and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in business activity and financial transactions, labor\nshortages, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. The ongoing effects\nof COVID-19 remain challenging to predict due to multiple uncertainties, including the transmissibility, severity,\nduration and resurgences of the outbreak; new virus variants and the potential extent of their spread; the\napplication and effectiveness of health and safety measures that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required\nby governments or public health authorities, including vaccines and treatments; the speed and strength of an\neconomic recovery; and the impact to our employees and our operations, our clients’ operations, suppliers and\nbusiness partners. Impacts to our business could be widespread and global, and material impacts may be\npossible, including the following:\n• Employees contracting COVID-19\n• Reductions in our operating effectiveness as our employees work from home or disaster-recovery\nlocations\n• Unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities\n• Unprecedented volatility in global financial markets\n• Reductions in revenue across our operating businesses\n• Closure of our offices or the offices of our clients\n• De-globalization\n• Potential regulatory scrutiny of our ability to adequately supervise our activities in accordance with\napplicable regulatory requirements\n13"

However, no assurance can be given that the steps being taken will be deemed to be adequate or\nappropriate, nor can we predict the level of disruption which will occur to our employees’ ability to provide\nclient support and service. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 outbreak has in the past, and may in the future, materially negatively impact stock\nand other securities prices and materially disrupt banking and other financial activity generally and in the areas in\nwhich we operate. This could likely result in a decline in demand for our products and services, which would\nnegatively impact our liquidity position and our growth strategy. Any one or more of these developments could\nhave a material adverse effect on our and our consolidated subsidiaries’ business, operations, consolidated\nfinancial condition, and consolidated results of operations.\nWe may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic,\ncybersecurity incidents and events, terrorist attacks, war, trade policies, military conflict, climate-related\nincidents, or other natural disasters.\nThe occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic, such as\nCOVID-19, or other widespread health emergency (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency),\ncybersecurity incidents and events, terrorist attacks, war, trade policies, military conflict, extreme climate-related\nincidents or events or other natural disasters, could create economic and financial disruptions, and could lead to\noperational difficulties (including travel limitations) that could impair our ability to manage our businesses. For\ninstance, military conflict and escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine have and may continue to result\nin geopolitical instability and adversely affect the global economy or specific markets, which could continue to\nhave an adverse impact or cause volatility in the financial services industry generally or on our results of\noperations and financial conditions. In addition, these geopolitical tensions can cause an increase in volatility in\ncommodity and energy prices, creating supply chain issues, and causing instability in financial markets.\nSanctions imposed by the United States and other countries in response to such conflict could further adversely\nimpact the financial markets and the global economy, and any economic countermeasures by the affected\ncountries or others, could exacerbate market and economic instability. While we do not have any operations in\nRussia or any clients with significant Russian operations and we have minimal market risk related to securities of\ncompanies either domiciled or operating in Russia, the specific consequences of the conflict in Ukraine on our\nbusiness is difficult to predict at this time, but in addition to inflationary pressures affecting our operations, we\nmay also experience an increase in cyberattacks against us and our third-party service providers from Russia or\nits allies.\nClimate change concerns and incidents could disrupt our businesses, adversely affect the profitability of\ncertain of our investments, adversely affect client activity levels, adversely affect the creditworthiness of our\ncounterparties, and damage our reputation.\nClimate change may cause extreme weather events that disrupt operations at one or more of our or our\ncustomer’s or client’s locations, which may negatively affect our ability to service and interact with our clients,\nand also may adversely affect the value of certain of our investments, including our real estate investments.\nClimate change, as well as uncertainties related to the transition to a lower carbon dependent economy, may also\nhave a negative impact on the financial condition of our clients, which may decrease revenues from those clients\nand increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients. Additionally, our\nreputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our involvement, or our clients’ involvement,\nin certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions\nwe make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change.\nNew regulations or guidance relating to climate change and the transition to a lower carbon dependent economy,\nas well as the perspectives of shareholders, employees and other stakeholders regarding climate change, may\n14"

When the outlook for such economic\nconditions is uncertain or negative, financial market activity generally tends to decrease, which reduces our\ninvestment banking revenues. Reduced expectations of U.S. economic growth or a decline in the global\neconomic outlook could cause financial market activity to decrease and negatively affect our investment banking\nrevenues.\nA sustained and continuing market downturn could lead to or exacerbate declines in the number of securities\ntransactions executed for clients and, therefore, to a decline in the revenues we receive from commissions and\nspreads. Correspondingly, a reduction of prices of the securities we hold in inventory or as investments would\nlead to reduced revenues.\nRevenues from our asset management businesses have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by\ndeclining securities prices, as well as widely fluctuating securities prices. Because our asset management\nbusinesses hold long and short positions in equity and debt securities, changes in the prices of these securities, as\nwell as any decrease in the liquidity of these securities, may materially and adversely affect our revenues from\nasset management.\nSimilarly, our merchant banking businesses may suffer from the above-mentioned impacts of fluctuations in\neconomic and market conditions, including reductions in business activity and financial transactions, labor\nshortages, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. In addition, other\nfactors, most of which are outside of our control, can affect our merchant banking businesses, including the state\nof the real estate market, the state of the Italian telecommunications market, and the state of international market\nand economic conditions which impact trading volume and currency volatility, and changes in regulatory\nrequirements.\nIn addition, global economic conditions and global financial markets remain vulnerable to the potential risks\nposed by certain events, which could include, among other things, level and volatility of interest rates,\navailability and market conditions of financing, economic growth or its sustainability, unforeseen changes to\ngross domestic product, inflation, energy prices, fluctuations or other changes in both debt and equity capital\nmarkets and currencies, political and financial uncertainty in the United States and the European Union, ongoing\nconcern about Asia’s economies, global supply disruptions, complications involving terrorism and armed\nconflicts around the world (including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine), or other challenges to global\ntrade or travel, such as those that have occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. More generally, because our\nbusiness is closely correlated to the general economic outlook, a significant deterioration in that outlook or\nrealization of certain events would likely have an immediate and significant negative impact on our business and\noverall results of operations.\n15"

Any\nsuch economic downturn, volatile business environment, hostile third-party action or continued\nunpredictable and unstable market conditions could adversely affect our general business strategies;\n• Unfavorable conditions or changes in general political, economic or market conditions could reduce the\nnumber and size of transactions in which we provide underwriting, financial advisory and other services.\nOur investment banking revenues, in the form of financial advisory and sales and trading or placement\nfees, are directly related to the number and size of the transactions in which we participate and could\ntherefore be adversely affected by unfavorable financial, economic or political conditions.

Even in the absence of a market\ndownturn, below-market investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could reduce asset\nmanagement revenues and assets under management and result in reputational damage that might make\nit more difficult to attract new investors;\n• Adverse changes in the financial markets could lead to regulatory restrictions that may limit or halt\ncertain of our business activities;\n• Limitations on the availability of credit can affect our ability to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis,\nwhich may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. Global market and economic\nconditions have been particularly disrupted and volatile in the last several years and may be in the future.\nOur cost and availability of funding could be affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads;\n• New or increased taxes on compensation payments such as bonuses may adversely affect our profits;\n• Should one of our clients or competitors fail, our business prospects and revenue could be negatively\nimpacted due to negative market sentiment causing clients to cease doing business with us and our\nlenders to cease loaning us money, which could adversely affect our business, funding and liquidity;\n• Unfavorable economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans and the\nservicing of loans originated by third-parties, which would have an adverse impact on the operations and\nprofitability of some of our financial services businesses.\nOperational Risks\nDamage to our reputation could damage our business.\nMaintaining our reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees.

There\nis no assurance that we will be able to successfully reverse the negative impact of allegations and rumors in the\nfuture and our potential failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand liquidity.\nWe may incur losses if our risk management is not effective.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure. Our risk management processes and procedures are designed\nto limit our exposure to acceptable levels as we conduct our business. We apply a comprehensive framework of\nlimits on a variety of key metrics to constrain the risk profile of our business activities. These limits reflect our\nrisk tolerances for business activity. Our framework includes inventory position and exposure limits on a gross\nand net basis, scenario analysis and stress tests, Value-at-Risk, sensitivities, exposure concentrations, aged\ninventory, amount of Level 3 assets, counterparty exposure, leverage, cash capital and performance analysis. See\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management\nwithin Part II. Item 7. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion. While we employ various\nrisk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their\napplication, including risk tolerance determinations, cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or\nthe specifics and timing of such outcomes. As a result, we may incur losses notwithstanding our risk\nmanagement processes and procedures.\nThe ability to attract, develop and retain highly skilled and productive employees is critical to the success of\nour business.\nOur ability to develop and retain our clients depends on the reputation, judgment, business generation\ncapabilities and skills of our professionals. To compete effectively, we must attract, retain and motivate qualified\nprofessionals, including successful investment bankers, sales and trading professionals, research professionals,\nportfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel, in addition to qualified, successful\npersonnel in functional, non-revenue producing roles. Competitive pressures we experience with respect to\nemployees could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nTurnover in the financial services industry is high. The cost of retaining skilled professionals in the financial\nservices industry has escalated considerably. Financial industry employers are increasingly offering guaranteed\ncontracts, upfront payments, and increased compensation. These can be important factors in a current employee’s\ndecision to leave us as well as in a prospective employee’s decision to join us. As competition for skilled\nprofessionals in the industry remains intense, we may have to devote significant resources to attracting and\nretaining qualified personnel.\nIf we were to lose the services of certain of our professionals, we may not be able to retain valuable relationships\nand some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services. If we are unable\nto retain our professionals or recruit additional professionals, our reputation, business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition will be adversely affected. Further, new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing\nbusinesses frequently require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional\nrevenues.\nMoreover, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors often claim that those\ncompetitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices. We may be subject to such claims in the future as we seek\nto hire qualified personnel who have worked for our competitors. Some of these claims may result in material\nlitigation. We could incur substantial costs in defending against these claims, regardless of their merits. Such\nclaims could also discourage potential employees who work for our competitors from joining us.\n17"

In recent years, there have been several highly publicized\nincidents involving financial services companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or other\nconfidential information, as well as cyber attacks involving theft, dissemination and destruction of corporate\ninformation or other assets, which in some cases occurred as a result of failure to follow procedures by\nemployees or contractors or as a result of actions by third-parties. Cyber attacks can originate from a variety of\nsources, including third-parties affiliated with foreign governments, organized crime or terrorist organizations,\nand malicious individuals both outside and inside a targeted company. Retaliatory acts by Russia or its allies in\nresponse to economic sanctions or other measures taken by the global community arising from the Russia-\nUkraine conflict could result in an increased number and/or severity of cyber attacks. Malicious actors may also\nattempt to compromise or induce our employees, clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive\ninformation or provide access to our data, and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent.\nLike other financial services firms, we and our third-party service providers have been the target of cyber attacks.\nAlthough we and our service providers regularly defend against, respond to and mitigate the risks of\ncyberattacks, cybersecurity incidents among financial services firms and industry generally are on the rise. We\nare not aware of any material losses we have incurred relating to cyber attacks or other information security\nbreaches. The techniques and malware used in these cyber attacks and cybersecurity incidents are increasingly\nsophisticated, change frequently and are often not recognized until launched because they are novel.

One of our subsidiaries is registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC\nand is a member of the NFA, is registered as a security-based swap dealer with the SEC and is registered with\nthe SEC as an OTC Derivatives Dealer. We have incurred significant compliance and operational costs as a result\nof the swaps and SBS rules adopted by the CFTC and SEC pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, and we expect that\nthe complex regulatory framework will continue to require significant monitoring and compliance expenditures.\nNegative effects could result from an expansive extraterritorial application of the Dodd-Frank Act and/or\ninsufficient international coordination with respect to adoption of rules for derivatives and other financial reforms\nin other jurisdictions.\nSimilar types of swap regulation have been proposed or adopted in jurisdictions outside the U.S., including in\nthe EU, the U.K. and Japan. For example, the EU and the U.K. have established regulatory requirements relating\nto portfolio reconciliation and reporting, clearing certain OTC derivatives and margining for uncleared\nderivatives activities under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (‘‘EMIR’’).\nThe Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation and a revision of the Market in Financial Instruments Directive\n(collectively referred to as ‘‘MiFID II’’) imposes certain restrictions as to the trading of shares and derivatives\nincluding market structure-related, reporting, investor protection-related and organizational requirements,\nrequirements on pre- and post-trade transparency, requirements to use certain venues when trading financial\ninstruments (which includes shares and certain derivative instruments), requirements affecting the way\ninvestment managers can obtain research, powers of regulators to impose position limits and provisions on\nregulatory sanctions.\nThe EU capital and liquidity legislation for banks implemented many of the finalized Basel III capital and\nliquidity standards, including in relation to the leverage ratio, market risk capital, and a net stable funding ratio.\nCertain of these changes began to be phased in from June 2021, and further changes will be required to be\nimplemented from 2023. In addition, new prudential regimes for investment firms are in the process of being\nimplemented in both the EU and the UK for MiFID authorized investment firms. The Investment Firms\nRegulation (IFR) and the Investment Firms Directive (IFD), being applicable to the UK and Europe, whilst\nsimplifying the capital treatment for investments firms such as the UK entity, Jefferies International Limited, and,\nits European subsidiary, Jefferies GmbH, will include a requirement that a certain amount of variable\nremuneration for material risk takers be paid in non-cash instruments and have a deferral element.\nImplementation of this requirement is effective from the financial year commencing December 1, 2022 for\nJefferies International Limited and Jefferies GmbH. Consequently, we are adapting our remuneration structures\nfor those employees identified as material risk takers.\nSignificant new legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry is regularly proposed and\nsometimes adopted. These legislative and regulatory initiatives affect not only us, but also our competitors and\ncertain of our clients. These changes could have an effect on our revenue and profitability, limit our ability to\npursue certain business opportunities, impact the value of assets that we hold, require us to change certain\nbusiness practices, impose additional costs on us and otherwise adversely affect our business. Accordingly, we\ncannot provide assurance that legislation and regulation will not eventually have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In the U.S., such initiatives frequently arise in\nthe aftermath of elections that change the party of the president or the majority party in the House and/or Senate.\n21"

      "text": "Increasing regulatory focus on evolving privacy and security issues and expanding laws could impact our\nbusinesses and investments and expose us to increased liability.\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation (the ‘‘EU GDPR’’ or ‘‘GDPR’’) applies in all EU Member States\nand also applies to entities established outside of the EU where such entity processes personal data in relation to:\n(i) the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA; or (ii) monitoring the behavior of data subjects\nas far as that behavior takes place in the EEA. The UK has implemented the GDPR as part of its national law\n(referred to as the ‘‘UK GDPR’’). The GDPR imposes a number of obligations on companies, including, without\nlimitation: accountability and transparency requirements; compliance with the data protection rights of data\nsubjects; and the prompt reporting of certain personal data breaches to both (1) the relevant data supervisory\nauthority without undue delay unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the data subject’s\nrights and freedoms; and (2) impacted individuals where the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk\nwith regard to their rights and freedoms.\nThe EU GDPR also includes restrictions on the transfers of personal data from the EEA to jurisdictions that are\nnot recognized as having ‘adequate data protection laws’. Obligations under the EU GDPR and implementing\nMember State legislation continue to evolve through legislation and regulatory guidance, for example imposing\nfurther restrictions on use of the standard contractual clauses (‘‘SCCs’’) to transfer data to third countries by\nrequiring companies to carry out a transfer privacy impact assessment.\nThe EU GDPR imposes significant fines for serious non-compliance of up to the higher of 4% of an\norganization’s annual worldwide turnover or €20 million (or approximately £17.5 million under the UK GDPR).\nThe EU GDPR identifies a list of points to consider when determining the level of fines to impose (including the\nnature, gravity and duration of the infringement). Data subjects also have a right to compensation as a result of\ninfringement of the EU GDPR for financial or non-financial losses.\nThe EU GDPR’s data protection obligations apply in the United Kingdom in substantially unvaried form under\n‘‘UK GDPR’’. The UK GDPR exists alongside the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and its requirements are largely\naligned with those under the EU GDPR and as such, may lead to similar compliance and operational costs with\npotential fines of up to £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover.\nOther privacy laws at both federal and state levels are in effect in the U.S. and other regions, many of which\ninvolve heightened compliance obligations similar to those under GDPR. The privacy and cybersecurity\nlegislative and regulatory landscape is evolving rapidly, and numerous proposals regarding privacy and\ncybersecurity are pending before U.S. and non-U.S. legislative and regulatory bodies. The adopted form of such\ndeveloping legislation and regulation will determine the level of any resources which we will need to invest to\nensure compliance. In the event of non-compliance with privacy laws and regulations, we could face significant\nadministrative and monetary sanctions as well as reputational damage which may have a material adverse effect\non our operations, financial condition and prospects.\nExtensive regulation of our business limits our activities, and, if we violate these regulations, we may be\nsubject to significant penalties.\nWe are subject to extensive laws, rules and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Firms that engage in\nproviding financial services must comply with the laws, rules and regulations imposed by national and state\ngovernments and regulatory and self-regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over such activities. Such laws, rules and\nregulations cover many aspects of providing financial services.\nOur regulators supervise our business activities to monitor compliance with applicable laws, rules and\nregulations. In addition, if there are instances in which our regulators question our compliance with laws, rules,\nor regulations, they may investigate the facts and circumstances to determine whether we have complied. At any\nmoment in time, we may be subject to one or more such investigations or similar reviews. At this time, all such\ninvestigations and similar reviews are insignificant in scope and immaterial to us. However, there can be no\nassurance that, in the future, the operations of our businesses will not violate such laws, rules, or regulations, or\n22"

The occurrence of any of these events could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory financial capital holding requirements that could impact\nvarious capital allocation decisions or limit the operations of our broker-dealers. In particular, compliance with\nthe financial capital holding requirement may restrict our broker-dealers’ ability to engage in capital-intensive\nactivities such as underwriting and trading, and may also limit their ability to make loans, advances, dividends\nand other payments and may restrict our swap dealers’ ability to execute certain derivative transactions.\nAdditional legislation, changes in rules, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules,\nconflicts and inconsistencies among rules and regulations, or the entering into businesses that subject us to new\nrules and regulations may directly affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We continue\nto monitor the impact of new U.S. and international regulation on our businesses.\nLegal liability may harm our business.\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability, and in the normal course of business, we have\nbeen named as a defendant or codefendant in lawsuits involving primarily claims for damages. The risks\nassociated with potential legal liabilities often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and\nmagnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The expansion of our business, including\nincreases in the number and size of investment banking transactions and our expansion into new areas impose\ngreater risks of liability. Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us\nsignificant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our business and our prospects.\nA change in tax laws in key jurisdictions could materially increase our tax expense.\nWe are subject to tax in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Changes to income tax laws and\nregulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, or the\nintroduction of new taxes, could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow\nfrom operating activities and otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIf our tax filing positions were to be challenged by federal, state and local, or foreign tax jurisdictions, we\nmay not be wholly successful in defending our tax filing positions.\nWe record reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based on our assessment of the probability of successfully\nsustaining tax filing positions. Management exercises significant judgment when assessing the probability of\nsuccessfully sustaining tax filing positions, and in determining whether a contingent tax liability should be\nrecorded and, if so, estimating the amount. If our tax filing positions are successfully challenged, payments could\nbe required that are in excess of reserved amounts or we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of our\nnet deferred tax asset, either of which result could be significant to our financial condition or results of\noperations.\nItem 1B.

Results in 2022 reflect strong advisory revenues, offset by lower results in most of our other\nbusinesses.\n• Earnings before income taxes of $1.06 billion for 2022 were down 53.2% over the prior year’s record.\n• Net earnings attributable to Jefferies Financial Group Inc. of $777 million for 2022 were down 53.4%\nover the prior year.\nBusiness Results\n• Our investment banking net revenues were $2.90 billion for 2022, compared with a prior year record of\n$4.66 billion for 2021, including strong advisory revenues of $1.78 billion, compared to a prior year\nrecord of $1.87 billion. Our underwriting revenues for 2022 were $1.03 billion, down 58.7%, consistent\nwith the significant reduction in industry-wide deal activity while our market position continued to\nimprove. For 2022, we ranked as the seventh largest firm globally across our three core investment\nbanking businesses - mergers and acquisitions advisory services, equity underwriting and leveraged\nfinance underwriting.\n• Our equities net revenues of $1.06 billion are 18.5% lower than 2021, as 2021 was an exceptional year\nand 2022 presented a more difficult trading environment with significantly reduced new issue activity,\nincluding substantially reduced Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (‘‘SPACs’’) activity. This was\npartially offset by market share gains and ongoing momentum in our client franchise. This compares to\nrecord results in predominately all of our equities businesses and across each of our regions during 2021.\n• Our fixed income net revenues of $765.6 million were down 20.2% compared to 2021, primarily due to\nreduced client activity across most products, increased inflation and interest rate concerns, mark-to-\nmarket losses on certain mortgage inventory positions and a slowdown in securitized markets resulted in\nfewer trading opportunities.\n• Overall net revenues in our asset management business were $1.26 billion, compared with $1.09 billion\nin 2021, reflecting revenues from sales of certain legacy merchant banking positions partially offset by\nlower investment returns as compared to the prior year.\nNon-interest Expenses\n• Non-interest expenses for 2022 decreased $836.4 million, or 14.5%, to $4.92 billion, compared with\n$5.76 billion for 2021. The decrease is due to lower compensation and benefits expense, consistent with\nthe decline in net revenues. Our pre-tax operating margin decreased to 17.7% in 2022 from 28.1% in\n2021.\n• Compensation and benefits expense for 2022 was $2.59 billion, a decrease of $965.7 million, or 27.2%,\nfrom 2021. Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of Net revenues was 43.3% for 2022,\ncompared with 44.4% for 2021. Refer to Note 13, Compensation Plans, included in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K, for further details.\n• Non-interest expenses were also impacted by increases in Floor brokerage and clearing expenses,\ntechnology and communications expenses and business and development expenses, partially offset by a\ndecline in underwriting expenses.\n28"

Our headcount decreased by 561 as a result of the sale of our\nwholly-owned subsidiary, Idaho Timber, offset by growth in our investment banking headcount, as well\nas additions in technology and other corporate services staff to support our growth and other strategic\npriorities.\n2021 Compared with 2020\nConsolidated Results\n• Net revenues for 2021 were $8.01 billion, compared with prior year net revenues of $5.85 billion for\n2020, an increase of $2.16 billion, or 37.0%, reflecting then record net revenues in investment banking,\nequities and asset management and solid results in fixed income.\n• Earnings before income taxes of $2.25 billion for 2021 were up 111.2% over the prior year’s earnings\nbefore income taxes.\n• Net earnings attributable to Jefferies Financial Group Inc. of $1.67 billion for 2021 were up 116.7% over\nthe prior year net earnings attributable to Jefferies Financial Group Inc. of $769.6 million for 2020.\nBusiness Results\n• Our investment banking net revenues of $4.66 billion for 2021 were an increase of 81.9% from the prior\nyear, reflecting record advisory revenues of $1.87 billion, an increase of 77.8%, or $820.1 million,\ncompared to 2020, while our record underwriting revenues for 2021 were $2.49 billion, up $1.04 billion,\nor 72.1%. The increase in net revenues is reflective of an increase in both the number and aggregate\nvalue of transactions completed by our investment banking franchise.\n• Our equities net revenues increased 15.2% compared to the prior year, reflecting record results that were\ndriven by strong client activity and trading performance as a result of meaningful growth across all of\nour products and regions.\n• Our fixed income net revenues were down 28.5% compared to the prior year, which was an all-time\nrecord. Net revenues for 2021 are reflective of strong trading results under more normalized trading\nconditions and reflect continued strength in certain of our credit-focused businesses and strong client\ndemand though this is in comparison to outsize trading volumes and extremely active markets and high\nlevels of volatility driving results in the prior year.\n• Our asset management net revenues of $1.09 billion for 2021, were higher than the $814.6 million\nrecorded in the prior year, driven by a substantial increase in asset management fees and revenues.\nExpenses\n• Non-interest expenses for 2021 increased $976.3 million, or 20.9%, to $5.76 billion, compared with\n$4.78 billion for 2020. This 20.4% increase, is largely due to higher compensation and benefits expense,\nas well as higher transaction-related costs.\n• Compensation and benefits expense for 2021 was $3.55 billion, an increase of $610.7 million, or 20.7%,\nfrom 2020. The increase is primarily a result of the significant increase in our net revenues.\n• Non-compensation expenses for 2021 increased $365.6 million, or 19.9%, to $2.20 billion, compared\nwith $1.84 billion for 2020. The increase in non-compensation expenses was largely due to higher Floor\nbrokerage and clearing fees related to increased trading volumes and a significant increase in volume of\ninvestment banking transactions driving higher Underwriting costs. Technology and communication\nexpenses, Professional services expenses and Business development expenses were also higher for 2021\nreflecting our growth and costs associated with our increased recruiting efforts.\n29"

Our headcount increased across all regions primarily as a\nresult in the growth of our investment banking business, as well as due to additions in technology and\nother corporate services staff to support our increased regulatory requirements and overall growth.\nRevenues by Source\nHistorically, our results of operations have been presented by summarized income statement line items by\nbusiness segments comprised as follows: Investment Banking and Capital Markets, Asset Management,\nMerchant Banking, Corporate and Parent Company Interest, including consolidation adjustments. During the\nyear ended November 30, 2022 and in connection with the merger of Jefferies Group LLC with and into\nJefferies Financial Group Inc., we transferred significantly all of our legacy merchant banking investments to our\nAsset Management reportable segment. Certain publicly traded equity investments that are related to investment\nbanking relationships were transferred from our Merchant Banking reportable segment to our Investment\nBanking and Capital Markets reportable segment. In addition, there were certain investments that were held\nwithin the Investment Banking and Capital Markets reportable segment, which have been transferred to the Asset\nManagement reportable segment. These investments are now managed by the respective segment managers and\nwe have revised our reportable business segment presentation accordingly. Prior period amounts have been\nrevised to conform to the current segment reporting.\nWe now present our results as two reportable business segments as follows: Investment Banking and Capital\nMarkets and Asset Management. Additionally, corporate activities are now fully allocated to each of these\nreportable business segments. We believe that this reorganization of our segments better aligns the manner in\nwhich we manage our business activities and is in keeping with our fundamental long-term strategy of\ncontinuing to build out our investment banking effort, enhancing our capital markets businesses and further\ndeveloping our Leucadia Asset Management alternative asset management platform as we continue to divest of\nsignificant portions of our legacy merchant banking portfolio.\nThe remainder of our ‘‘Consolidated Results of Operations’’ is presented on a detailed product and expense\nbasis. Our ‘‘Revenues by Source’’ is reported along the following business lines: investment banking, equities,\nfixed income and asset management. Additionally, the results of the asset management business include a new\nsubcategory ‘‘merchant banking.’’\nThe following is a description of the changes that have been made:\n• Revenues from certain publicly traded equity securities that were historically presented within our\nMerchant Banking segment and are related to investment banking relationships are now presented within\nOther investment banking revenues. Other investment banking also includes revenues from our share of\nnet earnings from our Jefferies Finance joint venture, our share of net earnings from our Berkadia\ncommercial real estate joint venture, revenues from our lending and servicing of automobile loans as\nwell as any revenues from securities and loans received or acquired in connection with our investment\nbanking activities that have also been previously presented within Other investment banking in prior\nfinancial statement filings.\n• Within Asset Management, investment return represents revenue related to our capital invested in asset\nmanagement funds that are managed by us or our affiliated asset managers. Historically, revenues from\nprincipal investments in private equity and hedge funds managed by third-parties that are not part of our\nLeucadia Asset Management platform and revenues from other investment positions were also reported\nwithin investment return and have now been disaggregated and are presented as part of the new\nmerchant banking subcategory.\n30"

This was offset by our share of the net loss of our\nJefferies Finance joint venture in 2022, reflecting reduced market activity and higher reserves recorded\non its loan portfolio and outstanding commitments due to company-specific developments and difficult\nconditions in the leveraged finance market compared with our share of JFIN’s net earnings in 2021.\nRevenues from Foursight were relatively consistent in 2022 as compared to 2021 as declines in revenue\nfrom originations and sales were offset by increases in servicing fee revenues. Other investment banking\nrevenues for 2022 were also impacted by net unrealized losses on various investments, including\npublicly traded equity securities related to investment banking relationships, as compared to net\nunrealized gains in 2021.\n• Our three-month forward investment banking backlog as of November 30, 2022 is consistent with the\nlevels as of August 31, 2022, but execution remains dependent on market conditions. As an indicator of\nnet revenues in a given future period, backlog snapshots are subject to limitations. The time frame for\nthe realization of revenues from these expected transactions varies and is influenced by factors we do not\ncontrol. Transactions not included in the estimate may occur, and expected transactions may also be\nmodified or cancelled.\n2021 Compared with 2020\n• Total Investment banking revenues for 2021 were a record of $4.66 billion, compared with $2.56 billion\nfor 2020, reflecting record advisory and underwriting revenues.\n• Our 2021 advisory revenues were a record $1.87 billion, up $820.1 million, or 77.8%, from 2020,\nprimarily due to a significant increase in the number and values of transactions, and including a\nsignificant contribution from Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (‘‘SPACs’’) advisory transactions\nin 2021.\n• Our underwriting revenues for 2021 were a record $2.49 billion, an increase of $1.04 billion, or 72.1%,\nfrom 2020, with record net revenues in equity underwriting of $1.56 billion and record net revenues of\n$935.1 million in debt underwriting, as clients took advantage of the strong equity environment and the\nlow interest rate environment. Our equity underwriting results also include increased revenues from\nSPAC offerings, as well as strong revenues from at-the-money offerings.\n• Other investment banking revenues were $291.4 million for 2021, compared with $58.3 million for\n2020. Other investment banking revenues include our share of the net earnings (loss) of the Jefferies\nFinance joint venture. In 2021, Jefferies Finance achieved record underwriting volumes on the back of\nthe strength of the leveraged loan market and an active private-equity backed mergers and acquisitions\nenvironment. The results in 2021 were partially offset by a $56.0 million one-time charge incurred by\nJefferies Finance related to refinancing outstanding debt. Results of Jefferies Finance in 2020 were\nimpacted by unrealized losses related to the write-down of commitments and loans held-for-sale,\nprimarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the markets and the economy. Additionally,\nresults for 2021 include higher net revenues of from our share of earnings from Berkadia. The higher net\nrevenues for 2021 are due to significant increases in debt and investment sales volumes. The net\nrevenues for 2020 were impacted by the impairment of mortgage servicing rights as a result of lower\ninterest rates, higher loan loss provisions and a decline in loan originations due to the impact of\nCOVID-19.

The results for 2022 were impacted by a more difficult trading\nenvironment than 2021 with significantly reduced new issue activity, including reduced SPAC activity.\nThis was partially offset by market share gains and ongoing momentum in our client franchise with\nstrong client activity on market volatility. This compares to record results in predominately all of our\nequities businesses and across each of our regions during 2021.\n• Results in our global cash equities business were lower across regions driven by lower trading revenues\nversus record results globally and across each region on strong market volumes in 2021. The prior year\nalso benefited from trading opportunities related to SPACs. Our global convertibles business also had\nlower revenues, primarily driven by weaker primary equity markets and widening credit spreads\ncompared to a strong new issue market in 2021. In addition, our equity derivatives business results\ndeclined as a difficult and challenging trading environment put pressure on trading activity during 2022.\n• The lower results were offset by record 2022 results in our electronic trading and prime services\nbusinesses, reflecting increased client trading volumes driving strong commission revenues and by\ncontinued growth and momentum in our outsourced trading business.\n2021 Compared with 2020\n• Total equities net revenues were a record $1.30 billion for 2021, an increase of 15.3% over the previous\nyear record of $1.13 billion in 2020. Overall, our record results were driven by strong client activity and\ntrading performance across all regions.\n• Our global cash equities business had record results driven by significant client activity and strong\ntrading revenue, including trading gains from SPAC-related activity, and our electronic trading platform\ncontinued to expand and achieve record results. Our derivatives business achieved record results, driven\nby strong client activity and trading revenues. Our prime services franchise had record results driven by\nhigher balances and increased client activity, as well as higher financing revenues in our securities\nfinance business.

While 2021 revenues decreased from 2020, our fixed income franchise produced solid overall\ntrading results across most of our businesses, reflecting continued strength in certain of our credit-\nfocused businesses and strong client demand in structuring and financing credit products and for trading\nsecuritized products. The results in 2020 significantly benefited from strong trading volumes due to\nextremely active markets and high levels of volatility.\n• Net revenues for 2021 were higher in our securitized markets groups and distressed trading business, as\ncompared with the prior year. In addition, 2021 results benefited from trading gains in our municipal\nsecurities business compared to 2020 when markets experienced a significant sell-off due to the impact\nof COVID-19. Our revenues also benefited from ongoing investments across our European credit\nfranchise.\n• Our 2021 results also include lower revenues in our U.S. and international rates businesses due to a\ndecline in trading opportunities, as a result of lower volatility, as the prior year benefited from significant\nclient activity and wider bid-offer spreads. Lower results across our investment grade corporates and\nemerging markets businesses, as well as our high yield and loan trading businesses, were driven by\nreduced client activity and lower levels of volatility in 2021.\nAsset Management\nWe operate a diversified alternative asset management platform offering institutional clients an innovative range\nof investment strategies directly and through our affiliated asset managers.

As a result, a significant portion of our performance fees and similar revenues generated from\ninvestment returns in a calendar year are recognized in our following fiscal year.\nThe following summarizes the results of our Asset Management businesses (dollars in thousands):\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2022\n2021\n% Change from\nPrior Year\nAsset management fees:\nEquities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n$\n7,198\n$\n6,927\n$\n6,158\n3.9%\n12.5%\nMulti-asset. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n16,327\n7,909\n8,544\n106.4%\n(7.4)%\nTotal asset management fees. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n23,525\n14,836\n14,702\n58.6%\n0.9%\nRevenue from strategic affiliates (1) . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n65,602\n105,897\n11,838\n(38.1)% 794.6%\nTotal asset management fees and revenues. . . . .\n89,127\n120,733\n26,540\n(26.2)% 354.9%\nInvestment return . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n156,594\n260,316\n256,090\n(39.8)%\n1.7%\nMerchant banking . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n1,053,031\n756,482\n580,411\n39.2%\n30.3%\nAllocated net interest . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n(41,059)\n(44,907)\n(48,484)\n(8.6)%\n(7.4)%\nTotal Asset Management . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n$1,257,693\n$1,092,624\n$814,557\n15.1%\n34.1%\n(1) These amounts include our share of fees received by affiliated asset management companies with which we\nhave revenue and/or profit share arrangements.\n2022 Compared with 2021\n• Asset management net revenues for 2022 were $1.26 billion, higher than the $1.09 billion for 2021,\nreflecting increased revenues on certain legacy merchant banking positions as well as sales of certain\npositions, partially offset by lower investment returns as compared to the prior year.

The decrease is primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expense,\nconsistent with the decline in net revenues as well as reduced underwriting costs consistent with the\noverall industry-wide decline in underwriting activity.\nCompensation and Benefits\n• Compensation\nand\nbenefits\nexpense\nconsists\nof\nsalaries,\nbenefits,\ncommissions,\nannual\ncash\ncompensation and share-based awards and the amortization of share-based and cash compensation\nawards to employees.\n• Cash and share-based awards and a portion of cash awards granted to employees as part of year end\ncompensation generally contain provisions such that employees who terminate their employment or are\nterminated without cause may continue to vest in their awards, so long as those awards are not forfeited\nas a result of other forfeiture provisions (primarily non-compete clauses) of those awards. Accordingly,\nthe compensation expense for a portion of awards granted at year end as part of annual compensation is\nrecorded during the year of the award. Compensation and benefits expense includes amortization\nexpense associated with these awards to the extent vesting is contingent on future service. In addition,\ncertain awards to our Chief Executive Officer and our President and contain market and performance\nconditions and the awards are amortized over their service periods.\n• Compensation and benefits expense was $2.59 billion for 2022 compared with $3.55 billion for 2021. A\nsignificant portion of our compensation expense is highly variable with net revenues. Compensation and\nbenefits expense as a percentage of Net revenues was 43.3% for 2022 and 44.4% for 2021.\n• Compensation expense related to the amortization of share- and cash-based awards amounted to $240.5\nmillion for 2022 compared with $405.0 million for 2021.

The increase also included higher Technology and communication expenses primarily\nrelated to the development of various trading and management systems and increased market data costs.\nProfessional services expenses were also higher primarily due to legal and agency fees to support\ngrowing activity across our businesses.\n• Results for 2021 also included higher Other expenses primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense\nmostly related to a specific default in our prime brokerage business and $64.0 million in costs related to\nthe early redemption of senior notes, partially offset by a reduction in the loss provision for investment\nbanking receivables.\nIncome Taxes\n• For 2022, the provision for income taxes was $273.9 million, equating to an effective tax rate of 25.9%,\ncompared with a provision for income taxes of $576.7 million, equating to an effective tax rate of 25.6%\nfor 2021.\n• Refer to Note 21, Income Taxes, in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K, for further details on income taxes.\n40"

      "text": "Accounting Developments\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting developments and their impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements, see Note 3, Accounting Developments, in our consolidated financial statements included in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (‘‘U.S. GAAP’’), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Actual results can and may differ\nfrom estimates. These differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe our application of U.S. GAAP and the associated estimates are reasonable. Our accounting estimates\nare reevaluated, and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change. Historically, we have\nfound our application of accounting policies to be appropriate, and actual results have not differed materially\nfrom those determined using necessary estimates.\nFor further discussions of the following significant accounting policies and other significant accounting policies,\nsee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our consolidated financial statements included in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nFinancial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased are recorded at fair value. The\nfair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price).\nUnrealized gains or losses are generally recognized in Principal transactions revenues in our Consolidated\nStatements of Earnings.\nFor information on the composition of our Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet\npurchased recorded at fair value, see Note 4, Fair Value Disclosures, in our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFair Value Hierarchy – In determining fair value, we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the\nuse of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are\ninputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from\nindependent sources. Unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions that market participants would use in pricing\nthe asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. We apply a\nhierarchy to categorize our fair value measurements broken down into three levels based on the transparency of\ninputs, where Level 1 uses observable prices in active markets and Level 3 uses valuation techniques that\nincorporate significant unobservable inputs. Greater use of management judgment is required in determining fair\nvalue when inputs are less observable or unobservable in the marketplace, such as when the volume or level of\ntrading activity for a financial instrument has decreased and when certain factors suggest that observed\ntransactions may not be reflective of orderly market transactions. Judgment must be applied in determining the\nappropriateness of available prices, particularly in assessing whether available data reflects current prices and/or\nreflects the results of recent market transactions. Prices or quotes are weighed when estimating fair value with\ngreater reliability placed on information from transactions that are considered to be representative of orderly\nmarket transactions.\nFair value is a market-based measure; therefore, when market observable inputs are not available, our judgment\nis applied to reflect those judgments that a market participant would use in valuing the same asset or liability.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary for different products. We use prices and inputs that are current as\nof the measurement date even in periods of market disruption or illiquidity. The valuation of financial\ninstruments categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy involves the greatest extent of management\n41"

(See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 4, Fair Value Disclosures, in our\nconsolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the\ndefinitions of fair value, Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 and related valuation techniques.)\nLevel 3 Assets and Liabilities – For information on the composition and activity of our Level 3 assets and\nLevel 3 liabilities, see Note 4, Fair Value Disclosures, in our consolidated financial statements included in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nControls Over the Valuation Process for Financial Instruments – Our Independent Price Verification Group,\nindependent of the trading function, plays an important role in determining that our financial instruments are\nappropriately valued and that fair value measurements are reliable. This is particularly important where prices or\nvaluations that require inputs are less observable. In the event that observable inputs are not available, the control\nprocesses are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and\nthat the assumptions are reasonable. Where a pricing model is used to determine fair value, these control\nprocesses include reviews of the pricing model’s theoretical soundness and appropriateness by risk management\npersonnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks. In addition, recently executed\ncomparable transactions and other observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions\nunderlying the model.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in estimating our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and\nliabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. In determining the provision\nfor income taxes, we must make judgments and interpretations about how to apply inherently complex tax laws\nto numerous transactions and business events. In addition, we must make estimates about the amount, timing and\ngeographic mix of future taxable income, which includes various tax planning strategies to utilize tax attributes\nof deferred tax assets before they expire.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to\nbe realized. We are required to consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, and to weigh the\nevidence when determining whether a valuation allowance is required and the amount of such valuation\nallowance. Generally, greater weight is required to be placed on objectively verifiable evidence when making this\nassessment, in particular on recent historical operating results.\nWe also record reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based on our assessment of the probability of successfully\nsustaining tax filing positions. Management exercises significant judgment when assessing the probability of\nsuccessfully sustaining tax filing positions, and in determining whether a contingent tax liability should be\nrecorded and if so, estimating the amount. If our tax filing positions are successfully challenged, payments could\nbe required that are in excess of reserved amounts or we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of our\nnet deferred tax asset, either of which could be significant to our financial condition or results of operations.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, in\nmanagement’s judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. When testing for\nimpairment, we group our long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which\nidentifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group).\nThe determination of whether an asset group is recoverable is based on management’s estimate of undiscounted\nfuture cash flows directly attributable to the asset group as compared to its carrying value. If the carrying amount\nof the asset group is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be recognized for the\namount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.\nDue to a decline in oil and gas prices during the second quarter of 2020, we performed an impairment analyses\non certain of our proven oil and gas properties in the DJ Basin of Wyoming and Colorado, the Williston Basin in\n42"

      "text": "North Dakota and Montana and oil and gas properties in the East Eagle Ford. Estimated undiscounted cash flows\nwere determined based on reserves and costs and updated those based on strip pricing as of May 31, 2020 for\nthe DJ Basin and Williston Basin properties and as of February 29, 2020 for the East Eagle Ford properties. The\nexpected undiscounted future net cash flows were then compared to the end of quarter net carrying value of the\noil and gas properties. No impairment of the Williston Basin assets was necessary as the undiscounted future net\ncash flows significantly exceeded the carrying value of these assets. Undiscounted future net cash flows were\nlower than the carrying value of the DJ Basin properties and the East Eagle Ford properties, and accordingly, the\nfair value of such proven properties was estimated using a 10.0% discount rate and estimated future cash flows\nfrom the properties’ reserve report. The estimated fair value of the proven oil and gas properties in the DJ Basin\ntotaled $26.8 million, which was $13.2 million lower than the carrying value as of the end of the second quarter\nof 2020 and the estimated fair value of the proven oil and gas properties in the East Eagle Ford totaled\n$9.6 million, which was $33.0 million lower than the carrying value as of the end of first quarter of 2020. As a\nresult, impairment charges of $46.2 million were recorded in Other expenses during 2020.\nImpairment of Equity Method Investments\nWe evaluate equity method investments for impairment when operating losses or other factors may indicate a\ndecrease in value which is other than temporary. We consider a variety of factors including economic conditions\nnationally and in their geographic areas of operation, adverse changes in the industry in which they operate,\ndeclines in business prospects, deterioration in earnings, increasing costs of operations and other relevant factors\nspecific to the investee. Whenever we believe conditions or events indicate that one of these investments might\nbe significantly impaired, we obtain from such investee updated cash flow projections. We use this information\nand, together with discussions with the investee’s management and comparable public company analysis,\nevaluate if the book value of its investment exceeds its fair value, and if so and the situation is deemed other\nthan temporary, record an impairment charge.\nWe have an equity method interest in FXCM with rights to a majority of all distributions in respect of FXCM. In\nthe fourth quarter of 2022, we had a triggering event to test our investment in FXCM for impairment. We\nestimated the fair value of our equity interest in FXCM based primarily on a discounted cash flow valuation\nmodel. The discounted cash flow valuation model used inputs including management’s projections of future\nFXCM cash flows and a discount rate of 23.0%. The estimated fair value of our equity investment in FXCM was\n$61.7 million as of the date of our impairment evaluation, which was $25.3 million lower than our prior carrying\nvalue. We concluded that the decline in fair value was other than temporary and as result incurred a\n$25.3 million impairment charge.\nWe have a 49% membership interest in the RedSky JZ Fulton Mall joint venture, which owns a property in\nBrooklyn, New York. During the first quarter of 2020, difficulties were encountered with attempts to refinance\ndebt within the investment. We viewed this, combined with a softening of the Brooklyn, New York real estate\nmarket during the quarter, as a triggering event and evaluated our equity method investment in RedSky JZ\nFulton Mall to determine if there was an impairment. In connection with this evaluation, we obtained an\nappraisal which reflected a reduction in the value of the investment in comparison to an earlier appraisal obtained\nshortly before the beginning of the quarter. The appraisal was based off of Level 3 inputs consisting of prices of\ncomparable properties and the appraisal indicated that the value of the property was worth less than the debt\noutstanding. We recorded an impairment charge of $55.6 million during 2020, which represented all of its\ncarrying value in the joint venture.\nGoodwill\nAt November 30, 2022, Goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition is $1.74 billion\n(3.4% of total assets). The nature and accounting for goodwill is discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies, and Note 11, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for\nimpairment at least annually, or when circumstances or events make it more likely than not that an impairment\noccurred. Goodwill is tested by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value.\n43"

      "text": "Our annual goodwill impairment testing date for a substantial portion of our reporting units is August 1 and\nNovember 30 for other identified reporting units. The results of our annual tests did not indicate any goodwill\nimpairment.\nWe use allocated tangible equity plus allocated goodwill and intangible assets for the carrying amount of each\nreporting unit. The amount of tangible equity allocated to a reporting unit is based on our cash capital model\ndeployed in managing our businesses, which seeks to approximate the capital a business would require if it were\noperating independently. For further information on our Cash Capital Policy, refer to the Liquidity, Financial\nCondition and Capital Resources section herein. Intangible assets are allocated to a reporting unit based on either\nspecifically identifying a particular intangible asset as pertaining to a reporting unit or, if shared among reporting\nunits, based on an assessment of the reporting unit’s benefit from the intangible asset in order to generate results.\nEstimating the fair value of a reporting unit requires management judgment and often involves the use of\nestimates and assumptions that could have a significant effect on whether or not an impairment charge is\nrecorded and the magnitude of such a charge. Estimated fair values for our reporting units utilize market\nvaluation methods that incorporate price-to-earnings and price-to-book multiples of comparable public\ncompanies and/or projected cash flows. Under the market valuation approach, the key assumptions are the\nselected multiples and our internally developed projections of future profitability, growth and return on equity for\neach reporting unit. The weight assigned to the multiples requires judgment in qualitatively and quantitatively\nevaluating the size, profitability and the nature of the business activities of the reporting units as compared to the\ncomparable publicly-traded companies. In addition, as the fair values determined under the market valuation\napproach represent a noncontrolling interest, we apply a control premium to arrive at the estimate fair value of\neach reporting unit on a controlling basis.\nHistorically, we have performed our annual goodwill impairment testing within the Investment Banking and\nCapital Markets, Asset Management and Merchant Banking reportable business segments. On November 1, 2022\nin connection with the merger of Jefferies Group LLC into Jefferies Financial Group Inc., we reassessed our\nreporting units based on the discrete financial information to be made available to segment management as of\nand subsequent to the merger. As a result, we identified each of the Investment Banking, Equities and Wealth\nManagement and Fixed Income businesses to be reporting units within the Investment Banking and Capital\nMarkets reportable business segment. Goodwill previously attributable to our Merchant Banking reportable\nsegment is now included within our Asset Management reportable business segment.\nThe total goodwill of $1.55 billion attributed to the Investment Banking and Capital Markets reportable business\nsegment has been assigned to each of the Investment Banking, Equities and Wealth Management and Fixed\nIncome reporting units as of November 1, 2022, based on the relative fair value of each of the reporting units as\nof November 1, 2022. The relative fair value estimate of each of the reporting units as of November 1, 2022,\nwas based on methodologies consistent with the market valuation approach used in our annual impairment test,\nwhich are consistent with valuation techniques market participants would use. The results of our reassessment of\nthe reporting units indicated that all of the reporting units had a fair value in excess of their carrying amounts\nbased on current projections as of November 1, 2022. The valuation methodology for our reporting units are\nsensitive to management’s forecasts of future profitability, which are a significant component of the valuation\nand come with a level of uncertainty regarding trading volumes and capital market transaction levels.\nThe carrying values of goodwill by reporting unit at November 30, 2022 are as follows: $722.5 million in\nInvestment Banking, $254.8 million in Equities and Wealth Management, $575.6 million in Fixed Income,\n$143.0 million in Asset Management and $40.2 million attributed to various individual legacy merchant banking\ninvestments.\nRefer to Note 11, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in our consolidated financial statements included in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, for further details on goodwill.\n44"

These policies are determined by the nature and needs of our day to day business\noperations, business opportunities, regulatory obligations, and liquidity requirements.\nOur actual levels of capital, total assets and financial leverage are a function of a number of factors, including\nasset composition, business initiatives and opportunities, regulatory requirements and cost and availability of\nboth long term and short term funding. We have historically maintained a balance sheet consisting of a large\nportion of our total assets in cash and liquid marketable securities. The liquid nature of these assets provides us\nwith flexibility in financing and managing our business.\nWe also own a legacy portfolio of businesses and investments that are reflected as consolidated subsidiaries,\nequity investments or securities. We are in the process of liquidating a substantial portion of this portfolio with\nthe intention of selling to third parties or distributing to shareholders this portfolio over the next few years.\nDuring the year ended November 30, 2022, we sold our wholly-owned manufacturing subsidiary, Idaho Timber,\nat a combined sales price of $239.3 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $138.7 million recognized in Other\nrevenue and also sold a multi-family real estate property recognizing revenues of $122.5 million in Other\nrevenue and Cost of sales of $70.2 million.\nIn keeping with our strategy of returning excess liquidity to shareholders, during the year ended November 30,\n2022, we returned an aggregate of $1.14 billion to shareholders in the form of $280.1 million dividends and the\nrepurchase of 25.6 million shares for a total of $859.6 million of $33.58 per share. On January 13, 2023, we\ndistributed our ownership interests in Vitesse Energy on a tax-free pro rata basis to all shareholders, resulting in a\ndistribution of capital of over $500.0 million.\nWe maintain modest leverage to support our investment grade ratings. The growth of our balance sheet is\nsupported by our equity and we have quantitative metrics in place to monitor leverage and double leverage. Our\ncapital plan is robust, in order to sustain our operating model through stressed conditions. We maintain adequate\nfinancial resources to support business activities in both normal and stressed market conditions, including a\nbuffer in excess of our regulatory, or other internal or external, requirements. Our access to funding and liquidity\nis stable and efficient to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity to meet our financial obligations in normal and\nstressed market conditions.\nOur Balance Sheet\nA business unit level balance sheet and cash capital analysis are prepared and reviewed with senior management\non a weekly basis. As a part of this balance sheet review process, capital is allocated to all assets and gross\nbalance sheet limits are adjusted, as necessary. This process ensures that the allocation of capital and costs of\ncapital are incorporated into business decisions. The goals of this process are to protect the firm’s platform,\nenable our businesses to remain competitive, maintain the ability to manage capital proactively and hold\nbusinesses accountable for both balance sheet and capital usage.\nWe actively monitor and evaluate our financial condition and the composition of our assets and liabilities. We\ncontinually monitor our overall securities inventory, including the inventory turnover rate, which confirms the\nliquidity of our overall assets. A significant portion of our financial instruments are valued on a daily basis and\nwe monitor and employ balance sheet limits for our various businesses.\n45"

      "text": "Contingency Funding Plan. Our Contingency Funding Plan is based on a model of a potential liquidity\ncontraction over a one year time period. This incorporates potential cash outflows during a market or our\nidiosyncratic liquidity stress event, including, but not limited to, the following:\n• Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within one year and no incremental unsecured debt issuance;\n• Maturity rolloff of outstanding letters of credit with no further issuance and replacement with cash\ncollateral;\n• Higher margin requirements than currently exist on assets on securities financing activity, including\nrepurchase agreements and other secured funding;\n• Liquidity outflows related to possible credit downgrade;\n• Lower availability of secured funding;\n• Client cash withdrawals;\n• The anticipated funding of outstanding investment and loan commitments; and\n• Certain accrued expenses and other liabilities and fixed costs.\nCash Capital Policy. We maintain a cash capital model that measures long-term funding sources against\nrequirements. Sources of cash capital include our equity, mezzanine equity and the noncurrent portion of long-\nterm borrowings. Uses of cash capital include the following:\n• Illiquid assets such as equipment, goodwill, net intangible assets, exchange memberships, deferred tax\nassets and certain investments;\n• A portion of securities inventory and other assets not expected to be financed on a secured basis in a\ncredit stressed environment (i.e., margin requirements); and\n• Drawdowns of unfunded commitments.\nTo ensure that we do not need to liquidate inventory in the event of a funding stress, we seek to maintain surplus\ncash capital. Our total long-term capital of $17.49 billion at November 30, 2022 exceeded our cash capital\nrequirements.\nMLO. Our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market\nmovements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult\nfunding environment. During a liquidity stress, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt and some\ntypes of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral\nprovisions and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change. As a result of our policy to\nensure we have sufficient funds to cover what we estimate may be needed in a liquidity stress, we hold more\ncash and unencumbered securities and have greater long-term debt balances than our businesses would otherwise\nrequire. As part of this estimation process, we calculate an MLO that could be experienced in a liquidity stress.\nMLO is based on a scenario that includes both a market-wide stress and firm-specific stress, characterized by\nsome or all of the following elements:\n• Global recession, default by a medium-sized sovereign, low consumer and corporate confidence, and\ngeneral financial instability.\n• Severely challenged market environment with material declines in equity markets and widening of credit\nspreads.\n• Damaging follow-on impacts to financial institutions leading to the failure of a large bank.\n• A firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses, reputational damage, litigation, executive\ndeparture, and/or a ratings downgrade.\nThe following are the critical modeling parameters of the MLO:\n• Liquidity needs over a 30-day scenario.\n• A two-notch downgrade of our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings.\n48"

      "text": "• No support from government funding facilities.\n• A combination of contractual outflows, such as upcoming maturities of unsecured debt, and contingent\noutflows (e.g., actions though not contractually required, we may deem necessary in a crisis). We assume\nthat most contingent outflows will occur within the initial days and weeks of a stress.\n• No diversification benefit across liquidity risks. We assume that liquidity risks are additive.\nThe calculation of our MLO under the above stresses and modeling parameters considers the following potential\ncontractual and contingent cash and collateral outflows:\n• All upcoming maturities of unsecured long-term debt, commercial paper, promissory notes and other\nunsecured funding products assuming we will be unable to issue new unsecured debt or rollover any\nmaturing debt.\n• Repurchases of our outstanding long-term debt in the ordinary course of business as a market maker.\n• A portion of upcoming contractual maturities of secured funding activity due to either the inability to\nrefinance or the ability to refinance only at wider haircuts (i.e., on terms which require us to post\nadditional collateral). Our assumptions reflect, among other factors, the quality of the underlying\ncollateral and counterparty concentration.\n• Collateral postings to counterparties due to adverse changes in the value of our over-the-counter\n(‘‘OTC’’) derivatives and other outflows due to trade terminations, collateral substitutions, collateral\ndisputes, collateral calls or termination payments required by a two-notch downgrade in our credit\nratings.\n• Variation margin postings required due to adverse changes in the value of our outstanding exchange-\ntraded derivatives and any increase in initial margin and guarantee fund requirements by derivative\nclearing houses.\n• Liquidity outflows associated with our prime services business, including withdrawals of customer credit\nbalances, and a reduction in customer short positions.\n• Liquidity outflows to clearing banks to ensure timely settlements of cash and securities transactions.\n• Draws on our unfunded commitments considering, among other things, the type of commitment and\ncounterparty.\n• Other upcoming large cash outflows, such as employee compensation, tax and dividend payments, with\nno expectation of future dividends from any subsidiaries.\nBased on the sources and uses of liquidity calculated under the MLO scenarios, we determine, based on a\ncalculated surplus or deficit, additional long-term funding that may be needed versus funding through the\nrepurchase financing market and consider any adjustments that may be necessary to our inventory balances and\ncash holdings. At November 30, 2022, we had sufficient excess liquidity to meet all contingent cash outflows\ndetailed in the MLO. We regularly refine our model to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and our\nbusiness mix.\n49"

At November 30, 2022, we\nhad the ability to readily obtain repurchase financing for 78.2% of our inventory at haircuts of 10% or less,\nwhich reflects the liquidity of our inventory.

There are no restrictions on the unencumbered liquid securities, nor have they\nbeen pledged as collateral.\nSources of Funding and Capital Resources\nOur assets are funded by equity capital, senior debt, securities loaned, securities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase, customer free credit balances, bank loans and other payables.\nSecured Financing\nWe rely principally on readily available secured funding to finance our inventory of financial instruments owned\nand financial instruments sold. Our ability to support increases in total assets is largely a function of our ability\nto obtain short and intermediate-term secured funding, primarily through securities financing transactions. We\nfinance a portion of our long inventory and cover some of our short inventory by pledging and borrowing\nsecurities in the form of repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements (collectively ‘‘repos’’), respectively. At\nNovember 30, 2022, approximately 61.0% of our cash and noncash repurchase financing activities use collateral\nthat is considered eligible collateral by central clearing corporations. During 2022, an average of approximately\n75.9% of our cash and noncash repurchase financing activities used collateral that was considered eligible\ncollateral by central clearing corporations. Central clearing corporations are situated between participating\nmembers who borrow cash and lend securities (or vice versa); accordingly, repo participants contract with the\ncentral clearing corporation and not one another individually. Therefore, counterparty credit risk is borne by the\ncentral clearing corporation which mitigates the risk through initial margin demands and variation margin calls\nfrom repo participants. The comparatively large proportion of our total repo activity that is eligible for central\nclearing reflects the high quality and liquid composition of the inventory we carry in our trading books. For\nthose asset classes not eligible for central clearing house financing, we seek to execute our bi-lateral financings\non an extended term basis and the tenor of our repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements generally exceeds\nthe expected holding period of the assets we are financing.

At November 30,\n2022, short-term borrowings, which must be repaid within one year or less and include bank loans and\noverdrafts, borrowings under revolving credit facilities and floating rate puttable notes totaled $528.4 million.\nInterest under the bank lines is generally at a spread over the federal funds rate. Letters of credit are used in the\nnormal course of business mostly to satisfy various collateral requirements in favor of exchanges in lieu of\ndepositing cash or securities. Average daily short-term borrowings outstanding were $432.0 million for 2022.\nAt November 30, 2022 and 2021, our borrowings under credit facilities classified within bank loans in Short-\nterm borrowings in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition were $517.0 million and $200.0 million,\nrespectively. Our borrowings include credit facilities that contain certain covenants that, among other things,\nrequire us to maintain a specified level of tangible net worth, require a minimum regulatory net capital\nrequirement for our U.S. broker-dealer, Jefferies LLC, and impose certain restrictions on the future indebtedness\nof certain of our subsidiaries that are borrowers.

The notes issued under the program are presented within Other secured\nfinancings in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

This decrease is primarily due to fair value changes in our\nstructured notes and gains on certain of our senior notes associated with interest rate swaps based on their\ndesignation as fair value hedges, partially offset by structured notes issuances, net of retirements, of\napproximately $209.4 million and net issuances of approximately $176.7 million related to our secured credit\nfacilities.\nAt November 30, 2022, all of our structured notes contain various interest rate payment terms and are accounted\nfor at fair value, with changes in fair value resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk\npresented in other comprehensive income and changes in fair value resulting from non-credit components\nrecognized in Principal transactions revenues. The fair value of all of our structured notes at November 30, 2022\nwas $1.58 billion.\nAt November 30, 2022 and 2021, our borrowings under several credit facilities classified within Long-term debt\nin our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition amounted to $933.5 million and $774.1 million,\nrespectively. Interest on these credit facilities are based on adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (‘‘LIBOR’’)\nrates, Secured Overnight Financing Rate (‘‘SOFR’’) plus a spread or other adjusted rates, as defined in the\nvarious credit agreements. The credit facility agreements contain certain covenants that, among other things,\nrequire us to maintain specified levels of tangible net worth and liquidity amounts, and impose certain\nrestrictions on future indebtedness of and require specified levels of regulated capital and cash reserves for\ncertain of our subsidiaries. At November 30, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants under theses credit\nfacilities, except for certain facilities secured by automobile loans with an amount outstanding of $112.9 million\nfor which technical covenant violations have occurred that are in the process of being resolved with the lenders.\nIn addition, one of our subsidiaries has a Loan and Security Agreement with a bank for a term loan (‘‘Secured\nBank Loan’’). At November 30, 2022, borrowings under the Secured Bank Loan amounted to $100.0 million\nand are also classified within Long-term debt in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The\nSecured Bank Loan matures on September 13, 2024 and is collateralized by certain trading securities with an\ninterest rate of 1.25% plus LIBOR. The agreement contains certain covenants that, among other things, restricts\nlien or encumbrance upon any of the pledged collateral. At November 30, 2022, we were in compliance with all\ncovenants under the Secured Bank Loan.\nHomeFed funds certain of its real estate projects in part by raising funds under the Immigrant Investor Program\nadministered by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act\n(‘‘EB-5 Program’’). This debt is secured by certain real estate of HomeFed. At November 30, 2022, HomeFed\nwas in compliance with all debt covenants which include, among other requirements, limitations on incurrence of\ndebt, collateral requirements and restricted use of proceeds. Primarily all of HomeFed’s EB-5 Program debt\nmatures in 2024 through 2026.\nAt November 30, 2022, HomeFed has construction loans with an aggregate committed amount of $101.9\nmillion. The proceeds are being used for construction at certain of its real estate projects. The outstanding\nprincipal amount of the loans bear interest based on the 30 day LIBOR or the SOFR, plus spreads of 1.35% to\n3.00%, subject to adjustment on the first of each calendar month. At November 30, 2022, the weighted average\ninterest rate on these loans was 6.07%. The loans mature between October 2023 and May 2024 and are\ncollateralized by the property underlying the related project with a guarantee by HomeFed. At November 30,\n2022 and November 30, 2021, $57.0 million and $45.6 million, respectively, was outstanding under the\nconstruction loan agreements.\nAt November 30, 2022, our unsecured long-term debt has a weighted average maturity of approximately 9.5\nyears.\nFor further information, see Note 17, Long-Term Debt, in our consolidated financial statements included in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n53"

Our current debt ratings are dependent upon many\nfactors, including industry dynamics, operating and economic environment, operating results, operating margins,\nearnings trend and volatility, balance sheet composition, liquidity and liquidity management, our capital\nstructure, our overall risk management, business diversification and our market share and competitive position in\nthe markets in which we operate. Deterioration in any of these factors could impact our credit ratings. While\ncertain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact on our\nbusiness and trading results in future periods is inherently uncertain and depends on a number of factors,\nincluding the magnitude of the downgrade, the behavior of individual clients and future mitigating action taken\nby us.\nIn connection with certain over-the-counter derivative contract arrangements and certain other trading\narrangements, we may be required to provide additional collateral to counterparties, exchanges and clearing\norganizations in the event of a credit rating downgrade. At November 30, 2022, the amount of additional\ncollateral that could be called by counterparties, exchanges and clearing organizations under the terms of such\nagreements in the event of a downgrade of our long-term credit rating below investment grade was $46.8\nmillion. For certain foreign clearing organizations, credit rating is only one of several factors employed in\ndetermining collateral that could be called. The above represents management’s best estimate for additional\ncollateral to be called in the event of a credit rating downgrade. The impact of additional collateral requirements\nis considered in our Contingency Funding Plan and calculation of MLO, as described above.\nEquity Capital\nAt November 30, 2022 and 2021, we had 600,000,000 authorized shares of common stock with a par value of\n$1.00 per share.

We do not have any operations in Russia or any clients with significant Russian operations\nand we have minimal market risk related to securities of companies either domiciled or operating in Russia. We\ncontinue to monitor the status of trading and the credit risk of our counterparties and we believe that any loss we\nmight incur will be immaterial.\nOn January 1, 2022, the publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR maturities and all non-\nU.S. Dollar LIBOR maturities ceased and the remaining U.S. Dollar LIBOR maturities will cease immediately\nafter June 30, 2023. We are a counterparty to a number of LIBOR-based contracts composed primarily of cleared\nderivative contracts and floating rate notes. We continue to make progress with our transition program to orderly\ntransition from Interbank Offered Rates to alternative reference rates in accordance with industry timelines,\nwhich includes a policy that limits new agreements that reference U.S. Dollar LIBOR or non-U.S. Dollar\nLIBOR, except as permitted under certain circumstances. Our transition plan is designed to enable operational\nreadiness and robust risk management and we are taking steps to update operational processes, models and\ncontracts for any changes that may be required as well as reduce our overall exposure to LIBOR. We are actively\nengaged with our counterparties to ensure that our contracts adhere to the International Swaps and Derivative\nAssociation, Inc. fallback protocol or are actively converted to alternative risk-free reference rates and are both\neducating and assisting our clients with the transition from and cessation of LIBOR.\n56"

See Note 13, Compensation Plans, in our\nconsolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nRisk Management\nOverview\nRisk is an inherent part of our business and activities. The extent to which we properly and effectively identify,\nassess, monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our activities is critical to our financial\nsoundness, viability and profitability. Accordingly, we have a comprehensive risk management approach, with a\nformal governance structure and policies and procedures outlining frameworks and processes to identify, assess,\nmonitor and manage risk. Principal risks involved in our business activities include market, credit, liquidity and\ncapital, operational, legal and compliance, new business and reputational risk.\nRisk management is a multifaceted process that requires communication, judgment and knowledge of financial\nproducts and markets. Our risk management process encompasses the active involvement of executive and senior\nmanagement, and also many departments independent of the revenue-producing business units, including the\nRisk Management, Operations, Information Technology, Compliance, Legal and Finance Departments. Our risk\nmanagement policies, procedures and methodologies are flexible in nature and are subject to ongoing review and\nmodification.\nIn achieving our strategic business objectives, our risk appetite incorporates keeping our clients’ interests as top\npriority and ensuring we are in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, as well as adhering to the\nhighest ethical standards. We undertake prudent risk-taking that protects the capital base and franchise, utilizing\nrisk limits and tolerances that avoid outsized risk-taking. We maintain a diversified business mix and avoid\nsignificant concentrations to any sector, product, geography, or activity and set quantitative concentration limits\nto manage this risk. We consider contagion, second order effects and correlation in our risk assessment process\nand actively seek out value opportunities of all sizes. We manage the risk of opportunities larger than our\napproved risk levels through risk sharing and risk distribution, sell-down and hedging as appropriate. We have a\nlimited appetite for illiquid assets and complex derivative financial instruments. We maintain the asset quality of\nour balance sheet through conducting trading activity in liquid markets and generally ensure high turnover of our\ninventory. We subject less liquid positions and derivative financial instruments to particular scrutiny and use a\nwide variety of specific metrics, limits, and constraints to manage these risks. We protect our reputation and\nfranchise, as well as our standing within the market. We operate a federated approach to risk management and\nassign risk oversight responsibilities to a number of functions with specific areas of focus.\nFor discussion of liquidity and capital risk management, refer to the ‘‘Liquidity, Financial Condition and Capital\nResources’’ section herein.\nGovernance and Risk Management Structure\nOur Board of Directors (‘‘Board’’) and Risk and Liquidity Oversight Committee (‘‘Committee’’). Our Board and\nCommittee play an important role in reviewing our risk management process and risk appetite. The Committee\nassists the Board in its oversight of: (i) the Company’s enterprise risk management, (ii) the Company’s capital,\nliquidity and funding guidelines and policies and (iii) the performance of the Company’s Chief Risk Officer. Our\nGlobal Chief Risk Officer (‘‘CRO’’) and Global Treasurer meet with the Committee on no less than a quarterly\nbasis to present our risk profile and liquidity profile and to respond to questions. Our Chief Information Officer\nalso meets with the Committee at least semi-annually to receive and review reports related to any exposure to\ncybersecurity risk and our plans and programs to mitigate and respond to cybersecurity risks. Additionally, our\nrisk management team continuously monitors our various businesses, the level of risk the businesses are taking\nand the efficacy of potential risk mitigation strategies and presents this information to our senior management\nand the Committee.\n58"

In addition, commodity price risk results\nfrom exposure to the changes in prices and volatilities of individual commodities, commodity baskets and\ncommodity indices, and foreign exchange risk results from changes in foreign currency rates.\nMarket risk is present in our capital markets business through market making, proprietary trading, underwriting\nand investing activities and is present in our asset management business through investments in separately\nmanaged accounts and direct investments in funds. Given our involvement in a broad set of financial products\nand markets, market risk exposures are diversified, and economic hedges are established as appropriate.\nMarket risk is monitored and managed through a set of key risk metrics such as VaR, stress scenarios, risk\nsensitivities and position exposures. Limits are set on the key risk metrics to monitor and control the risk\nexposure ensuring that it is in line with our risk appetite. Our risk appetite, including the market risk limits, is\nperiodically reviewed to reflect business strategy and market environment. Material risk changes, top/emerging\nrisks and limit utilizations/breaches are highlighted, through risk reporting, and escalated as necessary.\nTrading is principally managed through front office trader mandates, where each trader is provided a specific\nmandate in line with our product registry. Mandates set out the activities, currencies, countries and products that\nthe desk is permitted to trade in and set the limits applicable.\nTrader Mandates\nTrading is principally managed through front office trader mandates, where each trader is provided a specific\nmandate in line with our product registry. Mandates set out the activities, currencies, countries and products that\nthe desk is permitted to trade in and set the limits applicable to the desk. Traders are responsible for knowing\ntheir trading limits and trading in a manner consistent with their mandate.\nVaR\nVaR is a statistical estimate of the potential loss from adverse market movements over a specified time horizon\nwithin a specified probability (confidence level). It provides a common risk measure across financial instruments,\nmarkets and asset classes. We estimate VaR using a model that simulates revenue and loss distributions by\napplying historical market changes to the current portfolio. We calculate a one-day VaR using a one year look-\nback period measured at a 95% confidence level.\nAs with all measures of VaR, our estimate has inherent limitations due to the assumption that historical changes\nin market conditions are representative of the future. Furthermore, the VaR model measures the risk of a current\nstatic position over a one-day horizon and might not capture the market risk over a longer time horizon where\nmoves may be more extreme. Previous changes in market risk factors may not generate accurate predictions of\nfuture market movements. While we believe the assumptions and inputs in our risk model are reasonable, we\ncould incur losses greater than the reported VaR. Consequently, this VaR estimate is only one of a number of\ntools we use in our daily risk management activities.\n60"

Stress testing is an important part of our risk\nmanagement approach because it allows us to quantify our exposure to tail risks, highlight potential loss\nconcentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, set risk controls and overall assess and mitigate our risk.\nWe employ a range of stress scenarios, which comprise both historical market price and rate changes and\nhypothetical market environments, and generally involve simultaneous changes of many risk factors. Indicative\nmarket changes in the scenarios include, but are not limited to, a large widening of credit spreads, a substantial\ndecline in equities markets, significant moves in selected emerging markets, large moves in interest rates and\nchanges in the shape of the yield curve.\nUnlike our VaR, which measures potential losses within a given confidence interval, stress scenarios do not have\nan associated implied probability. Rather, stress testing is used to estimate the potential loss from market moves\nthat tend to be larger than those embedded in the VaR calculation. Stress testing complements VaR to cover for\npotential limitations of VaR such as the breakdown in correlations, non-linear risks, tail risk and extreme events\nand capturing market moves beyond the confidence levels assumed in the VaR calculations.\nStress testing is performed and reported at least weekly as part of our risk management process and on an ad hoc\nbasis in response to market events or concerns. Current stress tests provide estimated revenue and loss of the\ncurrent portfolio through a range of both historical and hypothetical events. The stress scenarios are reviewed\nand assessed at least annually so that they remain relevant and up to date with market developments. Additional\nhypothetical scenarios are also conducted on a sub-portfolio basis to assess the impact of any relevant\nidiosyncratic stress events as needed.\nCounterparty Credit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a counterparty’s credit worthiness or its ability or\nwillingness to meet its financial obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of a financial contract.\nWe are exposed to credit risk as a trading counterparty to other broker-dealers and customers, as a counterparty\nto derivative contracts, as a direct lender and through extending loan commitments and providing securities-\nbased lending and as a member of exchanges and clearing organizations. Credit exposure exists across a wide-\nrange of products, including cash and cash equivalents, loans, securities finance transactions and over-the-\ncounter derivative contracts. The main sources of credit risk are:\n64"

Current exposure\nrepresents loans that have been drawn by the borrower and lending commitments that are outstanding. In\naddition, credit exposures on forward settling traded loans are included within our loans and lending\nexposures for consistency with the balance sheet categorization of these items. Loans and lending also\narise in connection with our portion of a Secured Revolving Credit Facility that is with us and\nMassachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, to be funded equally, to support loan underwritings by\nJefferies Finance. For further information on this facility, refer to Note 9, Investments, in our\nconsolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we have\nloans outstanding to certain of our officers and employees (none of whom are executive officers or\ndirectors). For further information on these employee loans, refer to Note 25, Related Party Transactions,\nin our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n• Securities and margin financing transactions, which reflect our credit exposure arising from reverse\nrepurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements to the extent the fair\nvalue of the underlying collateral differs from the contractual agreement amount and from margin\nprovided to customers.\n• OTC derivatives, which are reported net by counterparty when a legal right of setoff exists under an\nenforceable master netting agreement. OTC derivative exposure is based on a contract at fair value, net\nof cash collateral received or posted under credit support agreements. In addition, credit exposures on\nforward settling trades are included within our derivative credit exposures.\n• Cash and cash equivalents, which includes both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits at\nbanks.\nCredit is extended to counterparties in a controlled manner and in order to generate acceptable returns, whether\nsuch credit is granted directly or is incidental to a transaction. All extensions of credit are monitored and\nmanaged as a whole to limit exposure to loss related to credit risk. Credit risk is managed according to the Credit\nRisk Management Policy, which sets out the process for identifying counterparty credit risk, establishing\ncounterparty limits, and managing and monitoring credit limits. The policy includes our approach for:\n• Client on-boarding and approving counterparty credit limits;\n• Negotiating, approving and monitoring credit terms in legal and master documentation;\n• Determining the analytical standards and risk parameters for ongoing management and monitoring credit\nrisk books;\n• Actively managing daily exposure, exceptions and breaches; and\n• Monitoring daily margin call activity and counterparty performance.\nCounterparty credit exposure limits are granted within our credit ratings framework, as detailed in the Credit\nRisk Management Policy. The Credit Risk Department assesses counterparty credit risk and sets credit limits at\nthe counterparty master agreement level. Limits must be approved by appropriate credit officers and initiated in\nour credit and trading systems before trading commences. All credit exposures are reviewed against approved\nlimits on a daily basis.\nOur Secured Revolving Credit Facility, which supports loan underwritings by Jefferies Finance, is governed\nunder separate policies other than the Credit Risk Management Policy and is approved by our Board. The loans\noutstanding to certain of our officers and employees are extended pursuant to a review by our most senior\nmanagement.\nCurrent counterparty credit exposures at November 30, 2022 and 2021 are summarized in the tables below and\nprovided by credit quality, region and industry (in millions). Credit exposures presented take netting and\ncollateral into consideration by counterparty and master agreement. Collateral taken into consideration includes\nboth collateral received as cash as well as collateral received in the form of securities or other arrangements.\nCurrent exposure is the loss that would be incurred on a particular set of positions in the event of default by the\ncounterparty, assuming no recovery. Current exposure equals the fair value of the positions less collateral. Issuer\n65"

We follow local\nand federal guidelines to ensure the safety of our people and clients and operate effectively with a hybrid\nworking environment across all functions with no disruptions to our business or control processes. As the\nincidence of COVID-19 decreases, our employees have returned to our offices in numbers matching pre-COVID-\n19 attendance levels.\nModel Risk\nModel risk refers to the risk of losses resulting from decisions that are based on the output of models, due to\nerrors or weaknesses in the design and development, implementation, or improper use of models. We use\nquantitative models primarily to value certain financial assets and liabilities and to monitor and manage our risk.\nModel risk is a function of the model materiality, frequency of use, complexity and uncertainty around inputs\nand assumptions used in a given model. Robust model risk management is a core part of our risk management\napproach and is overseen through our risk governance structure and risk management controls.\nLegal and Compliance Risk\nLegal and compliance risk includes the risk of noncompliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. We have\nvarious procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements, sales and trading practices, use of\nand safekeeping of customer funds, credit granting, collection activities, anti-money laundering and record\nkeeping. These risks also reflect the potential impact that changes in local and international laws and tax statutes\nhave on the economics and viability of current or future transactions. In an effort to mitigate these risks, we\ncontinuously review new and pending regulations and legislation and participate in various industry interest\ngroups. We also maintain an anonymous hotline for employees or others to report suspected inappropriate\nactions by us or by our employees or agents.\nNew Business Risk\nNew business risk refers to the risks of entering into a new line of business or offering a new product. By\nentering a new line of business or offering a new product, we may face risks that we are unaccustomed to\ndealing with and may increase the magnitude of the risks we currently face. The New Business Committee\nreviews proposals for new businesses and new products to determine if we are prepared to handle the additional\nor increased risks associated with entering into such activities.\nReputational Risk\nWe recognize that maintaining our reputation among clients, investors, regulators and the general public is an\nimportant aspect of minimizing legal and operational risks. Maintaining our reputation depends on a large\nnumber of factors, including the selection of our clients and the conduct of our business activities. We seek to\nmaintain our reputation by screening potential clients and by conducting our business activities in accordance\nwith high ethical standards. Our reputation and business activity can be affected by statements and actions of\nthird-parties, even false or misleading statements by them. We actively monitor public comment concerning us\nand are vigilant in seeking to assure accurate information and perception prevails.\nItem 7A.

      "text": "Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the\ncompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement evaluated our internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2022. In making this\nassessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). As a result of this assessment and\nbased on the criteria in this framework, management has concluded that, as of November 30, 2022, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited and issued a report on\nour internal control over financial reporting, which appears on page 74.\n71"

      "text": "REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Jefferies Financial Group Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Jefferies Financial Group\nInc. and subsidiaries (the ‘‘Company’’) as of November 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements\nof change to earnings, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity, for each of the three years in\nthe period ended November 30, 2022, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2)\n(collectively referred to as the ‘‘financial statements’’). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in\nall material respects, the financial position of the Company as of November 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results\nof its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November 30, 2022, in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2022,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated January 27, 2023, expressed an\nunqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting\nfor secondary loan trading activity from the trade date basis method to the settlement date basis method for the\nyears ended November 30, 2022 and 2021.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nEmphasis of Matter\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Jefferies Group LLC was wholly merged into Jefferies\nFinancial Group Inc. The Company made certain reclassifications within the Consolidated Statements of\nFinancial Condition and Consolidated Statement of Earnings in connection with the merger.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to\n72"

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter\nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it\nrelates.\nValuation of financial assets and liabilities that incorporate significant unobservable inputs or complex\nmodels/methodologies – Refer to Note 2 and Note 4 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company estimates fair value for certain financial assets and liabilities utilizing models and unobservable\ninputs. Unlike the fair value of other assets and liabilities which are readily observable and therefore more easily\nindependently corroborated, these financial assets and liabilities are not actively traded or quoted prices are\navailable but traded less frequently, and fair value is determined based on significant judgments such as models,\ninputs and valuation methodologies.\nWe identified the valuation of financial assets and liabilities that incorporate significant unobservable inputs or\ncomplex models/methodologies as a critical audit matter because of the pricing inputs, complexity of models\nand/or methodologies used by management and third-party specialists to estimate fair value. The valuations\ninvolve a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our\nfair value specialists who possess significant quantitative and modeling experience, to audit and evaluate the\nappropriateness of the models and inputs.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures for financial assets and liabilities that incorporate significant unobservable inputs or\ncomplex models/methodologies included the following procedures, among others:\n• We tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Company’s valuation controls, including the:\n\u0004\nIndependent price verification controls.\n\u0004\nPricing model controls which are designed to review a model’s theoretical soundness and its\nappropriateness.\n• With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of management’s\nvaluation methodology and estimates by:\n\u0004\nDeveloping independent valuation estimates and comparing such estimates to management’s recorded\nvalues.\n\u0004\nComparing management’s assumptions and both observable and unobservable inputs to relevant\naudit evidence, including external sources, where available.\n• We evaluated management’s ability to estimate fair value by comparing management’s valuation\nestimates to subsequent transactions, when available.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nNew York, New York\nJanuary 27, 2023\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2017.\n73"

      "text": "Jefferies Financial Group Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation\nOrganization\nJefferies Financial Group Inc. is a U.S.-headquartered global full service, integrated investment banking and\nsecurities firm. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements represent the accounts of Jefferies\nFinancial Group Inc. and subsidiaries (together ‘‘we’’ or ‘‘us’’). We, collectively with our consolidated\nsubsidiaries and through our affiliates, deliver a broad range of financial services across investment banking,\ncapital markets and asset management.\nWe operate in two reportable business segments: (1) Investment Banking and Capital Markets and (2) Asset\nManagement. The Investment Banking and Capital Markets reportable business segment includes our securities,\ncommodities, futures and foreign exchange capital markets activities and our investment banking business, which\nprovides underwriting and financial advisory services to our clients across most industry sectors. We operate\nglobally in the Americas; Europe and the Middle East; and Asia. Investment Banking and Capital Markets also\nincludes our corporate lending joint venture (‘‘JFIN Parent LLC’’ or ‘‘Jefferies Finance’’), our commercial real\nestate joint venture (‘‘Berkadia Commercial Holding LLC’’ or ‘‘Berkadia’’) and our automobile lending and\nservicing activities. The Asset Management reportable business segment provides alternative investment\nmanagement services to investors in the U.S. and overseas and generates investment income from capital\ninvested in and managed by us or our affiliated asset managers.\nJefferies Group LLC (‘‘Jefferies Group’’), our investment banking and securities firm, was historically operated\nas a separate consolidated subsidiary and was a separate Securities and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’)\nreporting company, filing annual, quarterly and periodic financial reports. On November 1, 2022, Jefferies Group\nwas wholly merged into Jefferies Financial Group Inc., which has eliminated the requirement for separate SEC\nreport filings. In addition, we have historically owned a portfolio of investments that have been reflected in our\nconsolidated financial statements as consolidated subsidiaries, equity investments, securities or in other ways that\nconstituted our ‘‘merchant banking’’ business, which were reported as part of our Merchant Banking reportable\nsegment. During the year ended November 30, 2022 and in connection with the merger, we transferred\nsignificantly all of our Merchant Banking investments into our Asset Management reportable segment. Certain\nother publicly traded equity investments related to investment banking relationships were transferred from our\nMerchant Banking reportable segment to our Investment Banking and Capital Markets reportable segment. These\ninvestments are now managed by the respective segment managers. Additionally, activities that were presented as\npart of the Corporate reportable segment are now fully allocated to either the Investment Banking and Capital\nMarkets or Asset Management reportable segments. Prior year amounts have been revised to conform to the\ncurrent segment reporting. For further information on our reportable business segments, refer to Note 24,\nSegment Reporting.\nDuring the year ended November 30, 2022, we sold all of our interests in Idaho Timber and sold our interests in\nthe Oak Hill investment management company, registered investment adviser and general partner entity and\nrecognized a gain on sale of $138.7 million and $175.1 million, respectively. These gains are presented within\nOther revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and included within our Asset Management\nreportable business segment.\nReclassifications to Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have made certain reclassifications within our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings in connection with the merger of Jefferies Group into Jefferies Financial\nGroup Inc. This streamlines our financial statements and better aligns the presentation of our firm with our\nstrategy of building our investment banking and capital markets and asset management businesses and reducing\nour legacy merchant banking portfolio. The reclassifications including, but not limited to, the presentation of\n82"

      "text": "equity method investments and any related equity method earnings, loans receivable, intangible assets and\ninterest expense within the financial statements, conform to the presentation utilized in the historical Jefferies\nGroup LLC consolidated financial statements prior to the merger. Additionally, the presentation of receivables,\npayables, asset management fees and revenues and selling, general and other expenses has been disaggregated to\nprovide additional financial statement line item categories on the face of the Consolidated Statements of\nFinancial Condition and the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. These reclassifications have no effect on our\nconsolidated net earnings, comprehensive income, total assets, total liabilities or total equity. These\nreclassifications have no effect on the net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. Historical\nperiods have been recast to conform to these reclassifications.\nChanges to Consolidated Financial Statements for Change in Accounting Policy\nAs of November 30, 2022, we have changed the accounting for our secondary trading activity related to the\npurchases and sales of corporate loans. Historically, we have accounted for purchases and sales of corporate\nloans in the secondary market on trade date. Purchases of loans in the secondary market were recognized on\ntrade date within Financial instruments owned for the total amount of the loans and a corresponding liability was\nrecognized within Payables – brokers, dealers and clearing organizations. Sales of loans in the secondary market\nwere recognized on trade date within Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased for the total amount of the\nloans and a corresponding asset was recognized within Receivables – brokers, dealers and clearing organizations\non the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition for the amount of cash to be paid or received upon\nsettlement. We have determined that it is preferable to recognize this trading activity on a settlement date basis.\nA firm commitment to purchase and/or sell loans on the date of trade execution due to the extended settlement\nperiod for this trading activity is recognized and results in recognizing the changes in fair value related to the\nunderlying purchased loans or sold loans. We have elected the fair value option for the firm commitment to\npurchase or sell loans and account for changes in the fair value of the firm commitment within Principal\ntransactions revenues between the trade date and settlement date on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and\nwithin Financial Instruments owned, or Financial Instruments sold on the Consolidated Statement of Financial\nCondition.\nThis change in accounting policy resulted in a reduction of Financial instruments owned of $2.1 billion,\nFinancial instruments sold, not yet purchased of $2.8 billion, Payables – Brokers of $2.4 billion and\nReceivables – Brokers of $3.1 billion on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at November 30,\n2022. There was no impact to net earnings or total equity as a result of this change in accounting policy.\nThe following table sets forth our Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as of November 30, 2021 as\noriginally reported and as revised and presented within these consolidated financial statements as a result of the\nreclassifications and change in accounting policy.\n83\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 1.

      "text": "Consolidation\nOur policy is to consolidate all entities that we control by ownership of a majority of the outstanding voting\nstock. In addition, we consolidate entities that meet the definition of a variable interest entity (‘‘VIE’’) for which\nwe are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the party who has the power to direct the activities of\na VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and who has an obligation to absorb\nlosses of the entity or a right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity.\nFor consolidated entities that are less than wholly-owned, the third-party’s holding of equity interest is presented\nas Noncontrolling interests in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Consolidated Statements\nof Changes in Equity. The portion of net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests is presented as Net\nearnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nIn situations in which we have significant influence, but not control, of an entity that does not qualify as a VIE,\nwe apply either the equity method of accounting or fair value accounting pursuant to the fair value option\nelection under U.S. GAAP, with our portion of net earnings or gains and losses recorded in Other revenues or\nPrincipal transactions revenues, respectively. We also have formed nonconsolidated investment vehicles with\nthird-party investors that are typically organized as partnerships or limited liability companies and are carried at\nfair value. We act as general partner or managing member for these investment vehicles and have generally\nprovided the third-party investors with termination or ‘‘kick-out’’ rights.\nIntercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition Policies\nCommissions and Other Fees. All customer securities transactions are reported in our Consolidated Statements of\nFinancial Condition on a settlement date basis with related income reported on a trade-date basis. We permit\ninstitutional customers to allocate a portion of their gross commissions to pay for research products and other\nservices provided by third-parties. The amounts allocated for those purposes are commonly referred to as soft\ndollar arrangements. These arrangements are accounted for on an accrual basis and, as we are acting as an agent\nin these arrangements, netted against commission revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In\naddition, we earn asset-based fees associated with the management and supervision of assets, account services\nand administration related to customer accounts.\nPrincipal Transactions. Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased are\ncarried at fair value with gains and losses reflected in Principal transactions revenues in our Consolidated\nStatements of Earnings, except for derivatives accounted for as hedges (see ‘‘Hedge Accounting’’ section herein\nand Note 5, Derivative Financial Instruments). Fees received on loans carried at fair value are also recorded in\nPrincipal transactions revenues.\nInvestment Banking. Advisory fees from mergers and acquisitions engagements are recognized at a point in time\nwhen the related transaction is completed. Advisory fees from restructuring engagements are recognized over\ntime using a time elapsed measure of progress. Expenses associated with investment banking advisory\nengagements are deferred only to the extent they are explicitly reimbursable by the client and the related revenue\nis recognized at a point in time. All other investment banking advisory related expenses, including expenses\nincurred related to restructuring advisory engagements, are expensed as incurred. All investment banking\nadvisory expenses are recognized within their respective expense category on the Consolidated Statements of\nEarnings and any expenses reimbursed by clients are recognized as Investment banking revenues.\n86\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 1.

Costs associated with\nunderwriting activities are deferred until the related revenue is recognized or the engagement is otherwise\nconcluded and are recorded on a gross basis within Underwriting costs in the Consolidated Statements of\nEarnings.\nAsset Management Fees and Revenues. Asset management fees and revenues consist of asset management fees,\nas well as revenues from third-parties with strategic relationships pursuant to arrangements, which entitle us to\nportions of our revenues and/or affiliated managers’ profits and perpetual rights to certain defined revenues for a\ngiven revenue share period. Revenue from third-parties with strategic relationships pursuant to arrangements is\nrecognized at the end of the defined revenue or profit share period when the revenues have been realized and all\ncontingencies have been resolved.\nManagement and administrative fees are generally recognized over the period that the related service is provided.\nPerformance fee revenue is generally recognized only at the end of the performance period to the extent that the\nbenchmark return has been met.\nInterest Revenue and Expense. We recognize contractual interest on Financial instruments owned and Financial\ninstruments sold, not yet purchased, on an accrual basis as a component of interest revenue and expense. Interest\nflows on derivative trading transactions and dividends are included as part of the fair valuation of these contracts\nand recognized in Principal transactions revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings rather than as a\ncomponent of interest revenue or expense. We account for our short- and long-term borrowings at amortized\ncost, except for those for which we have elected the fair value option, with related interest recorded on an\naccrual basis as Interest expense. Discounts/premiums arising on our long-term debt are accreted/amortized to\nInterest expense using the effective yield method over the remaining lives of the underlying debt obligations. We\nrecognize interest revenue related to our securities borrowed and securities purchased under agreements to resell\nactivities and interest expense related to our securities loaned and securities sold under agreements to repurchase\nactivities on an accrual basis. In addition, we recognize interest income as earned on brokerage customer margin\nbalances and interest expense as incurred on credit balances.\nOther Revenues. Other revenues include revenue from the sale of manufactured or remanufactured lumber for\nwhich the transaction price is fixed at the time of sale and revenue is generally recognized when the customer\ntakes control of the product. Other revenues also include revenue from the sale of produced oil and gas and\nrevenue from the sale of real estate. Contracts for revenue from the sale of produced oil and gas typically include\nvariable consideration based on monthly pricing tied to local indices and volumes and revenue is recorded at the\npoint in time when control of the produced oil and gas transfers to the customer, which is when the performance\nobligation is satisfied and the variable consideration can be reliably estimated at the end of each month.\nRevenues from the sales of real estate are recognized at a point in time when the related transaction is complete.\nIf performance obligations under the contract with a customer related to a parcel of real estate are not yet\ncomplete when title transfers to the buyer, revenue associated with the incomplete performance obligations is\ndeferred until the performance obligation is completed.\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents include highly liquid investments, including money market funds and certificates of deposit,\nnot held for resale with original maturities of three months or less.\n87\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 2.

Certain other entities are also obligated by\nrules mandated by their primary regulators to segregate or set aside cash or equivalent securities to satisfy\nregulations, promulgated to protect customer assets. In addition, certain exchange and/or clearing organizations\nrequire cash and/or securities to be deposited by us to conduct day-to-day activities.\nFinancial Instruments and Fair Value\nFinancial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased are recorded at fair value, either\nas required by accounting pronouncements or through the fair value option election. These instruments primarily\nrepresent our trading activities and include both cash and derivative products. Gains and losses are recognized in\nPrincipal transactions revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The fair value of a financial\ninstrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price).\nIn determining fair value, we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable\ninputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources.\nUnobservable inputs reflect our assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability\ndeveloped based on the best information available in the circumstances. We apply a hierarchy to categorize our\nfair value measurements broken down into three levels based on the transparency of inputs as follows:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reported\ndate. Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to Level 1 instruments.\nLevel 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly\nobservable at the reported date. The nature of these financial instruments include cash instruments for\nwhich quoted prices are available but traded less frequently, derivative instruments for which fair values\nhave been derived using model inputs that are directly observable in the market, or can be derived\nprincipally from, or corroborated by, observable market data, and financial instruments that are fair\nvalued by reference to other similar financial instruments, the parameters of which can be directly\nobserved.\nLevel 3: Instruments that have little to no pricing observability at the reported date. These financial\ninstruments are measured using management’s best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the\ndetermination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation.\nCertain financial instruments have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. For financial\ninstruments whose inputs are based on bid-ask prices, the financial instrument is valued at the point within the\nbid-ask range that meets our best estimate of fair value. We use prices and inputs that are current at the\nmeasurement date. For financial instruments that do not have readily determinable fair values using quoted\nmarket prices, the determination of fair value is based on the best available information, taking into account the\ntypes of financial instruments, current financial information, restrictions (if any) on dispositions, fair values of\nunderlying financial instruments and quotations for similar instruments.\n88\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 2.

      "text": "The valuation of financial instruments may include the use of valuation models and other techniques.\nAdjustments to valuations derived from valuation models are permitted based on management’s judgment, which\ntakes into consideration the features of the financial instrument such as its complexity, the market in which the\nfinancial instrument is traded and underlying risk uncertainties about market conditions. Adjustments from the\nprice derived from a valuation model reflect management’s judgment that other participants in the market for the\nfinancial instrument being measured at fair value would also consider in valuing that same financial instrument.\nTo the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market,\nthe determination of fair value requires more judgment.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for\nexample, the type of financial instrument and market conditions. As the observability of prices and inputs may\nchange for a financial instrument from period to period, this condition may cause a transfer of an instrument\namong the fair value hierarchy levels. The degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for\ninstruments categorized within Level 3.\nSecurities Borrowed and Securities Loaned\nSecurities borrowed and securities loaned are carried at the amounts of cash collateral advanced and received in\nconnection with the transactions and accounted for as collateralized financing transactions. In connection with\nboth trading and brokerage activities, we borrow securities to cover short sales and to complete transactions in\nwhich customers have failed to deliver securities by the required settlement date, and lend securities to other\nbrokers and dealers for similar purposes. When we borrow securities, we generally provide cash to the lender as\ncollateral, which is reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as Securities borrowed. We\nearn interest revenues on this cash collateral. Similarly, when we lend securities to another party, that party\nprovides cash to us as collateral, which is reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as\nSecurities loaned. We pay interest expense on the cash collateral received from the party borrowing the\nsecurities. The initial collateral advanced or received approximates or is greater than the fair value of the\nsecurities borrowed or loaned. We monitor the fair value of the securities borrowed and loaned on a daily basis\nand request additional collateral or return excess collateral, as appropriate. In instances where the Company\nreceives securities as collateral in connection with securities-for-securities transactions in the which the Company\nis the lender of securities and is permitted to sell or repledge the securities received as collateral, the Company\nreports the fair value of the collateral received and the related obligation to return the collateral in the Company’s\nConsolidated Statement of Financial Condition.\nSecurities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell and Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (collectively\n‘‘repos’’) are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at their contracted resale or\nrepurchase amount plus accrued interest. We earn and incur interest over the term of the repo, which is reflected\nin Interest revenue and Interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings on an accrual basis. Repos\nare presented in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition on a net-basis by counterparty, where\npermitted by U.S. GAAP. We monitor the fair value of the underlying securities daily versus the related\nreceivable or payable balances. Should the fair value of the underlying securities decline or increase, additional\ncollateral is requested or excess collateral is returned, as appropriate.\nOffsetting of Derivative Financial Instruments and Securities Financing Agreements\nTo manage our exposure to credit risk associated with our derivative activities and securities financing\ntransactions, we may enter into International Swaps and Derivative Association, Inc.

      "text": "agreements, master securities lending agreements, master repurchase agreements or similar agreements and\ncollateral arrangements with counterparties. A master agreement creates a single contract under which all\ntransactions between two counterparties are executed allowing for trade aggregation and a single net payment\nobligation. Master agreements provide protection in bankruptcy in certain circumstances and, where legally\nenforceable, enable receivables and payables with the same counterparty to be settled or otherwise eliminated by\napplying amounts due against all or a portion of an amount due from the counterparty or a third-party. Under our\nISDA master netting agreements, we typically also execute credit support annexes, which provide for collateral,\neither in the form of cash or securities, to be posted by or paid to a counterparty based on the fair value of the\nderivative receivable or payable based on the rates and parameters established in the credit support annex.\nIn the event of the counterparty’s default, provisions of the master agreement permit acceleration and termination\nof all outstanding transactions covered by the agreement such that a single amount is owed by, or to, the non-\ndefaulting party. In addition, any collateral posted can be applied to the net obligations, with any excess returned;\nand the collateralized party has a right to liquidate the collateral. Any residual claim after netting is treated along\nwith other unsecured claims in bankruptcy court.\nThe conditions supporting the legal right of offset may vary from one legal jurisdiction to another and the\nenforceability of master netting agreements and bankruptcy laws in certain countries or in certain industries is\nnot free from doubt. The right of offset is dependent both on contract law under the governing arrangement and\nconsistency with the bankruptcy laws of the jurisdiction where the counterparty is located. Industry legal\nopinions with respect to the enforceability of certain standard provisions in respective jurisdictions are relied\nupon as a part of managing credit risk. In cases where we have not determined an agreement to be enforceable,\nthe related amounts are not offset. Master netting agreements are a critical component of our risk management\nprocesses as part of reducing counterparty credit risk and managing liquidity risk.\nWe are also a party to clearing agreements with various central clearing parties. Under these arrangements, the\ncentral clearing counterparty facilitates settlement between counterparties based on the net payable owed or\nreceivable due and, with respect to daily settlement, cash is generally only required to be deposited to the extent\nof the net amount. In the event of default, a net termination amount is determined based on the market values of\nall outstanding positions and the clearing organization or clearing member provides for the liquidation and\nsettlement of the net termination amount among all counterparties to the open contracts or transactions.\nRefer to Note 5, Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 6, Collateralized Transactions, for further\ninformation.\nSecuritization Activities\nWe engage in securitization activities related to corporate loans, consumer loans, commercial mortgage loans and\nmortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities. Transfers of financial assets to secured funding vehicles are\naccounted for as sales when we have relinquished control over the transferred assets. The gain or loss on sale of\nsuch financial assets depends, in part, on the previous carrying amount of the assets involved in the transfer\nallocated between the assets sold and the retained interests, if any, based upon their respective fair values at the\ndate of sale. We may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the\nsecuritization. These retained interests are included in Financial instruments owned within our Consolidated\nStatements of Financial Condition at fair value. Any changes in the fair value of such retained interests are\nrecognized in Principal transactions revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nWhen a transfer of assets does not meet the criteria of a sale, we account for the transfer as a secured borrowing\nand continue to recognize the assets of a secured borrowing in Financial instruments owned and recognize the\nassociated financing in Other secured financings in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\n90\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 2.

Investments in and loans to related parties are accounted for using the equity method or at cost,\nas appropriate, and reviewed for impairment when changes in circumstances may indicate a decrease in value\nwhich is other than temporary. Revenues on Investments in and loans related parties are included in Other\nrevenues in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. See Note 9, Investments, and Note 25, Related Party\nTransactions, for additional information regarding certain of these investments.\nCredit Losses\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost are presented at the net amount expected to be collected and the\nmeasurement of credit losses and any expected increases in expected credit losses are recognized in earnings.\nThe estimate of expected credit losses involves judgment and is based on an assessment over the life of the\nfinancial instrument taking into consideration current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts\nof expected future economic conditions.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets\nacquired. Goodwill is not amortized and is subject to annual impairment testing on August 1 for our Investment\nBanking, Fixed Income, Equities and Asset Management reporting units, on November 30 for other identified\nreporting units or between annual tests if an event or change in circumstance occurs that would more likely than\nnot reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The goodwill impairment test is performed\nat the reporting unit level by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying\nvalue. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not impaired.\nIf the fair value is less than the carrying value, then an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which\nthe carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.\nThe fair value of reporting units are based on widely accepted valuation techniques that we believe market\nparticipants would use, although the valuation process requires significant judgment and often involves the use\nof significant estimates and assumptions. The methodologies we utilize in estimating the fair value of reporting\nunits include market valuation methods that incorporate price-to-earnings and price-to-book multiples of\ncomparable exchange-traded companies and multiples of merger and acquisitions of similar businesses. The\nestimates and assumptions used in determining fair value could have a significant effect on whether or not an\nimpairment charge is recorded and the magnitude of such a charge. Adverse market or economic events could\nresult in impairment charges in future periods.\nIntangible Assets. Intangible assets deemed to have finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their\nestimated useful lives, where the useful life is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly,\nor indirectly, to our future cash flows. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when\ncertain events or circumstances exist. For intangible assets deemed to be impaired, an impairment loss is\nrecognized for the amount by which the intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. At least annually,\nthe remaining useful life is evaluated.\nAn intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more\nfrequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the\nindefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.

Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line\nmethod over the term of the related leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever is shorter.\nPremises and equipment includes internally developed software.

A corresponding right-of-use (‘‘ROU’’) asset is initially recognized equal to the lease\nliability adjusted for any lease prepayments, initial direct costs and lease incentives. The ROU assets are included\nin Premises and equipment and the lease liabilities are included in Lease liabilities in our Consolidated Statement\nof Financial Condition.\nThe discount rates used in determining the present value of leases represent our collateralized borrowing rate\nconsidering each lease’s term and currency of payment. The lease term includes options to extend or terminate\nthe lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Certain leases have renewal options that\ncan be exercised at the discretion of the Company.

When testing for\nimpairment, we group our long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which\nidentifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group).\nThe determination of whether an asset group is recoverable is based on management’s estimate of undiscounted\nfuture cash flows directly attributable to the asset group as compared to its carrying value. If the carrying amount\nof the asset group is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be recognized for the\namount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.\nShare-based Compensation\nShare-based awards are measured based on the fair value of the award and recognized over the required service or\nvesting period. Certain executive share-based awards contain market, performance and service conditions. Market\nconditions are incorporated into the grant-date fair value using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation\nexpense for awards with market conditions is recognized over the service period and is not reversed if the market\ncondition is not met. Awards with performance conditions are amortized over the service period if it is determined\nthat it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. The fair value of options are estimated at the\ndate of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We account for forfeitures as they occur, which results\nin dividends and dividend equivalents originally charged against retained earnings for forfeited shares to be\nreclassified to compensation expense in the period in which the forfeiture occurs.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences\nbetween the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases\nand for tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected\nto apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or\nsettled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the\nperiod that includes the enactment date. The realization of deferred tax assets is assessed and a valuation\nallowance is recorded to the extent that it is more likely than not that any portion of the deferred tax asset will\nnot be realized on the basis of its projected separate return results.\n93\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 2.

      "text": "We record uncertain tax positions using a two-step process: (i) we determine whether it is more likely than not\nthat each tax position will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position; and (ii) for those tax\npositions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit\nthat is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\nWe use the portfolio approach relating to the release of stranded tax effects recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss).\nEarnings per Common Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the\nweighted average number of common shares outstanding and certain other shares committed to be, but not yet\nissued. Net earnings available to common shareholders represent net earnings to common shareholders reduced\nby the allocation of earnings to participating securities. Losses are not allocated to participating securities.\nCommon shares outstanding and certain other shares committed to be, but not yet issued, include restricted stock\nand restricted stock units (‘‘RSUs’’) for which no future service is required. Diluted earnings per share is\ncomputed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders plus dividends on dilutive mandatorily\nredeemable convertible preferred shares by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and\ncertain other shares committed to be, but not yet issued, plus all dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding\nduring the period.\nUnvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents\n(whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and, therefore, are included in the earnings allocation in\ncomputing earnings per share under the two-class method of earnings per share. Restricted stock and RSUs\ngranted as part of share-based compensation contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends and dividend equivalents,\nrespectively, and therefore, prior to the requisite service being rendered for the right to retain the award,\nrestricted stock and RSUs meet the definition of a participating security. RSUs granted under the senior\nexecutive compensation plan are not considered participating securities as the rights to dividend equivalents are\nforfeitable. See Note 13 for more information regarding the senior executive compensation plan.\nLegal Reserves\nIn the normal course of business, we have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in legal and regulatory\nproceedings. We are also involved, from time to time, in other exams, investigations and similar reviews (both\nformal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our businesses, certain of which\nmay result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other injunctions.\nWe recognize a liability for a contingency in Accrued expenses and other liabilities when it is probable that a\nliability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a\nprobable loss is a range, we accrue the most likely amount of such loss, and if such amount is not determinable,\nthen we accrue the minimum in the range as the loss accrual. The determination of the outcome and loss\nestimates requires significant judgment on the part of management. We believe that any other matters for which\nwe have determined a loss to be probable and reasonably estimable are not material to our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn many instances, it is not possible to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the\namount of any loss or the size of any range of loss. We believe that, in the aggregate, the pending legal actions\nor regulatory proceedings and any other exams, investigations or similar reviews (both formal and informal)\nshould not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial\n94\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 2.

In addition, we believe that any amount of potential loss or range of potential loss in excess of what\nhas been provided in our consolidated financial statements that could be reasonably estimated is not material.\nHedge Accounting\nHedge accounting is applied using interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of changes in the\nbenchmark interest rate of fixed rate senior long-term debt. The interest rate swaps are included as derivative\ncontracts in Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased in our Consolidated\nStatements of Financial Position. We use regression analysis to perform ongoing prospective and retrospective\nassessments of the effectiveness of these hedging relationships. A hedging relationship is deemed effective if the\nchange in fair value of the interest rate swap and the change in the fair value of the long-term debt due to\nchanges in the benchmark interest rate offset within a range of 80% – 125%. The impact of valuation\nadjustments related to our own credit spreads and counterparty credit spreads are included in the assessment of\neffectiveness.\nFor qualifying fair value hedges of benchmark interest rates, the change in the fair value of the derivative and the\nchange in fair value of the long-term debt provide offset of one another and, together with any resulting\nineffectiveness, are recorded in Interest expense.\nWe seek to reduce the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on our net investments in certain non-U.S.\noperations through the use of foreign exchange contracts. The foreign exchange contracts are included as\nderivative contracts in Financial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased in our\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Position. For foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges, the\neffectiveness of the hedge is assessed based on the overall changes in the fair value of the forward contracts (i.e.,\nbased on changes in forward rates). For qualifying net investment hedges, all gains or losses on the hedging\ninstruments are included in Currency translation adjustments and other in our Consolidated Statements of\nComprehensive Income.\nRefer to Note 5, Derivative Financial Instruments, for further information.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAssets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries having non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at\nexchange rates at the end of a period. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the\nperiod. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars, net\nof hedging gains or losses and taxes, if any, are included in Other comprehensive income. Gains or losses\nresulting from foreign currency transactions are included in Principal transactions revenues in our Consolidated\nStatements of Earnings.\nNote 3. Accounting Developments\nAdopted Accounting Standards\nReference Rate Reform. In March 2020, the FASB issued new guidance, which was subsequently amended in\nJanuary 2021, which provides optional exceptions for applying GAAP to certain contract modifications, hedge\naccounting relationships or other transactions affected by reference rate reform. In December 2022, the FASB\nissued an accounting standard update to extend the temporary relief until December 31, 2024. Our assessment of\ncontracts with provisions based on LIBOR is ongoing and this guidance may be applied as we transition away\nfrom LIBOR.\n95\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 2.

      "text": "Income Taxes. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying\nthe Accounting for Income Taxes. The objective of the guidance is to simplify the accounting for income taxes\nby removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and to provide more consistent application\nto improve the comparability of financial statements. We adopted the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2021\nand the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidation. In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-17, Consolidation: Targeted Improvements to\nRelated Party Guidance for Variable Interest Entities. The guidance requires indirect interests held through\nrelated parties under common control arrangements be considered on a proportional basis for determining\nwhether fees paid to decision makers and service providers are variable interests. We adopted the guidance in the\nfirst quarter of fiscal 2021 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nInternal-Use Software. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other –\nInternal-Use Software: Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing\nArrangement That Is a Service Contract. The guidance amends the definition of a hosting arrangement and\nrequires that the customer in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract capitalize certain implementation\ncosts as if the arrangement was an internal-use software project. We adopted the guidance in the first quarter of\nfiscal 2021 and elected to apply the guidance prospectively to implementation costs incurred after the adoption\ndate. The adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements on the adoption date.\nDefined Benefit Plans. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, Compensation – Retirement Benefits\n– Defined Benefit Plans – General: Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined\nBenefit Plans. The objective of the guidance is to improve the effectiveness of disclosure requirements on defined\nbenefit pension plans and other postretirement plans. We adopted the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2021\nand the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,\nwhich simplifies goodwill impairment testing. We adopted the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and the\nadoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of\nCredit Losses on Financial Instruments. The guidance provides for estimating credit losses on financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost by introducing an approach based on expected losses over the financial asset’s entire\nlife, recorded at inception or purchase. We adopted the new credit loss guidance on December 1, 2020 and\napplied a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings upon\nadoption. At transition on December 1, 2020, the new accounting guidance’s adoption resulted in an increase in\nthe provision for credit losses of $26.5 million with a corresponding decrease in retained earnings of $19.9\nmillion, net of tax. The increase is primarily attributable to a $30.1 million increase in the allowance for credit\nlosses in our automobile loans receivables portfolio. We estimate expected credit losses on the portfolio using an\nanalysis of historical portfolio performance data as well as external economic factors that we consider to be\nrelevant to the credit losses expected in the portfolio. This was offset by decreases attributable to applying a\nrevised provisioning methodology based on historical loss experience for our investment banking fee receivables.\nThe impact upon adoption for our secured financing receivables (reverse repurchases agreements, securities\nborrowing arrangements, and margin loans) was immaterial because of the contractual collateral maintenance\nprovisions that require that the counterparty continually adjust the amount of collateralization securing the credit\nexposure on these contracts. For the remaining financial instruments within the guidance’s scope, the expected\ncredit losses were also determined to be immaterial considering the counterparty’s credit quality, an insignificant\nhistory of credit losses, or the short-term nature of the credit exposures.\n96\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 3.

      "text": "The following is a description of the valuation basis, including valuation techniques and inputs, used in\nmeasuring our financial assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis:\nCorporate Equity Securities\n• Exchange-Traded Equity Securities: Exchange-traded equity securities are measured based on quoted\nclosing exchange prices, which are generally obtained from external pricing services, and are categorized\nwithin Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, otherwise they are categorized within Level 2 of the fair value\nhierarchy. To the extent these securities are actively traded, valuation adjustments are not applied.\n• Non-Exchange-Traded Equity Securities: Non-exchange-traded equity securities are measured primarily\nusing broker quotations, pricing data from external pricing services and prices observed from recently\nexecuted market transactions and are categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Where such\ninformation is not available, non-exchange-traded equity securities are categorized within Level 3 of the\nfair value hierarchy and measured using valuation techniques involving quoted prices of or market data\nfor comparable companies, similar company ratios and multiples (e.g., price/Earnings before interest,\ntaxes, depreciation and amortization (‘‘EBITDA’’), price/book value), discounted cash flow analyses and\ntransaction prices observed from subsequent financing or capital issuance by the company. When using\npricing data of comparable companies, judgment must be applied to adjust the pricing data to account for\ndifferences between the measured security and the comparable security (e.g., issuer market capitalization,\nyield, dividend rate, geographical concentration).\n• Equity Warrants: Non-exchange-traded equity warrants are measured primarily from observed prices on\nrecently executed market transactions and broker quotations and are categorized within Level 2 of the\nfair value hierarchy. Where such information is not available, non-exchange-traded equity warrants are\ngenerally categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and can be measured using third-party\nvaluation services or the Black-Scholes model with key inputs impacting the valuation including the\nunderlying security price, implied volatility, dividend yield, interest rate curve, strike price and maturity\ndate.\nCorporate Debt Securities\n• Investment Grade Corporate Bonds: Investment grade corporate bonds are measured primarily using\npricing data from external pricing services and broker quotations, where available, prices observed from\nrecently executed market transactions and bond spreads. Investment grade corporate bonds measured\nusing these valuation methods are categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. If broker\nquotes, pricing data or spread data is not available, alternative valuation techniques may be used.\nInvestment grade corporate bonds measured using alternative valuation techniques are categorized within\nLevel 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy\n• High Yield Corporate and Convertible Bonds: A significant portion of our high yield corporate and\nconvertible bonds are categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and are measured primarily\nusing broker quotations and pricing data from external pricing services, where available, and prices\nobserved from recently executed market transactions of institutional size. Where pricing data is less\nobservable, valuations are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and are based on\npending transactions involving the issuer or comparable issuers, prices implied from an issuer’s\nsubsequent financing or recapitalization, models incorporating financial ratios and projected cash flows\nof the issuer and market prices for comparable issuers.\n99\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 4.

Valuation that is based on\nrecently executed market transactions of similar securities incorporates additional review and analysis of pricing\ninputs and comparability criteria, including, but not limited to, collateral type, tranche type, rating, origination\nyear, prepayment rates, default rates and loss severity.\nU.S. Government and Federal Agency Securities\n• U.S. Treasury Securities: U.S. Treasury securities are measured based on quoted market prices obtained\nfrom external pricing services and categorized within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\n• U.S. Agency Debt Securities: Callable and non-callable U.S. agency debt securities are measured\nprimarily based on quoted market prices obtained from external pricing services and are generally\ncategorized within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nMunicipal Securities\nMunicipal securities are measured based on quoted prices obtained from external pricing services, where\navailable, or recently executed independent transactions of comparable size and are generally categorized within\nLevel 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nSovereign Obligations\nSovereign government obligations are measured based on quoted market prices obtained from external pricing\nservices, where available, or recently executed independent transactions of comparable size. Sovereign\ngovernment obligations, with consideration given to the country of issuance, are generally categorized within\nLevel 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nResidential Mortgage-Backed Securities\n• Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (‘‘RMBS’’): Agency RMBS include mortgage pass-\nthrough securities (fixed and adjustable rate), collateralized mortgage obligations and principal-only and\ninterest-only (including inverse interest-only) securities. Agency RMBS are generally measured using\nrecent transactions, pricing data from external pricing services or expected future cash flow techniques\nthat incorporate prepayment models and other prepayment assumptions to amortize the underlying\nmortgage loan collateral and are categorized within Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We\nuse prices observed from recently executed transactions to develop market-clearing spread and yield\nassumptions. Valuation inputs with regard to the underlying collateral incorporate factors such as\nweighted average coupon, loan-to-value, credit scores, geographic location, maximum and average loan\nsize, originator, servicer and weighted average loan age.\n• Non-Agency RMBS: The fair value of non-agency RMBS is determined primarily using pricing data\nfrom external pricing services, where available, and discounted cash flow methodologies and securities\nare categorized within Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy based on the observability and\nsignificance of the pricing inputs used.

Yield\ncurves used in the discounted cash flow models are based on observed market prices for comparable\nsecurities and published interest rate data to estimate market yields. In addition, broker quotes, where\navailable, are also referenced to compare prices primarily on interest-only securities.\nCommercial Mortgage-Backed Securities\n• Agency Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (‘‘CMBS’’): Government National Mortgage Associa-\ntion (‘‘Ginnie Mae’’) project loan bonds are measured based on inputs corroborated from and\nbenchmarked to observed prices of recent securitization transactions of similar securities with\nadjustments incorporating an evaluation of various factors, including prepayment speeds, default rates\nand\ncash\nflow\nstructures.\nFederal\nNational\nMortgage\nAssociation\n(‘‘Fannie\nMae’’)\nDelegated\nUnderwriting and Servicing (‘‘DUS’’) mortgage-backed securities are generally measured by using\nprices observed from recently executed market transactions to estimate market-clearing spread levels for\npurposes of estimating fair value. Ginnie Mae project loan bonds and Fannie Mae DUS mortgage-backed\nsecurities are categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n• Non-Agency CMBS: Non-agency CMBS are measured using pricing data obtained from external pricing\nservices, prices observed from recently executed market transactions or based on expected cash flow\nmodels that incorporate underlying loan collateral characteristics and performance. Non-Agency CMBS\nare categorized within Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy depending on the observability of\nthe underlying inputs.\nOther Asset-Backed Securities\nOther asset-backed securities (‘‘ABS’’) include, but are not limited to, securities backed by auto loans, credit\ncard receivables, student loans and other consumer loans and are categorized within Level 2 or Level 3 of the\nfair value hierarchy. Valuations are primarily determined using pricing data obtained from external pricing\nservices, broker quotes and prices observed from recently executed market transactions. In addition, recent\ntransaction data from comparable deals is deployed to develop market clearing yields and cumulative loss\nassumptions. The cumulative loss assumptions are based on the analysis of the underlying collateral and\ncomparisons to earlier deals from the same issuer to gauge the relative performance of the deal.\nLoans and Other Receivables\n• Corporate Loans: Corporate loans categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy are measured\nbased on market consensus pricing service quotations. Where available, market price quotations from\nexternal pricing services are reviewed to ensure they are supported by transaction data. Corporate loans\ncategorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are measured based on price quotations that are\nconsidered to be less transparent. Price quotations are derived using market prices for debt securities of\nthe same creditor and estimates of future cash flows. Future cash flows use assumptions regarding\ncreditor default and recovery rates, credit rating, effective yield and consideration of the issuer’s capital\nstructure.\n101\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 4.

Securitization prices are adjusted to estimate the fair value of\nthe loans to account for the arbitrage that is realized at the time of securitization. The measurements are\ncategorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy given the observability and volume of recently\nexecuted transactions.\n• Consumer Loans and Funding Facilities: Consumer and small business whole loans and related funding\nfacilities are valued based on observed market transactions and incorporating valuation inputs including,\nbut not limited to, delinquency and default rates, prepayment rates, borrower characteristics, loan risk\ngrades and loan age. These assets are categorized within Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n• Escrow and Claim Receivables: Escrow and claim receivables are categorized within Level 2 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy where fair value is based on recent observations in the same receivable. Escrow and\nclaim receivables are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy where fair value is estimated\nbased on reference to market prices and implied yields of debt securities of the same or similar issuers.\nDerivatives\n• Listed Derivative Contracts: Listed derivative contracts that are actively traded are measured based on\nquoted exchange prices, broker quotes or vanilla option valuation models, such as Black-Scholes, using\nobservable valuation inputs from the principal market or consensus pricing services. Exchange quotes\nand/or valuation inputs are generally obtained from external vendors and pricing services. Broker quotes\nare validated directly through observable and tradeable quotes. Listed derivative contracts that use\nexchange close prices are generally categorized within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. All other listed\nderivative contracts are generally categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n• Over-the-Counter (‘‘OTC’’) Derivative Contracts: OTC derivative contracts are generally valued using\nmodels, whose inputs reflect assumptions that we believe market participants would use in valuing the\nderivative in a current transaction. Where available, valuation inputs are calibrated from observable\nmarket data. For many OTC derivative contracts, the valuation models do not involve material\nsubjectivity as the methodologies do not entail significant judgment and the inputs to valuation models\ndo not involve a high degree of subjectivity as the valuation model inputs are readily observable or can\nbe derived from actively quoted markets. OTC derivative contracts are primarily categorized within\nLevel 2 of the fair value hierarchy given the observability and significance of the inputs to the valuation\nmodels. Where significant inputs to the valuation are unobservable, derivative instruments are\ncategorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nOTC options include OTC equity, foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity options measured using\nvarious valuation models, such as Black-Scholes, with key inputs including the underlying security price,\nforeign exchange spot rate, commodity price, implied volatility, dividend yield, interest rate curve, strike\nprice and maturity date. Discounted cash flow models are utilized to measure certain OTC derivative\ncontracts including the valuations of our interest rate swaps, which incorporate observable inputs related\nto interest rate curves, valuations of our foreign exchange forwards and swaps, which incorporate\nobservable inputs related to foreign currency spot rates and forward curves and valuations of our\n102\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 4.

The range of\nunobservable inputs could differ significantly across different firms given the range of products across different\nfirms in the financial services sector. The inputs are not representative of the inputs that could have been used in\nthe valuation of any one financial instrument (i.e., the input used for valuing one financial instrument within a\nparticular class of financial instruments may not be appropriate for valuing other financial instruments within that\ngiven class). Additionally, the ranges of inputs presented below should not be construed to represent uncertainty\nregarding the fair values of our financial instruments; rather, the range of inputs is reflective of the differences in\nthe underlying characteristics of the financial instruments in each category.\nFor certain categories, we have provided a weighted average of the inputs allocated based on the fair values of\nthe financial instruments comprising the category. We do not believe that the range or weighted average of the\ninputs is indicative of the reasonableness of uncertainty of our Level 3 fair values. The range and weighted\naverage are driven by the individual financial instruments within each category and their relative distribution in\nthe population. The disclosed inputs when compared with the inputs as disclosed in other periods should not be\nexpected to necessarily be indicative of changes in our estimates of unobservable inputs for a particular financial\ninstrument as the population of financial instruments comprising the category will vary from period to period\nbased on purchases and sales of financial instruments during the period as well as transfers into and out of\nLevel 3 each period.\n109\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 4.

A significant increase (decrease) in the price of the private equity securities, non-\nexchange-traded securities, corporate debt securities, CDOs and CLOs, other ABS, loans and other\nreceivables, total return swaps or structured notes would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value\nmeasurement. A significant increase (decrease) in the EBITDA multiple related to corporate debt and\nprivate equity securities would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. A significant\nincrease (decrease) in the revenue multiple related to private equity securities would result in a significantly\nhigher (lower) fair value measurement. A significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate/security yield\nrelated to private equity securities would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.\nDepending on whether we are a receiver or (payer) of basis points upfront, a significant increase in basis\npoints would result in a significant increase (decrease) in the fair value measurement of interest rate swaps.\n• Loans and other receivables, corporate debt securities, CDOs and CLOs, CMBS, private equity securities\nand other secured financings using scenario analysis. A significant increase (decrease) in the possible\nrecovery rates of the cash flow outcomes underlying the financial instrument would result in a\nsignificantly higher (lower) fair value measurement for the financial instrument. A significant increase\n(decrease) in the discount rate/yield underlying the investment would result in a significantly lower\n(higher) fair value measurement. A significant increase (decrease) in the revenue growth underlying the\ninvestment would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.\n• CDOs and CLOs and other ABS using a discounted cash flow valuation technique. A significant\nincrease (decrease) in isolation in the constant default rate, loss severity or cumulative loss rate would\nresult in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. The impact of changes in the constant\nprepayment rate and duration would have differing impacts depending on the capital structure and type\nof security. A significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate/security yield would result in a\nsignificantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. A significant increase (decrease) in term based on\nthe time to pay off the loan would result in a lower (higher) fair value measurement.\n• Derivative equity options and non-exchange-traded securities using volatility benchmarking. A significant\nincrease (decrease) in volatility would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.\nFair Value Option Election\nWe have elected the fair value option for all loans and loan commitments made by our investment banking and\ncapital markets businesses. These loans and loan commitments include loans entered into by our investment\nbanking division in connection with client bridge financing and loan syndications, loans purchased by our\nleveraged credit trading desk as part of its bank loan trading activities and mortgage and consumer loan\ncommitments, purchases and fundings in connection with mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization\nactivities.

      "text": "Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value\nCertain of our financial instruments are not carried at fair value but are recorded at amounts that approximate fair\nvalue due to their liquid or short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These financial assets include\nCash and cash equivalents and Cash and securities segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes or\ndeposited with clearing and depository organizations and would generally be presented within Level 1 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\nAdditionally, at November 30, 2022 and 2021, we had equity securities without readily determinable fair values,\nwhich we account for at cost, minus impairment, of $37.0 million and $119.4 million, respectively, which are\npresented within Other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. There were no impairments\non these investments during the years ended November 30, 2022 and 2021. An impairment was recognized on\nthese investments of $20.4 million during the year ended November 30, 2020. Realized gains of $3.6 million,\n$0.8 million and $2.1 million were recognized on these investments during the years ended November 30, 2022,\n2021 and 2020, respectively. There were no unrealized gains or losses recognized on these investments during\nthe years ended November 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020. These investments would generally be presented within\nLevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nNote 5. Derivative Financial Instruments\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nOur derivative activities are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition in\nFinancial instruments owned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased, net of cash paid or received\nunder credit support agreements and on a net counterparty basis when a legally enforceable right to offset exists\nunder a master netting agreement. We enter into derivative transactions to satisfy the needs of our clients and to\nmanage our own exposure to market and credit risks. In addition, we apply hedge accounting to: (1) interest rate\nswaps that have been designated as fair value hedges of the changes in fair value due to the benchmark interest\nrate for certain fixed rate senior long-term debt, and (2) forward foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges\nto offset the change in the value of certain net investments in foreign operations.\nSee Note 4, Fair Value Disclosures, and Note 22, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees, for additional\ndisclosures about derivative financial instruments.\nDerivatives are subject to various risks similar to other financial instruments, including market, credit and\noperational risk. The risks of derivatives should not be viewed in isolation, but rather should be considered on an\naggregate basis along with our other trading-related activities. We manage the risks associated with derivatives\non an aggregate basis along with the risks associated with proprietary trading as part of our firm wide risk\nmanagement policies.\nIn connection with our derivative activities, we may enter into ISDA master netting agreements or similar\nagreements with counterparties. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional\ninformation regarding the offsetting of derivative contracts.\nThe following tables present the fair value and related number of derivative contracts at November 30, 2022 and\n2021 categorized by type of derivative contract and the platform on which these derivatives are transacted. The\nfair value of assets/liabilities represents our receivable/payable for derivative financial instruments, gross of\ncounterparty netting and cash collateral received and pledged. The following tables also provide information\nregarding 1) the extent to which, under enforceable master netting arrangements, such balances are presented net\nin our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as appropriate under U.S. GAAP and 2) the extent to\n115\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 4.

We enter into secured borrowing and lending arrangements to obtain collateral\nnecessary to effect settlement, finance inventory positions, meet customer needs or re-lend as part of our dealer\noperations. We monitor the fair value of the securities loaned and borrowed on a daily basis as compared with\nthe related payable or receivable, and request additional collateral or return excess collateral, as appropriate. We\npledge financial instruments as collateral under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements and other\nsecured arrangements, including clearing arrangements. Our agreements with counterparties generally contain\ncontractual provisions allowing the counterparty the right to sell or repledge the collateral. Pledged securities\nowned that can be sold or repledged by the counterparty are included in Financial instruments owned, at fair\nvalue and noted parenthetically as Securities pledged in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nIn instances where we receive securities as collateral in connection with securities-for-securities transactions in\nwhich we are the lender of securities and are permitted to sell or repledge the securities received as collateral, we\nreport the fair value of the collateral received and the related obligation to return the collateral in our\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\n121\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 5.

Segregated cash\nand securities consist of deposits in accordance with Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which\nsubjects Jefferies LLC as a broker-dealer carrying customer accounts to requirements related to maintaining cash or\nqualified securities in segregated special reserve bank accounts for the exclusive benefit of its customers.\nNote 7. Securitization Activities\nWe engage in securitization activities related to corporate loans, mortgage loans, consumer loans and mortgage-\nbacked and other asset-backed securities. In our securitization transactions, we transfer these assets to special\npurpose entities (‘‘SPEs’’) and act as the placement or structuring agent for the beneficial interests sold to\ninvestors by the SPE. A significant portion of our securitization transactions are the securitization of assets\nissued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. These SPEs generally meet the criteria of VIEs; however, we\ngenerally do not consolidate the SPEs as we are not considered the primary beneficiary for these SPEs. See Note\n8, Variable Interest Entities, for further discussion on VIEs and our determination of the primary beneficiary.\nWe account for our securitization transactions as sales, provided we have relinquished control over the\ntransferred assets. Transferred assets are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in\nPrincipal transactions revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings prior to the identification and\nisolation for securitization. Subsequently, revenues recognized upon securitization are reflected as net\nunderwriting revenues. We generally receive cash proceeds in connection with the transfer of assets to an\nSPE. We may, however, have continuing involvement with the transferred assets, which is limited to retaining\none or more tranches of the securitization (primarily senior and subordinated debt securities in the form of\nmortgage-backed and other-asset backed securities or CLOs). These securities are included in Financial\ninstruments owned, at fair value in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and are generally initially\ncategorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. For further information on fair value measurements and\nthe fair value hierarchy, refer to Note 4, Fair Value Disclosures, and Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies, herein.\nThe following table presents activity related to our securitizations that were accounted for as sales in which we\nhad continuing involvement (in millions):\n2022\n2021\n2020\nYear Ended November 30,\nTransferred assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n$6,351.2\n$10,487.3\n$6,556.2\nProceeds on new securitizations. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n6,402.6\n10,488.6\n6,556.2\nCash flows received on retained interests . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n31.7\n21.8\n26.8\nWe have no explicit or implicit arrangements to provide additional financial support to these SPEs, have no\nliabilities related to these SPEs and do not have any outstanding derivative contracts executed in connection with\nthese securitization activities at November 30, 2022 and 2021.\n125\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 6.

Assets retained in connection with a securitization transaction represent the fair value of the\nsecurities of one or more tranches issued by an SPE, including senior and subordinated tranches. Our risk of loss\nis limited to this fair value amount which is included in total Financial instruments owned in our Consolidated\nStatements of Financial Condition.\nAlthough not obligated, in connection with secondary market-making activities we may make a market in the\nsecurities issued by these SPEs. In these market-making transactions, we buy these securities from and sell these\nsecurities to investors. Securities purchased through these market-making activities are not considered to be\ncontinuing involvement in these SPEs. To the extent we purchased securities through these market-making\nactivities and we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, these securities are included in agency\nand non-agency mortgage-backed and asset-backed securitizations in the nonconsolidated VIEs section presented\nin Note 8, Variable Interest Entities.\nNote 8. Variable Interest Entities\nVIEs are entities in which equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. VIEs are\nconsolidated by the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the party who has both (1) the power to\ndirect the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and (2) an\nobligation to absorb losses of the entity or a right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be\nsignificant to the entity.\nOur variable interests in VIEs include debt and equity interests, commitments, guarantees and certain fees. Our\ninvolvement with VIEs arises primarily from:\n• Purchases of securities in connection with our trading and secondary market making activities;\n• Retained interests held as a result of securitization activities;\n• Acting as placement agent and/or underwriter in connection with client-sponsored securitizations;\n• Financing of agency and non-agency mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities;\n• Acting as servicer for a fee to automobile loan financing vehicles;\n• Warehouse funding arrangements for client-sponsored consumer and mortgage loan vehicles and CLOs\nthrough participation agreements, forward sale agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, and revolving\nloan and note commitments; and\n• Loans to, investments in and fees from various investment vehicles.\n126\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 7.

      "text": "We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE upon our initial involvement with the VIE and\nwe reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis. Our determination of whether\nwe are the primary beneficiary of a VIE is based upon the facts and circumstances for each VIE and requires\njudgment. Our considerations in determining the VIE’s most significant activities and whether we have power to\ndirect those activities include, but are not limited to, the VIE’s purpose and design and the risks passed through\nto investors, the voting interests of the VIE, management, service and/or other agreements of the VIE,\ninvolvement in the VIE’s initial design and the existence of explicit or implicit financial guarantees. In situations\nwhere we have determined that the power over the VIE’s significant activities is shared, we assess whether we\nare the party with the power over the most significant activities. If we are the party with the power over the most\nsignificant activities, we meet the ‘‘power’’ criteria of the primary beneficiary. If we do not have the power over\nthe most significant activities or we determine that decisions require consent of each sharing party, we do not\nmeet the ‘‘power’’ criteria of the primary beneficiary.\nWe assess our variable interests in a VIE both individually and in aggregate to determine whether we have an\nobligation to absorb losses of or a right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to\nthe VIE. The determination of whether our variable interest is significant to the VIE requires judgment.

The maximum\nexposure to loss is dependent on the nature of our variable interests in the VIEs and is limited to the notional\namounts of certain loan and equity commitments and guarantees. Our maximum exposure to loss does not\ninclude the offsetting benefit of any financial instruments that may be utilized to hedge the risks associated with\nour variable interests and is not reduced by the amount of collateral held as part of a transaction with a VIE.\nCollateralized Loan Obligations. Assets collateralizing the CLOs include bank loans, participation interests, sub-\ninvestment grade and senior secured U.S. loans, and senior secured Euro denominated corporate leveraged loans\nand bonds. We underwrite securities issued in CLO transactions on behalf of sponsors and provide advisory\nservices to the sponsors. We may also sell corporate loans to the CLOs. Our variable interests in connection with\nCLOs where we have been involved in providing underwriting and/or advisory services consist of the following:\n• Forward sale agreements whereby we commit to sell, at a fixed price, corporate loans and ownership\ninterests in an entity holding such corporate loans to CLOs;\n• Warehouse funding arrangements in the form of:\n\u0004\nParticipation interests in corporate loans held by CLOs and commitments to fund such participation\ninterests,\n\u0004\nReverse repurchase agreements with collateral margin maintenance obligations and commitments to\nfund such reverse repurchase agreements; and\n\u0004\nSenior and subordinated notes issued in connection with CLO warehousing activities.\n• Trading positions in securities issued in CLO transactions; and\n• Investments in variable funding notes issued by CLOs.\nAsset-Backed Vehicles. We provide financing and lending related services to certain client-sponsored VIEs in the\nform of revolving funding note agreements, revolving credit facilities, forward purchase agreements and reverse\nrepurchase agreements. The underlying assets, which are collateralizing the vehicles, are primarily composed of\nunsecured consumer loans and mortgage loans. In addition, we may provide structuring and advisory services\nand act as an underwriter or placement agent for securities issued by the vehicles. We do not control the\nactivities of these entities.\nRelated Party Private Equity Vehicles. We committed to invest in private equity funds, (the ‘‘JCP Funds’’,\nincluding JCP Fund V (see Note 9, Investments)) managed by Jefferies Capital Partners, LLC (the ‘‘JCP\nManager’’). Additionally, we committed to invest in the general partners of the JCP Funds (the ‘‘JCP General\nPartners’’) and the JCP Manager. Our variable interests in the JCP Funds, JCP General Partners and JCP\nManager (collectively, the ‘‘JCP Entities’’) consist of equity interests that, in total, provide us with limited and\ngeneral partner investment returns of the JCP Funds, a portion of the carried interest earned by the JCP General\nPartners and a portion of the management fees earned by the JCP Manager.

The assets of FXCM consist primarily of brokerage receivables and other financial instruments and\noperating assets as part of FXCM’s foreign exchange trading business.\nMortgage-Backed and Other Asset-Backed Secured Funding Vehicles. In connection with our secondary trading\nand market making activities, we buy and sell agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities and other\nasset-backed securities, which are issued by third-party securitization SPEs and are generally considered variable\ninterests in VIEs. Securities issued by securitization SPEs are backed by residential mortgage loans, U.S. agency\ncollateralized mortgage obligations, commercial mortgage loans, CDOs and CLOs and other consumer loans,\nsuch as installment receivables, automobile loans and student loans. These securities are accounted for at fair\nvalue and included in Financial instruments owned in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. We\nhave no other involvement with the related SPEs and therefore do not consolidate these entities.\nWe also engage in underwriting, placement and structuring activities for third-party-sponsored securitization\ntrusts generally through agency (Fannie Mae, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (‘‘Freddie Mac’’) or\nGinnie Mae) or non-agency-sponsored SPEs and may purchase loans or mortgage-backed securities from third-\nparties that are subsequently transferred into the securitization trusts. The securitizations are backed by residential\nand commercial mortgage, home equity and automobile loans. We do not consolidate agency-sponsored\nsecuritizations as we do not have the power to direct the activities of the SPEs that most significantly impact\ntheir economic performance. Further, we are not the servicer of non-agency-sponsored securitizations and\ntherefore do not have power to direct the most significant activities of the SPEs and accordingly, do not\nconsolidate these entities. We may retain unsold senior and/or subordinated interests at the time of securitization\nin the form of securities issued by the SPEs.\nAt November 30, 2022 and 2021, we held $1.47 billion and $1.31 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities,\nrespectively, and $180.6 million and $253.9 million of non-agency mortgage-backed and other asset-backed\nsecurities, respectively, as a result of our secondary trading and market-making activities, and underwriting,\nplacement and structuring activities. Our maximum exposure to loss on these securities is limited to the carrying\nvalue of our investments in these securities. These mortgage-backed and other asset-backed secured funding\nvehicles discussed are not included in the above table containing information about our variable interests in\nnonconsolidated VIEs.\n130\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 8.

A portion of the carrying amount of\nthe investment in Monashee relates to contract and customer relationship and client relationship intangible assets\nand goodwill.

      "text": "we converted our $25.0 million term loan agreement into additional common shares. At November 30, 2022, the\nchange in fair value of our equity investments in ApiJect was a mark-to-market gain of $37.3 million and the\ntotal fair value of our equity investment in common shares of ApiJect is $100.1 million, which is included within\nLevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Additionally, we owned warrants to purchase up to 950,000 shares of\ncommon stock at any time or from time to time on or before April 15, 2032.\nWe also have a term loan agreement with a principal of ApiJect for $28.7 million, maturing on February 28,\n2023. The loan is accounted for at cost plus accrued interest and is reported within Other assets in our\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Interest income on the term loan of $2.3 million and $1.6\nmillion was recognized in Interest revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the year ended\nNovember 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The loan has a fair value of $28.9 million and $26.6 million at\nNovember 30, 2022 and 2021, which is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nNote 10. Credit Losses on Financial Assets Measured at Amortized Cost\nAutomobile Loans. Financial assets measured at amortized cost are presented at the net amount expected to be\ncollected and the measurement of credit losses and any expected increases or decreases in expected credit losses\nare recognized in earnings. The estimate of expected credit losses involves judgment based on an assessment\nover the life of the financial instrument taking into consideration forecast of expected future economic\nconditions.\nAt November 30, 2022 and 2021, we had automobile loans, including accrued interest and related fees, of\n$891.1 million and $812.6 million, respectively, which are classified as either held for investment or held for sale\ndepending on the intent and ability to hold the loans, which are collateralized by a security interest in the\nvehicles’ titles. These loans are included in Other assets in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nLoans held for investment are recorded at cost net of deferred acquisition costs and an allowance for credit\nlosses. Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value until the loans are sold.\nProvision for credit losses are charged to income in amounts sufficient to maintain an allowance for credit losses\ninherent in the automobile loans held for investment which is established systematically by management as of\nthe reporting date. All automobile loans held for investment are collectively evaluated for impairment.\nManagement’s estimate of expected credit losses is based on an evaluation of relevant information about past\nevents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the future collectability of the\nreported amounts. We use static pool modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected\nover the remaining life of the loans, which is supplemented by management judgment. Expected losses are\nestimated for groups of accounts aggregated by monthly vintage.\nGenerally, the expected losses are projected based on historical loss experience over the last eight years, more\nheavily weighted toward recent performance when determining the allowance to result in an estimate that is more\nreflective of the current internal and external environments. Our estimate of expected credit losses includes a\nreasonable and supportable forecast period of two years and then reverts to an estimate based on historical losses.\nWe review charge-off experience factors, contractual delinquency, historical collection rates, the value of\nunderlying collateral and other information to make the necessary judgments as to credit losses expected in the\nportfolio as of the reporting date. While management utilizes the best information available to make its\nevaluations, changes in macroeconomic conditions, interest rate environments, or both, may significantly impact\nthe assumptions and inputs used in determining the allowance for credit losses. Our charge-off policy is based on\na loan by loan review of delinquent loans. We have an accounting policy to not place loans on nonaccrual status;\nhowever, the allowance for credit losses is determined including the accrued interest receivable that it does not\nexpect to collect.\n138\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 9.

In evaluating secured financing receivables (reverse repurchases agreements,\nsecurities borrowing arrangements, and margin loans), the underlying collateral maintenance provisions are taken\ninto consideration. The underlying contractual collateral maintenance for significantly all of our secured\nfinancing receivables requires that the counterparty continually adjust the collateralization amount, securing the\ncredit exposure on these contracts. Collateralization levels for our secured financing receivables are initially\nestablished based upon the counterparty, the type of acceptable collateral that is monitored daily and adjusted to\nmitigate the potential of any credit losses. Credit losses are not recognized for secured financing receivables\nwhere the underlying collateral’s fair value is equal to or exceeds the asset’s amortized cost basis. In cases where\nthe collateral’s fair value does not equal or exceed the amortized cost basis, the allowance for credit losses, if\nany, is limited to the difference between the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date and the amortized\ncost basis of the financial assets. During the year ended November 30, 2021, we incurred bad debt expense of\n$39.0 million related to a specific default in our prime brokerage business.\nBroker Receivables. Our receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations include deposits of cash\nwith exchange clearing organizations to meet margin requirements, amounts due from clearing organizations for\ndaily variation settlements, securities failed-to-deliver or receive, receivables and payables for fees and\ncommissions, and receivables arising from unsettled securities or loans transactions. These receivables generally\ndo not give rise to material credit risk and have a remote probability of default either because of their short-term\nnature or due to the credit protection framework inherent in the design and operations of brokers, dealers and\nclearing organizations. As such, generally, no allowance for credit losses is held against these receivables.\nOther Financial Assets. For all other financial assets measured at amortized cost, we estimate expected credit\nlosses over the financial assets’ life as of the reporting date based on relevant information about past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nOur allowance for credit losses on our investment banking fee receivables using a provisioning matrix based on\nthe shared risk characteristics and historical loss experience for such receivables. In some instances, we may\nadjust the allowance calculated based on the provision matrix to incorporate a specific allowance based on the\nunique credit risk profile of a receivable. The provisioning matrix is periodically updated to reflect changes in\nthe underlying portfolio’s credit characteristics and most recent historical loss data.\n140\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 10.

The quantitative goodwill\nimpairment test is performed at the level of the reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is compared\nwith its carrying value, including goodwill and allocated intangible assets. If the fair value is in excess of the\ncarrying value, the goodwill for the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than\nthe carrying value, then an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the\nreporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. Allocated tangible equity plus allocated goodwill and\nintangible assets are used for the carrying amount of each reporting unit.\n141\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 10.

      "text": "Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit requires management judgment. Estimated fair values for our\nreporting units were determined using methodologies that include a market valuation method that incorporated\nprice-to-earnings and price-to-book multiples of comparable public companies and/or projected cash flows.\nUnder the market valuation approach, the key assumptions are the selected multiples and our internally\ndeveloped projections of future profitability, growth and return on equity for each reporting unit. The weight\nassigned to the multiples requires judgment in qualitatively and quantitatively evaluating the size, profitability\nand the nature of the business activities of the reporting units as compared to the comparable publicly-traded\ncompanies. In addition, as the fair values determined under the market valuation approach represent a\nnoncontrolling interest, we applied a control premium to arrive at the estimated fair value of each reporting unit\non a controlling basis. We engaged an independent valuation specialist to assist us in our valuation process at\nAugust 1, 2022.\nHistorically, we have performed our annual goodwill impairment testing within the Investment Banking and\nCapital Markets and Asset Management reportable business segments, which did not indicate any goodwill\nimpairment as of our annual testing date of August 1, 2022. On November 1, 2022, in connection with the\nmerger of Jefferies Group LLC into Jefferies Financial Group Inc., we reassessed our reporting units based on\nthe discrete financial information to be made available to segment management as of and subsequent to the\nmerger. As a result, we identified each of the Investment Banking, Equities and Fixed Income businesses to be\nreporting units within the Investment Banking and Capital Markets reportable business segment. The total\ngoodwill of $1.55 billion attributed to the Investment Banking and Capital Markets reportable business segment\nhas been assigned to each of these reporting units as of November 1, 2022, based on the relative fair value of\neach of the reporting units as of November 1, 2022. The relative fair value estimate of each of the reporting units\nas of November 1, 2022 was based on methodologies consistent with the market valuation approach used in our\nannual impairment test, which are consistent with valuation techniques market participants would use. In\nconnection with the transfer of certain legacy merchant banking investments to our Asset Management segment,\ngoodwill previously attributable to our Merchant Banking reportable segment is now included within our Asset\nManagement reportable business segment.\nWe tested the assigned goodwill to each of the Investment Banking, Equities and Fixed Income reporting units as\nof November 1, 2022 for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values\nas of November 1, 2022. The carrying values of the reporting units were determined based on, allocated tangible\nequity as determined by our cash capital model plus allocated goodwill and intangible assets. The amount of\ntangible equity allocated to a reporting unit is based on our cash capital model deployed in managing our\nbusinesses, which seeks to approximate the capital a business would require if it were operating independently.\nIntangible assets are allocated to a reporting unit based on either specifically identifying a particular intangible\nasset as pertaining to a reporting unit or, if shared among reporting units, based on an assessment of the reporting\nunit’s benefit from the intangible asset in order to generate results. There was no indication of goodwill\nimpairment in any of the reporting units as a result of the testing performed as of November 1, 2022 in\nconnection with the reassessment of our reporting units.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are included in Other assets in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

A good or service is transferred to a customer\nwhen, or as, the customer obtains control of that good or service. A performance obligation may be satisfied over\ntime or at a point in time. Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied over time is recognized by measuring\nour progress in satisfying the performance obligation in a manner that depicts the transfer of the goods or\nservices to the customer. Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time is recognized at the\npoint in time that we determine the customer obtains control over the promised good or service. The amount of\nrevenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those promised goods\nor services (i.e., the ‘‘transaction price’’). In determining the transaction price, we consider multiple factors,\nincluding the effects of variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to\nthe extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur\nwhen the uncertainties with respect to the amount are resolved. In determining when to include variable\nconsideration in the transaction price, we consider the range of possible outcomes, the predictive value of our\npast experiences, the time period of when uncertainties expect to be resolved and the amount of consideration\nthat is susceptible to factors outside of our influence, such as market volatility or the judgment and actions of\nthird-parties.\nThe following provides detailed information on the recognition of our revenues from contracts with customers:\nInvestment Banking. We provide our clients with a full range of financial advisory and underwriting services.\nRevenues from financial advisory services primarily consist of fees generated in connection with merger,\nacquisition and restructuring transactions. Advisory fees from mergers and acquisitions engagements are\nrecognized at a point in time when the related transaction is completed, as the performance obligation is to\nsuccessfully broker a specific transaction. Fees received prior to the completion of the transaction are deferred\nwithin Accrued expenses and other liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Advisory\nfees from restructuring engagements are recognized over time using a time elapsed measure of progress as our\nclients simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of those services as they are provided. A significant\nportion of the fees we receive for our advisory services are considered variable as they are contingent upon a\n144\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 12.

      "text": "future event (e.g., completion of a transaction or third-party emergence from bankruptcy) and are excluded from\nthe transaction price until the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved,\nwhich is expected to occur upon achievement of the specified milestone. Payment for advisory services are\ngenerally due promptly upon completion of a specified milestone or, for retainer fees, periodically over the\ncourse of the engagement. We recognize a receivable between the date of completion of the milestone and\npayment by the customer. Expenses associated with investment banking advisory engagements are deferred only\nto the extent they are explicitly reimbursable by the client and the related revenue is recognized at a point in\ntime. All other investment banking advisory related expenses, including expenses incurred related to\nrestructuring assignments, are expensed as incurred. All investment banking advisory expenses are recognized\nwithin their respective expense category in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and any expenses\nreimbursed by our clients are recognized as Investment banking revenues.\nUnderwriting services include underwriting and placement agent services in both the equity and debt capital\nmarkets, including private equity placements, initial public offerings, follow-on offerings and equity-linked\nsecurities transactions and structuring, underwriting and distributing public and private debt, including\ninvestment grade debt, high yield bonds, leveraged loans, municipal bonds and mortgage-backed and asset-\nbacked securities. Underwriting and placement agent revenues are recognized at a point in time on trade-date, as\nthe client obtains the control and benefit of the underwriting offering at that point. Costs associated with\nunderwriting transactions are deferred until the related revenue is recognized or the engagement is otherwise\nconcluded, and are recorded on a gross basis within Underwriting costs in our Consolidated Statements of\nEarnings as we are acting as a principal in the arrangement. Any expenses reimbursed by our clients are\nrecognized as Investment banking revenues.\nCommissions and Other Fees. We earn commission and other fee revenue by executing, settling and clearing\ntransactions for clients primarily in equity, equity-related and futures products. Trade execution and clearing\nservices, when provided together, represent a single performance obligation as the services are not separately\nidentifiable in the context of the contract. Commission revenues associated with combined trade execution and\nclearing services, as well as trade execution services on a standalone basis, are recognized at a point in time on\ntrade-date. Commissions revenues are generally paid on settlement date and we record a receivable between\ntrade-date and payment on settlement date. We permit institutional customers to allocate a portion of their gross\ncommissions to pay for research products and other services provided by third-parties. The amounts allocated for\nthose purposes are commonly referred to as soft dollar arrangements. We act as an agent in the soft dollar\narrangements as the customer controls the use of the soft dollars and directs our payments to third-party service\nproviders on its behalf. Accordingly, amounts allocated to soft dollar arrangements are netted against commission\nrevenues in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We also earn investment research fees for the sales of our\nproprietary investment research when a contract with a client has been identified. The delivery of investment\nresearch services represents a distinct performance obligation that is satisfied over time when the performance\nobligation is to provide ongoing access to a research platform or research analysts, with fees recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the period in which the performance obligation is satisfied. The performance obligation is\nsatisfied at a point in time when the performance obligation is to provide individual interactions with research\nanalysts or research events, with fees recognized on the interaction date.\nWe earn account advisory and distribution fees in connection with wealth management services. Account\nadvisory fees are recognized over time using the time-elapsed method as we determined that the customer\nsimultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of investment advisory services as they are provided. Account\nadvisory fees may be paid in advance of a specified service period or in arrears at the end of the specified service\nperiod (e.g., quarterly). Account advisory fees paid in advance are initially deferred within Accrued expenses and\nother liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Distribution fees are variable and\nrecognized when the uncertainties with respect to the amounts are resolved.\n145\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 12.

      "text": "Asset Management Fees. We earn management and performance fees in connection with investment advisory\nservices provided to various funds and accounts, which are satisfied over time and measured using a time\nelapsed measure of progress as the customer receives the benefits of the services evenly throughout the term of\nthe contract. Management and performance fees are considered variable as they are subject to fluctuation (e.g.,\nchanges in assets under management, market performance) and/ or are contingent on a future event during the\nmeasurement period (e.g., meeting a specified benchmark) and are recognized only to the extent it is probable\nthat a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is\nresolved. Management fees are generally based on month-end assets under management or an agreed upon\nnotional amount and are included in the transaction price at the end of each month when the assets under\nmanagement or notional amount is known. Performance fees are received when the return on assets under\nmanagement for a specified performance period exceed certain benchmark returns, ‘‘high-water marks’’ or other\nperformance targets. The performance period related to our performance fees is annual or semi-annual.\nAccordingly, performance fee revenue will generally be recognized only at the end of the performance period to\nthe extent that the benchmark return has been met.\nManufacturing Revenues. We earn revenues from the sale of manufactured or remanufactured lumber.\nAgreements with customers for these sales specify the type, quantity and price of products to be delivered as\nwell as the delivery date and payment terms. The transaction price is fixed at the time of sale and revenue is\ngenerally recognized when the customer takes control of the product.\nOil and Gas Revenues. The sales of oil and natural gas are made under contracts negotiated with customers,\nwhich typically include variable consideration based on monthly pricing tied to local indices and volumes.\nRevenue is recorded at the point in time when control of the produced oil and gas transfers to the customer,\nwhich is when the performance obligation is satisfied. The amount of production delivered to the customer and\nthe price that will be received for the sale of the product is estimated utilizing production reports, market indices\nand estimated differential. The variable consideration can be reasonably estimated at the end of the month when\nthe performance obligation is satisfied.\nReal Estate Revenues. Revenues from the sales of real estate are recognized at a point in time when the related\ntransaction is complete. The majority of our real estate sales of land, lots and homes transfer the goods and\nservices to the customer at the close of escrow when the title transfers to the buyer and the buyer has the benefit\nand control of the goods and service. If performance obligation under the contract with a customer related to a\nparcel of real estate are not yet complete when title transfers to the buyer, revenue associated with the incomplete\nperformance obligation is deferred until the performance obligation is completed.\n146\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 12.

We record a\nreceivable when revenue is recognized prior to payment and we have an unconditional right to payment.\nAlternatively, when payment precedes the provision of the related services, we record deferred revenue until the\nperformance obligations are satisfied.\nOur deferred revenue primarily relates to retainer and milestone fees received in investment banking advisory\nengagements where the performance obligation has not yet been satisfied. Deferred revenue at November 30,\n2022 and 2021 was $27.0 million and $49.7 million, respectively, which are recorded in Accrued expenses and\nother liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. During the years ended November 30,\n2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized revenue of $48.7 million, $10.8 million and $10.9 million, respectively,\nthat were recorded as deferred revenue at the beginning of the year. We had receivables related to revenues from\ncontracts with customers of $206.6 million and $298.7 million at November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nContract Costs\nWe capitalize costs to fulfill contracts associated with investment banking advisory engagements where the\nrevenue is recognized at a point in time and the costs are determined to be recoverable. Capitalized costs to\nfulfill a contract are recognized at the point in time that the related revenue is recognized.\nAt November 30, 2022 and 2021, capitalized costs to fulfill a contract were $3.4 million and $1.6 million,\nrespectively, which are recorded in Receivables–Fees, interest and other in the Consolidated Statement of\nFinancial Condition. For the years ended November 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized expenses of $1.6\nmillion, $1.7 million and $5.1 million, respectively, related to costs to fulfill a contract that were capitalized as of\nthe beginning of the year. There were no significant impairment charges recognized in relation to these\ncapitalized costs during the years ended November 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nNote 13. Compensation Plans\nEquity Compensation Plan. Our 2003 Incentive Compensation Plan, as Amended and Restated (‘‘Incentive\nPlan’’), allowed awards in the form of incentive stock options (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal\nRevenue Code), nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, unrestricted stock,\nperformance awards, restricted stock units (‘‘RSUs’’), dividend equivalents or other share-based awards. We also\nhave the 1999 Directors’ Stock Compensation Plan, as Amended and Restated July 25, 2013 (the ‘‘Directors’\nPlan’’), which provided for equity awards to our non-employee directors.\nOn March 25, 2021, a new Equity Compensation Plan (the ‘‘ECP’’) was approved by shareholders. The ECP\nreplaced the Incentive Plan and Directors’ Plan; no further awards will be granted under the replaced plans. The\nECP is an omnibus plan authorizing a variety of equity award types, as well as cash incentive awards, to be used\nfor employees, non-employee directors and other service providers. At November 30, 2022, 4,489,965 shares\nremain available for new grants under the ECP.\nRestricted stock awards are grants of our common shares that require service as a condition of vesting.

Prior to settlement, RSUs carry no voting or dividend rights associated with the stock ownership, but\ndividend equivalents are accrued to the extent there are dividends declared on the underlying common shares as\ncash amounts or as deemed reinvestments in additional RSUs.\nRestricted stock and RSUs may be granted to new employees as ‘‘sign-on’’ awards, to existing employees as\n‘‘retention’’ awards and to certain executive officers as incentive awards. Sign-on and retention awards are\ngenerally subject to annual ratable vesting over a multi-year service period and are amortized as compensation\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the service period. Restricted stock and RSUs granted to certain senior\nexecutives may contain market, performance and/or service conditions. Market conditions are incorporated into\nthe grant-date fair value of senior executive awards using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation\nexpense for awards with market conditions is recognized over the service period and is not reversed if the market\nconditions are not met. Awards with performance conditions are amortized over the service period if, and to the\nextent, it is determined to be probable that the performance condition will be achieved. If awards are forfeited\ndue to failure to achieve performance conditions or failure to satisfy service conditions, any previously\nrecognized expense for such awards is reversed.\nSenior Executive Compensation Plan. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved an\nexecutive compensation plan for our senior executives for compensation year 2020 (the ‘‘2020 Plan’’). For each\nsenior executive, the Compensation Committee targeted long-term compensation of $22.5 million per year under\nthe 2020 Plan with a target of $16.0 million in long-term equity in the form of RSUs and a target of $6.5 million\nin cash for both plan years. To receive targeted long-term equity, our senior executives had to achieve 9% growth\non a multi-year compounded basis in Jefferies’ total shareholder return (‘‘TSR’’) and to receive targeted cash, our\nsenior executives had to achieve 9% growth in annual Jefferies’ Return on Tangible Deployable Equity\n(‘‘ROTDE’’). If TSR and ROTDE were less than 6%, our senior executives would receive no incentive\ncompensation. If TSR growth rates were greater than 9%, our senior executives were eligible to receive up to\n75% additional incentive compensation relative to our peer companies. If ROTDE growth rates were greater than\n9%, our senior executives were eligible to receive up to 75% additional incentive compensation on an\ninterpolated basis, up to 12% growth rates.\nIn December 2020, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted our senior executives\nnonqualified stock options and stock appreciation rights (‘‘SARs’’). The total initial fair value of the stock\noptions and SARs were recorded as expense at the time of the grant, as both awards have no future service\nrequirements. The SARs initially provided for settlement in cash but, at the sole discretion of the Compensation\nCommittee, the awards could be converted irrevocably to a stock-settled award. Accordingly, the SARs were\ninitially determined to be liability-classified share-based awards. In March 2021, the Compensation Committee\nexercised its discretion and converted the SARs to stock-settled awards, and at which time they became equity-\nclassified share-based awards. As a result, a total of 2,506,266 stock options, with an exercise price of $23.75,\nwere issued to each of our senior executives. The SARs included excess dividend rights, which provide for\ncrediting to the executive a cash amount equal to two times the amount of any quarterly dividend paid in the 9.5\nyears after grant to the extent the dividend exceeds the quarterly dividend rate in effect at the time of grant for\neach share underlying the granted SARs (including after conversion to stock options). Beginning in March 2021,\nthe credited amounts are converted to share units at the dividend payment date, to be settled by issuance of\nshares 9.5 years after grant of the SARs. All of the stock options vest in three equal annual tranches beginning\nDecember 6, 2021, with a final expiration date of December 5, 2030. For the year ended November 30, 2021, we\nrecorded $48.6 million of total Compensation and benefits expense relating to the stock options and SARs. At\nboth November 30, 2022 and 2021, 5,012,532 of our common shares were designated for the senior executive\nnonqualified stock options.\n149\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 13.

      "text": "In December 2021, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted each of our senior\nexecutives RSUs with a grant date fair value of $8.2 million and performance stock units (‘‘PSUs’’) with a target\nfair market value of $8.2 million. The RSUs have a three-year cliff vesting schedule. With respect to the PSUs,\nthere is a three-year service period, along with performance period measures of fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2023\nperformance, the threshold level of Return on Tangible Equity (‘‘ROTE’’) was 7.5%, the target level of ROTE\nwas 10%, and the upper end was 15%. Any performance below 7.5% will result in forfeiture of all PSUs; 7.5%\nROTE will result in receiving 75% of target PSUs; and 15% ROTE or greater will result in receiving 150% of\ntarget PSUs. ROTE performance between 7.5% and 10% and 10% and 15% will be linearly interpolated to\ndetermine PSU distribution.\nIn December 2021, the Board of Directors also granted our senior executives each a special long-term, five-year\nretention grant, termed the Leadership Continuity Grant, with a grant date fair value of $25.0 million. Our senior\nexecutives will gain the benefits of the retention award after an additional three-year holding period following\nthe five-year service period.\nThe following table details the total activity in restricted stock, inclusive across all plans, during the years ended\nNovember 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nRestricted Stock\nWeighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nBalance at November 30, 2019 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2,008\n$22.04\nGrants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n115\n$13.20\nForfeited . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n(21)\n$23.38\nFulfillment of vesting requirement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n(619)\n$19.99\nBalance at November 30, 2020 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n1,483\n$22.19\nGrants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n337\n$30.81\nForfeited . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n(40)\n$24.92\nFulfillment of vesting requirement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n(196)\n$23.55\nBalance at November 30, 2021 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n1,584\n$23.78\nGrants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n1,457\n$29.91\nForfeited . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n–\n$\n–\nFulfillment of vesting requirement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n(902)\n$24.03\nBalance at November 30, 2022 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2,139\n$27.85\n150\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 13.

      "text": "Employee Stock Purchase Plan. An Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ‘‘ESPP’’) has been implemented under\nboth the prior Incentive Plan and the new ECP. We consider the ESPP to be noncompensatory effective January\n1, 2007. The ESPP allows eligible employees to make payroll contributions that are used to acquire shares of our\nstock, generally at a discounted price.\nDeferred Compensation Plan. A Deferred Compensation Plan (the ‘‘DCP’’), has been implemented under both\nthe prior Incentive Plan and the new ECP. The DCP permits eligible employees to defer compensation which\nmay be deemed invested in our common shares usually at a discount, or directed among other investment\nvehicles available under the DCP. We often invest directly, as a principal, in investments corresponding to the\nother investment vehicles, relating to our obligations to perform under the DCP. The compensation deferred by\nour eligible employees is expensed in the period earned. The change in fair value of our investments in assets\ncorresponding to the specified other investment vehicles are recognized in Principal transactions revenues and\nchanges in the corresponding deferred compensation liability are reflected as Compensation and benefits expense\nin our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nOther Stock-Based Plans. In connection with the HomeFed merger in 2019, each HomeFed stock option was\nconverted into an option to purchase two of our common shares. At November 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020,\n12,000, 96,000 and 313,000, respectively, of our common shares were designated for the HomeFed stock\noptions.\nProfit Sharing Plan. We have a profit sharing plan, covering substantially all employees, which includes a salary\nreduction feature designed to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nRestricted Cash Awards. We provide compensation to new and existing employees in the form of loans and/or\nother cash awards which are subject to ratable vesting terms with service requirements. We amortize these\nawards to compensation expense over the relevant service period, which is generally considered to start at the\nbeginning of the annual compensation year.\nCompensation Expense.

As plan funded status improves, the asset\nallocation will move along a predetermined, de-risking glide path that reallocates capital from growth assets to\nliability-hedging assets in order to reduce funded status volatility and lock in funded status gains. Plan assets are\nsplit into two separate portfolios, each with different asset mixes and objectives. The portfolios are valued at\ntheir NAV as a practical expedient for fair value.\n• The Growth Portfolio consists of global equities and high yield investments.\n• The Liability-Driven Investing (‘‘LDI’’) Portfolio consists of long duration credit bonds and a suite of\nlong duration, Treasury-based instruments designed to provide capital-efficient interest rate exposure as\nwell as target specific maturities. The objective of the LDI Portfolio is to seek to achieve performance\nsimilar to the WilTel plan’s liability by seeking to match the interest rate sensitivity and credit sensitivity.\nThe LDI Portfolio is managed to mitigate volatility in funded status deriving from changes in the\ndiscounted value of benefit obligations from market movements in the interest rate and credit\ncomponents of the underlying discount curve.\nU.S. Pension Plan Assets\nWe have an agreement with an external investment manager to invest and manage the plan’s assets under a\nstrategy using a combination of two portfolios. The investment manager allocates the plan’s assets between a\ngrowth portfolio and a liability-driven portfolio according to certain target allocations and tolerance bands that\nare agreed to by the Administrative Committee of the U.S. Pension Plan. Such target allocations will take into\nconsideration the plan’s funded ratio. The manager will also monitor the strategy and, as the plan’s funded ratio\nchanges over time, will rebalance the strategy, if necessary, to be within the agreed tolerance bands and target\nallocations. The portfolios are composed of certain common collective investment trusts that are established and\nmaintained by the investment manager. The common collective trusts are valued at their NAV as a practical\nexpedient for fair value.\n156\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 14. Benefit Plans, continued"

      "text": "Plan Assumptions\nTo develop the assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we considered the following\nunderlying assumptions: 2.5% current expected inflation, (0.5)% to 1.5% real rate of return for long duration risk\nfree investments and an additional 0.5% to 1.5% return premium for corporate credit risk. For U.S. and\ninternational equity, we assume an equity risk premium over risk-free assets equal to 4.6%. We then weighted\nthese assumptions based on invested assets and assumed that investment expenses were offset by expected\nreturns in excess of benchmarks, which resulted in the selection of 6.0% and 5.0% expected long-term rate of\nreturn assumption for WilTel and U.S. Pension plan, respectively, for 2022.\nOther\nWe have defined contribution pension plans, including 401(k) plans, that cover certain employees. Amounts\ncharged to expense related to such plans were $12.7 million, $9.8 million and $9.5 million for the years ended\nNovember 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNote 15.

A weighted average coupon rate is not meaningful, as all of the structured\nnotes are carried at fair value.\n(3) The Total Long-term debt has a fair value of $8.46 billion and $9.85 billion at November 30, 2022 and\n2021, respectively, which would be classified as Level 2 and Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nIn connection with the merger of Jefferies Group LLC with and into Jefferies Financial Group Inc. on November\n1, 2022, we assumed all of the debt obligations of Jefferies Group LLC, which had previously been non-recourse\nto us.\nDuring 2022, long-term debt decreased by $351.7 million to $8.77 billion at November 30, 2022, as presented in\nour Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. This decrease is primarily due to fair value changes in our\nstructured notes and gains on certain of our senior notes associated with interest rate swaps based on their\ndesignation as fair value hedges, partially offset by structured notes issuances, net of retirements, of\napproximately $209.4 million and net issuances of approximately $176.7 million related to our secured credit\nfacilities.\nDuring 2021, long-term debt increased by $774 million to $9.13 billion at November 30, 2021. This increase is\nprimarily due to our issuances of 2.625% senior notes with a principal amount of $1.0 billion, due 2031, and\nfloating rate senior notes with a principal amount of $62.3 million, due 2071, partially offset by the early\nredemption of our 5.125% senior notes with a principal amount of $750.0 million, due January 20, 2023 and\npartial repurchase of $308.3 million of our 5.500% senior notes, due October 18, 2023. The change was also due\nto an increase of $349.0 million from borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility\n(‘‘Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility’’), an increase of $484.3 million from secured long-term borrowings and\napproximately $175.6 million of structured notes issuances, net of retirements.\nAt November 30, 2022 and 2021, our borrowings under several credit facilities classified within Long-term debt\nin our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition amounted to $933.5 million and $774.1 million,\nrespectively. Interest on these credit facilities are based on adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (‘‘LIBOR’’)\nrates, Secured Overnight Financing Rate (‘‘SOFR’’) plus a spread or other adjusted rates, as defined in the\nvarious credit agreements. The credit facility agreements contain certain covenants that, among other things,\nrequire us to maintain specified levels of tangible net worth and liquidity amounts, and impose certain\nrestrictions on future indebtedness of and require specified levels of regulated capital and cash reserves for\ncertain of our subsidiaries. At November 30, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants under theses credit\nfacilities, except for certain facilities secured by automobile loans with an amount outstanding of $112.9 million\nfor which technical covenant violations have occurred that are in the process of being resolved with the lenders.\nIn addition, one of our subsidiaries has a Loan and Security Agreement with a bank for a term loan (‘‘Secured\nBank Loan’’). At November 30, 2022 and 2021, borrowings under the Secured Bank Loan amounted to\n$100.0 million and are also classified within Long-term debt in our Consolidated Statements of Financial\nCondition. The Secured Bank Loan matures on September 13, 2024 and is collateralized by certain trading\nsecurities with an interest rate of 1.25% plus LIBOR. The agreement contains certain covenants that, among\nother things, restricts lien or encumbrance upon any of the pledged collateral. At November 30, 2022, we were\nin compliance with all covenants under the Secured Bank Loan.\nHomeFed funds certain of its real estate projects in part by raising funds under the Immigrant Investor Program\nadministered by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act\n(‘‘EB-5 Program’’). This debt is secured by certain real estate of HomeFed. At November 30, 2022, HomeFed\nwas in compliance with all debt covenants which include, among other requirements, limitations on incurrence of\ndebt, collateral requirements and restricted use of proceeds. Primarily all of HomeFed’s EB-5 Program debt\nmatures in 2024 through 2026.\n160\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 17. Long-Term Debt, continued"

The outstanding\nprincipal amount of the loans bears interest based on the 30 day LIBOR or the SOFR, plus spreads of 1.35% to\n3.00%, subject to adjustment on the first of each calendar month. At November 30, 2022, the weighted average\ninterest rate on these loans was 6.07%.

The Preferred Shares have a dividend rate equal to the sum of 3.25%\nannual, cumulative cash dividend, plus an additional quarterly payment based on the amount by which our\ncommon stock dividends exceed $0.0625 per common share. At November 30, 2022, the Preferred Shares are\nconvertible into 4,440,863 common shares, an effective conversion price of $28.15 per share. Based on the\ncurrent quarterly dividend of $0.30 per common share, the effective rate on these Preferred Shares is\napproximately 6.6%. In connection with the Vitesse Energy spin-off, the number of common shares into which\nthe Preferred Shares will convert may be adjusted based on subsequent trading prices, which may increase the\nnumber of Preferred Shares convertible into common shares.\n161\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 17.

The Inflation Reduction Act of\n2022 includes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (‘‘AMT’’) and a one percent excise tax on net stock\nrepurchases. The corporate AMT applies to corporations with average annual profits over $1 billion and is\ncalculated on their financial statement income, with certain adjustments, and will apply to our tax year beginning\nDecember 1, 2023. The one percent excise tax on net stock repurchases is effective January 1, 2023.

We enter into commitments to take possession of securities with\nagreements to resell on a forward starting basis and to sell securities with agreements to repurchase on a forward\nstarting basis that are primarily secured by U.S. government and agency securities.\nOther Unfunded Commitments. Other unfunded commitments include obligations in the form of revolving notes,\nwarehouse financings and debt securities to provide financing to asset-backed and CLO vehicles. Upon\nadvancing funds, drawn amounts are collateralized by the assets of an entity.\nGuarantees\nDerivative Contracts. As a dealer, we make markets and trade in a variety of derivative instruments. Certain\nderivative contracts that we have entered into meet the accounting definition of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP,\nincluding credit default swaps, written foreign currency options and written equity put options. On certain of\nthese contracts, such as written interest rate caps and foreign currency options, the maximum payout cannot be\nquantified since the increase in interest or foreign exchange rates are not contractually limited by the terms of the\ncontract. As such, we have disclosed notional values as a measure of our maximum potential payout under these\ncontracts.\nThe following table summarizes the notional amounts associated with our derivative contracts meeting the\ndefinition of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP at November 30, 2022 (in millions):\n2023\n2024\n2025 and\n2026\n2027 and\n2028\n2029 and\nLater\nNotional/\nMaximum\nPayout\nExpected Maturity Date (Fiscal Years)\nGuarantee Type:\nDerivative contracts – non-credit related.\n$19,015.0\n$6,933.1\n$11,994.3\n$850.3\n$ –\n$38,792.7\nWritten derivative contracts – credit\nrelated . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n–\n0.2\n–\n–\n–\n0.2\nTotal derivative contracts . . . . . . . . . . . .\n$19,015.0\n$6,933.3\n$11,994.3\n$850.3\n$ –\n$38,792.9\nThe derivative contracts deemed to meet the definition of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP are before consideration\nof hedging transactions and only reflect a partial or ‘‘one-sided’’ component of any risk exposure. Written equity\noptions and written credit default swaps are often executed in a strategy that is in tandem with long cash\ninstruments (e.g., equity and debt securities). We substantially mitigate our exposure to market risk on these\ncontracts through hedges, such as other derivative contracts and/or cash instruments, and we manage the risk\nassociated with these contracts in the context of our overall risk management framework. We believe notional\namounts overstate our expected payout and that fair value of these contracts is a more relevant measure of our\nobligations. At November 30, 2022, the fair value of derivative contracts meeting the definition of a guarantee is\napproximately $702.1 million.\n168\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 22.

We have agreed to reimburse Berkshire Hathaway for up to one-half of any losses incurred under a\n$1.5 billion surety policy securing outstanding commercial paper issued by an affiliate of Berkadia. At\nNovember 30, 2022, the aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding was $1.47 billion.\nHomeFed. For real estate development projects, we are generally required to obtain infrastructure improvement\nbonds at the beginning of construction work and warranty bonds upon completion of such improvements. These\nbonds are issued by surety companies to guarantee a municipality satisfactory completion of a project. As the\nplanned area is developed and the municipality accepts the improvements, the bonds are released. At November\n30, 2022, the aggregate amount of infrastructure improvement bonds outstanding was $70.7 million.\nStandby Letters of Credit. At November 30, 2022, we provided guarantees to certain counterparties in the form\nof standby letters of credit in the amount of $57.6 million, with a weighted average maturity of less than one\nyear. Standby letters of credit commit us to make payment to the beneficiary if the guaranteed party fails to\nfulfill its obligation under a contractual arrangement with that beneficiary. Since commitments associated with\nthese collateral instruments may expire unused, the amount shown does not necessarily reflect the actual future\ncash funding requirement.\nOther Guarantees. We are members of various exchanges and clearing houses. In the normal course of business,\nwe provide guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges. These guarantees generally are required\nunder the standard membership agreements, such that members are required to guarantee the performance of\nother members. Additionally, if a member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing house, other\nmembers would be required to meet these shortfalls. To mitigate these performance risks, the exchanges and\nclearing houses often require members to post collateral. Our obligations under such guarantees could exceed the\ncollateral amounts posted. Our maximum potential liability under these arrangements cannot be quantified;\nhowever, the potential for us to be required to make payments under such guarantees is deemed remote.\nAccordingly, no liability has been recognized for these arrangements. Additionally, we provide certain\nindemnifications in connection with third-party clearing and execution arrangements whereby a third-party may\nclear and settle transactions on behalf of our clients. These indemnifications generally have standard contractual\nterms and are entered into in the ordinary course of business. Our obligations in respect of such transactions are\nsecured by the assets in our client’s account, as well as any proceeds received from the transactions cleared and\nsettled on behalf of our client. However, we believe that it is unlikely we would have to make any material\npayments under these arrangements and no material liabilities related to these indemnifications have been\nrecognized.\nNote 23. Net Capital Requirements\nAs a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and a member firm of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n(‘‘FINRA’’), Jefferies LLC is subject to the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule (‘‘Rule 15c3-1’’), which requires the\nmaintenance of minimum net capital, and has elected to calculate minimum capital requirements using the\nalternative method permitted by Rule 15c3-1 in calculating net capital. Jefferies LLC, as a dually-registered U.S.\nbroker-dealer and futures commission merchant (‘‘FCM’’), is also subject to Rule 1.17 of the Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission (‘‘CFTC’’), which sets forth minimum financial requirements. The minimum net\ncapital requirement in determining excess net capital for a dually-registered U.S. broker-dealer and FCM is equal\nto the greater of the requirement under Rule 15c3-1 or CFTC Rule 1.17.\nJefferies Financial Services, Inc. (‘‘JFSI’’) is a registered swap dealer subject to the CFTC’s regulatory capital\nrequirements, is a registered security-based swap dealer with the SEC subject to the SEC’s security-based swap\ndealer regulatory rules and is approved by the SEC as an OTC derivatives dealer subject to compliance with the\nSEC’s net capital requirements. At November 30, 2022, JFSI is in compliance with these SEC and CFTC\nrequirements.

The Investment Banking and Capital Markets\nreportable business segment provides the sales, trading, origination and advisory effort for various fixed income,\nequity and advisory products and services. The Asset Management reportable business segment provides\ninvestment management services to investors in the U.S. and overseas and invests capital in hedge funds,\nseparately managed accounts and third-party asset managers.\nOur reportable business segment information is prepared using the following methodologies:\n• Net revenues and non-interest expenses directly associated with each reportable business segment are\nincluded in determining earnings (loss) before income taxes.\n• Net revenues and non-interest expenses not directly associated with specific reportable business\nsegments are allocated based on the most relevant measures applicable, including each reportable\nbusiness segment’s net revenues, headcount and other factors.\n• Reportable business segment assets include an allocation of indirect corporate assets that have been fully\nallocated to our reportable business segments, generally based on each reportable business segment’s\ncapital utilization.\n170\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued\nNote 23.

      "text": "Jefferies Financial Group Inc.\n(Parent Company Only)\nNotes to Condensed Financial Statements\nNote 1. Introduction and Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying condensed financial statements (the ‘‘Parent Company Financial Statements’’), including the\nnotes thereto, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Jefferies Financial\nGroup Inc. (the ‘‘Company’’) and the notes thereto found in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended November 30, 2022. For purposes of these condensed financial statements, the Company’s\nwholly-owned and majority owned subsidiaries are accounted for using the equity method of accounting\n(‘‘equity method subsidiaries’’).\nOn November 1, 2022, Jefferies Group LLC was merged into the Company with the Company as the surviving\nentity. Prior to the merger, Jefferies Group LLC was a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Upon the\nmerger, the Company recognized the assets and liabilities of Jefferies Group LLC transferred into the Company\nat their carrying amounts. The merger of Jefferies Group LLC into the Company is deemed a transfer between\nentities under common control and constitutes a change in the reporting entity of the Company. Accordingly, the\nfinancial statements of the Company are combined retrospectively as if the merger of Jefferies Group LLC with\nand into the Company had occurred as of December 1, 2019. The transfer of the net assets of Jefferies Group\nLLC into the Company resulted in an increase in total assets of $8.06 billion and an increase in total liabilities of\n$8.06 billion at November 30, 2021. There was no impact to total common shareholders’ equity, net earnings\nattributable to the Company or comprehensive income attributable to the Company as a result of the net transfer.\nThe Parent Company Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (‘‘U.S. GAAP’’) for financial information. The significant accounting policies of the Parent\nCompany Financial Statements are those used by the Company on a consolidated basis, to the extent applicable.\nFor further information regarding the significant accounting policies refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies, in the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2022.\nThe Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities\nand the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity with\nU.S. GAAP. The most important of these estimates and assumptions relate to fair value measurements,\ncompensation and benefits, goodwill and intangible assets, the ability to realize deferred tax assets and the\nrecognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions. Although these and other estimates and assumptions are\nbased on the best available information, actual results could be materially different from these estimates.\nNote 2. Transactions with Subsidiaries\nThe Parent Company has transactions with its consolidated subsidiaries and certain other affiliated entities\ndetermined on an agreed upon basis and has guaranteed certain unsecured lines of credit and contractual\nobligations of certain equity method subsidiaries.\nNote 3. Guarantees\nIn the normal course of its business, the Parent Company issues guarantees in respect of obligations of certain of\nits wholly-owned subsidiaries under trading and other financial arrangements, including guarantees to various\ntrading counterparties and banks. The Parent Company records all derivative contracts and Financial instruments\nowned and Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased at fair value in its Consolidated Statements of Financial\nCondition.\nCertain of the Parent Company’s equity method subsidiaries are members of various exchanges and clearing\nhouses. In the normal course of business, the Parent Company provides guarantees to securities clearinghouses\nS-6"
    },

      "page_index": 204,
      "text": "and exchanges. These guarantees generally are required under the standard membership agreements, such that\nmembers are required to guarantee the performance of other members. Additionally, if a member becomes unable\nto satisfy its obligations to the clearinghouse, other members would be required to meet these shortfalls. To\nmitigate these performance risks, the exchanges and clearinghouses often require members to post collateral. The\nParent Company’s obligations under such guarantees could exceed the collateral amounts posted. The maximum\npotential liability under these arrangements cannot be quantified; however, the potential for the Parent Company\nto be required to make payments under such guarantees is deemed remote. Accordingly, no liability has been\nrecognized for these arrangements.\nThe Parent Company guarantees certain financing arrangements of subsidiaries. The maximum amount payable\nunder these guarantees is $876.2 million at November 30, 2022. For further information, refer to Note 16, Short-\nTerm Borrowings, and Note 17, Long-Term Debt, in the Company’s consolidated financial statements included\nin the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2022.\nS-7\nNotes to Condensed Financial Statements, continued\nNote 3.
