As a result, Adjusted EBITDA increased 51%, or $14.2 million, to $42.2 million.\n•\nNet Cash provided by Operating Activities increased 13% to $52.3 million.\n•\nWe returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders, investing $23.9 million to repurchase\n585,000 shares: and,\n•\nOur liquidity remained high. Even after investing the $23.9 million for share repurchases, we ended the year\nwith $75.5 million of liquidity.\nWe are extremely pleased by our accelerating revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth and the business’ momentum.\nPrior to the pandemic we talked about our ability to predictably generate high single digit revenue growth, while at the\nsame time achieving even more rapid growth in Adjusted EBITDA. We are really pleased to now be expecting to\nconsistently achieve at least low teens revenue growth, with the expectation that this growth will increase to\nmid-teens, and then high teens in the coming years, and with the expectation that a significant percentage of this\nstrong revenue growth will flow-through to even more rapid increases in Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Flow.\nThere are five key drivers underly these results. We would like to emphasize that while each of these drivers is\nimportant in any environment, we believe these drivers are even more important in uncertain and turbulent times like\nat present.\nDriver 1: The markets we have chosen to serve are very large, are growing significantly, and are highly\nfragmented. This provides us with enormous headroom for growth and the opportunity to earn a significant share of\nour chosen segments in these markets.\n2\nLetter to Shareholders\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

The\nopportunities and challenges we help our clients address – challenges that require the collective action of large\nnumbers of people – are ‘‘must win’’ for organizations. These are durable and enduring challenges. This provides us\nwith the opportunity to not only partner with our organizational clients and schools in good times, but to become\neven more important to them in challenging times.\nDriver 3: The ongoing strength of our subscription business model. Because of the importance of the challenges\nwe help organizations address, and because organizations are typically needing to address several of these challenges\nsimultaneously, seven years ago we moved to a subscription model so that our clients could have access to the full\nstrength and breadth of our powerful solutions.\nAAP Subscription & Subscription Services\n(in millions and unaudited)\nFY 2016\nFY 2017\nFY 2018\nFY 2019\nFY 2020\nFY 2021\nFY 2022\n13.7\n33.8\n60.3\n81.5\n90.5\n112.5\n144.5\nThis subscription model combines our unique strengths, which include our: (a) best-in-class content; (b) ability to\nprovide clients with the broadest range of impactful delivery options across almost any combination of modalities;\n(c) global sales and delivery reach; and (d) strength, reach and impact of our thought leadership.\nTogether they have proven to be a powerful engine that has driven and is driving accelerated growth; is significantly\nincreasing the predictability and durability of our revenue; and is creating a high flow- through of increases in revenue\nto growth in profitability and cash flow.\nDriver 4: We will take advantage of compelling opportunities to accelerate our growth. The combination of:\n(1) the large and growing markets we serve; (2) the importance of the challenges we help our clients address; and\n(3) the strength of our business model is creating exciting opportunities to further accelerate our growth. We have\nmade and are making significant ongoing investments in new content in technology and in the growth of our direct\nsales force which now exceeds 300 salespeople, or client partners, and is expected to grow to 340 client partners by the\nend of fiscal 2023.\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nLetter to Shareholders\n3"

We have invested this free cash flow\nat high rates of return both in the business, and in returning capital to shareholders through substantial share\nrepurchases. We expect to continue to generate significant amounts of free cash flow in the coming years and expect\nto be able to continue to invest this cash to create significant additional shareholder value.\nIn conclusion, we anticipate our subscription business to continue to achieve significant top and bottom line growth\nin fiscal 2023 and well into the future, and for substantially all our business to become subscription and subscription\nservices over the next few years. As this occurs, we expect to: (a) achieve accelerated growth in revenue, Adjusted\nEBITDA and cash flow; (b) substantially increase our number of clients – clients who go on to become ‘‘clients for\nlife;’’ and (c) ensure that FranklinCovey makes accelerated progress toward its goal of being ‘‘the workplace of choice\nfor achievers with heart.’’\nWe are grateful to our associates and partners all over the world for their tremendous efforts on behalf of our clients.\nWe thank you, our shareholders, for the trust you have extended to us. We are committed to ensuring that your trust\nis well-placed.\nWe wish you all a great 2023, a year in which you and your families are safe, well, and happy, and one in which we\nexpect FranklinCovey’s progress to accelerate even further.\nWith gratitude,\nPaul Walker\nPresident & CEO\nFranklin Covey Co.\nStephen D.

      "text": "What is the difference between a shareholder of record and a ‘‘street name’’ holder?\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with Broadridge, our stock transfer agent, you are considered a\nshareholder of record with respect to those shares. If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or\nother nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of those shares, but not the shareholder of record, and your\nshares are held in ‘‘street name.’’ You are entitled to vote your shares whether you are the shareholder of record or you\nhold the shares in street name.\nHow can you vote?\nYou may submit your proxy by mail, telephone, or the Internet. If you are submitting your proxy by mail, you should\ncomplete, sign, and date your proxy card and return it in the envelope provided. Sign your name exactly as it appears\non the proxy card. If you plan to vote by telephone or the Internet, voting instructions are printed on your proxy card.\nIf you hold your shares through an account with a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, please follow the\ninstructions you receive from them to vote your shares. If you provide specific voting instructions, your shares will be\nvoted as you have instructed. Proxy cards submitted by mail must be received by our voting tabulator no later than\nThursday, January 19, 2023 to be voted at the Annual Meeting. You may also vote in person at the Annual Meeting.\nWhat if I do not specify on my proxy card how I want my shares voted?\nShares of Common Stock which are entitled to be voted at the Annual Meeting and which are represented by properly\nexecuted proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on such proxies. If no instructions are\nindicated, such shares will be voted (i) FOR the election of each of the seven director nominees (Proposal No. 1);\n(ii) FOR the proposal regarding an advisory vote on executive compensation (Proposal No. 2); (iii) FOR the\nratification of the appointment of Deloitte as our independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending\nAugust 31, 2023 (Proposal No. 3); and in the discretion of the proxy holders as to any other matters as may properly\ncome before the Annual Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. It is not currently anticipated that\nany other matters will be presented at the Annual Meeting.\nWhat is ‘‘householding?’’\nWe are sending only one notice or one copy of our proxy materials to shareholders who share the same last name and\naddress, unless they have notified us that they want to receive multiple copies. This practice, known as ‘‘householding,’’\nis designed to reduce duplicate mailings, and printing and mailing costs. If any shareholder residing at such address\nwishes to receive a separate copy of our proxy materials in the future, or, if any shareholders sharing an address are\nreceiving multiple copies of our proxy materials and would like to request a single copy, they may contact the Office of\nthe Corporate Secretary at 2200 West Parkway Blvd., Salt Lake City, Utah 84119-2331.\nHow do I vote at the Annual Meeting?\nYou may vote in person by written ballot at the Annual Meeting. However, if your shares are held in street name, you\nmust bring a legal proxy or other proof from that broker, trust, bank, or other nominee of your beneficial ownership of\nthose shares as of the record date in order to vote at the Annual Meeting. If you vote by proxy and also attend the\nAnnual Meeting, you do not need to vote again at the Annual Meeting.\nWhat are broker non-votes?\nWhen a broker, bank, or other nominee has discretion to vote on one or more proposals at a meeting but does not\nhave discretion to vote on other matters at the meeting, the broker, bank, or other nominee will inform the inspector\nof election that it does not have the authority to vote on the ‘‘non-discretionary’’ matters with respect to shares held\nfor beneficial owners which did not provide voting instructions with respect to the ‘‘non-discretionary’’ matters. This\nsituation is commonly referred to as a ‘‘broker non-vote.’’\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nSolicitation of Proxies/Voting\n9"

      "text": "If my shares are held in street name, will my broker, bank or other nominee vote my shares for me?\nGenerally no. If you hold your shares in street name and do not give voting instructions to your broker, bank, or other\nnominee, then your broker, bank, or other nominee may only vote your shares with respect to ‘‘discretionary’’ matters,\nbut may not vote your shares with respect to ‘‘non-discretionary’’ matters. Each of our proposals, except for Proposal\nNo. 3, the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, are considered\n‘‘non-discretionary’’ matters. As a result, if you hold your shares in street name, your broker, bank, or other nominee\nwill not have discretion to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting, except for Proposal No. 3, if you do not provide\nvoting instructions. Accordingly, it is important that street name holders give instructions to their broker, bank, or\nother nominee by following the voting instructions received from their broker, banker, or other nominee.\nMay I revoke my vote prior to the Annual Meeting?\nYes. A shareholder who has completed a proxy may revoke it at any time prior to its exercise at the Annual Meeting by\nreturning a proxy bearing a later date, by filing with the Secretary of the Company, at the address set forth below, a\nwritten notice of revocation bearing a later date than the proxy being revoked, or by voting the Common Stock\ncovered thereby in person at the Annual Meeting.\nWhat is a Quorum?\nA quorum is the presence, in person or by proxy, of at least a majority of the shares of our Common Stock outstanding\nas of the close of business on the Record Date. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the Annual Meeting.\nAbstentions and ‘‘broker non-votes’’ will be included in determining the presence of a quorum at the Annual Meeting.\nHolders of common stock will vote as a single class. If there are not sufficient shares represented for a quorum, then\nthe Annual Meeting may be adjourned or postponed from time to time until a quorum is established.\nWhat Vote is Required for a Proposal to be Approved?\nSubject to the paragraph below, the seven nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares\nentitled to be voted for them, up to the seven directors to be elected by those shares, will be elected as directors to\nserve until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until their successors are duly elected and qualified.\nAbstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the election of directors.\nPursuant to the Company’s bylaws, any nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes ‘‘withheld’’ or\n‘‘against’’ from his or her election than votes ‘‘for’’ his or her election shall immediately offer to tender his or her\nresignation following certification of such shareholder vote. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee\n(the Nominating Committee) shall promptly consider the director’s resignation offer and make a recommendation to\nthe Board of Directors on whether to accept or reject the offer. The Board of Directors shall act on the\nrecommendation of the Nominating Committee and publicly disclose its decision within 90 days following\ncertification of the shareholder vote.\nApproval of Proposal No. 2, the advisory vote on executive compensation, requires that the number of votes cast in\nfavor of the proposal exceeds the number of votes cast in opposition. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not\nconsidered votes cast for the foregoing purpose and will not have any effect on the outcome of this proposal.\nThe ratification of the appointment of Deloitte as our independent registered public accountants (Proposal No. 3)\nrequires that the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceeds the number of votes cast in opposition.\nAbstentions and broker non-votes will not have any effect on the outcome of this proposal.\nWhat are the Board’s voting recommendations?\nThe Board of Directors recommends that you vote ‘‘FOR’’ proposal nos. 1, 2, and 3 as further described in this Proxy\nStatement.\nThe Company’s Principal Office and Main Telephone Number\nOur principal executive offices are located at 2200 West Parkway Blvd., Salt Lake City, Utah 84119-2331 and our main\ntelephone number is (801) 817-1776.\n10\nSolicitation of Proxies/Voting\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applies to\nall directors, officers, and employees of Franklin Covey.\nA feature of our corporate governance is that our standing committees are comprised of independent directors, as\ndiscussed below. We believe this structure allows for a collective focus by a majority of our independent directors on\nthe various complex matters that come before Board committees. The overlap inherent in this structure assists these\nindependent directors in the execution of their responsibilities.\nDiversity of Board Skills and Experience\nOur directors have significant experience with our business and are familiar with the risks and competition we face,\nwhich allow them to participate actively and effectively in Board and committee discussions and deliberations. Our\ndirectors meet and speak frequently with each other and with members of our senior management team. These formal\nmeetings and informal discussions occur based on the needs of our business and the market environment.\nThe Nominating Committee, in its board composition discussions, has focused on diversity of experience and\nperspectives in relation to guiding and overseeing the growth and development of our business. The Board believes\nthe skills, qualities, attributes, and experiences of its directors provide the Company with the business acumen and\nrange of perspectives to engage each other and management to effectively address our evolving needs and represent\nthe best interests of our shareholders. Consistent with our longstanding focus on diversity and inclusion, the\nNominating Committee believes our Board should reflect over time a diversity of gender, race, and age. Although we\ndo not have a formal policy on Board member diversity, and the Nominating Committee does not follow strict criteria\nwhen making decisions, we believe considering diversity is aligned with the Board’s objective of enhancing\ncomposition and available skills to most effectively evaluate and guide our strategy now and in the future. In addition\nto the considerations discussed in the ‘‘Director Nomination Process’’ section below, the Nominating Committee\nseeks Board candidates who have the ability to bring diversity to the Board, which includes diverse viewpoints and\nperspectives.\n12\nBoard of Directors and Corporate Governance\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

      "text": "Affirmative Determination Regarding Board Independence\nThe Board of Directors has determined each of the following directors to be an ‘‘independent director’’ under the\nlisting standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE): Anne H. Chow, Craig Cuffie, Donald J. McNamara, Nancy\nPhillips, and Derek van Bever.\nThe Company has engaged Ms. Anne H. Chow to deliver keynote addresses to clients and prospective clients on its\nbehalf. Ms. Chow will receive compensation for the speeches that she delivers. The Board of Directors has reviewed\nthe nature and amounts of expected compensation from these addresses and has determined that Ms. Chow will\nremain an independent director.\nIn assessing the independence of the directors, the Board of Directors determines whether or not any director has a\nmaterial relationship with us (either directly, or as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a\nrelationship with us). The Board of Directors considers all relevant facts and circumstances in making independence\ndeterminations, including the director independence standards adopted by the Board of Directors and the existence of\nrelated-party transactions as described in the section entitled ‘‘Certain Relationships and Related Transactions’’ found\nin this report.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nThe Board of Directors does not have a policy on whether the roles of Chairman and CEO should be separate or\ncombined. Following the September 1, 2021 appointment of Robert A. Whitman as Executive Chairman and\nChairman of the Board and Paul S. Walker as Chief Executive Officer, these roles are no longer combined. Drawing on\nMr. Whitman’s capabilities, broad experience, and extensive knowledge of the Company and its operations, his\nresponsibilities as Executive Chairman have included:\n•\nAdvising the Company and the new CEO during the transition of the Chief Executive Officer;\n•\nFocusing his efforts on corporate strategy, innovations, key financial matters, and capital transactions;\n•\nAttending meetings with Company leadership, business partners, employees, and others as requested by the CEO\nor the Board;\n•\nAssisting the Board with its oversight of the Company’s risks;\n•\nCommunicating with both internal and external stakeholders, as appropriate;\n•\nActing as a primary liaison between the Board and management; and\n•\nCreating tight alignment between the Board and management as to the Company’s strategic direction, and\nsupporting the execution of the Company’s strategy.\nWe believe Mr. Whitman’s leadership and previous experience with the Company and its operations will enable him\nto provide meaningful contributions in the Executive Chairman role. Our Board regularly assesses the roles of Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chairman of the Board, and deliberates the merits of its leadership structure to ensure that the\nmost efficient and appropriate structure is in place. The Board of Directors has determined that if the Chairman of the\nBoard is not an independent director, then there should be a Lead Independent Director.\nUltimately, we believe that our current leadership structure, combined with strong governance practices, creates a\nproductive relationship between our Board and management, including strong independent oversight that benefits\nour shareholders. As CEO, Mr. Walker is directly accountable to our Board and, through our Board, to our\nshareholders. Mr. Whitman’s role as Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board is also directly accountable to\nthe Board and to our shareholders. We believe Mr. Whitman’s role is both counterbalanced and enhanced by the\noverall independence of the Board and independent leadership provided by our Lead Independent Director, Ms. Anne\nH. Chow. Ms. Chow, as Chair of our Nominating Committee, was designated as the Lead Independent Director by our\nBoard. Our independent directors may elect another independent director as Lead Independent Director at any time.\nMr. Walker, Mr. Whitman, and Ms. Chow meet and speak frequently regarding our Board and our Company.\n18\nCorporate Governance\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

      "text": "The Board of Director’s Role in Risk Management Oversight\nThe Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has responsibility for the oversight of risk management, while our\nmanagement team is responsible for the day-to-day risk management process. With the oversight of the Board of\nDirectors, management has developed an enterprise risk management strategy, whereby management identifies the\ntop individual risks that we face with respect to our business, operations, strategy, and other factors that were\nrecognized after discussions with key business and functional leaders and reviews of external information. In addition\nto evaluating various key risks, management identifies ways to manage and mitigate such risks. During fiscal 2022, our\nmanagement met regularly with the Audit Committee to discuss the identified risks and the efforts that are designed\nto mitigate and manage these risks. These risks are allocated to the various committees of the Board of Directors to\nallow the committees to examine a particular risk in detail and assess its potential impact to our operations. For\nexample, the Audit Committee reviews compliance and risk management processes and practices related to\naccounting and financial reporting matters; the Nominating Committee reviews the risks related to succession\nplanning and the independence of the Board of Directors; and the Organization and Compensation Committee\nreviews the risks related to our various compensation plans. In the event that a committee is allocated responsibility\nfor examining and analyzing a specific risk, such committee reports on the relevant risk exposure during its regular\nreports to the entire Board of Directors.\nAs part of its responsibilities, the Organization and Compensation Committee periodically reviews our compensation\npolicies and programs to ensure that the compensation programs offer appropriate performance incentives for\nemployees, including executive officers, while mitigating excessive risk taking. We believe that our various\ncompensation programs contain provisions that discourage excessive risk taking. These provisions include:\n•\nAn appropriate balance between annual cash compensation and equity compensation that may be earned over\nseveral years.\n•\nMetrics that are weighted between the achievement of overall financial goals and individual objectives.\n•\nStock ownership guidelines that encourage executive officers to accumulate meaningful levels of equity\nownership, which align the interests of executives with those of long-term shareholders.\nBased on a review of the nature of our operations by the Organization and Compensation Committee, we do not\nbelieve that any areas of the Company are incented to take excessive risks that would likely have a material adverse\neffect on our operations.\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nCorporate Governance\n19"

Our Growth and\nInnovations Committee is designed to: 1) assist our management with strategic guidance over growth initiatives and\nthe execution of these initiatives to drive increased sales and shareholder return; and 2) provide strategic direction in\nour efforts to expand our content and offerings into areas that will provide meaningful results for clients and new\ngrowth opportunities.\nMr. van Bever is the Chair of the Growth and Innovations Committee and is joined by Ms. Chow, Mr. Cuffie, and\nMs. Phillips as members of this committee. We believe the experience and skills of these directors provides valuable\nstrategic direction to the Company’s ongoing growth and innovation objectives.\nCommitment of our Directors\nOur Board and its standing committees met regularly during fiscal 2022 as shown below.\nMeetings\nBoard\n4\nAudit\n7\nNominating\n4\nCompensation\n5\nIn addition to the formal meetings shown above, our Board regularly participated in informal update calls with\nmembers of our executive management as necessary throughout fiscal 2022.\nOur Lead Independent Director plays an active role on our Board of Directors.

Although we encourage Board members to attend our Annual Meeting, we do\nnot have a formal policy regarding director attendance at our annual shareholder meetings. Seven members of our\nBoard of Directors were available for questions at our most recent annual meeting of shareholders, which was held in\nJanuary 2022.\nDirector Nomination Process\nAs indicated above, the Nominating Committee oversees the director nomination process. The Nominating\nCommittee is responsible for identifying and evaluating candidates for membership on the Board of Directors and\nrecommending to the Board of Directors nominees to stand for election. Each candidate to serve on the Board of\nDirectors must be able to fulfill the responsibilities for directors set out in the Corporate Governance Guidelines\napproved by the Board of Directors. These Corporate Governance Guidelines may be found on our website at\nwww.franklincovey.com. In addition to the qualifications set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, nominees\nfor director will be selected on the basis of such attributes as their integrity, experience, achievements, judgment,\nintelligence, personal character, ability to make independent analytical inquiries, willingness to devote adequate time\nto Board duties, and the likelihood that he or she will be able to serve on the Board for a sustained period. In\nconnection with the selection of nominees for director, consideration will be given to the Board’s overall balance of\ndiversity of perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences. We believe it is important to have an appropriate mix of\ndiversity for the optimal functionality of the Board of Directors. Although we do not have a formal diversity policy\nrelating to the identification and evaluation of nominees for director, the Nominating Committee considers all of the\ncriteria described above in identifying and selecting nominees and in the future may establish additional minimum\ncriteria for nominees.\nAlthough not an automatically disqualifying factor, the inability of a director candidate to meet independence\nstandards of the NYSE will weigh negatively in any assessment of a candidate’s suitability.\nThe Nominating Committee intends to use a variety of means of identifying nominees for director, including outside\nsearch firms, recommendations from current Board members, and recommendations from shareholders. In\ndetermining whether to nominate a candidate, the Nominating Committee will consider the current composition and\ncapabilities of serving Board members, as well as additional capabilities considered necessary or desirable in light of\nexisting Company needs and then assess the need for new or additional members to provide those capabilities.\nUnless well known to one or more members of the Nominating Committee, normally at least one member of the\nNominating Committee will interview a prospective candidate who is identified as having high potential to satisfy the\nexpectations, requirements, qualities, and capabilities for Board membership.\nShareholder Nominations\nThe Nominating Committee, will consider, but shall not be required to nominate, candidates recommended by our\nshareholders who beneficially own at the time of the recommendation not less than one percent of our outstanding\nstock (Qualifying Shareholders).\nGenerally speaking, the manner in which the Nominating Committee evaluates nominees for director recommended\nby a Qualifying Shareholder will be the same as for nominees from other nominating sources. However, the\nNominating Committee will seek and consider information concerning the relationship between a Qualifying\nShareholder’s nominee and that Qualifying Shareholder to determine whether the nominee can effectively represent\nthe interests of all shareholders.\nQualifying Shareholders wishing to make recommendations to the Nominating Committee for its consideration may\ndo so by submitting a written recommendation, including detailed information on the proposed candidate, including\neducation, professional experience, and expertise, via mail addressed as follows:\nFranklin Covey Co.\nc/o Stephen D.

We stand firmly against racism and discrimination and we expect our associates to create\nenvironments of acceptance and contribution as we teach in our Unconscious Bias offering. Our goal is to have every\nassociate feel they are a valued member of a winning team doing meaningful work in an environment of trust. To\naccomplish this goal, we are focused on attracting, developing, and retaining talent while looking through the lens of\ndiversity, equity, and inclusion in each area.\nIn January 2021, we established the new position of Director of Learning, Development, and Inclusion. This position is\nresponsible for the internal learning and development of our associates in ways that align with our strategic plans for\ngrowth. In addition, we established the Franklin Covey Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Council, which is comprised of\napproximately 35 associates from across our organization who are tasked with monitoring and implementing\ndiversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at all levels within the Company. Franklin Covey also sponsors an increasing\nnumber of Employee Resource Groups, which are groups of employees who come together based on a shared interest\nin a specific dimension of diversity. Our global ERG network spans varying dimensions of diversity and is open to all\nassociates. These ERGs are a cornerstone of our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. We believe our ERGs represent\nand support our diverse workforce, facilitate networking and connections with peers, and create a culture of inclusion\nand engagement within the organization.\nWe believe the diverse and global makeup of our workforce allows us to successfully serve a variety of clients with\ndifferent needs on a worldwide basis.\nWe also remain steadfast in our commitment to recruiting and developing Black, Indigenous, and People of Color\n(BIPOC) associates. From June 1, 2021, through May 31, 2022, 31 percent of our new hires were BIPOC associates. In\nan effort to increase the population of BIPOC associates, we have expanded our recruitment efforts. We hope to\nincrease the number of BIPOC applicants to ensure we are hiring the most qualified people while increasing our\ndiversity. We are also actively engaged in ensuring that our associate promotions are fair and equitable.\nThrough our ongoing associate development efforts, from June 1, 2021, to May 31, 2022, over 73 percent of our\npromotions awarded were to women and more than 29 percent of promotions were awarded to BIPOC associates. As\nof June 1, 2022, 47 percent of all Vice Presidents within Franklin Covey are women.\nFor more information on our Human Capital resources, refer to Item 1 in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nAugust 31, 2022 as filed with the SEC on November 14, 2022.\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nEnvironmental Stewardship, Social Responsibility, and Governance\n25"

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly\nand effectively transitioned more than 90 percent of our associates to remote work and worked diligently to adhere to\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health professional guidance to ensure that we implemented\nbest practices to protect the safety of colleagues while continuing to serve clients, partners, and other stakeholders. We\nbelieve these actions have been effective during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nSupporting Our Communities\nWe strongly believe that the benefits of our success and scale should enrich our stakeholders, including the\ncommunities in which we operate. We are committed to being responsible global and corporate citizens by positively\ncontributing to the communities in which we work and live.\nIn September 2022, we held our second annual International Day of Service, which was focused on feeding the hungry\nand distribution of food to the less fortunate.

We are likely to retain some degree of this change in the future. In addition, the\nmajority of our workforce now works from home, which reduces our carbon footprint and congestion of roadways.\nOur training materials are available in digital or paper-based formats. If a client chooses to use printed materials, we\nseek to source our training materials from suppliers which are environmentally responsible. In addition, our materials\nare primarily comprised of paper, which we believe is a sustainable and renewable resource.\nStakeholder Engagement: Extending our Reach\nWe seek to create deeper partnerships with organizations to drive and advance our purpose of enabling greatness in\npeople and organizations throughout the world. As a result, we engage with the following stakeholders:\n•\nClients and potential clients, including schools\n•\nShareholders and potential shareholders\n•\nAssociates and potential associates\n•\nSuppliers/Vendors\nWe believe our efforts in the ESG arena will promote and create positive differences in our associates and the\ncommunities in which we live and operate.

Prior to the acquisition date, CoveyLink granted us a non-exclusive license related to The Speed of\nTrust book and related training courses for which we paid CoveyLink specified royalties. As part of the CoveyLink\nacquisition, we obtained an amended and restated license of intellectual property that granted us an exclusive,\nperpetual, worldwide, transferable, royalty-bearing license to use, sell, and perform the licensed material in any format\nor medium and through any market or distribution channel. The amount expensed for these royalties to Stephen\nM.R. Covey under the amended and restated license agreement totaled $1.8 million during the fiscal year ended\nAugust 31, 2022. In connection with the CoveyLink acquisition, we also signed a speaking services agreement that\npays Stephen M.R. Covey a portion of the speaking revenues received for his presentations.

Walker – President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO);\n•\nStephen D. Young – Chief Financial Officer (CFO);\n•\nRobert A. Whitman – Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board of Directors;\n•\nM. Sean Covey – President of the Education Division; and\n•\nJennifer C. Colosimo – President of the Enterprise Division.\nOverview\nThis Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) describes in detail:\n•\nThe guiding principles, philosophy, and objectives of our executive compensation program, including\nshareholder-minded compensation practices we employ;\n•\nOur fiscal 2022 executive compensation program; and\n•\nActual compensation earned by or provided to our NEOs as required by SEC rules.\nEffective September 1, 2021, Mr. Whitman, the Company’s Chairman and CEO during fiscal 2021, transitioned to the\nrole of Executive Chairman. Mr. Walker began serving as the Company’s President and CEO on that date.\nWe begin this CD&A with a short summary of our basic approach to executive compensation and our financial results\nfor fiscal 2022.\nBasic Elements of and Approach to Executive Compensation at Franklin Covey\nThe basic elements of compensation for our executives, including our NEOs, are salary, annual cash incentive\ncompensation based on progress against specified performance metrics, which we call ‘‘STIP’’ (short-term incentive\nplan) awards, time and performance-based equity awards, which we call ‘‘LTIP’’ (long-term incentive plan) awards,\nand employee benefits, including retirement and severance benefits. The Compensation Committee of our Board of\nDirectors sets salaries and STIP metrics at the beginning of each year and considers LTIP awards annually.\nWe are a people business. We take what we believe to be a rigorous pay-for-performance approach. Accordingly, the\nkey elements of compensation are similar in structure for all employees within our various geographic regions. In\nrecent years, we have increased the percentage of pay that is based on performance and performance-measured\ncompensation for more senior roles, including our NEOs, to further align executive pay with shareholder interests. We\nhave also adopted many compensation policies that we believe to be shareholder minded. As a result, we are pleased\nto have again received overwhelming support from shareholders in our annual ‘‘say-on-pay’’ votes, including an over\n97% approval for our say-on-pay vote in fiscal 2022.\nFiscal 2022 Performance\nAs a result of our continued transition to a subscription-based model, performance for fiscal 2022 was very strong and\nexceeded expectations:\n•\nOur consolidated revenue increased 17% year-over-year to $262.8 million.\n•\nOur adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) increased 51%\nyear-over-year to $42.2 million.\nThis strong performance reflects the continuation and acceleration of key trends, including the following: (1) our\nEnterprise Division sales grew 15% to $194.4 million in fiscal 2022; (2) our Education Division sales grew 26% to\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\n29"

      "text": "$61.9 million in fiscal 2022; and (3) we achieved significant increases in All Access Pass deferred revenue within our\ninternational operations that will increase the reported results for these operations in the future. In North America,\nAll Access Pass subscription and subscription services sales now account for 88% of total sales and are expected to\ncontinue increasing over the next few years. We also anticipate All Access Pass and subscription services to make up\nthe majority of our sales in our international operations in the coming years.\nShareholder-Minded Compensation Practices\nThe Compensation Committee regularly reviews and considers the views of shareholders and proxy advisory firms on\ncorporate pay practices. In this regard, we reach out to key shareholders to solicit their views on executive\ncompensation and consider the results of our annual say-on-pay vote. Taking these and other inputs into account, the\nCompensation Committee has implemented and maintains the following policies:\n•\nClawback Policy – The Board has authority to require reimbursement of any STIP or LTIP payment made to an\nexecutive officer where: (1) the payment was based on achieving financial results that were subsequently the\nsubject of a substantial restatement of Company financial statements filed with the SEC; (2) the Board determines\nthe executive engaged in misconduct that caused the need for the substantial restatement; and (3) a lower\npayment would have been made to the executive based on the restated financial results. In such an instance, the\nCompany expects that it will seek to recover from the individual executive the amount by which the individual\nexecutive’s incentive payments for the relevant period exceeded the lower payment that would have been made\nbased on the restated financial results. We note that, in light of the SEC’s adoption of final clawback rules in\nOctober 2022, our clawback policy is expected to change when necessary in order to comply with final stock\nexchange listing standards.\n•\nHedging Policy – Our directors and executive officers are prohibited from buying or selling publicly traded\noptions, puts, calls or other derivative instruments related to Company stock. All other employees are\ndiscouraged from engaging in hedging transactions related to Company stock.\n•\nNo Option Repricing Without Shareholder Approval – Our equity plans expressly prohibit option repricing\nwithout shareholder approval.\n•\nNo Excise Tax Gross-ups – Excise tax gross-ups for our NEOs are prohibited.\n•\nStock Ownership Guidelines – Our stock ownership guidelines require an ownership threshold of five times\nbase salary for our CEO, three times base salary for our CFO and two times base salary for our other NEOs. Each\nNEO is targeted to reach the applicable threshold within five years of the policy becoming applicable to the NEO\nand from the date the NEO first has shares awarded as part of their annual compensation. NEOs are prohibited\nfrom selling any shares until after these established guidelines are met. The Compensation Committee annually\nreviews executives’ progress toward meeting these guidelines. For fiscal 2022, the stock ownership of Mr. Young,\nMr. Whitman, and Mr. Covey met or exceeded the applicable threshold, and Mr. Walker and Ms. Colosimo are\nalso currently expected to meet their ownership threshold within the allotted time.\nIn addition to the stock ownership guidelines for our NEOs, a Board policy requires that each director who is not\nan employee of the Company maintain beneficial ownership of the Company’s common stock and/or vested\nrestricted stock units (RSUs), equal in value to at least five times the annual Board cash retainer at all times\nduring his or her tenure on the Board.

Over 97% of the votes cast were in favor of the compensation of our NEOs. Considering its\nongoing shareholder-minded compensation policies, discussions with advisors and the indications of this vote, our\nBoard of Directors and the Compensation Committee considered and discussed this shareholder vote result during\nfiscal 2022 and determined not to make significant changes to the existing program for fiscal 2022 in response to\nshareholder feedback. The Compensation Committee expects to periodically explore various executive pay and\ncorporate governance changes to the extent appropriate to keep our executive compensation program aligned with\nbest practices in our competitive market and the Company’s particular circumstances, keeping shareholder views in\nmind. The Compensation Committee intends to continue holding say-on-pay votes with shareholders on an annual\nbasis, consistent with our shareholders’ recommendation.\nGuiding Philosophy, Principles and Objectives of our Executive Compensation Program\nTo fulfill our mission and implement our strategy, Franklin Covey must attract, motivate, and retain highly qualified\nemployees. We achieve this objective, in part, through working to achieve both a winning culture and a competitive\nperformance-based total compensation program. We align our executives’ interests with those of our shareholders by\ntying STIP and LTIP compensation to the Company’s achievement of key measures of growth and key strategic\nobjectives.\nWe believe variable, performance-based compensation should constitute a significant percentage of our executives’\noverall compensation opportunity. All executive base salary, STIP, and LTIP compensation is designed to be\nmarket-based. Variable cash incentive pay and LTIP pay are linked to, and designed to reward the achievement of,\nspecific performance targets.\nThe philosophy and objectives of our executive compensation program are reflected in the compensation principles\nlisted below, which guide the Compensation Committee in its oversight of our compensation practices and plans. The\nspecific objectives of our executive compensation program are to reward achievement of our strategic and annual\nbusiness plans and to link a major portion of pay directly to performance. The key principles that guide the\nCompensation Committee are that the Company’s executive compensation program should:\n•\nReflect Performance: We establish multi-year objectives for the Company relating to both growth and the\nachievement of key strategic objectives to align compensation with performance over both the short and long\nterm. Annual performance targets are established in the context of these multi-year objectives, and for fiscal 2022\nconsisted primarily of goals for growth in revenue, new business, Adjusted EBITDA, and deferred revenue. NEO\nperformance pay levels for the year are generally determined by assessing the Company’s level of achievement\ncompared to these objectives. Since our NEOs are responsible for overall Company performance against these\nobjectives, their compensation can vary (and has varied) significantly from year to year.\n•\nEncourage Long-Term Company-Wide Focus: We believe that compensation should encourage and reward both\nthe achievement of annual objectives and longer-term, Company-wide performance improvement. We use a\nservice-based and performance-based award program to focus NEO efforts on long-term growth in shareholder\nvalue. We believe that paying a significant portion of variable compensation to our NEOs in the form of\nequity-based compensation that vests over a period of time, based on performance, also encourages a long-term,\nCompany-wide focus. Value is realized through delivering results today, but in a way that builds the foundation\nfor delivering even stronger results in the future. We believe that this practice will lead to our NEOs having a\nconsiderable investment in our shares over time. This investment in turn advances both a culture of teamwork\nand partnership and encourages a stewardship mentality for the Company among our key leaders.\n•\nAttract and Retain Talent: We understand the importance of hiring and retaining the best people. Retention of\ntalented employees is critical to successfully executing our business strategy. We seek to be what we refer to\ninternally as ‘‘the workplace of choice for achievers with heart.’’ Successful execution of our business strategy\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\n31"

For us, compensation is not just an overhead expense; it is a key component of\nthe investments we make and costs we incur to generate our revenues. In determining the compensation of our\nNEOs and in reviewing the effectiveness of our compensation program for attracting and retaining talent, the\nCompensation Committee generally considers the competitive market for talent. We believe that our\ncompensation programs should enable us to attract and retain talented people and incentivize them to contribute\ntheir finest talents to achieving our objectives. We are pleased that, even in the context of the very demanding\nresults they must achieve, our executive officers have an average tenure of over 22 years with our Company\n(ranging from one to 36 years).\nIn addition to aligning our compensation programs with the achievement of objectives that drive shareholder value,\nthe Compensation Committee also considers the consistency of our compensation programs and works to ensure that\nour variable compensation does not encourage imprudent risk-taking. We have determined that our Company’s\napproach to the compensation process addresses the need to balance prudence with performance through a\ncombination of:\n•\nControls on the allocation and overall management of risk-taking;\n•\nComprehensive profit and loss and other management information, that provides ongoing performance feedback;\n•\nRigorous, multi-party performance assessments and compensation decisions; and\n•\nA Company-wide compensation structure that strives to meet industry best practice standards, including a\nbusiness model that is based on compensating our associates in direct proportion to the revenue and profit\ncontribution they generate.\nOur compensation framework seeks to balance risk and reward. Our executive team is involved in identifying relevant\nrisks and performance metrics for our business. We work to create a cadence of accountability within our organization\nthrough continuous evaluation and measurement of performance compared to what we refer to internally as our\n‘‘Wildly Important Goals’’ of achieving profitable growth, meeting strategic objectives, and building a winning culture.\nBased on the considerations discussed above, in connection with its compensation decisions for fiscal 2022, our\nCompensation Committee concluded that our Company’s compensation program and policies are structured such\nthat they do not encourage imprudent risk-taking, and that there are no risks arising from such programs and policies\nthat are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nAnalysis of Fiscal 2022 Compensation Decisions and Actions\nFiscal 2022 Executive Compensation Determination Process\nThe Compensation Committee determined the form and amount of fixed compensation and established specific\nperformance metrics for determining year-end variable compensation to be awarded to our NEOs for fiscal 2022\nconsidering: (1) our financial performance over the prior year and past several years and expectations for fiscal 2022;\n(2) the individual and collective performance of our NEOs relative to the achievement of metric-based strategic\nobjectives related to growth in key areas; and (3) compensation in connection with our goal of attracting and retaining\nthe best talent. In particular, the Compensation Committee reviewed at a general level the following financial metrics\nand related growth rates in connection with making its key compensation decisions:\n•\nRevenue;\n•\nAdjusted EBITDA and operating income;\n•\nMulti-year changes in operating income, Adjusted EBITDA and specific revenue targets;\n•\nAchieving high rates of revenue retention for subscription-based revenue; and\n•\nOverall performance, while still continuing through challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n32\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

Our CEO submitted year-end variable\ncompensation calculations (certified by our CFO) and recommendations to the Committee for our other executives,\nincluding the NEOs. These calculations and recommendations precisely followed the payout guidelines established for\nincentive compensation relating to financial performance.\nGeneral Market Assessment: Our Compensation Committee evaluates our NEO compensation program at a high level\nagainst market practices. In fiscal 2022, the Committee asked Mercer, the Committee’s compensation consultant, to\nassess our NEO compensation program, identify considerations that could inform compensation decisions, and advise\nas to current market practices, trends, and plan designs. Mercer reviewed data from its own research and databases\nand used this information primarily as supplemental data to assist the Compensation Committee in understanding\ncurrent market practices related to executive compensation. Mercer has advised us that our compensation program\n(1) contains features that reinforce significant alignment with shareholders and a long-term focus, (2) blends\nsubjective assessment and policies in a way that addresses known and perceived risks at levels consistent with market\ncompensation for similar-sized and comparable professional services and content companies, and (3) has been aligned\nwith corporate performance.\nThe Compensation Committee has assessed Mercer’s independence, as required under NYSE rules, and considered\nand assessed all relevant factors, including those required by the SEC that could give rise to a potential conflict of\ninterest during fiscal 2022. The Compensation Committee did not identify any conflicts of interest raised by the work\nperformed by Mercer.\nIn making pay decisions for fiscal 2022, the Compensation Committee considered how executive compensation\nshould drive desired performance toward our business objectives. The Compensation Committee also considered the\nspecific business opportunities and challenges facing the Company compared to those of our competitors and\nsimilar-sized companies. However, the Compensation Committee did not specifically benchmark elements of\ncompensation when making its fiscal 2022 executive compensation decisions. Finally, the Compensation Committee\ngenerally considered the past performance of our NEOs, including performance against previous individual and\ncorporate objectives, expected contribution to future corporate objectives and whether the NEOs’ performance was\nachieved consistent with our governing values. The Compensation Committee made final judgments regarding the\nappropriate compensation level for each NEO based on these additional inputs.\nThe following peer group was used for fiscal 2022. These companies were selected based on size, industry, and types of\nprofessional services offered. The list of peers remains similar to those selected in fiscal 2021 but with the removal of\nGP Strategies Corporation which was acquired by another organization. Changes in the peer group are occasionally\nmade to achieve the most accurate comparison. Annual revenues for the peer group, which is one of the factors\nconsidered in selecting the peers, range from approximately $100 million to $1.0 billion. The data for this peer group\nwas regressed due to the overall revenue of the peer group, to be more comparable with our revenue. With our fiscal\n2022 revenues totaling approximately $263 million, we believe with the previously stated regression, this peer group is\nappropriate for comparative purposes. This peer group is one of many tools used by the Compensation Committee for\nassessing executive compensation and was comprised of the following companies for fiscal 2022:\n•\nComputer Task Group, Inc.\n•\nCRA International, Inc.\n•\nExponent, Inc.\n•\nForrester Research, Inc.\n•\nThe Hackett Group, Inc.\n•\nHealthStream, Inc.\n•\nHeidrick & Struggles International, Inc.\n•\nHuron Consulting Group, Inc.\n•\nInformation Services Group, Inc.\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\n33"

Based on the key factors described above, along with our expected\ngrowth, the Compensation Committee established fiscal 2022 total compensation targets of $1.6 million for our CEO\nand $1.0 million, on average, for our other NEOs, assuming achievement of targeted results under our STIP and LTIP.\nThese calculations exclude book royalty payments made to Mr. Covey, as noted in the Fiscal 2022 Summary\nCompensation Table.\nTotal Compensation Mix: The following charts identify the fiscal 2022 target compensation mix for our CEO and\naverage mix for our other NEOs.\n2022 Target Compensation Mix (CEO)\n2022 Average Target Compensation Mix (Other NEOs)\n31%\n46%\n23%\n32%\n45%\n23%\nBase Salary\nStock Awards (LTIP RSUs)\nPerformance-Based Cash Variable Pay\n(STIP)\nIn particular, the Compensation Committee gave consideration to our CEO’s base pay, which affects his overall\ncompensation level, against a peer set which includes companies that are substantially larger by revenues than\nFranklin Covey and considered this in setting his compensation levels.\nBase Salaries\nThe Company pays a base salary to each of our NEOs to provide a base level of fixed income for services rendered.\nThe Compensation Committee annually reviews base salary market data and if appropriate, will adjust base salaries to\nremain at competitive levels. The Committee continues to emphasize performance-based variable pay as the primary\nmeans by which NEOs may increase their total compensation absent increases in responsibilities. Effective\nSeptember 1, 2021, in connection with Mr. Whitman’s transition from Chief Executive Officer to Executive Chairman\nand Chairman of the Board of Directors, his annual base salary rate was reduced from $500,000 to $200,000, and\nMr. Walker’s annual base salary rate was increased from $425,000 to $500,000 to reflect his appointment to his new\nrole.

Effective September 1, 2021, in connection with Mr. Whitman’s transition\nfrom Chief Executive Officer to Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board of Directors, his target STIP payout\nopportunity was reduced from $575,000, and Mr. Walker’s target STIP payout opportunity was increased from\n$284,750 to reflect his appointment to his new role.

The STIP reinforces our strong pay-for-performance philosophy and rewards the achievement of\nspecific business and financial goals during the fiscal year. STIP opportunities can range from 0% to 200% of target\nbased on performance.\nFinancial Performance Component (70%): The threshold necessary for NEOs to earn 100% of the financial\nperformance component of their target STIP payout in fiscal 2022 was an increase in Qualified Adjusted EBITDA to\n$30 million, compared to $28.0 million for the previous fiscal year. Qualified Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as\nreported Adjusted EBITDA which is adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange and potentially other items.\nThe Company uses Qualified Adjusted EBITDA in its analysis and decision-making because it provides information\nthat facilitates consistent internal comparisons to the historical operating performance of prior periods, and we\nbelieve the measure provides greater transparency to evaluate operational activities and financial results. Qualified\nAdjusted EBITDA is also the primary measure by which internal business segment performance is evaluated and is\nregularly communicated to our analysts. Refer to the table in Appendix A for the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\nto consolidated net income (loss), a comparable GAAP financial measure.\nIn fiscal 2022, Qualified Adjusted EBITDA was $42.2 million, which exceeded the $30 million threshold, and was\n51% higher than the $28.0 million achieved in fiscal 2021. This performance resulted in a payout of 200% of the 70%\nfinancial performance component (a maximum payout of the financial performance component of the STIP).\nThe following table shows the potential payouts to our NEOs based on the degree of attainment of fiscal 2022 STIP\nQualified Adjusted EBITDA objectives (and assuming metric-based executive team performance objectives were\nachieved). Pro-rata calculations are on a straight-line basis between the performance levels.\nPotential payouts for fiscal 2022 STIP Qualified Adjusted EBITDA objectives (70%)\nQualified Adjusted\nEBITDA less than\n$25.0 million and not\nmeeting performance\nobjectives\nIf Qualified Adjusted\nEBITDA as calculated\nwas > $25.0 million\nand< $30.0 million and\nmeeting performance\nobjectives\nTargeted Qualified\nAdjusted EBITDA of\n$30.0 million and\nmeeting performance\nobjectives\nIf Qualified Adjusted\nEBITDA (including STIP\nexpense) was >\n$30.0 million and\n< $35.0 million in and\nmeeting performance\nobjectives\nQualified Adjusted\nEBITDA (including STIP\nexpense) equal to or\ngreater than\n$35 million and meeting\nperformance objectives\n0%\nPro-rata calculation\n100%\nPro-rata calculation\n200%\nPerformance Objectives Component (30%): The performance objectives component of the STIP represents 30% of the\nSTIP award. Goals under this component are objectives with specific measures related to the transition to a\nsubscription-based business model as well as recurring All Access Pass revenue. Each key strategic goal is individually\nweighted based on difficulty and on the effort required to achieve the goal, with most goals weighted between 25% and\n35% of this portion of the STIP award opportunity. We believe that the goals established for each NEO were ‘‘stretch’’\ngoals tied to over-achieving compared to our annual plan in support of the Company’s long-term strategy of building\nits subscription business. Each goal was typically linked to what we refer to internally and was previously mentioned as\nour ‘‘Wildly Important Goals’’ that are cascaded throughout the Company, and progress toward each of these goals\nwas tracked regularly. As a point of context as to the rigor of these non-disclosed goals, in recent years, we have\nachieved various levels of payout under this 30% component: 200% achievement in fiscal 2021; 48% achievement in\nfiscal 2020; 84% achievement in fiscal 2019; and 100% achievement in each of fiscal 2018 and 2017. Based on\nperformance against these objectives, and the strong performance of the Company’s subscription business, NEOs were\npaid 95% of the performance objectives component.\nThe Adjusted EBITDA portion of the payout combined with the achievement of 95% of the 30% performance\nobjective component resulted in a total payout of 198.5% of STIP for fiscal 2022. These payouts are reflected in the\n‘‘Fiscal Year 2022 Summary Compensation Table’’ found in this document under the heading ‘‘Non-Equity Incentive\nPlan Compensation.’’ For more information about the NEOs’ award opportunities under the STIP for fiscal 2022, see\nthe ‘‘Fiscal Year 2022 Grants of Plan-Based Awards’’ table below.

      "text": "Equity Compensation\nWe believe that the granting of long-term equity awards over the years has created strong alignment of interests\nbetween NEOs and shareholders, as reflected in our strong financial performance from fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2022.\nThe same program and philosophy were reflected in our use of LTIP equity awards in fiscal 2022.\nFiscal 2022 LTIP – Service-Based and Performance-Based Equity Grants: A significant portion of our NEOs’ total\ntargeted compensation for fiscal 2022 was provided in the form of performance-based stock awards that vest upon the\nachievement of key financial objectives included in our longer-term financial plan over a period of years, and\nservice-based stock awards that vest upon the completion of three years of service. If the performance targets are not\nachieved within the allotted time frame, then the performance based award tranches are forfeited.\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Compensation Committee granted service-based and performance-based equity awards to our\nNEOs. Shares may be earned under the fiscal 2022 LTIP award based on two components over an approximate\nthree-year service period, which ends on August 31, 2024, as described below:\n(1)\n25% of the fiscal 2022 LTIP award vests after three years of service and is expected to vest on August 31,\n2024; and\n(2)\n75% of the fiscal 2022 LTIP award is based on Qualified Adjusted EBITDA performance, as defined earlier.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is one of the most important measures of our financial results and is\nimportant in both the short- and long term. Therefore, this measure is used in both our STIP and LTIP\naward plans. The Compensation Committee sets the Qualified Adjusted EBITDA award thresholds at levels\nwhich are expected peak in the final year of the award measurement period. Qualified Adjusted EBITDA for\npurposes of fiscal 2022 LTIP is based on the highest Qualified Adjusted EBITDA achieved for any rolling\nfour-quarter period during the three-year measurement period ending August 31, 2024.\nIn addition to payout levels of 50%, 100%, and 200% for the achievement of applicable performance goals, the number\nof shares paid in settlement of the performance-based tranche with the financial targets is a straight-line pro-rata\ncalculation between a 50% threshold and a 100% target, and a different straight-line pro-rata calculation between 100%\ntarget and 200% maximum. Inasmuch as earning the performance-based LTIP award requires meeting total\nperformance targets over a three-year period, as of August 31, 2022, the fiscal 2022 performance-based LTIP award\nremained unearned. The three-year performance targets for the fiscal 2022 LTIP award (and the corresponding payout\nlevels for achieving the targets) are as follows:\nQualified Adjusted EBITDA Performance Measures\n•\n$42.0 million (50% of target – minimum threshold);\n•\n$48.0 million (100% of target); and\n•\n$55.0 million (200% of target – maximum threshold).\nWe believe that our LTIP equity-based program aligns a significant portion of our executive compensation with\nimproving performance, which increases intrinsic value to our shareholders. Effective September 1, 2021, in\nconnection with Mr. Whitman’s transition from Chief Executive Officer to Executive Chairman and Chairman of the\nBoard of Directors, his target LTIP award opportunity was reduced from $1,150,000 to $1,000,000, and Mr. Walker’s\ntarget LTIP award opportunity was increased from $425,000 to $750,000 to reflect his appointment to his new role.\nFor further information regarding our specific LTIP awards and other share-based compensation instruments\n(including applicable performance achievement), please refer to the notes to our financial statements found in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, and the footnotes to the Outstanding Equity\nAwards at Fiscal 2022 Year-End table that are provided below.

Contributions to the 401(k) plan\nfrom highly compensated employees are currently limited to a maximum of 12% of compensation, subject to statutory\nlimits.\nOther Benefits: The Compensation Committee evaluates the market competitiveness of the executive benefit package\nto determine the most critical and essential benefits necessary to retain executives. Based on market information\nreceived from Mercer, the Compensation Committee determined to include executive life insurance for certain NEOs.\nIn addition, several years ago, the Company agreed to provide Mr. Whitman, our former CEO, with supplemental\ndisability insurance. For fiscal 2022, the Compensation Committee was provided with the estimated value of these\nitems (which value is included in the Fiscal 2022 Summary Compensation Table below), and determined, as in prior\nyears, that these amounts were not material in determining our NEOs’ fiscal 2022 compensation.\n•\nTerm Life Insurance: Franklin Covey provides a portable 20-year term life policy for Mr. Whitman and Mr. Young.\nThe coverage amount is about 6.5 times Mr. Whitman’s target annual cash compensation (base salary plus target\nperformance-based cash variable pay), and about 2.5 times Mr. Young’s target annual cash compensation (base\nsalary plus target performance-based cash variable pay). The increase in multiple for Mr. Whitman compared to\nfiscal year 2021 is due to his decrease in compensation for fiscal 2022 due to his transition to the role of Executive\nChairman on September 1, 2021.\n•\nSupplemental Disability Insurance: Franklin Covey provides Mr. Whitman with long-term disability insurance\nwhich, combined with our current group policy, provides, in the aggregate, monthly long-term disability benefits\nequal to about 100% of his fiscal 2022 target cash compensation. Again, the increase in percentage for\nMr. Whitman compared to fiscal year 2021 is due to his decrease in compensation for fiscal 2022 due to his\ntransition to the role of Executive Chairman on September 1, 2021. Our other NEOs may purchase voluntary\nsupplemental disability insurance at their own expense.\nWe maintain a number of other broad-based employee benefit plans in which, consistent with our values, our NEOs\nparticipate on the same terms as other employees who meet the eligibility requirements, subject to any legal\nlimitations on amounts that may be contributed to or benefits payable under the plans. These benefits include:\n•\nOur high-deductible health plans and health savings accounts administered under Sections 125 and 223 of the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code); and\n•\nOur employee stock purchase plan implemented and administered under Section 423 of the Code.\nSeverance Policy: We have implemented a severance policy to establish, in advance, the appropriate treatment for\nterminated NEOs and to help ensure market competitiveness. The severance policy uses the same benefit formula for\nour NEOs as it uses for all our employees. We do not ‘‘gross-up’’ severance payments to compensate for taxes. For\nmore information about the terms of this severance policy, see the section below entitled ‘‘Executive Compensation –\nPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control.’’\nEmployment Agreements and Change-in-Control Severance Agreements: We do not have employment agreements with\nany of our NEOs, but we are a party to change-in-control severance agreements with each of our NEOs. However,\nconsistent with our conservative approach to compensation specific matters that raise shareholder sensitivities, the\nseverance amount is only one time the executive’s salary and bonus.

The ratio between the CEO’s\nand median employee’s annual total compensation as of August 31, 2022, is approximately 24:1.\n•\nTo determine the median employee, we prepared a list of our employee population as of June 30, 2022. We\nincluded the global employee population (approximately 1,100 employees), whether employed on a full-time,\npart-time, temporary, or seasonal basis.\n•\nWe established a consistently applied compensation measure consisting of total cash paid from July 1, 2021,\nthrough June 30, 2022. We annualized compensation for employees hired during that time. Non-U.S. employee\ncompensation was converted to U.S. dollars based on applicable exchange rates as of June 30, 2022.\n•\nWe believe that the ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of SEC\nRegulation S-K. Given the rule’s flexibility, the method the Company used to determine the median employee\nmay be different from its peers, so other companies’ CEO pay ratios may not be comparable.\n44\nCompensation Committee Report\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

The Audit Committee is comprised\nentirely of independent directors and operates in accordance with a written charter, which was adopted by the Board\nof Directors. A copy of that charter is available on our website at www.franklincovey.com. Each member of the Audit\nCommittee is ‘‘independent,’’ as required by the applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and the\nrules of the SEC.\nThe Audit Committee oversees the Company’s financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. The\nCompany’s management has primary responsibility for the financial statements and reporting process, including the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible\nfor performing an integrated audit of the Company’s financial statements and internal control over financial reporting\nin accordance with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.\nIn fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management the audited\nfinancial statements to be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022. This\nreview included a discussion of the quality and the acceptability of the Company’s financial reporting and system of\ninternal controls, including the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. The Audit Committee also reviewed\nand discussed with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm the audited financial statements of\nthe Company for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, their judgments as to the quality and acceptability of the\nCompany’s financial reporting, and such other matters as are required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board standards.\nThe Audit Committee obtained from the independent registered public accountants a formal written statement\ndescribing all relationships between the auditors and the Company that might bear on the auditors’ independence\nconsistent with applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and discussed with the\nauditors any relationships that may impact their objectivity and independence, and satisfied itself as to the auditors’\nindependence. The Audit Committee meets periodically with the independent registered public accounting firm, with\nand without management present, to discuss the results of the independent registered public accounting firm’s\nexaminations and evaluations of the Company’s internal control and the overall quality of the Company’s financial\nreporting.\nBased upon the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended that the Company’s\naudited financial statements be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nAugust 31, 2022, for filing with the SEC.\nDate: November 10, 2022\nDonald J.

Each of these proposals is discussed in more detail in the pages that follow.\nPROPOSAL NO. 1\nElection of Directors\nAt the Annual Meeting, seven directors are to be elected to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders or\nuntil their successors shall be duly elected and qualified. Our director nominees have a great diversity of experience\nand bring to our Board a wide variety of skills, qualifications, and viewpoints that strengthen their ability to carry out\ntheir oversight role on behalf of our shareholders.

We believe that it is appropriate to seek the views of shareholders on the design and effectiveness of\nour executive compensation program.\nThe overall goal of our executive compensation program is to attract, motivate, and retain a talented and creative\nteam of executives who will provide leadership for our success in dynamic and competitive markets. The Company\nseeks to accomplish this goal in a way that rewards performance and that is aligned with shareholders’ long-term\ninterests.

We believe that the compensation program for the Named Executive Officers is instrumental in helping the\nCompany achieve its financial goals.

      "text": "PROPOSAL NO. 3\nRatification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Audit Committee has selected the independent registered public accounting firm Deloitte & Touche LLP to audit\nour financial statements for fiscal 2023. Deloitte began serving as our independent registered public accounting firm\nin the third quarter of fiscal 2016. In making its selection, the Audit Committee took into account:\n•\nDeloitte’s knowledge of the Company’s business allows it to design and enhance its audit plan by focusing on\nknown and emerging risks, which creates efficiency and controls cost through iteration.\n•\nDeloitte has a global footprint and the expertise and capabilities necessary to handle the breadth and\ncomplexity of our international business, accounting practices, and internal controls.\n•\nDeloitte generally attends each Audit Committee meeting and meets regularly in closed door sessions with\nour Audit Committee so they can provide timely and candid feedback to the Committee regarding\naccounting and control issues which may impact the Company.\n•\nDeloitte is an independent public accounting firm and is subject to oversight and inspection by the\nUnited States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), Big 4 peer reviews, and SEC\nregulations. The results of these reviews are communicated to the Audit Committee.\n•\nDeloitte has significant policies and procedures in place to maintain its continued independence, including\nmandatory lead audit partner rotation to balance fresh perspectives with the benefits of having a tenured\nauditor with institutional knowledge.\nThe members of our Audit Committee believe that the continued retention of Deloitte as our independent registered\npublic accounting firm is in the best interests of our Company and our shareholders.\nPrincipal Accountant Fees\nThe following table shows the fees accrued or paid to our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal\nyears ended August 31, 2022 and 2021:\nFiscal 2022\nFiscal 2021\nAudit Fees(1)\n$ 698,134\n$701,084\nAudit-Related Fees(2)\n20,000\n—\nTax Fees(3)\n391,479\n54,465\nAll Other Fees(4)\n—\n—\n$1,109,613\n$755,549\n(1)\nAudit fees represent fees and expenses for professional services provided in connection with the audit of our\nconsolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting found in the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K and reviews of our financial statements contained in Quarterly Reports on\nForm 10-Q, accounting consultations on actual transactions, and audit services provided in connection with\nother statutory filings.\n(2)\nAudit-Related Fees consist of fees for services related to registration statements and other transactions.\n(3)\nTax Fees consisted primarily of fees and expenses for services related to tax compliance, tax planning, and tax\nconsulting.\n(4)\nDeloitte did not provide any ‘‘other services’’ during the periods presented.\nThe Audit Committee pre-approves all services to be performed by our independent registered public accountants\nand subsequently reviews the actual fees and expenses paid to them. All of the audit-related services and tax services\nprovided by our independent registered public accounting firm during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021\nwere pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

      "text": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral Information\nFranklin Covey is a global company focused on organizational performance improvement. Our mission is to ‘‘enable\ngreatness in people and organizations everywhere,’’ and our global structure is designed to help individuals and\norganizations achieve results that require collective behavior change. From the foundational work of Dr. Stephen\nR. Covey in leadership and personal effectiveness, and Hyrum W. Smith in productivity and time management, we\nhave developed deep expertise that extends to helping organizations and individuals achieve desired results through\nlasting behavioral change. We believe that our clients are able to utilize our content and offerings to create cultures\nwhich include high-performing, collaborative individuals, led by effective, trust building leaders who execute with\nexcellence and deliver measurably improved results for all of their key stakeholders.\nThe Company was incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the state of Utah, and we merged with the Covey\nLeadership Center in 1997 to form Franklin Covey Co. Our consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended August 31,\n2022 totaled $262.8 million and our shares of common stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)\nunder the ticker symbol ‘‘FC.’’\nOur fiscal year ends on August 31 of each year. Unless otherwise noted, references to fiscal years apply to the\n12 months ended August 31 of the specified year.\nThe Company’s principal executive offices are located at 2200 West Parkway Boulevard, Salt Lake City,\nUtah 84119-2331, and our telephone number is (801) 817-1776. Our website is www.franklincovey.com.\nFranklin Covey Services and Offerings\nOur mission is to ‘‘enable greatness in people and organizations everywhere,’’ and we believe that we are experts at\nsolving certain pervasive, intractable problems, each of which requires a change in human behavior. Our services and\nproducts are designed to help our clients succeed in four key areas:\n1.\nDevelop exceptional leaders at every level.\n2.\nInstill habits of effectiveness in every individual.\n3.\nBuild an inclusive, high-trust culture.\n4.\nUse a common execution framework to pursue their most important goals.\nWe believe that when organizations partner with us, their people change behavior—both individually and\ncollectively—in ways that help solve an organization’s most pressing problems and achieve breakthrough results.\nLasting behavior change begins with individuals from the inside out, with how people see themselves and the world\naround them. These insights translate into how individuals engage and lead others. Our content, which is based on\ntimeless principles of human effectiveness, is designed to help people change both their mindset and behavior.\nWe seek to combine the best content, people, and technology to help our clients achieve results at scale—across an\nentire organization. We believe the combination of powerful content, teams of experts, a dynamic behavior change\nplatform, and key metrics can guide leaders and teams through impact journeys that deliver exceptional results again\nand again.\nOur services and products are primarily delivered through our subscription offerings, which are comprised of the All\nAccess Pass (AAP), which is primarily sold through our Enterprise Division, and the Leader in Me membership, which\nis designed specifically for our Education Division. We believe the AAP is a revolutionary and innovative way to\ndeliver our content to clients of various sizes, including large, multinational organizations, in a flexible and\ncost-effective manner. Clients may utilize complete offerings such as The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, The\nFour Disciplines of Execution, and The 5 Choices to Extraordinary Productivity, or use individual concepts from any of\nour well-known offerings to create a custom solution to fit their organizational or individual training needs. Since the\nintroduction of the All Access Pass, we have developed the role of Implementation Specialists to provide our clients\nwith the direction necessary to create meaningful impact journeys using our tools and content. An impact journey is a\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nBusiness\n57"

We have also translated AAP materials into numerous\nadditional languages, which allows the AAP to be used effectively by multinational entities and provides for greater\ninternational sales opportunities.\nIn our Education Division, we offer the Leader in Me membership, which provides access to the Leader in Me online\nservice, and authorizes use of Franklin Covey’s proprietary intellectual property. The Leader in Me online service\nprovides access to digital versions of student leadership guides, leadership lessons, illustrated leadership stories, and a\nvariety of other resources to enable an educational institution to effectively implement and utilize the Leader in Me\nprogram. We believe that the tools and resources available through the Leader in Me membership will provide\nmeasurable results that are designed to develop student leadership, improve school culture, and increase academic\nproficiency.\nTo deliver these services and products, we operate globally with one common brand and a business model designed to\nenable us to provide clients around the world with the same high level of service. To achieve this high level of service\nwe have sales and support associates in various locations around the United States and Canada, and operate wholly\nowned subsidiaries in Australia, China, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. In foreign\nlocations where we do not have a directly owned office, we may contract with independent licensee partners who\ndeliver our content and provide services in 150 other countries and territories around the world.\nFurther information about our content and services can be found on our website at www.franklincovey.com. However,\nthe information contained in, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute any part of this\nAnnual Report.\nBusiness Development\nOur business is currently structured around two divisions, the Enterprise Division and the Education Division. The\nEnterprise Division consists of our Direct Office and International Licensee segments and is focused on selling our\nofferings to corporations, governments, not-for-profits, and other related organizations. Franklin Covey offerings\ndelivered through the Enterprise Division are designed to help organizations and individuals achieve their own great\npurposes through behavior changing content and coaching. Our Education Division is centered around the principles\nfound in the Leader in Me and is dedicated to helping educational institutions build cultures that will produce great\nresults, including increased student performance, improved school culture, and increased parental and teacher\ninvolvement.\nFollowing the launch of our AAP subscription service and Leader in Me membership, we have consistently sought to\nimprove the technology, content, and overall client experience with these offerings. Bob Whitman, our former Chief\nExecutive Officer and current Executive Chairman of our Board of Directors described our commitment to continued\ndevelopment as, ‘‘We don’t want to fall in love with our current solutions, we want to ‘fall in love with problems’ and\nkeep working to find solutions that help people make real progress.’’ We believe that continued investments in\ntechnology, content, and personnel are key to subscription service renewals and the future growth of our offerings.\nIn addition to the internal development of our offerings, we have on occasion sought to grow our sales through\nacquisitions of businesses and content licenses, and opening new international offices. Over the past few years, our\ngrowth investment efforts have included the following:\n•\nAcquisition of Strive Talent, Inc. – In April 2021 we purchased Strive Talent, Inc. (Strive), a San\nFrancisco-based technology company which has developed and markets an innovative learning deployment\nplatform. The Strive platform is expected to enable the seamless integration and deployment of our content,\nservices, technology, and metrics to deliver behavioral impact at scale, primarily through the Company’s\nAAP subscription. We are excited to fully roll out the new capabilities of the Strive platform in early fiscal\n2023 and believe the new Impact Platform will provide significant additional value to our clients and appeal\nto potential new clients.\n58\nBusiness\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

Despite the recent\nemployment turmoil during the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing recovery, we have increased the\nnumber of client partners to 300 at August 31, 2022. We expect to hire additional sales professionals in\nfiscal 2023 and future periods to provide additional growth opportunities.\nWe seek to consistently deliver world-class content with the broadest and deepest distribution capabilities through the\nmost flexible content delivery modalities and expect to make additional investments in technology, content, and\npersonnel in fiscal 2023 and in future periods as market conditions allow. These investments may include business\nacquisitions, the acquisition of license rights, and hiring additional personnel.\nOur Associates\nWe have approximately 1,150 associates worldwide, who are mostly full-time employees. We also utilize independent\ncontractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. None of our associates are represented by a union\nor collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a material labor interruption due to labor\ndisagreements. For more information regarding our associates refer to the Human Capital Resources disclosures\nfound later in this section.\nOur Industry and Clients\nAccording to the Training magazine 2022 Training Industry Survey, the total size of the U.S. training industry is\nexpected to increase 10 percent over 2021 and is estimated to be $101.6 billion. As such, we believe that there is ample\nroom for growth and increased market share within our industry. Overall, the training industry is highly fragmented\nand includes a wide variety of training and service providers of varying sizes. We believe our competitive advantages in\nthis industry stem from our fully integrated principle-centered training offerings, our wide variety of delivery options,\nand various implementation tools to help organizations and individuals measurably improve their effectiveness.\nThe training industry is a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace and we compete with a variety\nof organizations of assorted sizes that offer services comparable with ours. Based upon our annual sales, we believe\nthat we are a significant competitor in the performance skills and education market. Other significant comparative\ncompanies that compete with our Enterprise Division include: LinkedIn Learning, Development Dimension\nInternational, SkillSoft, Coursera, Udemy Business, Harvard Business Publishing, Cornerstone, Workboard, and\nKorn Ferry, among others. Our Education Division competes with entities such as: Second Step, Avid, Responsive\nClassroom, Panorama Education, and 7 Mindsets.\nWe believe that the principal competitive factors in the industry in which we compete include the following:\n•\nQuality of offerings, services, and solutions\n•\nSkills and capabilities of people who develop and deliver our content\n•\nInnovative training and consulting services combined with effective technology and products\n•\nAbility to add value to client operations\n•\nReputation and client references\n•\nPricing\n•\nGlobal reach and scale\n•\nBranding and name recognition in our marketplace\nGiven the relative ease of entry into the training market, the number of our competitors could increase, many of\nwhom may imitate existing methods of distribution, or could offer similar content and programs at lower prices.\nHowever, we believe that we have several areas of competitive differentiation in our industry. We believe that our\ncompetitive advantages include: (1) the quality of our content; (2) the breadth of our delivery options, including the\nAAP and Leader in Me membership; (3) our global reach, which allows truly multinational clients to scale our content\nuniformly across the globe; and (4) the significant impact which our offerings can have on our clients’ organization\nand results.\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nBusiness\n59"

      "text": "We have a relatively broad base of clients, which includes thousands of organizational, governmental, educational, and\nindividual clients in both the United States and in other countries that are served through our directly owned\noperations. We have thousands of additional organizational clients throughout the world which are served through\nour global licensee partner network, and we believe that our content, in all its forms, delivers results that encourage\nstrong client loyalty. Our clients are in a broad array of industries and we are not dependent on a single client or\nindustry group. During the periods presented in this report, none of our clients were responsible for more than ten\npercent of our consolidated revenues.\nOur Intellectual Property\nOur success has resulted in part from our proprietary content, methodologies, and other intellectual property rights.\nWe seek to protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, copyrights, and confidentiality\nagreements. We claim rights for over 660 trademarks in the United States and foreign countries, and we have obtained\nregistration in the United States and numerous foreign countries for many of our trademarks including FranklinCovey,\nThe 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, The 4 Disciplines of Execution, and The 7 Habits. We consider our trademarks\nand other proprietary rights to be important and material to our business and we regularly review the status of our\ntrademarks and renew them to prevent the trademark protection from lapsing.\nWe claim nearly 235 registered copyrights, and own sole or joint copyrights on our books, manuals, text and other\nprinted information provided in our training programs, and other electronic media products, including audio and\nvideo media. We may license, rather than sell, facilitator workbooks and other seminar and training materials in order\nto protect our intellectual property rights therein. We place trademark and copyright notices on our instructional,\nmarketing, and advertising materials. In order to maintain the proprietary nature of our product information, we enter\ninto written confidentiality agreements with certain executives, product developers, sales professionals, training\nconsultants, other employees, and licensees.\nOur Products and Sustainability\nWe offer training materials and related accessories in either digital or paper formats. Our printed training materials\nare primarily comprised of paper, which we believe is a renewable and sustainable resource. We purchase our training\nmaterials and related products from various vendors and suppliers located both domestically and internationally, and\nwe are not dependent upon any one vendor for the production of our training and related materials as the raw\nmaterials for these products are readily available. Our training materials are primarily warehoused and distributed\nfrom an independent warehouse facility located in Des Moines, Iowa.\nSeasonality\nOur fourth quarter of each fiscal year typically has higher sales and operating income than other fiscal quarters\nprimarily due to increased revenues in our Education Division (when school administrators and faculty have\nprofessional development days) and to increased sales that typically occur during that quarter from year-end incentive\nprograms. Overall, training sales are moderately seasonal because of the timing of corporate training, which is not\ntypically scheduled as heavily during holiday and certain vacation periods.\nHuman Capital Resources\nA Culture of Belonging at Franklin Covey\nOur mission is to ‘‘enable greatness in people and organizations everywhere,’’ which is also the cornerstone of our\nculture. To fulfill that mission and successfully implement our strategy, we must attract, develop, and retain highly\nqualified associates for each role in the organization. We currently have approximately 1,150 associates worldwide\ndedicated to providing the best service possible for our clients and for each other. Our goal is to have every associate\nfeel they are a valued member of a winning team doing meaningful work in an environment of trust. To accomplish this\nideal outcome, we are continuously focused on attracting, developing, and retaining talent while looking through the\nlens of diversity, equity, and inclusion in each area.\n60\nBusiness\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

      "text": "Providing Focus and Accountability\nWe have historically attracted ‘‘mission-driven’’ people who care deeply about making a difference in the world. Our\napproaches to ensure accountability and responsibility to our mission and culture are shared by all of us and are\nfurther fortified through our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Core Council, the Director of Learning,\nDevelopment, and Inclusion, and the Manager of Diversity Partnerships.\nThe purpose of the DEI Core Council is to provide input, insight, feedback, and guidance on our Diversity, Equity, and\nInclusivity commitments and initiatives as we strive to enhance our intent of being the workplace of choice for\nachievers with heart. This multi-disciplinary council is comprised of approximately 35 associates from across our\norganization. During fiscal 2022, the DEI Core Council focused on hiring and promotion opportunities, and building\ncultural competence.\nThe role of Director of Learning, Development, and Inclusion is accountable for the internal learning and\ndevelopment of our associates in ways that align with our strategic plans for growth through the multi-dimensional\nlens of inclusion. In fiscal 2022, we grew the Mentorship and Employee Resource programs and evaluated our\nContribution Conversations program for effectiveness. We also worked to align our Human Resource Information\nSystem and Learning Management Systems (LMS), and to support the professional development of our internal LMS\nstakeholder groups.\nAttracting Talent\nOur recruiting and hiring efforts cast a wide net when looking for candidates by partnering with many groups and\nagencies, including alumni organizations, multiple diversity job boards, diversity career fairs, the Utah Governor’s\nCommittee on Employment of People with Disabilities and Business Relations, and ElevatHER – an organization\ndesigned to promote women in leadership.\nWe remain steadfast in our commitment to recruiting and developing underinvested and underrepresented groups of\nemployees. Women currently constitute 67 percent of our workforce, while the number of women in leadership grew\nto 44 percent. Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) associates currently comprise 19 percent of our\nworkforce, which represents growth of more than five percent over the prior year. We continue to make efforts to\nincrease the representation of BIPOC, veterans, women, and individuals with disabilities in our workforce while\nensuring that our associate promotions are fair and equitable.\nDeveloping Talent\nWe believe that building an environment that encourages lifelong learning and development is essential for us to\nmaintain a high level of service and to achieve our goal of having every associate feel they are a valued member of a\nwinning team doing meaningful work in an environment of trust. We believe Franklin Covey is one of the world’s\npremier training and consulting organizations. We develop and deliver various offerings, including leadership and\nindividual effectiveness, to clients around the globe, and we provide these same world-class offerings to our associates.\nDuring an associate’s first year, they complete a three-part Company culture orientation, including our 7 Habits of\nHighly Effective People offering, which is the cultural operating system for our organization. Our associates have\nunlimited access to our content and training through the AAP, where they can experience the exact high-quality\nsolutions available to our clients.\nIf an associate struggles with reaching their goals or producing the results required of the role, a thoughtful and\nthorough performance plan is created and implemented by the associate's manager and our Chief People Officer. The\nperformance plan is designed to help the associate recalibrate and bring performance up to expectations. Through this\ntransparent coaching process, struggling associates can learn how to improve their performance and become engaged,\nsuccessful contributors in their roles. We believe this process strengthens our associate base while reducing the cost of\nfinding and training new associates.\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nBusiness\n61"

      "text": "Retaining Talent\nTalented people are always in high demand, and even more so when talent searches align their purpose and values\nwith the organizations and teams they work for and with. From June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2022, our associate\nturnover rate in the United States and Canada was 17 percent, which we believe is reasonable for our industry and the\nmake-up of our workforce, especially considering the impact of the ‘‘great resignation,’’ which has impacted\nworkforces around the world over the past few years.\nTo retain our associates, we believe it is crucial to continually focus on making sure our associates are highly engaged\nand feel valued. We further address retention efforts in several ways, including training our leaders in our solutions\nsuch as The 6 Critical Practices for Leading a Team, Multipliers, Unconscious Bias, and Leading Change. Our employee\nretention practices include holding consistent, compelling one-on-one interviews, where leaders regularly take time to\nconnect with their associates and to understand what is working well for them and what is not. In our 2022 Culture\nSurvey, 86 percent of associates said they had at least one meaningful conversation with their manager in the past year.\nThough one conversation seems like a low benchmark, these conversations are essential because they are not\nperformance reviews. Our Contribution Conversations are an open, ongoing dialogue focused on how our associates\nwant to contribute and bring their ‘‘best selves’’ to work. Based on these discussions, leaders are encouraged to ‘‘clear\nthe path’’ of those things that may hold the associate back. We aim to establish a culture of feedback where feedback\nfor both leaders and associates is a normal and worthwhile part of how work gets done. Contribution Conversations\nalign with our core value to focus on the whole person and allow our associates to find their voice. We believe these\nefforts are vital to creating an atmosphere of continuous improvement.\nWe currently have six Employee Resource Groups (ERGs): Veterans and First Responders, BOLD (Black Originators,\nLeaders, and Doers), WIN (Women's International Network), Global Wellness, FC Ability, and LGBTQ+. These\nemployee-led networks serve historically underinvested and underrepresented associates and allies. They offer safe\nspaces for people to come together based on a shared interest in a specific dimension of equity and inclusion while\nactively working to enhance career opportunities, build cultural competence, and foster community within the\norganization. We believe our ERGs represent and support our diverse workforce, facilitate networking, and foster\nconnections and engagement within the organization.\nThe Mentorship Program is company-wide and is for all employees. Mentees and mentors are paired based on\nself-selected areas of interest and ability, giving the partners a great deal of flexibility for how they can best engage\nwith each other for mutual benefit and professional development. This program started as 30 pairs of mentors and\nmentees and has now increased to 86 pairs of participants.\nOur compensation plans are audited periodically to confirm ongoing pay equity. We provide a generous personal time\noff benefit as well as a flexible and inclusive holiday schedule, reflecting the diversity of our workforce and the\ncelebration of various cultural and religious affiliations.

RISK FACTORS\nOur business environment, current domestic and international economic conditions, impacts from the ongoing\nCOVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical circumstances, changing social standards, and other specific risks may affect our\nfuture business decisions and financial performance. The matters discussed below may cause our future results to\ndiffer from past results or those described in forward-looking statements and could have a material effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and stock price, and should be considered in evaluating\nour Company.\nThe risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional risk factors which\ncould adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly\nchanging global environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to\npredict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which\nany factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any\nforward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on\nforward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Further, the disclosure of risks identified below does not\nimply that the risk has already materialized.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Risks\nOur results of operations have been adversely affected and could be materially impacted in the future by the\nongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption in the United\nStates and elsewhere in the world over the past several quarters. The extent to which the ongoing COVID-19\npandemic impacts our business, operations, and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we\nmay not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration, scope, and severity of the pandemic; governmental,\nbusiness, and individuals’ actions that have been taken, and continue to be taken, in response to the pandemic; the\nimpact of the pandemic on worldwide economic activity, including related supply chain issues (including, for example,\nshipping delays, capacity constraints, increasing labor costs, and supply shortages), and actions taken in response to\nsuch impacts; the effect on our clients, including educational institutions, and client demand for our services; our\nability to conduct in-person programs; our ability to sell and provide our services and solutions, including the impact\nof travel restrictions and from people working from home; the ability of our clients to pay for our services on a timely\nbasis or at all; the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity; and any closure of our offices. Any of these events, or related\nconditions, could cause or contribute to the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report and could\nmaterially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and stock price.\nTraining Industry and Related Risks\nWe operate in an intensely competitive industry and our competitors may develop programs, services, or courses\nthat adversely affect our ability to sell our offerings.\nThe training and consulting services industry is intensely competitive with relatively easy entry. Competitors\ncontinually introduce new programs, services, and delivery methods that may compete directly with our offerings, or\nthat may make our offerings uncompetitive or obsolete. Larger competitors may have superior abilities to compete for\nclients and skilled professionals, reducing our ability to deliver quality work to our clients. Some of our competitors\nmay have greater financial and other resources than we do. In addition, one or more of our competitors may develop\nand implement training courses or methodologies that may adversely affect our ability to sell our offerings and\nproducts to new clients. Any one of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain new\nbusiness and successfully deliver our services.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these\nconditions on our clients’ businesses and their levels of business activity.\nGlobal economic and political conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets in which they operate.\nInstability in the global credit markets; the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy;\ninstability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world, including international hostilities; inflation;\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nRisk Factors\n65"

These conditions\nmay reduce the demand for our services or depress the pricing of those services and have an adverse impact on our\nresults of operations. Changes in global economic conditions may also shift demand to services for which we do not\nhave competitive advantages, and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. Such\neconomic, political, and client spending conditions are influenced by a wide range of factors that are beyond our\ncontrol and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. If we are unable to successfully anticipate these\nchanging conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be\nadversely affected.\nOur business success also depends in part upon continued growth in the use of training and consulting services and\nthe renewal of existing contracts by our clients. In challenging economic environments, our clients may reduce or\ndefer their spending on new services and consulting solutions in order to focus on other priorities. At the same time,\nmany companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting their business and\nthey may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel and/or processes. If\ngrowth in the general use of training and consulting services in business or our clients’ spending on these items\ndeclines, or if we cannot convince our clients or potential clients to embrace new services and solutions, our results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our business tends to lag behind economic cycles and, consequently, the benefits of an economic recovery\nfollowing a period of economic downturn may take longer for us to realize than other segments of the economy.\nFailure to maintain our reputation, brand image, and culture could negatively impact our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining,\npromoting, and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including advertising and\nconsumer campaigns, content and platform innovation and quality, and our efforts in these respects may not have the\ndesired impact on our brand image and reputation. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending, and expanding\nour brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing\nreliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns on our digital platforms and through our\ndigital experiences. We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives.\nOur brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity,\npurpose, and brand culture. Negative claims or publicity involving us, our culture and values, our products, services\nand experiences, consumer data, or any of our affiliates could seriously damage our reputation and brand image,\nregardless of whether such claims are accurate. Further, our reputation and brand image could be damaged as a result\nof our support of, association with or lack of support or disapproval of certain social causes, as well as any decisions we\nmake to continue to conduct, or change, certain of our activities in response to such considerations. Social media,\nwhich accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity, can increase the challenges of responding\nto negative claims. Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or by us, could also damage our\nreputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products,\neven if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. If the reputation, perception, or\nimage of any of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity, our financial condition and results of\noperations could be materially and adversely affected.\nSome terminology, language, or content in our offerings may be deemed offensive by certain individuals due to\nrapidly changing societal norms, which may cause damage to our brand or reputation.\nOur mission is to enable greatness in individuals and organizations regardless of race, religion, gender, or other\nindividual characteristics.

The loss of\nthe services of any key individuals could harm our business. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify,\nattract, and retain additional qualified senior personnel. Competition for such individuals in the current labor market\nand in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality employees, including sales personnel and training\nconsultants, we may not be able to grow our business as projected or may not be able to compete effectively.\nOur success and ability to grow are partially dependent on our ability to hire, retain, and motivate sufficient numbers\nof talented people with the increasingly diverse skills needed to serve our clients and grow our business. Competition\nfor skilled personnel is intense at all levels of experience and seniority. There is a risk that we will find it difficult to\nhire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds we require, or that it will prove\ndifficult to retain them in a competitive and inflationary labor market. If we are unable to hire and retain talented sales\nand delivery employees with the skills, and in the locations, we require, we might not be able to grow our business at\nprojected levels or may not be able to effectively deliver our content and services.

While these projects are often\nplanned and executed as multi-year projects, the governmental entities usually reserve the right to change\nthe scope of, or terminate, these projects for lack of approved funding, budgetary changes, and other\ndiscretionary reasons.

As a result, we are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign\njurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the various U.S. federal and state laws\ngoverning the protection of personal data. If we, our associates, business partners, or our service providers negligently\ndisregard or intentionally breach our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or\nmisappropriates that data, we could be subject to monetary damages, fines, and/or criminal prosecution.\nUnauthorized disclosure of personal, sensitive, or confidential client or employee data, whether through systems\nfailure, employee negligence, fraud, or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients.\nLegal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For\nexample, in May 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became effective in the European Union (EU).\nThe GDPR imposed strict requirements on the collection, use, security, and transfer of personal information in and\nfrom EU member states. Under GDPR, fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to four percent of the annual global\nrevenues of the infringer, whichever is greater, could be imposed. Although GDPR applies across the European Union,\nlocal data protection authorities still have the ability to interpret GDPR, which may create inconsistencies in\napplication on a country-by-country basis. Furthermore, with the United Kingdom’s (UK) transition out of the EU as\nof January 1, 2021, we may encounter additional complexity with respect to data privacy and data transfers to and\nfrom the UK under the UK GDPR. Other countries, such as Brazil and South Africa, have also enacted data protection\nlaws analogous to GDPR. We have implemented controls and procedures, including a team dedicated to data\nprotection, to comply with the requirements of GDPR/UK GDPR and analogous laws. However, these new procedures\nand controls may not be completely effective in preventing unauthorized breaches of personal data.\nIn addition, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy\nShield, a framework that had enabled companies to transfer data from EU member states to the U.S. On\nSeptember 8, 2020, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner followed suit, and announced\nthat the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework was inadequate for personal information transfers from Switzerland to\nthe U.S. Both cases raised questions about the viability of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) as a Privacy-Shield\nalternative. On June 4, 2021, the European Commission adopted new SCCs, which imposed on companies additional\nobligations relating to data transfers, including the obligation to conduct a transfer impact assessment and, depending\non a party’s role in the transfer and the laws and practices of the destination country, to implement additional security\nmeasures, and to update internal privacy practices. Regulatory guidance suggests that certain transfers of personal\ndata to the U.S. could be compliant only if the recipient is able to implement specific technical and procedural security\ncontrols to protect that personal data, and such controls may not be practical for certain service delivery models, in\nparticular those reliant on cloud services. Decisions in several countries in the EU have created additional uncertainty\nsurrounding the conditions necessary to properly implement the SCCs in the context of U.S. transfers, in particular,\nthe nature of the technical and organizational controls necessary for such transfers to be lawful. To the extent we rely\non the SCCs for data transfers, we may be required to incur significant time and resources to update our contractual\narrangements and implement the supplementary security measures, necessary to comply with new requirements.\nCompliance may also require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that may result in increased\ncosts, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Failure to comply\nwith existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity. The\ninability to import personal information from Europe to the United States or other countries may decrease demand\nfor our products and services as our customers that are subject to such laws may seek alternatives that do not involve\npersonal information transfers out of Europe. Our inability to import personal information to the United States and\nother countries may decrease the functionality or effectiveness of our products and services, increase costs, and\nadversely impact our marketing efforts, plans, and activities.\nFurther, on August 20, 2021, China adopted the PRC Personal Information Protection Law, or PIPL. The PIPL took\neffect on November 1, 2021. The PIPL establishes comprehensive requirements relating to the collection, use, transfer,\nsecurity, and other processing of personal information in or from China. The PIPL incorporates many requirements\ncommon to international privacy laws, such as GDPR, and adds unique regulatory requirements relating to data\nlocalization, international data transfers, consumer consent, the processing of ‘‘sensitive personal information,’’ and\nthe operations of certain ‘‘internet platform services.’’ While several new regulations and practical guidelines have been\npublished by the PRC in order to implement the PIPL, key regulations are not yet in force, including those concerning\ncontractual clauses for international data transfers and other requirements relating to international data transfers and\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nRisk Factors\n69"

Fines and penalties under the PIPL range from fines up to RMB 50,000,000 or five percent of global\nannual turnover, to the cancellation of business authorizations, personal liability or professional restrictions for\nresponsible company officers, as well as criminal and civil liability. Early enforcement actions under PIPL have\nincluded civil actions against companies that fail to obtain proper consent for processing sensitive personal\ninformation or other unlawful data collection. Recent regulatory actions have centered on ineffective channels for data\nsubjects to exercise rights, the over-collection of personal information, and deceptive practices. In the event the law\nrequires us to store data in China, or limits our ability to transfer data across borders, we may experience increased\ncosts, business inefficiencies, lost sales, decreased demand, and decreased competitiveness, as we may be unable to\nprovide our services or certain features, or provide them in an efficient or centralized manner. Additionally, local\ncompanies may be favored by customers who will not consent to or accept transfer of their data out of China. Fines,\ncorrective actions, or other penalties asserted due to alleged noncompliance may impose additional financial or\noperational costs, limit our ability to attract and retain local talent, or limit our ability to do business in China. These\nrisks may be magnified due to regulatory uncertainty and short periods to achieve compliance. Additionally, under the\nPIPL, we may be subject to additional liabilities, claims, penalties, or causes of action in the event of a breach of\ncustomer personal information.\nOther governmental authorities throughout the U.S. and around the world are considering or have adopted similar\ntypes of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. For example, in June 2018, the State of\nCalifornia enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the CCPA), which was took effect on January 1, 2020.\nThe CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to\nconsumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, and allows consumers to opt out of data sales, as well\nas certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new private cause of action for data breaches. Additionally,\nthe California Privacy Rights Act (the CPRA) amendments to the CCPA created additional obligations relating to\nconsumer data beginning on January 1, 2022, with enforcement beginning on July 1, 2023. The CPRA amendments\nexpand the private right of action for consumers, expands the CCPA’s limitation on sharing of personal information,\nand removes the 30-day window to cure alleged noncompliance before being subject to administrative enforcement.\nOther states, including Colorado, Virginia, and Utah have also passed comprehensive privacy laws that are now in\neffect or will come into effect in the coming years. Furthermore, in June 2022, the first draft of a comprehensive\nfederal privacy bill was introduced to congress. If enacted, the proposed American Data Privacy and Protection Act\nwould largely preempt state privacy legislation; however, the scope of preemption and enforcement-related matters\nremain uncertain. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state\nconsumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data.\nThese privacy, security, and data protection laws and regulations continue to evolve and enforcement in the U.S. and\ninternationally continues to increase. These developments could impose significant limitations on or require changes\nto our business, restrict our use or storage of personal information, and increase risks of legal liability, which may in\nturn increase our compliance risk and expenses, and make our business more costly or less efficient to conduct.\nWe strive to employ global best practices in securing and monitoring code, applications, systems, processes, and data,\nand our data protection practices are regularly reviewed and validated by an external auditing firm. However, these\nefforts may be insufficient to protect sensitive information against illegal activities and we may be exposed to\nadditional liabilities from the various data protection laws enacted within the jurisdictions where we operate.\nOur business is becoming increasingly dependent on information technology and will require additional cash\ninvestments in order to grow and meet the demands of our clients.\nSince the introduction of our online subscription services, our dependence on the use of sophisticated technologies\nand information systems has increased. Moreover, our technology platforms will require continuing cash investments\n(including business acquisitions such as the acquisition of Strive in fiscal 2021) by us to expand existing offerings,\nimprove the client experience, and develop complementary offerings. Our future success depends in part on our\nability to adapt our services and infrastructure while continuing to improve the performance, features, and reliability\nof our services in response to the evolving demands of the marketplace. Failure to adapt and improve these areas could\nhave an adverse effect on our business, including our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n70\nRisk Factors\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

We are unable to control many of these factors, such as the general economy,\neconomic conditions in the industries in which we operate, and competitive pressures. Our cash flows may be\ninsufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness and to meet our other obligations. If our cash\nflows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay\ninvestments and capital expenditures or to sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our\nindebtedness. These alternative measures may be unsuccessful and we may not meet our scheduled debt service\nobligations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements, including our 2019 Credit Agreement (as\ndefined below) and subsequent modifications, may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives.\nIn the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding indebtedness before maturity or as it\nmatures, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness or refinance our\nexisting indebtedness at all. If interest rates or other factors existing at the time of refinancing result in higher interest\nrates upon refinancing, we will incur higher interest expense. Furthermore, if any rating agency changes our credit\nrating or outlook, our debt and equity securities could be negatively affected, which could adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and financial results.\nFailure to comply with the terms and conditions of our credit facility may have an adverse effect upon our\nbusiness and operations.\nOur secured credit agreement and subsequent modifications require us to be in compliance with customary\nnon-financial terms and conditions as well as specified financial ratios. Failure to comply with these terms and\nconditions or maintain adequate financial performance to comply with specific financial ratios entitles the lender to\ncertain remedies, including the right to immediately call due any amounts owed on the credit agreement. Such events\nwould have an adverse effect upon our business and operations as there can be no assurance that we may be able to\nobtain other forms of financing or raise additional capital on terms that would be acceptable to us.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, and this capital may not be available to us on favorable terms or\nat all.\nWe may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt offerings or equity financings in order to:\n•\nDevelop new services, programs, or offerings\n•\nTake advantage of opportunities, including business acquisitions\n•\nRespond to competitive pressures\nGoing forward, we will continue to incur costs necessary for the day-to-day operation and potential growth of the\nbusiness and may use our available revolving line of credit facility and other financing alternatives, if necessary, for\nthese expenditures. We obtained a new credit agreement in August 2019 (the 2019 Credit Agreement) with our\nexisting lender that expires in August 2024. We expect to regularly renew or amend our lending agreement in the\nfuture to maintain the availability of this credit facility. Additional potential sources of liquidity available to us include\nfactoring receivables, issuance of additional equity, or issuance of debt from public or private sources. If necessary, we\nwill evaluate all of these options and select one or more of them depending on overall capital needs and the associated\ncost of capital.\nAny additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute current shareholders’ ownership percentage in us.\nFurthermore, we may be unable to obtain the necessary capital on terms or conditions that are favorable to us, or at\nall.\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nRisk Factors\n71"

These periodic reports include information\nabout our historical financial results as well as the analysts’ estimates of our future performance. The analysts’\nestimates are based on their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. The price of our\ncommon stock could, however, decline if an analyst downgrades our common stock or if those analysts issue other\nunfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business. If analysts do not continue to follow us\nor if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock\nprice could decline. If our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in securities litigation following a decline in\nprice.

While\nwe believe that our annual financial guidance provides investors and analysts with insight into our view of the\nCompany’s future performance, such financial guidance is based on assumptions that may not always prove to be\naccurate and may vary from actual results. If we fail to meet the financial guidance that we provide, or if we find it\nnecessary to revise such guidance during the year, the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur future quarterly operating results are subject to factors that can cause fluctuations in our stock price.\nHistorically, our stock price has experienced significant volatility. We expect that our stock price may continue to\nexperience volatility in the future due to a variety of potential factors that may include the following:\n•\nFluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and cash flows\n•\nIncreased overall market volatility\n•\nVariations between our actual financial results and market expectations\n•\nChanges in key balances, such as cash and cash equivalents\n•\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations\n•\nUnexpected asset impairment charges\nThese factors, among others, may have an adverse effect upon our stock price in the future.\nGeneral Business Risks\nOur results of operations may be adversely impacted by the costs of persistent and rising inflation if we are\nunable to pass these costs on to our clients.\nIn recent quarters inflation has increased significantly in the United States and in many of the countries where we\nconduct business. Inflation increases the cost of many aspects of our business, including the cost of our products sold,\nbenefit costs, travel expenses, and associate salaries since we must increase our compensation to retain key personnel.\nIf we are unable to increase our prices to sufficiently offset the increased costs of doing business, our results of\noperations and profitability may be adversely impacted.\nUnstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial\ncondition, and operations.\nThe global credit and financial markets have from time to time experienced extreme volatility and disruptions,\nincluding severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic\ngrowth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability.

Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any\nsuch economic downturn, volatile business environment or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions.\nOur global operations pose complex management, foreign currency, legal, tax, and economic risks, which we may\nnot adequately address.\nWe have sales offices in Australia, China, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and the United Kingdom. We also\nhave licensed operations in numerous other foreign countries. As a result of these foreign operations and their impact\nupon our financial statements, we are subject to a number of risks, including:\n•\nRestrictions on the movement of cash\n•\nThe absence in some jurisdictions of effective laws to protect our intellectual property rights\n•\nPolitical instability\n•\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations\nIn addition, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, or Brexit, became effective on January 21, 2020. The UK\nand EU subsequently signed and EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. This agreement provides details on how\nsome aspects of the UK and EU’s relationship will operate going forward; however, there continues to be uncertainty\nover the practical consequences of Brexit. The impact of Brexit depends on the implementation of this agreement, as\nwell as the terms of the UK’s future trade agreements with other countries, and such impact may not be fully realized\nfor several years or longer. This lack of clarity could lead to economic and legal uncertainty, including significant\nvolatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rates among other things. We have experienced or expect we\nmay in the future experience impacts on our operations from the following:\n•\nMore stringent rules of origin on goods traded between the UK and the EU;\n•\nadditional procedures related to goods traded between the EU and non-EU countries; and\n•\nnew product registration requirements applicable including to avoid any new tariffs or quotas, or as a result\nof REACH and the new UK REACH regime.\nWhile we believe that some of these adverse impacts will be resolved in the coming years as the UK becomes\naccustomed to operating independent of the EU, we may in the future experience adverse consequences from Brexit,\nwhich could have a negative impact on our future operations, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and\nviolation of these regulations could harm our business.\nBecause we provide services to clients in many countries, we are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting,\nregulations on matters as diverse as import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation,\nsanctions, government affairs, internal and disclosure control obligations, data privacy, and labor relations. Violations\nof these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us or our officers,\nprohibitions on doing business, and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations in connection with the\nperformance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for monetary damages, fines, unfavorable\npublicity, and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations. Due to the varying\ndegrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws may be insufficient to\nprotect our rights.\nIn many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in the local business community might\nnot conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption regulations, including the United\nStates Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits giving anything of value intended to influence the awarding of\ngovernment contracts.

Our intangible assets are evaluated for\nimpairment based on qualitative factors or upon cash flows and estimated royalties from revenue streams\n(indefinite-lived intangible assets) if necessary. Our goodwill is evaluated through qualitative factors and by comparing\nthe fair value of the reporting units to the carrying value of our net assets if necessary. Although our current sales, cash\nflows, and market capitalization are sufficient to support the carrying basis of these long-lived assets, if our sales, cash\nflows, or common stock price decline, we may be faced with significant asset impairment charges that would have an\nadverse impact upon our results of operations.\nThe Company’s use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact our financial results.\nOur most critical accounting estimates are described in Management’s Discussion and Analysis found in Item 7 of this\nreport under the section entitled ‘‘Use of Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies.’’ In addition, as discussed in\nvarious footnotes to our financial statements as found in Item 8, we make certain estimates for loss contingencies,\nincluding decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. Because, by definition, these estimates and assumptions\ninvolve the use of judgment, our actual financial results may differ from these estimates. If our estimates or\nassumptions underlying such contingencies and reserves prove incorrect, we may be required to record additional\nadjustments or losses relating to such matters, which would negatively affect our financial results.\nIneffective internal controls could impact our business and operating results.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent\nlimitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even\neffective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation\nof financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement\nrequired new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and\noperating results may be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nExtreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial\ncondition.\nExtreme weather conditions in the areas in which our suppliers, customers, distribution facilities, offices, and\nheadquarters are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, natural\ndisasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, and tsunamis, whether occurring in the United States or abroad,\nand their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, have in the past\ntemporarily disrupted, and could in the future disrupt, our operations, the operations of our customers, vendors and\nsuppliers or have in the past resulted in, and in the future could result in, economic instability that may negatively\nimpact our operating results and financial condition. In particular, if a natural disaster or severe weather event were to\noccur in an area in which we or our suppliers, customers, distribution facilities and vendors are located, our continued\nsuccess would depend, in part, on the safety and availability of the relevant personnel and facilities and proper\nfunctioning of our or third parties’ computer, network, telecommunication and other systems and operations. If we\nwere to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event or concurrent events, we could\nexperience operational challenges, in particular depending upon how a local or regional event may affect our human\ncapital across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations, such as key executive officers or\npersonnel. Further, if we are unable to find alternative suppliers, replace capacity at key distribution locations or\nquickly repair damage to our information technology systems, our ability to serve our customers could be adversely\naffected.

Constant currency is a\nnon-GAAP financial measure that removes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and is\ncalculated by translating the current period’s financial results at the same average exchange rates in effect during the\nprior year and then comparing this amount to the prior year.\nWe reference these non-GAAP financial measures in our decision making because they provide supplemental\ninformation that facilitates consistent internal comparisons to the historical operating performance of prior periods\nand we believe it provides investors with greater transparency to evaluate operational activities and financial results.\nFor a reconciliation of our segment Adjusted EBITDA to net income or loss, a related GAAP measure, please refer to\nNote 16 Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements as presented in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nGeneral Overview\nFranklin Covey Co. is a global company focused on individual and organizational performance improvement.

In the\ntraining and consulting marketplace, we believe there are three important characteristics that distinguish us from our\ncompetitors.\n1.\nWorld Class Content – Our content is based on timeless principles of human effectiveness and is designed\nto help people change both their mindset and behavior. When our content is applied consistently in an\norganization, we believe the culture of that organization will change to enable the organization to get desired\nresults and achieve its own great purposes.\n2.\nBreadth and Scalability of Delivery Options – We have a wide range of content delivery options,\nincluding: the All Access Pass, the Leader in Me membership, and other intellectual property licenses, digital\nonline learning, on-site training, training led through certified facilitators, blended learning, and\norganization-wide transformational processes, including consulting and coaching.

Increased sales during fiscal 2022 were primarily driven by strong subscription and subscription\nservices sales, including the following:\n•\nAll Access Pass subscription and subscription services sales grew 28 percent to $144.5 million in fiscal 2022\ncompared with $112.5 million in fiscal 2021. In our Enterprise Division, where most AAP contracts are sold,\nsales increased 15 percent to $194.4 million compared with $168.6 million in the prior year.\n•\nEducation Division revenues grew 26 percent to $61.9 million on the strength of increased Leader in Me\nmembership revenues and subscription services, including coaching and consulting, and sales of materials.\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Education Division added a record 739 new Leader in Me schools in the United States\nand Canada.\n•\nTotal Company deferred revenue at August 31, 2022 topped $100 million for the first time and totaled\n$102.4 million. The sum of billed subscription and unbilled deferred subscription revenue at August 31, 2022\ngrew 20 percent to $153.4 million, compared with August 31, 2021. Approximately 46 percent of our AAP\nsubscriptions are now multi-year contracts.\nWe believe the momentum gained in fiscal 2022 will carry over into fiscal 2023 and generate additional growth. In\nOctober 2022, we launched the Impact Platform, which is our new interactive AAP platform based on technology we\nacquired from Strive Talent, Inc. in fiscal 2021. We believe our investments in technology, content, and people will\nalso generate future growth in fiscal 2023 and beyond.\nOur consolidated revenue for fiscal 2022 year grew 17 percent, or $38.7 million, to $262.8 million compared with\n$224.2 million in the prior year. Our sales in fiscal 2022 increased primarily due to strong sales of subscription and\nsubscription services, including a strong recovery of onsite training days. Despite unfavorable exchange rate\nfluctuations and ongoing challenges in the macroeconomic and operating environment during fiscal 2022, especially\nin Asia, our AAP and Leader in Me membership revenues increased compared with fiscal 2021 and each of our\noperating segments were able to increase sales over the prior year. On a constant currency basis, our sales for fiscal\n2022 increased 18 percent to $265.5 million. Our revenue growth in fiscal 2022 was driven primarily by a combination\nof contract renewals, expansions, and new customers as price increases did not have a material impact on our sales\ngrowth over fiscal 2021. Enterprise Division sales for the year increased 15 percent, or $25.8 million, to $194.4 million\ncompared with $168.6 million in the prior year, and were driven primarily by increased AAP revenues and recovering\nlicensee and international direct office revenues. All Access Pass subscription and subscription services sales grew\n28 percent in fiscal 2022, licensee revenues increased 17 percent, or $1.5 million, and international direct office sales\nincreased four percent, or $1.4 million, compared with fiscal 2021.

Our cost of sales includes\nthe direct costs of delivering content onsite at client locations, including presenter costs; amortization of previously\ncapitalized curriculum development costs; content royalties; materials used in the production of training products and\nrelated assessments; manufacturing labor costs; and freight. Gross profit may be affected by, among other things, the\nmix of services sold to clients, prices of materials, travel, labor rates, changes in product discount levels, and freight\ncosts. Consolidated cost of sales in fiscal 2022 totaled $60.9 million compared with $51.3 million for fiscal 2021. Our\ngross profit for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 increased 17 percent, or $29.0 million, to $201.9 million,\ncompared with $172.9 million in fiscal 2021, and increased primarily due to increased sales as described above. Our\ngross margin in fiscal 2022 remained strong at 76.8 percent of sales compared with 77.1 percent in the prior year.\nOur operating expenses in fiscal 2022 increased $13.4 million compared with fiscal 2021 primarily due to a\n$14.8 million increase in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses. Despite the increase in SG&A\nexpenses, as a percentage of revenue, our SG&A expenses in fiscal 2022 decreased to 60.8 percent compared with\n64.7 percent in fiscal 2021. Our SG&A expenses increased primarily due to increased associate costs resulting from\nnew personnel and increased salaries; increased commissions on higher sales; increased travel expense; increased\ncurriculum development expense; and increased marketing and advertising expenses. At August 31, 2022, we had\n300 client partners compared with 273 at August 31, 2021.\nOur fiscal 2022 income from operations improved 192 percent, or $15.6 million, to $23.7 million compared with\n$8.1 million in the prior year. Fiscal 2022 pre-tax income was $22.1 million compared with $6.1 million in fiscal 2021,\nreflecting the items noted above.\nOur effective income tax rate for fiscal 2022 was approximately 16 percent compared with an effective benefit rate of\napproximately 124 percent in fiscal 2021 on pre-tax income of $6.1 million. Our unusual income tax benefit in fiscal\n2021 was primarily the result of a $10.5 million reduction in the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax\nassets, based on a return to a three-year cumulative pre-tax income measurement during fiscal 2021, and the outlook\nfor continued strong financial performance. Our effective rate in fiscal 2022 benefitted from decreasing the valuation\nallowances against other deferred tax assets during the year.\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n81"

Our Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2022 increased 51 percent,\nor $14.2 million, to $42.2 million compared with $28.0 million in fiscal 2021, reflecting the above-noted factors.\nFurther details regarding these items can be found in the comparative analysis of fiscal 2022 with fiscal 2021 as\ndiscussed within this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.\nOur liquidity, financial position, and capital resources remained strong during fiscal 2022. At August 31, 2022, we had\n$60.5 million of cash, with no borrowings on our $15.0 million revolving credit facility, compared with $47.4 million of\ncash, and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility, at August 31, 2021.

For further information regarding our liquidity and cash flows, refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources\ndiscussion found within this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.\nFor a discussion of the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal\n2020, refer to Part II, Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nin our fiscal 2021 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on\nNovember 12, 2021.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Financial Statements\nCOVID-19 was first identified in China during December 2019, and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World\nHealth Organization. Since its discovery, COVID-19 and its variants have surfaced in nearly all regions around the\nworld and have resulted in government-imposed travel restrictions and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected\nareas. These closures had a significant adverse impact on our business beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2020.\nAfter a strong start to fiscal 2020, our sales in the third and fourth quarters decreased 29 percent compared with the\nthird and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019.\nHowever, as individuals and businesses began adapting to pandemic-related circumstances, our business also began to\nrecover. Driven primarily by previous changes to a subscription-based business model, we were able to quickly pivot\nto delivering content live-online and through our other digital modalities. As a result, our subscription service clients\nare able to access content and programs from remote locations, which allows continued engagement of personnel and\nstudents during long periods of displacement from normal working or classroom conditions. The ability to deliver\nhigh-quality content to our clients, combined with adaptations to the pandemic and loosening restrictions provided a\npath to recovery in fiscal 2021 and our sales increased 13 percent compared with fiscal 2020. Through successful\nefforts to contain costs and reduced travel expense, our profitability also improved significantly in fiscal 2021.\nThe momentum and recovery achieved in fiscal 2021 provided a strong foundation for fiscal 2022 as our sales and\nprofitability improved over fiscal 2021, as previously discussed. However, certain areas of our operations continue to\nbe adversely impacted from the lingering effects of the pandemic. Our direct offices in China and Japan, and many of\nour international licensee partners continue to experience significant business disruptions from continued\ngovernmental and individual efforts to address the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 virus and its variants. While we\nremain optimistic about the future, continued ‘‘zero tolerance’’ and similar policies may continue to hamper business\nactivity in fiscal 2023 and in future periods in certain countries and geographic regions through implementation of\nadditional lockdowns or restrictions. We will continue to monitor developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic,\nincluding personnel and supply chain issues, and their actual and potential impacts on our financial position, results of\noperations, and liquidity.\nKey Strategic Objectives\nWe believe following key strategic priorities will position us for continued growth in fiscal 2023 and beyond:\n•\nIncrease the Impact and Scale of Our Solutions – We intend to build the capabilities to dramatically\nincrease the impact and scale of our solutions with significant investments in people, content, and\ntechnology. During fiscal 2023 and future periods, we expect to hire new leaders, salespeople, and team\nmembers; offer new and refreshed content and solutions; launch the new Impact Platform, which is built on\nthe technology we acquired from Strive in fiscal 2021; work to integrate content, client personnel, and\n82\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

We consistently seek to provide our clients\nworld-class solutions, using the best technology, that will allow them to transform their organizations into\nhigh performing entities.\n•\nRefresh our Brand and Messaging – We are focused on telling our story more broadly and powerfully, with\nthe goal of helping significantly more people understand what we do and how we can help them. In\nJanuary 2022, we launched a new brand that was designed to reflect our development into content and\ntechnology while retaining our connection to the principles that have driven our growth over the years. The\nnew branding has brought more visitors to our website, registered more people for our marketing events,\nand generated more thought leadership guide downloads than ever before. We seek to increase the visibility\nof our services to a much larger audience and believe these efforts will provide added opportunities in the\ntraining marketplace.\n•\nAccelerate the Flywheel – We seek to build on the momentum of our subscription businesses, which are\ncentered around the All Access Pass in the Enterprise Division and the Leader in Me membership in the\nEducation Division. During fiscal 2022, we achieved our highest logo and revenue retention and delivered\nthe most training and coaching in our history. Additionally, we added the most new schools in our history\nand had close to the highest level of school retention in history. With millions of AAP users throughout\nthousands of organizations globally and many thousands of students in schools around the world, we believe\nthat our growth and building momentum have established a strong foundation for future growth and\naccelerating the ‘‘flywheel’’ of results for our clients, associates, and shareholders.\n•\nInvest in and Expand Our Culture – We believe that we are the workplace of choice for achievers with heart.\nDuring fiscal 2022 we sought to expand and improve our culture by launching a new set of corporate values,\nfocusing our teams on making a culture commitment, and standardizing our communication and\ncollaboration toolset. We strive to maintain a culture that provides a great place to work and allows\nindividuals to contribute their best talents and abilities. We believe this atmosphere produces better\nsolutions for our clients and feelings of well-being and satisfaction for our associates. Through our efforts to\nimprove our culture, we have made great progress in our diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and\ncreated a welcoming environment for the many new and talented associates that joined us during fiscal 2022.\nWe believe the pursuit of these strategic priorities will enable us to be the most trusted leadership company in the\nworld by providing world-class solutions to our clients that will improve their organizations, by creating a rewarding\nand appealing environment for our associates, and by driving results that will provide return to our shareholders.\nOther key factors that influence our operating results include: the number of organizations that are active customers;\nthe number of people trained within those organizations; the continuation or renewal of existing services contracts,\nespecially subscription renewals; the availability of budgeted training spending at our clients and prospective clients,\nwhich, in certain content categories, can be significantly influenced by general economic conditions; client satisfaction\nwith our offerings and services; the number and productivity of our international licensee operations; and our ability\nto manage operating costs necessary to develop and provide meaningful offerings and related products to our clients.\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n83"

      "text": "The performance of our international direct offices during fiscal 2022 was directly related to the level of recovery from\nthe pandemic and corresponding business activity in each country. For fiscal 2022, sales increased in each of our\ninternational direct offices, except for China, which had a resurgence of COVID cases during fiscal 2022 and enacted\nstrict lockdown measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. Sales growth during fiscal 2022 was led by our office in\nthe United Kingdom, which grew 41 percent compared with fiscal 2021 and was followed by strong growth at our\noffices in Australia, and Germany/Switzerland/Austria. While we remain confident in our international direct offices’\nability to grow in future periods, growth in our China and Japan offices is expected to be slowed by mandated\nrestrictions aimed to curb the ongoing pandemic and prevailing economic conditions in those countries. Foreign\nexchange rates had a $2.0 million unfavorable impact on our Direct Office sales and a $0.5 million adverse effect on\noperating income during fiscal 2022.\nGross Profit. Direct Office gross profit increased primarily due to sales growth as previously described. Direct Office\ngross margin remained strong, and was 80.5 percent compared with 81.1 percent in the prior year.\nSG&A Expense. Direct Office SG&A expense for fiscal 2022 increased primarily due to increased associate costs from\nnew personnel and increased salaries; increased commissions on higher sales; the acquisition of Strive Talent, Inc.,\nwhich was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2021; increased platform and content development expense; and\nincreased travel costs.\nInternational Licensees Segment\nIn foreign locations where we do not have a directly owned office, our training and consulting services are delivered\nthrough independent licensees.

Our international licensee revenues are primarily comprised of royalty revenues. During fiscal 2022, our licensee\nrevenues increased primarily due to increased royalty revenues from certain licensees as economies in many of the\ncountries where our licensees operate continue to recover from the pandemic. The ongoing recovery led to improved\nlicensee royalty revenues and continued increases in our share of AAP sales. Compared with the prior year, our royalty\nrevenues increased 11 percent and our share of AAP revenues increased by 108 percent to $1.4 million. We receive\nadditional revenue from the international licensees for AAP sales to cover a portion of the costs of operating the AAP\nportal. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased service revenues through our licensee support team and\ndecreased wholesale product sales. Foreign exchange rates had a $0.4 million unfavorable impact on international\nlicensee revenues and operating results during fiscal 2022.\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased primarily due to increased royalty revenues and AAP revenues as previously\ndescribed. Gross margin improved primarily due to the mix of revenue recognized during fiscal 2022, which included\nmore royalty and AAP revenues and less licensee support and product revenues than the prior year.\nSG&A Expense.

Education Division sales for fiscal 2022 grew 26 percent, or $13.0 million, on the strength of increased Leader in\nMe subscription revenues and subscription services, including coaching and consulting, and sales of materials used by\nschools in connection with their membership subscription. During fiscal 2022, the Education Division added a record\n739 new Leader in Me schools in the United States and Canada, which is a 29 percent increase over fiscal 2021, and\nretained nearly 90 percent of its existing Leader in Me schools in the United States and Canada. Education Division\nsubscription and subscription related revenue increased 29 percent compared with fiscal 2021. Following the\nchallenges in the educational environment over the past couple of years related to the pandemic and its recovery, we\nwere very encouraged by the growth of our Education Division during fiscal 2022 and believe this growth sets a strong\nfoundation for future sales growth as schools and districts realize the value of the Leader in Me membership for both\nstudents and teachers. Foreign exchange rates had a $0.1 million unfavorable impact on Education Division sales and\noperating income during fiscal 2022. As of August 31, 2022, the Leader in Me program is used in over 3,300 schools in\nthe United States and Canada, compared with nearly 2,900 schools at August 31, 2021.\nGross Profit. Education Division gross profit increased primarily due to increased sales as previously described.\nEducation segment gross margin remained strong at 66.6 percent of sales compared with 67.0 percent in the prior\nyear.\nSG&A Expenses. Education SG&A expenses increased primarily due to increased associate costs from additional\ncommission expense on improved sales, additional sales support headcount, and increased salaries compared with the\nprior year. In addition, travel expenses rose due to increased travel days by associates compared with the pandemic\nperiods and an increase in the costs of traveling.\nOther Operating Expense Items\nDepreciation – Depreciation expense decreased $1.3 million compared with the prior year primarily due to the full\ndepreciation of certain assets during the fiscal year and reduced capital expenditures in the past couple of years. We\ncurrently expect depreciation expense will total approximately $5.7 million in fiscal 2023.\nAmortization – Amortization expense increased $0.3 million compared with fiscal 2021 primarily due to the\nacquisition of Strive Talent, Inc. during the third quarter of fiscal 2021. We currently expect amortization expense will\ntotal $4.3 million during fiscal 2023.\nInterest Expense – Our interest expense during fiscal 2022 decreased $0.4 million primarily due to reduced term loan\ndebt and a reduced principal balance on our financing obligation (long-term lease on our corporate campus)\ncompared with the prior year. However, rising interest rates in future periods may partially offset the benefit of lower\ndebt balances during fiscal 2023 and future periods.\n86\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

Our effective income tax rate\nfor fiscal 2022 was lower than the statutory rate due primarily to a $2.8 million decrease in the valuation allowance\nagainst our deferred income tax assets and a $0.6 million benefit for share-based compensation deductions in excess of\nthe corresponding book expense. These tax benefits were partially offset by tax expense of $1.2 million for\nnon-deductible executive compensation. The income tax benefit rate recognized in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to a\n$10.5 million decrease in the valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets and a $0.5 million tax benefit\nfrom the exercise of stock options, which were partially offset by a $0.8 million reduction in foreign tax credit\ncarryforwards.\nWe paid $3.2 million in cash for income taxes during fiscal 2022.

      "text": "In normal operating years, our fourth quarter typically has higher sales and operating income than other fiscal\nquarters primarily due to increased revenues in our Education Division (when school administrators and faculty have\nprofessional development days) and from increased sales that typically occur during that quarter resulting from\nyear-end incentive programs. Overall, subscription service and training sales are moderately seasonal because of the\ntiming of corporate training, which is not typically scheduled as heavily during holiday and certain vacation periods.\nQuarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including increased subscription sales, the introduction of\nnew offerings, pandemics or other natural disasters, business acquisitions, the addition of new organizational\ncustomers, and the elimination of underperforming offerings.\nFor more information on our quarterly results of operations, refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as filed with\nthe SEC. Our quarterly reports for the periods indicated are available free of charge at www.sec.gov.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nIntroduction\nOur cash balance at August 31, 2022 totaled $60.5 million, with no borrowings on our $15.0 million revolving credit\nfacility. Of our $60.5 million in cash at August 31, 2022, $16.9 million was held outside the U.S. by our foreign\nsubsidiaries. We routinely repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries and consider cash generated from foreign\nactivities a key component of our overall liquidity position. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from the\nsale of services and products in the normal course of business and available proceeds from our credit facility. Our\nprimary uses of liquidity include payments for operating activities, purchases of our common stock, debt payments,\ncapital expenditures (including curriculum development), working capital expansion, business acquisitions, and\ncontingent payments from previous business acquisitions.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the past three\nyears (in thousands):\nYEAR ENDED AUGUST 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020\nTotal cash provided by (used for):\nOperating activities\n$ 52,254\n$ 46,177\n$ 27,563\nInvesting activities\n(5,331)\n(14,315)\n(11,865)\nFinancing activities\n(32,670)\n(11,479)\n(16,557)\nEffect of exchange rates on cash\n(1,153)\n(103)\n297\nIncrease (decrease) in cash and\ncash equivalents\n$ 13,100\n$ 20,280\n$\n(562)\nOur Current Credit Agreement\nOn August 7, 2019, we entered into a new credit agreement (the 2019 Credit Agreement) with our existing lender,\nwhich replaced our amended and restated credit agreement dated March 2011. The 2019 Credit Agreement provides\nup to $25.0 million in term loans and a $15.0 million revolving line of credit, which expires in August 2024. Upon\nentering into the 2019 Credit Agreement, we borrowed $20.0 million through a term loan and used the proceeds to\nrepay all indebtedness under the previous credit agreement. During November 2019, we borrowed the remaining\n$5.0 million term loan available on the 2019 Credit Agreement.\nIn anticipation of potential covenant compliance issues associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainties\nassociated with the economic recovery, on July 8, 2020, we entered into the First Modification Agreement to the 2019\nCredit Agreement. The primary purpose of the First Modification Agreement was to provide temporary alternative\nborrowing covenants for the fiscal quarters ending August 31, 2020 through May 31, 2021. In connection with the\nacquisition of Strive Talent, Inc. in April 2021, we entered into a Consent and Second Modification Agreement to the\n2019 Credit Agreement.\n88\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

      "text": "The primary purposes of the Consent and Second Modification Agreement were to:\n•\nConsent to the purchase of Strive.\n•\nReinstate the original debt covenants of the 2019 Credit Agreement which were temporarily replaced by\nalternate debt covenants in the First Modification Agreement to the 2019 Credit Agreement.\n•\nReduce the interest rate for borrowings from LIBOR plus 3.0 percent to LIBOR plus 1.85 percent, which was\nthe original rate on the 2019 Credit Agreement. The unused credit commitment fee also returns to the\npreviously established 0.2 percent. The 2019 Credit Agreement contains provisions for adopting alternative\ninterest rate measures when LIBOR is discontinued, which we do not believe will have a material impact on\nour interest expense.\nThe Consent and Second Modification Agreement did not change any repayment or credit availability terms on the\n2019 Credit Agreement.\nAt August 31, 2022, our reinstated debt covenants consist of the following: (i) a Funded Indebtedness to Adjusted\nEBITDAR Ratio of less than 3.00 to 1.00; (ii) a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio not less than 1.15 to 1.00; (iii) an annual\nlimit on capital expenditures (excluding capitalized curriculum development costs) of $8.0 million; and\n(iv) consolidated accounts receivable of not less than 150 percent of the aggregate amount of the outstanding\nborrowings on the revolving line of credit, the undrawn amount of outstanding letters of credit, and the amount of\nunreimbursed letter of credit disbursements. In the event of noncompliance with these financial covenants and other\ndefined events of default, the lender is entitled to certain remedies, including acceleration of the repayment of any\namounts outstanding on the 2019 Credit Agreement. At August 31, 2022, we believe that we were in compliance with\nthe terms and covenants applicable to the 2019 Credit Agreement and subsequent modifications.\nIn addition to our term loan obligations and notes payable to the former owners of Strive Talent, Inc., we have a\nlong-term lease on our corporate campus that is accounted for as a financing obligation. For further information on\nour debt and leasing obligations, refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements as presented in Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following discussion is a description of the primary factors affecting our cash flows and their effects upon our\nliquidity and capital resources during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur primary source of cash from operating activities was the sale of services and products to our customers in the\nnormal course of business. The primary uses of cash for operating activities were payments for selling, general, and\nadministrative expenses; payments for direct costs necessary to conduct training programs; payments to suppliers for\nmaterials used in training manuals sold; and to fund working capital needs. During fiscal 2022, our cash provided by\noperating activities increased 13 percent to $52.3 million compared with $46.2 million in fiscal 2021. The increase was\nprimarily due to improved operating income, strong collections of accounts receivable, and favorable changes in\nworking capital. Despite ongoing pandemic conditions in certain countries, our collection of accounts receivable\nremained strong during fiscal 2022 and provided the necessary cash to support our operations, pay our obligations,\nand make critical investments.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities and Capital Expenditures\nOur cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2022 totaled $5.3 million. The primary uses of cash for investing\nactivities during the year were purchases of property and equipment in the normal course of business and additional\ninvestments in the development of our offerings.\nOur purchases of property and equipment during fiscal 2022 consisted primarily of computer hardware and software,\nand leasehold improvements on our corporate campus. We expect to continue investing in our content and delivery\nmodalities, including the AAP and Leader in Me subscription service portals, and also expect to make required\nleasehold improvements on our corporate campus in future periods. We currently anticipate that our purchases of\nproperty and equipment will total $7.6 million in fiscal 2023.\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n89"

      "text": "We spent $2.2 million during fiscal 2022 on the development of various content and offerings. We believe continued\ninvestment in our content and offerings is key to future growth and the development of our subscription offerings. We\ncurrently expect that our capital spending for curriculum development will increase in future periods and will total\n$9.5 million during fiscal 2023.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDuring the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, our net cash used for financing activities totaled $32.7 million. Our\nprimary uses of financing cash during fiscal 2022 included $23.9 million for purchases of our common stock for\ntreasury, $8.7 million used for principal payments on our term loans, financing obligation, and Strive note payable,\nand $1.4 million of cash used to pay contingent consideration liabilities from previous business acquisitions. Our\npurchases of common stock during fiscal 2022 were comprised of $20.3 million from open market purchases and\n$3.5 million for shares withheld from participants to pay statutory income taxes on stock-based compensation awards\nwhich were distributed during fiscal 2022. Partially offsetting these uses of cash were $1.3 million of proceeds from\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan participants to purchase shares of our stock during fiscal 2022.\nOn November 15, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a new plan to purchase up to $40.0 million of the Company’s\noutstanding common stock. The previously existing common stock repurchase plan was canceled and the new\ncommon share repurchase plan does not have an expiration date. At August 31, 2022, we had $19.5 million of\nauthorized purchases remaining under this board-approved plan. Our uses of financing cash during fiscal 2023 are\nexpected to include required payments on our term loans, financing obligation, note payable from the acquisition of\nStrive, contingent consideration payments from previous business acquisitions, and may include purchases of our\ncommon stock for treasury.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposes a one percent excise tax on purchases of our common stock beginning\non January 1, 2023. This new tax may reduce the number of shares that we purchase on the open market in future\nperiods through our approved common stock purchase plan. However, the timing and amount of common stock\npurchases is dependent on a number of factors, including available resources and market conditions, and we are not\nobligated to make purchases of our common stock during any future period.\nSources of Cash and Liquidity\nWe expect to meet our projected capital expenditures, repay amounts borrowed on our 2019 Credit Agreement,\nservice our existing financing obligation, and meet other working capital requirements during fiscal 2023 from current\ncash balances, future cash flows from operating activities, and available borrowings from our revolving line of credit.\nGoing forward, we will continue to incur costs necessary for the day-to-day operation and potential growth of the\nbusiness and may use our available revolving line of credit and other financing alternatives, if necessary, for these\nexpenditures. At August 31, 2022, we had $15.0 million of available borrowing capacity on our revolving line of credit.\nOur 2019 Credit Agreement expires in August 2024 and we expect to renew or amend the 2019 Credit Agreement on\na regular basis to maintain the long-term borrowing capacity of this credit facility. Additional potential sources of\nliquidity available to us include factoring receivables, issuance of additional equity, or issuance of debt from public or\nprivate sources. If necessary, we will evaluate all of these options and select one or more of them depending on overall\ncapital needs and the associated cost of capital. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and other macroeconomic\ndifficulties has created uncertainty in capital markets, which may limit our ability to access liquidity on favorable\nterms, or at all.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operating activities, and availability of\nexternal funds as described above, will be sufficient for us to maintain our operations over the next 12 months.\nHowever, our ability to maintain adequate capital for our operations in the future is dependent upon a number of\nfactors, including sales trends, macroeconomic activity, our ability to contain costs, levels of capital expenditures,\ncollection of accounts receivable, and other factors. Some of the factors that influence our operations are not within\nour control, such as general economic conditions and the introduction of new offerings or technology by our\ncompetitors.\n90\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

      "text": "During the periods presented within this Annual Report, inflation has not had a material effect on our operations.\nHowever, economic conditions indicate that future inflationary pressure may have an impact on a variety of our\noperating costs, including associate compensation, benefit costs, travel costs, and the price of materials used in the\nproduction of training products and related accessories, including paper and related raw materials. We may not be\nable to pass on such increased costs to our customers.\nWe will continue to monitor our liquidity position and may pursue additional financing alternatives, as described\nabove, to maintain sufficient resources for future growth and capital requirements. However, there can be no\nassurance such financing alternatives will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nWe do not operate any manufacturing, mining, or other capital-intensive facilities, and we have not structured any\nspecial purpose entities, or participated in any commodity trading activities, which would expose us to potential\nundisclosed liabilities or create adverse consequences to our liquidity. However, we have cash expenditures and are\nsubject to various contractual obligations that are required to run our business. As discussed above, general economic\nconditions indicate that future inflationary pressure may affect these expenditures. Our material cash requirements\ninclude the following:\n•\nAssociate and Consultant Compensation – Associate and consultant compensation is our largest\nrecurring use of cash. Our compensation plans for associates and delivery consultants include fixed (salaried)\nand variable (commissions, bonuses, etc.) elements as well as the cost of benefits, and may fluctuate with\nsales, financial results, and hiring/retention activity. During fiscal 2022, we expensed approximately\n$161 million for associate and delivery consultant cash compensation. Associate compensation expense is\nincluded in SG&A expense and consultant compensation is included in our cost of sales. These associate\ncosts include variable compensation such as commissions, incentives, and bonuses, and may fluctuate from\nyear-to-year.\n•\nInformation Technology – Our business is reliant on computer software and hardware. Our subscription\nservice portals require ongoing development, recurring maintenance, and utilize various software. In\naddition, we utilize various software programs to run our business, including applications for customer\nresource management, general ledger, cybersecurity, spreadsheets, word processing, e-mail, etc. Including\ncapitalized hardware and software, we spent approximately $8 million for information technology software\nand hardware during fiscal 2022. We expect spending related to our AAP subscription and Leader in Me\nmembership service portals to increase in future years.\n•\nContent Development – We believe that ongoing investment in our content and offerings is key to our\nfuture success. Our innovations group is responsible for the development of new content as well as\nrefreshing and maintaining our existing content. Including capitalized development, we spent approximately\n$7 million (excluding compensation discussed above) for the development and maintenance of our offerings\nand content in fiscal 2022.\n•\nIncome Taxes – We are required to pay income taxes in the various jurisdictions where we operate. During\nfiscal 2022, we paid $3.2 million in cash for income taxes during fiscal 2022. Our use of cash for income taxes\nin future periods depends upon our profitability and our ability to utilize tax assets such as net operating loss\ncarryforwards and foreign income tax credits.\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n91"

We\nreassess the fair value of estimated contingent consideration payments each quarter based on available information. The actual payment of\ncontingent consideration amounts may differ in amount and timing from those shown in the table.\n(3)\nContingent compensation from the acquisition of Strive Talent, Inc. is based on current estimates and projections and includes a $1.0 million\nbonus payable to Strive employees that are employed 18 months from the acquisition date. After forfeitures and early payments, this amount\nis expected to be $0.6 million in fiscal 2023. The actual payment of Strive contingent compensation amounts may differ in amount and timing\nfrom those shown in the table and we may pay these obligations with shares of our common stock or in cash at our sole discretion.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America. The significant accounting policies that we used to prepare our consolidated financial\nstatements are outlined primarily in Note 1 and in Note 2 (revenue recognition policies) to the consolidated financial\nstatements, which are presented in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Some of those accounting policies require us to\nmake assumptions and use judgments that may affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements.\nManagement regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions and bases those estimates and assumptions on\nhistorical experience, factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and requirements under\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Actual results may differ from these\nestimates under different assumptions or conditions, including changes in economic and political conditions and\nother circumstances that are not within our control, but which may have an impact on these estimates and our actual\nfinancial results.\nThe following items require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimates:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers (Topic 606). For the All Access Pass, judgment is required to determine whether the intellectual property\nand web-based functionality and content are considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and\naccounted for together.\nWe have determined to account for the AAP as a single performance obligation and recognize the associated\ntransaction price ratably over the term of the underlying contract beginning on the commencement date of each\ncontract, which is the date the Company’s platforms and resources are made available to the customer. This\ndetermination was reached after considering that our web-based functionality and content, in combination with our\nintellectual property, each represent inputs that transform into a combined output that represents the intended\noutcome of the AAP, which is to provide a continuously accessible, customized, and dynamic learning and\ndevelopment solution only accessible through the AAP platform.\n92\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

      "text": "Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (SSP) for each distinct performance obligation in a\nrevenue contract. Where we have more than one distinct performance obligation, we must allocate the transaction\nprice to each performance obligation based on its relative SSP. The SSP is the price which we would sell a promised\nproduct or service separately to a customer. In determining the SSP, we consider the size and volume of transactions,\nprice lists, historical sales, and contract prices. We may modify our pricing from time-to-time in the future, which\ncould result in changes to the SSP.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOur shareholders have approved performance-based long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) that provide for grants of\nstock-based performance awards to certain managerial personnel and executive management as directed by the\nOrganization and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The number of common shares that are vested\nand issued to LTIP participants is variable and is based upon the achievement of specified performance objectives\nduring defined service periods. Due to the variable number of common shares that may be issued under the LTIP, we\nreevaluate our LTIP grants on a quarterly basis and adjust the expected vesting dates and number of shares expected\nto be awarded based upon actual and estimated financial results of the Company compared with the performance\ngoals set for the award. Adjustments to the number of shares awarded, and to the corresponding compensation\nexpense, are made on a cumulative basis at the adjustment date based upon the new estimated probable number of\ncommon shares to be awarded.\nThe analysis of our LTIP awards contains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and judgments\nabout the timing and/or the eventual number of shares that will vest in each LTIP grant. The assumptions and\njudgments that are essential to the analysis include forecasted sales and operating income levels during the LTIP\nservice periods. These forecasted amounts may be difficult to predict over the life of the LTIP awards due to changes\nin our business, such as from the introduction of subscription-based services, or other external factors, such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and their impact on our financial results. Events such as these may leave some previously\napproved performance measures obsolete or unattainable. The evaluation of LTIP performance awards and the\ncorresponding use of estimated amounts may produce additional volatility in our consolidated financial statements as\nwe record cumulative adjustments to the estimated service periods and number of common shares to be awarded\nunder the LTIP grants as described above. For example, uncertainties associated with the impact of and expected\nrecovery from the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant reversal of previously recognized performance award\nstock-based compensation expense during fiscal 2020.\nAccounts Receivable Valuation\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Our allowance for doubtful\naccounts calculations contain uncertainties because the calculations require us to make assumptions and judgments\nregarding the collectability of customer accounts, which may be influenced by a number of factors that are not within\nour control, such as the financial health of each customer. We regularly review the collectability assumptions of our\nallowance for doubtful accounts calculation and compare them against historical collections. Adjustments to the\nassumptions may either increase or decrease our total allowance for doubtful accounts and may adversely impact our\nfinancial results. For example, a 10 percent increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts at August 31, 2022 would\ndecrease our reported income from operations by approximately $0.4 million.\nFor further information regarding the calculation of our allowance for doubtful accounts, refer to the notes to our\nfinancial statements as presented in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nValuation of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nIntangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life and goodwill balances are not amortized, but rather are\ntested for impairment on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that a potential\nimpairment exists. The Covey trade name intangible asset originated from the merger with the Covey Leadership\nCenter in 1997 and has been deemed to have an indefinite life. This intangible asset is quantitatively tested for\nimpairment using the present value of estimated royalties on trade name related revenues, which consist primarily of\ntraining seminars and related products, and international licensee royalties.\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n93"

      "text": "Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price for a business acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net\ntangible and identified intangible assets acquired. Under current accounting guidance, an annual or interim goodwill\nimpairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and an\nimpairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.\nWe tested goodwill for impairment at August 31, 2022 at the reporting unit level using a qualitative approach. We\ndetermined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was more than their\ncarrying values. This determination required judgment to estimate future cash flows and operating results and\nconsidered current operating results, expected future operating results, and various other factors such as\nmacroeconomic conditions. Some of these factors are not within our control.\nOn an interim basis, we consider whether events or circumstances are present that may lead to the determination that\ngoodwill may be impaired. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following:\n•\nsignificant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;\n•\nsignificant change in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business;\n•\nsignificant change in prevailing interest rates;\n•\nsignificant negative industry or economic trend;\n•\nsignificant change in market capitalization relative to book value; and/or\n•\nsignificant negative change in market multiples of the comparable company set.\nIf, based on events or changing circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting\nunit does not exceed its carrying value, we would be required to test goodwill for impairment.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and\nassumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate\nprojected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and determination\nof appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but\nthat are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we\nmake certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for\neach of our reporting units. The timing and frequency of our goodwill impairment tests are based on an ongoing\nassessment of events and circumstances that would indicate a possible impairment. Based on the results of our\ngoodwill impairment analysis during fiscal 2022, we determined that no impairment existed at August 31, 2022, as we\ndetermined that it was more likely than not that each reportable operating segment’s estimated fair value exceeded its\ncarrying value. We will continue to monitor our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment and conduct formal\ntests when impairment indicators are present.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived tangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We use an estimate\nof undiscounted future net cash flows of the assets over their remaining useful lives in determining whether the\ncarrying value of the assets is recoverable. If the carrying values of the assets exceed the anticipated future cash flows\nof the assets, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the\nasset to the asset’s estimated fair value, which may be based upon discounted cash flows over the estimated remaining\nuseful life of the asset. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new\ncost basis, which is then depreciated or amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset. Impairment of long-lived\nassets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent from other\ngroups of assets.\nOur impairment evaluation calculations contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and apply\njudgment in order to estimate future cash flows, forecast the useful lives of the assets, and select a discount rate that\nreflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.

      "text": "long-lived assets impairment assessment methodology, if forecasts and assumptions used to support the carrying value\nof our long-lived tangible and finite-lived intangible assets change in the future, significant impairment charges could\nresult that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAcquisitions and Contingent Consideration Liabilities\nWe record acquisitions resulting in the consolidation of an enterprise using the purchase method of accounting.\nUnder this method, the acquiring company records the assets acquired, including intangible assets that can be\nidentified and named, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The\npurchase price in excess of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. If the\nassets acquired, net of liabilities assumed, are greater than the purchase price paid, then a bargain purchase has\noccurred and the Company will recognize the gain immediately in earnings. Among other sources of relevant\ninformation, we use independent appraisals or other valuations to assist in determining the estimated fair values of the\nassets and liabilities. Various assumptions are used in the determination of these estimated fair values including\ndiscount rates, market and volume growth rates, product or service selling prices, cost structures, royalty rates, and\nother prospective financial information.\nAdditionally, we are required to reassess the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities resulting from business\nacquisitions at each reporting period. Although subsequent changes to the contingent consideration liabilities do not\naffect the goodwill generated from the acquisition transaction, the valuation of expected contingent consideration\noften requires us to estimate future sales and/or profitability. These estimates require the use of numerous\nassumptions, many of which may change frequently and lead to increased or decreased operating income in future\nperiods. For instance, during fiscal 2022 we recorded $0.1 million of net increases to the fair value of our contingent\nconsideration liabilities compared with $0.2 million of increases during fiscal 2021, and approximately $49,000 of\ndecreases in fiscal 2020. Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recorded as a component\nof SG&A expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nWe regularly evaluate our United States federal and various state and foreign jurisdiction income tax exposures. We\naccount for certain aspects of our income tax provision using the provisions of ASC 740-10-05, which addresses the\ndetermination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the\nfinancial statements. We may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not\nthat the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the\nposition. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the\nlargest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon final settlement. The provisions of\nASC 740-10-05 also provide guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest, and penalties on income taxes,\naccounting for income taxes in interim periods, and require increased disclosure of various income tax items. Taxes\nand penalties are components of our overall income tax provision.\nWe record previously unrecognized tax benefits in the financial statements when it becomes more likely than not\n(greater than a 50 percent likelihood) that the tax position will be sustained. To assess the probability of sustaining a\ntax position, we consider all available evidence. In many instances, sufficient positive evidence may not be available\nuntil the expiration of the statute of limitations for audits by taxing jurisdictions, at which time the entire benefit will\nbe recognized as a discrete item in the applicable period.\nOur unrecognized tax benefits result from uncertain tax positions about which we are required to make assumptions\nand apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. The calculation of our\nincome tax provision or benefit, as applicable, requires estimates of future taxable income or losses. During the course\nof the fiscal year, these estimates are compared to actual financial results and adjustments may be made to our tax\nprovision or benefit to reflect these revised estimates. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax\nlaw and the results of tax audits by various jurisdictions. Although we believe that our judgments and estimates\ndiscussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we could be exposed to losses or gains that could be\nmaterial.\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n95"

      "text": "We establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate it is more likely than not that the tax assets\nwill not be realized. The determination of whether valuation allowances are needed on our deferred income tax assets\ncontains uncertainties because we must project future income, including the use of tax-planning strategies, by\nindividual tax jurisdictions. Changes in industry and economic conditions and the competitive environment may\nimpact the accuracy of our projections. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized\nand determine if adjustments to our valuation allowance are necessary. These evaluations may produce additional\nvolatility in our tax provision or benefit, net income or loss, and earnings or loss per share. For example, in\nconsideration of the relevant accounting guidance, we reevaluated our deferred tax assets during fiscal 2020 and\nconsidered both positive and negative evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that some portion or\nall of our deferred tax assets will be realized. Because of the cumulative pre-tax losses over the past three fiscal years,\ncombined with the expected continued disruptions and negative impact to our business resulting from uncertainties\nrelated to the recovery from the pandemic, we were unable to overcome accounting guidance indicating that it is\nmore-likely-than-not that insufficient taxable income will be available to realize all of our deferred tax assets before\nthey expire, which are primarily foreign tax credit carryforwards and a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards.\nAccordingly, we increased the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in fiscal 2020. Due to\nbetter-than-expected results in fiscal 2021, we reversed a substantial portion of these valuation allowances.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information on recent accounting pronouncements.\nREGULATORY COMPLIANCE\nWe are registered in states in which we do business that have a sales tax and we collect and remit sales or use tax on\nsales made in these jurisdictions.

Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast,\nindicate, or imply future results, performance, or achievements, and may contain words such as ‘‘believe,’’ ‘‘anticipate,’’\n‘‘expect,’’ ‘‘estimate,’’ ‘‘project,’’ or words or phrases of similar meaning. In our reports and filings we may make\nforward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our expectations about future sales levels and financial\nresults, expected effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, including effects on how we conduct our business and our\nresults of operations, the timing and duration of the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, future training and\nconsulting sales activity, expected benefits from the All Access Pass and the electronic delivery of our content,\nanticipated renewals of subscription offerings, the impact of new accounting standards on our financial condition and\nresults of operations, the amount and timing of capital expenditures, anticipated expenses, including SG&A expenses,\ndepreciation, and amortization, future gross margins, the release of new services or products, the adequacy of existing\ncapital resources, our ability to renew or extend our line of credit facility, the amount of cash expected to be paid for\nincome taxes, our ability to maintain adequate capital for our operations for at least the upcoming 12 months, the\nseasonality of future sales, future compliance with the terms and conditions of our line of credit, the ability to borrow\non our line of credit, expected collection of accounts receivable, estimated capital expenditures, and cash flow\nestimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets. These, and other forward-looking statements, are\nsubject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking\nstatements.

      "text": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket Risk of Financial Instruments\nWe are exposed to financial instrument market risk primarily through fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates\nand interest rates. To manage risks associated with foreign currency exchange and interest rates, we may make limited\nuse of derivative financial instruments. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from one or more\nunderlying financial instruments. As a matter of policy, our derivative instruments are entered into for periods\nconsistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions that are independent of those\nexposures. In addition, we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes, nor are we party\nto any leveraged derivative instrument. During the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we were not\nparty to any foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swap agreements, or similar derivative instruments.\nForeign Exchange Sensitivity\nDue to the global nature of our operations, we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated\nin currencies other than the United States dollar, as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in foreign\ncurrencies to United States dollars as a normal part of the reporting process. The objective of our foreign currency risk\nmanagement activities is to reduce foreign currency risk in the consolidated financial statements. In order to manage\nforeign currency risks, we may make limited use of foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency\nrelated derivative instruments.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nOur long-term liabilities primarily consist of term loans payable obtained from the lender on our 2019 Credit\nAgreement, a long-term lease agreement (financing obligation) associated with the previous sale of our corporate\nheadquarters, a note payable to the former owners of Strive, amounts borrowed on our revolving credit facility,\ndeferred income taxes, and contingent consideration payments resulting from our business acquisitions. Our overall\ninterest rate sensitivity is primarily influenced by any amounts borrowed on term loans or on our revolving line of\ncredit facility, and the prevailing interest rate on these instruments. The effective interest rate on the term loans and\nour revolving line of credit facility was 4.2 percent at August 31, 2022, and we may incur additional expense if interest\nrates increase in future periods. For example, a one percent increase in the interest rate on our term loans payable at\nAugust 31, 2022 would result in approximately $0.1 million of additional interest expense in fiscal 2023. We did not\nhave borrowings on our revolving credit facility at August 31, 2022 and our other obligations have fixed interest rates.\nOur financing obligation has a payment structure equivalent to a long-term leasing arrangement with a fixed interest\nrate of 7.7 percent and our note payable to the former owners of Strive has a fixed discount rate of 3.6 percent. Our\nother long-term liabilities do not include an interest component.\n98\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

(hereafter referred to as we, us, our, or the Company) is a global company specializing in\norganizational performance improvement. We help individuals and organizations achieve results that require a change\nin human behavior and our mission is to ‘‘enable greatness in people and organizations everywhere.’’ We have some of\nthe best-known offerings in the training industry, including a suite of individual-effectiveness and leadership-\ndevelopment training and products based on the best-selling books, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, The Speed\nof Trust, The Leader In Me, The Four Disciplines of Execution, and Multipliers, and proprietary content in the areas of\nLeadership, Execution, Productivity, Sales Performance, and Educational improvement. Our offerings are described in\nfurther detail at www.franklincovey.com and elsewhere in this report. Through our organizational research and\ncurriculum development efforts, we seek to consistently create, develop, and introduce new services and products that\nhelp individuals and organizations achieve their own great purposes.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on August 31 of each year and our fiscal quarters end on the last day of November, February, and\nMay. Unless otherwise noted, references to fiscal years apply to the 12 months ended August 31 of the specified year.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and our wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries, which consist of Franklin Development Corp., and our offices in Japan, China, the United Kingdom,\nAustralia, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in\nconsolidation.\nPervasiveness of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, shareholders’ equity, revenues,\nand expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nSome of our cash is deposited with financial institutions located throughout the United States of America and at banks\nin foreign countries where we operate subsidiary offices, and at times may exceed insured limits. We consider all\nhighly liquid debt instruments with an original maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We did\nnot hold a significant amount of investments that would be considered cash equivalent instruments at either\nAugust 31, 2022 or 2021. Of our $60.5 million in cash at August 31, 2022, $16.9 million was held outside the U.S. by\nour foreign subsidiaries. We routinely repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries and consider cash generated from\nforeign activities a key component of our overall liquidity position.\n106\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

      "text": "Inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined using the first-in, first-out\nmethod. Elements of cost in inventories generally include raw materials and direct labor. Cash flows from the sale of\ninventory are included in cash flows provided by operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Our\ninventories are comprised primarily of training materials, books, training-related accessories, and consisted of the\nfollowing (in thousands):\nAUGUST 31,\n2022\n2021\nFinished goods\n$3,519\n$2,468\nRaw materials\n8\n28\n$3,527\n$2,496\nProvision is made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value. In assessing the\nvaluation of our inventories, we make judgments regarding future demand requirements and compare these estimates\nwith current and committed inventory levels. Inventory requirements may change based on projected customer\ndemand, training curriculum life-cycle changes, and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories.\nOther Current Assets\nSignificant components of our other current assets were as follows (in thousands):\nAUGUST 31,\n2022\n2021\nDeferred commissions\n$12,598\n$10,991\nOther current assets\n1,969\n1,872\n$14,567\n$12,863\nWe defer commission expense on subscription-based sales and recognize the commission expense with the\nrecognition of the corresponding revenue.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation expense, which includes depreciation on our corporate\ncampus that is accounted for as a financing obligation (Note 7), is calculated using the straight-line method over the\nlesser of the expected useful life of the asset or the contracted lease period. We generally use the following depreciable\nlives for our major classifications of property and equipment:\nDescription\nUseful Lives\nBuildings\n20 years\nMachinery and equipment\n5–7 years\nComputer hardware and software\n3–5 years\nFurniture, fixtures, and leasehold improvements\n5–7 years\nOur property and equipment were comprised of the following (in thousands):\nAUGUST 31,\n2022\n2021\nLand and improvements\n$\n1,312\n$\n1,312\nBuildings\n30,038\n30,059\nMachinery and equipment\n543\n915\nComputer hardware and software\n26,030\n29,127\nFurniture, fixtures, and leasehold improvements\n9,287\n9,426\n67,210\n70,839\nLess accumulated depreciation\n(57,412)\n(59,314)\n$\n9,798\n$ 11,525\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n107"

Depreciation of capitalized subscription portal costs is included\nin depreciation expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived tangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We use an estimate\nof undiscounted future net cash flows of the assets over the remaining useful lives in determining whether the carrying\nvalue of the assets is recoverable. If the carrying values of the assets exceed the anticipated future cash flows of the\nassets, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying values of the assets and their\nestimated fair values. Impairment of long-lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable\ncash flows that are independent from other groups of assets. The evaluation of long-lived assets requires us to use\nestimates of future cash flows. If forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our long-lived tangible\nand finite-lived intangible assets change in the future, significant impairment charges could result that would\nadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. There were no long-lived asset impairment charges\nduring any of the periods presented in this report.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill Impairment Testing\nIntangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life and acquired goodwill are not amortized, but rather are\ntested for impairment on an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances indicate that a potential\nimpairment exists. The Covey trade name intangible asset has been deemed to have an indefinite life. This intangible\nasset is tested for impairment using qualitative factors or the present value of estimated royalties on trade name\nrelated revenues, which consist primarily of training seminars and work sessions, international licensee sales, and\nrelated products. Based on the fiscal 2022 evaluation of the Covey trade name, we believe the fair value of the Covey\ntrade name substantially exceeds its carrying value. No impairment charges were recorded against the Covey trade\nname during the periods presented in this report.\nGoodwill is recorded when the purchase price for a business acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net\ntangible and identified intangible assets acquired. We test goodwill for impairment each year on August 31 or upon\nthe occurrence of events or changes in circumstances which indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill is\nassigned to our reporting units, which are our operating segments, where discrete financial information is available\nthat is regularly reviewed by management to evaluate segment performance.\nDuring the annual impairment testing process, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment\n(commonly referred to as Step Zero) over relative events and circumstances to determine whether it is more likely\nthan not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or to perform a quantitative assessment\nwhere we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using both an income and market approach. At August 31,\n2022, we completed a Step Zero assessment and concluded there were no indicators of impairment. Refer to Note 5,\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill for further information on our goodwill.\nWhen we perform a quantitative analysis to assess the recoverability of our goodwill, we determine the estimated fair\nvalue of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. If the fair\nvalue is less than the carrying value of the net assets and related goodwill, an impairment charge is recognized for the\ndifference. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is calculated using a combination of the income approach\n(discounted cash flows) and the market approach (using market multiples derived from a set of companies with\ncomparable market characteristics). The value estimated using a discounted cash flow model is weighted against the\nestimated value derived from the guideline company market approach method. This market approach method\nestimates the price reasonably expected to be realized from the sale of the reporting unit based on comparable\ncompanies. In developing the discounted cash flow analysis, our assumptions about future revenues and expenses,\ncapital expenditures, and changes in working capital are based on our internal plan and assume a terminal growth rate\nthereafter. The discounted cash flow analysis is derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant\ninputs are not observable and constitute Level 3 fair value measures.\n108\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

      "text": "Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and\nassumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate\nprojected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and determination\nof appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but\nthat are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.\nCapitalized Curriculum Development Costs\nDuring the normal course of business, we develop training courses and related materials that we sell to our clients.\nCapitalized curriculum development costs include certain expenditures to develop course materials such as video\nsegments, course manuals, and other related materials. Our capitalized curriculum development spending in fiscal\n2022, which totaled $2.2 million, was primarily for various Education practice offerings and content for the AAP.\nCurriculum costs are capitalized when there is a major revision to an existing course that requires a significant\nre-write of the course materials. Costs incurred to maintain existing offerings are expensed when incurred. In\naddition, development costs incurred in the research and development of new offerings and software products to be\nsold, leased, or otherwise marketed are expensed as incurred until economic and technological feasibility has been\nestablished.\nCapitalized development costs are amortized over three- to five-year useful lives, which are based on numerous\nfactors, including expected cycles of major changes to our content. Capitalized curriculum development costs are\nreported as a component of other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $5.0 million and\n$6.2 million at August 31, 2022 and 2021. Amortization of capitalized curriculum development costs is reported as a\ncomponent of cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income\n(loss).\nAccrued Liabilities\nSignificant components of our accrued liabilities were as follows (in thousands):\nAUGUST 31,\n2022\n2021\nAccrued compensation\n$20,608\n$17,955\nOther accrued liabilities\n13,597\n17,025\n$34,205\n$34,980\nContingent Consideration Payments from Business Acquisitions\nBusiness acquisitions may include contingent consideration payments based on various future financial measures\nrelated to the acquired entity. Contingent consideration is required to be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition\ndate. We estimate the fair value of these liabilities based on financial projections of the acquired company and\nestimated probabilities of achievement. Based on updated estimates and projections, the contingent consideration\nliabilities are adjusted at each reporting date to their estimated fair value. Changes in fair value subsequent to the\nacquisition date are reported in selling, general, and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive income (loss), and may have a material impact on our operating results. Variations in\nthe fair value of contingent consideration liabilities may result from changes in discount periods or rates, changes in\nthe timing and amount of earnings estimates, and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of\nachieving various payment criteria.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\nThe functional currencies of our foreign operations are the reported local currencies. Translation adjustments result\nfrom translating our foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into United States dollars. The balance sheet accounts\nof our foreign subsidiaries are translated into United States dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance\nsheet dates. Revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates for each month during the fiscal year.\nThe resulting translation differences are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n109"

Foreign currency transaction losses totaled $0.5 million, $0.1 million, and $0.1 million for the\nfiscal years ended August 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and are included as a component of selling, general,\nand administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nRevenue Recognition\nWe account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers (Topic 606). For further information on revenue recognition, refer to Note 2, Revenue\nRecognition.\nRevenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts and product\nreturns.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe record the compensation expense for all stock-based payments, including grants of stock options and the\ncompensatory elements of our employee stock purchase plan, in our consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive income (loss) based upon their fair values over the requisite service period. For more information on\nour stock-based compensation plans, refer to Note 12.\nShipping and Handling Fees and Costs\nAll shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded as a component of net sales. All costs incurred related\nto the shipping and handling of products are recorded in cost of sales.\nAdvertising Costs\nCosts for advertising are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs included in selling, general, and administrative\nexpenses totaled $4.8 million, $4.0 million, and $3.3 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nRestructuring Costs\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we restructured certain information technology, central operations, and\nmarketing functions. We incurred $1.6 million of severance costs related to these restructuring activities. At\nAugust 31, 2022, we had less than $0.1 million of remaining accrued restructuring costs, which are expected to be paid\nduring fiscal 2023.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax provision has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.\nUnder this approach, deferred income taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The income tax provision represents income taxes\npaid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred income taxes result\nfrom differences between the financial and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for tax rates and tax\nlaws when changes are enacted. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred income tax assets when it is more\nlikely than not that all or some portion of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Interest and penalties\nrelated to uncertain tax positions are recognized as components of income tax benefit or expense in our consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nWe may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position\nwill be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax\nbenefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has\na greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nWe provide for income taxes, net of applicable foreign tax credits, on temporary differences in our investment in\nforeign subsidiaries, which consist primarily of unrepatriated earnings.\n110\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

Comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income or loss and other comprehensive income and\nloss items. Our other comprehensive income and losses generally consist of changes in the cumulative foreign\ncurrency translation adjustment, net of tax.\nAccounting Pronouncements Issued and Adopted\nIncome Taxes\nOn September 1, 2021, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for\nIncome Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes, eliminates certain exceptions within\nASC 740, Income Taxes, and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistency among reporting\nentities. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nCredit Losses on Financial Instruments\nOn September 1, 2020, we adopted ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement\nof Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326). This new standard is intended to improve financial reporting by\nrequiring more timely recognition of credit losses on trade accounts receivable and requires the measurement of all\nexpected credit losses based on historical experience, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and\ndisclosures. For further information on our receivables, refer to Note 4, Accounts Receivable.\nAccounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement\nOn September 1, 2020, we adopted ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software\n(Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That\nIs a Service Contract (ASU 2018-15). This guidance clarifies the accounting for implementation costs in a cloud\ncomputing arrangement that is a service contract and aligns the requirements for capitalizing those costs with the\ncapitalization requirements for costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The Company adopted\nASU 2018-15 on a prospective basis and the adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n2. REVENUE RECOGNTION\nWe earn revenue from contracts with customers primarily through the delivery of our All Access Pass and the Leader\nin Me membership subscription offerings, through the delivery of training days and training course materials\n(whether digitally or in person), and through the licensing of rights to sell our content into geographic locations where\nthe Company does not maintain a direct office. We also earn revenues from leasing arrangements that are not\naccounted for under Topic 606. Returns and refunds are generally immaterial, and we do not have any significant\nwarranty obligations.\nWe recognize revenue upon the transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount\nequal to the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Although rare, if the\nconsideration promised in a contract includes variable amounts, we evaluate the estimate of variable consideration to\ndetermine whether the estimate needs to be constrained. We include the variable consideration in the transaction\nprice only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will\nnot occur.\nThe Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through application of the following steps:\n•\nIdentification of the contract with a customer\n•\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract\n•\nDetermination of the transaction price\n•\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n•\nRecognition of revenue when the Company satisfies the performance obligations\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n111"

      "text": "Taxes assessed by a government authority that are collected from a customer are excluded from net revenue.\nSubscription Revenues\nSubscription revenues primarily relate to the Company’s AAP and the Leader in Me membership offerings. We have\ndetermined that it is most appropriate to account for the AAP as a single performance obligation and recognize the\nassociated transaction price ratably over the term of the underlying contract beginning on the commencement date of\neach contract, which is the date the Company’s platforms and resources are made available to the customer. This\ndetermination was reached after considering that our web-based functionality and content, in combination with our\nintellectual property, each represent inputs that transform into a combined output that represents the intended\noutcome of the AAP, which is to provide a continuously accessible, customized, and dynamic learning and\ndevelopment solution only accessible through the AAP platform.\nWe typically invoice our customers annually upon execution of the contract or subsequent renewals. Amounts that\nhave been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or revenue, depending on whether\ntransfer of control has occurred.\nOur Leader in Me membership offering is bifurcated into a portal membership obligation and a coaching delivery\nobligation. We have determined that it is appropriate to recognize revenue related to the portal membership over the\nterm of the underlying contract and to recognize revenue from coaching as those services are performed. The\ncombined contract amount is recorded in deferred subscription revenue until the performance obligations are\nsatisfied. Any additional coaching or training days which are contracted independent of a Leader in Me membership\nare recorded as revenue in accordance with our general policy for services and products as described below.\nServices and Products\nWe deliver Company-led training days from our offerings, such as The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, at a\ncustomer’s location or live-online based upon a daily consultant rate and a set price for training materials. These\nrevenues are recognized as the training days occur and the services are performed. Customers also have the option to\npurchase training materials and present our offerings through internal facilitators and not through the use of a\nFranklin Covey consultant. Revenue is recognized from these product sales when the materials are shipped. Shipping\nrevenues associated with product sales are recorded in revenue with the corresponding shipping cost being recorded\nas a component of cost of sales.\nRoyalties\nOur international strategy includes the use of licensees in countries where we do not have a wholly-owned direct\noffice. Licensee companies are unrelated entities that have been granted a license to translate our content and\nofferings, adapt the content to the local culture, and sell our content in a specific country or region. We recognize\nrevenue on the upfront fees from the sale of a territory to a licensee over the term of the initial contract. Licensees are\nthen required to pay us royalties based upon a percentage of their sales to clients. We recognize royalty income each\nreporting period based upon the sales information reported to us from our licensees. When sales information is not\nreceived from a particular licensee at the end of a reporting period, the Company estimates the amount of royalties to\nbe received for the period that is being reported based upon prior forecasts and historical performance. These\nestimated royalties are recorded as revenue and are adjusted in the subsequent period. Refer to the disaggregated\nrevenue information presented in Note 16, Segment Information, for our royalty revenues in the fiscal years presented\nin this report.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nWe periodically enter into contracts that include multiple performance obligations. A performance obligation is a\npromise in a contract to transfer products or services that are distinct, or that are distinct within the context of the\ncontract. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue\nwhen the performance obligation is satisfied. Determining whether products and services meet the distinct criteria\nthat should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting requires significant judgment.\n112\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

      "text": "When determining whether goods and services meet the distinct criteria, we consider various factors for each\nagreement including the availability of the services and the nature of the offerings and services. We allocate the\ntransaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis. Judgment is\nrequired to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. The SSP is the price which the Company\nwould sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. In determining the SSP, we consider the size and\nvolume of transactions, price lists, historical sales, and contract prices. We may modify our pricing from time-to-time\nin the future, which could result in changes to the SSP.\nContract Balances\nAs described above, our subscription revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the underlying contract\nbeginning on the commencement date of each agreement. The timing of when these contracts are invoiced, cash is\ncollected, and revenue is recognized impacts our accounts receivable and deferred subscription revenue accounts. We\ngenerally bill our clients in advance for subscription offerings or within the month that the training and products are\ndelivered. As such, consideration due to the Company for work performed is included in accounts receivable and we\ndo not have a significant amount of contract assets. Our receivables are generally collected within 30 to 150 days but\ntypically no longer than 12 months. Deferred subscription revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received\nin advance of revenue being recognized from our subscription offerings. Furthermore, our clients, to expend funds in a\nparticular budget cycle, may prepay for services or products which are a component of our other deferred revenue.\nOur deferred subscription revenue and our other deferred revenue totaled $102.4 million at August 31, 2022 and\n$88.6 million at August 31, 2021, of which $2.7 million was classified as components of other long-term liabilities at\neach of August 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021, respectively. The amount of deferred revenue that was generated from\nsubscription offerings totaled $88.1 million at August 31, 2022 and $77.0 million at August 31, 2021. During the fiscal\nyears ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $123.1 million and $99.5 million of previously deferred\nsubscription revenue.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nWhen possible, we enter into multi-year non-cancellable contracts which are invoiced either upon execution of the\ncontract or at the beginning of each annual contract period. Our remaining performance obligation represents\ncontracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, including unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be\nrecognized as revenue in future periods. Transaction price is influenced by factors such as seasonality, the average\nlength of the contract term, and the ability of the Company to continue to enter multi-year non-cancellable contracts.\nAt August 31, 2022 we had $153.4 million of remaining performance obligations, including $88.1 million of deferred\nrevenue related to our subscription offerings. The remaining performance obligation does not include other deferred\nrevenue as amounts included in other deferred revenue include items such as deposits that are generally refundable at\nthe client’s request prior to the satisfaction of the obligation.\nCosts Capitalized to Obtain Contracts\nWe capitalize the incremental costs of obtaining non-cancellable subscription revenue, primarily from the All Access\nPass and the Leader in Me membership offerings. These incremental costs consist of sales commissions paid to our\nsales force and include the associated payroll taxes and fringe benefits. As the same commission rates are paid\nannually when the customer renews their contract, the capitalized commission costs are generally amortized ratably\non an annual basis consistent with the recognition of the corresponding subscription revenue. At August 31, 2022, we\nhave $13.8 million of capitalized direct commissions, of which $12.6 million is included in other current assets and\n$1.2 million is in other long-term assets based on the expected recognition of the commission expense. During the\nfiscal year ended August 31, 2022, we capitalized $18.1 million of commission costs to obtain revenue contracts and\namortized $16.4 million of deferred commissions to selling, general, and administrative expense. At August 31, 2021,\nwe had $12.1 million of capitalized direct sales commissions with $11.0 million included in other current assets and\n$1.1 million included in other long-term liabilities.\nRefer to Note 16, Segment Information, to these consolidated financial statements for our disaggregated revenue\ninformation.\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n113"

LEASES\nLessee Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we lease office space, primarily for international sales administration offices, in\ncommercial office complexes that are conducive to sales and administrative operations. We also rent warehousing and\ndistribution facilities that are designed to provide secure storage and efficient distribution of our training products,\nbooks, and accessories, and certain office equipment. These leases are classified as operating leases. Operating lease\nassets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over\nthe lease term. Since most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based\non the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Leases\nwith an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. For operating leases, expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We do not have significant amounts of variable lease payments.\nSome of our operating leases contain renewal options that may be exercised at our discretion after the completion of\nthe base rental term.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nWarehouse Outsourcing Contract\nWe have a warehousing services agreement with an independent warehouse and distribution company to provide\nproduct kitting, warehousing, and order fulfillment services at a facility in Des Moines, Iowa. Under the terms of this\ncontract, we pay a fixed charge of approximately $90,000 per year for account management services and variable\ncharges for other warehousing services based on specified activities, including shipping charges. This warehousing\ncontract expired on September 30, 2022. Subsequent to August 31, 2022, we signed a one-year extension to this\nwarehousing contract.\nDuring fiscal years ended August 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we expensed $2.5 million, $2.1 million, and $2.1 million for\nservices provided under the terms of our warehouse and distribution outsourcing contract.

At\nAugust 31, 2022, we had open purchase commitments totaling $2.6 million for products and services to be delivered\nprimarily in fiscal 2023.\nLetters of Credit\nAt August 31, 2022 and 2021, we had standby letters of credit totaling $10,000. These letters of credit were required to\nsecure commitments for a certain insurance policy. No amounts were drawn on the letters of credit at either\nAugust 31, 2022 or August 31, 2021.\nLegal Matters and Loss Contingencies\nWe are the subject of certain legal actions, which we consider routine to our business activities.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nPreferred Stock\nWe have 14.0 million shares of preferred stock authorized for issuance. At August 31, 2022 and 2021, no shares of\npreferred stock were issued or outstanding.\nTreasury Stock\nOn November 15, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a new plan to repurchase up to $40.0 million of our\noutstanding common stock. The previously existing common stock repurchase plan was canceled and the new\ncommon share repurchase plan does not have an expiration date. During fiscal 2022, we purchased 499,411 shares of\nour common stock for $20.3 million in open market purchases. The actual timing, number, and value of common\nshares repurchased under this plan will be determined at our discretion and will depend on a number of factors,\nincluding, among others, general market and business conditions, the trading price of our common shares, and\napplicable legal requirements. We have no obligation to repurchase any common shares under the authorization, and\nthe repurchase plan may be suspended, discontinued, or modified at any time for any reason.\nDuring fiscal 2022, we withheld 86,125 shares of common stock, with a cost basis of $3.5 million, for statutory taxes on\nstock-based compensation awards (Note 12). Shares withheld for income taxes were valued at the market price on the\ndate the stock-based plan shares were distributed to participants. The cost of common stock purchased for treasury on\nour consolidated statement of cash flows for fiscal 2021 was entirely comprised of 147,092 shares withheld for income\ntaxes on various stock-based compensation awards, which had a total cost of $3.0 million.

      "text": "11. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The accounting standards related to fair\nvalue measurements include a hierarchy for information and valuations used in measuring fair value that is broken\ndown into the following three levels based on reliability:\n•\nLevel 1 valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that the Company\ncan access at the measurement date.\n•\nLevel 2 valuations are based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for\nthe instrument, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability including\nthe following:\na.\nquoted prices for similar, but not identical, instruments in active markets;\nb.\nquoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active;\nc.\ninputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the instrument; or\nd.\ninputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or\nother means.\n•\nLevel 3 valuations are based on information that is unobservable and significant to the overall fair value\nmeasurement.\nThe book values of our financial instruments at August 31, 2022 and 2021 approximated their fair values. The\nassessment of the fair values of our financial instruments is based on a variety of factors and assumptions.\nAccordingly, the fair values may not represent the actual values of the financial instruments that could have been\nrealized at August 31, 2022 or 2021, or that will be realized in the future, and do not include expenses that could be\nincurred in an actual sale or settlement. The following methods and assumptions were used to determine the fair\nvalues of our financial instruments, none of which were held for trading or speculative purposes.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Accounts Receivable– The carrying amounts of cash, cash equivalents, and accounts\nreceivable approximate their fair values due to the liquidity and short-term maturity of these instruments.\nOther Assets– Our other assets, including notes receivable, were recorded at the net realizable value of estimated\nfuture cash flows from these instruments.\nDebt Obligations– At August 31, 2022, our debt obligations consisted primarily of variable-rate term notes payable\nand a note payable to the former owners of Strive. Our term notes payable and revolving line of credit are negotiated\ncomponents of our 2019 Credit Agreement, which was completed in August 2019 and modified in April 2021. Since\nthe interest rate for any obligation on our 2019 Credit Agreement is variable, the applicable interest rates on the term\nloan and revolving line of credit are reflective of current market conditions, and the carrying value of term loan and\nrevolving line of credit (when applicable) obligations therefore approximate their fair value.\nContingent Consideration Liabilities from Business Acquisitions\nWe have a contingent consideration liability arising from a previous business acquisition. We measure the fair value of\nour contingent consideration liability at each reporting date based on the valuation model described below. Changes\nto the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities are recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses\nin the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the period of\nadjustment. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability from the acquisition of Jhana Education (Jhana)\nchanged as follows during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 (in thousands):\nAUGUST 31,\n2021\nChange in\nFair Value\nPayments\n2022\nJhana contingent liability\n$2,095\n$68\n$(1,434)\n$729\n124\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

The Jhana purchase price included potential contingent\nconsideration of $7.2 million through the measurement period, which ends in July 2026. The fair value of the Jhana\ncontingent consideration is a Level 3 measurement because we estimate projected consolidated Company and AAP\nsales over the measurement period. Changes in expected qualifying revenues over the measurement period influence\nthe timing and amount of these contingent payments to the former owners of Jhana. Based on the timing of expected\npayments, all of the Jhana contingent consideration liability is recorded as a component of accrued liabilities at\nAugust 31, 2022. Adjustments to the fair value of our contingent consideration liability are included in selling, general,\nand administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income\n(loss).\n12. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS\nOverview\nWe utilize various stock-based compensation plans as integral components of our overall compensation and associate\nretention strategy. Our shareholders have approved various stock incentive plans that permit us to grant performance\nawards, unvested stock awards, stock options, fully-vested stock awards, and employee stock purchase plan (ESPP)\nshares. The Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee)\nhas responsibility for the approval and oversight of our stock-based compensation plans.\nOn January 14, 2022, our shareholders approved the Franklin Covey Co. 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2022 Plan),\nwhich authorized an additional 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance as stock-based payments. A more\ndetailed description of the 2022 Plan is set forth in our Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on December 15,\n2021. At August 31, 2022, the 2022 Plan had approximately 838,000 shares available for future grants.\nOur employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) is administered under the terms of the Franklin Covey Co. 2017 Employee\nStock Purchase Plan, which was approved by our shareholders at the annual meeting of shareholders held on\nJanuary 26, 2018. For additional information regarding the Franklin Covey Co. 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan,\nplease refer to our definitive Proxy Statement as filed with the SEC on December 22, 2017. At August 31, 2022, we had\napproximately 773,000 shares available for purchase by plan participants under the terms of the current\nshareholder-approved ESPP.\nThe total compensation expense of our various stock-based compensation plans was as follows (in thousands):\nYEAR ENDED AUGUST 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020\nPerformance awards\n$6,133\n$7,298\n$(1,518)\nStrive acquisition compensation\n1,196\n354\n—\nUnvested stock awards\n673\n700\n700\nCompensation cost of the ESPP\n239\n205\n185\nFully vested stock awards\n45\n60\n60\n$8,286\n$8,617\n$ (573)\nNo stock-based compensation was capitalized during the fiscal years presented in this report. We recognize forfeitures\nof stock-based compensation instruments as they occur. During fiscal 2022, we issued 272,060 shares of our common\nstock from shares held in treasury for various stock-based compensation arrangements, including the ESPP. Our\nstock-based compensation plans allow shares to be withheld from the award to pay the participants’ statutory income\ntax liabilities. We withheld 86,125 shares of our common stock, with a fair value of $3.5 million, for statutory income\ntaxes during fiscal 2022.\nAt each quarterly or annual reporting date, we evaluate the number and probability of shares expected to vest in each\nof our performance-based long-term incentive plan (LTIP) awards and adjust our stock-based compensation expense\nto correspond with the number of shares expected to vest over the anticipated service period. Due to the significant\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and the\nuncertainties surrounding the recovery of the world’s economies and our business, we determined that the LTIP award\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n125"

We therefore reversed the previously recognized stock-based\ncompensation expense associated with these awards during fiscal 2020, which produced a benefit from stock-based\ncompensation for the year. On October 2, 2020, the Compensation Committee modified the terms of our\nperformance-based LTIP award tranches to extend the service period of each financial-metric based tranche by\ntwo years and increase each qualified Adjusted EBITDA vesting target by $2.0 million. No time-based vesting LTIP\ntranches were modified. During fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 we reassessed the probability of awards vesting under the\nmodified conditions and have expensed awards based on the new vesting requirements and expected financial results\nover the revised service periods.\nThe following is a description of our stock-based compensation plans.\nPerformance Awards\nThe Compensation Committee has awarded various performance-based stock compensation awards to members of\nour senior management as long-term incentive-based compensation. These awards vest to the participants based upon\nthe achievement of specified performance criteria. Compensation expense is recognized as we determine it is probable\nthat the shares will vest. Adjustments to compensation expense to reflect the timing of and the number of shares\nexpected to be awarded are made on a cumulative basis at the date of the adjustment.

The fiscal 2022 LTIP award has two tranches, which consist of\nthe following: 1) shares that vest after three years of service and 2) shares that vest based on the achievement of\nspecified levels of qualified Adjusted EBITDA. Twenty-five percent of a participant’s award vests after three years of\nservice, and the number of shares awarded in this tranche does not fluctuate based on financial measures. The number\nof shares granted in this tranche totals 24,649 shares. The remaining tranche is based on the highest rolling\nfour-quarter level of qualified Adjusted EBITDA achieved in the three-year period ended August 31, 2024. The\nnumber of shares that will vest to participants for this tranche is variable and may be 50 percent of the award\n(minimum award threshold) or up to 200 percent of the participant’s award (maximum threshold) depending on the\nlevel of qualified Adjusted EBITDA achieved. The number of shares that may be earned for achieving 100 percent of\nthe performance-based objective totals 73,929 shares. The maximum number of shares that may be awarded in\nconnection with the performance-based tranche of the 2022 LTIP totals 147,858 shares.\nFiscal 2021 LTIP Award – On October 2, 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors granted a\nnew LTIP award to our executive officers and members of senior management. The fiscal 2021 LTIP award has\ntwo tranches, which consist of the following: 1) shares that vest after three years of service and 2) the achievement of\nspecified levels of qualified Adjusted EBITDA. Twenty-five percent of a participant’s award vests after three years of\nservice, and the number of shares awarded in this tranche does not fluctuate based on financial measures. The number\nof shares granted in this tranche totals 52,696 shares. The remaining tranche is based on the highest rolling\nfour-quarter level of qualified Adjusted EBITDA achieved in the three-year period ended August 31, 2023. The\nnumber of shares that will vest to participants for this tranche is variable and may be 50 percent of the award\n(minimum award threshold) or up to 200 percent of the participant’s award (maximum threshold) depending on the\nlevel of qualified Adjusted EBITDA achieved. The number of shares that may be earned for achieving 100 percent of\nthe performance-based objective totals 158,088 shares.

Each of the following amounts may be payable in\nshares of our common stock or cash at our sole discretion:\n•\nContingent Consideration – A maximum of approximately $4.2 million may be earned by the former\nprincipal owner of Strive over a five-year period ending in May 2026. The total value of this consideration is\ncontingent upon sales and growth of the All Access Pass subscription and subscription services revenues\nduring the five-year measurement period. We measure the contingent consideration each quarter and divide\nthe total by the average of the closing share price of our common stock on the NYSE over the last 15 trading\ndays of the quarter. Shares are required to be distributed within 45 days following the end of each quarter.\nThrough August 31, 2022, we have recognized $0.8 million of share-based compensation expense for the\nStrive contingent consideration payments.\n•\nBonus Payments – Approximately $1.0 million will be paid 18 months following the Closing Date to\nstockholders and option holders of Strive who are still employed by the Company or its affiliates as of the\n18-month date, subject to certain exceptions. We are expensing these awards evenly over the service period,\nwhich is 18 months.

The fiscal 2020 LTIP award has\nthree tranches, which consist of the following: 1) shares that vest after three years of service; 2) shares that vest based\non the achievement of specified levels of qualified Adjusted EBITDA; and 3) shares that vest based on the achievement\nof specified levels of subscription service sales. Twenty-five percent of a participant’s award vests after three years of\nservice, and the number of shares awarded in this tranche does not fluctuate based on financial measures. The number\nof shares granted in this tranche totals 25,101 shares. The remaining two tranches of the award are based on the\nhighest rolling four-quarter levels of qualified Adjusted EBITDA and subscription service sales achieved in the\nthree-year period which originally ended August 31, 2022. The number of shares that will vest to participants for these\ntwo tranches is variable and may be 50 percent of the award (minimum award threshold) up to 200 percent of the\nparticipant’s award (maximum threshold). The maximum number of shares that may be awarded in connection with\nthese tranches totals 150,630 shares. As described above, the qualified Adjusted EBITDA vesting targets for the fiscal\n2020 LTIP were increased by $2.0 million and the life of the award was extended to August 31, 2024.\nFiscal 2019 LTIP Award – On October 1, 2018, the Compensation Committee granted a performance-based LTIP\naward to our executive officers and members of senior management. The fiscal 2019 LTIP award has three tranches,\nwhich consist of the following: 1) shares that vest after three years of service; 2) the achievement of certain levels of\nqualified Adjusted EBITDA; and 3) the achievement of certain levels of subscription service sales. Twenty-five percent\nof a participant’s award vests after three years of service, and the number of shares awarded in this tranche will not\nfluctuate based on financial measures. The number of shares granted in this tranche totals 36,470 shares. The\nremaining two tranches of the fiscal 2019 award are based on the highest rolling four-quarter levels of qualified\nAdjusted EBITDA and subscription service sales achieved in the measurement period that originally ended August 31,\n2021. The number of shares that will vest to participants for these two tranches is variable and may be 50 percent of\nthe award (minimum threshold) up to 200 percent of the participant’s award (maximum threshold). The maximum\nnumber of shares that may be awarded in connection with these tranches totals 218,818 shares. During fiscal 2021, the\nfiscal 2019 LTIP award was modified by increasing the qualified Adjusted EBITDA vesting targets by $2.0 million and\nextending the measurement period by two years to August 31, 2023.\nUnvested Stock Awards\nThe annual Board of Director unvested stock award, which is administered under the terms of the Franklin Covey Co.\nOmnibus Incentive Plans, is designed to provide our non-employee directors, who are not eligible to participate in our\nESPP, an opportunity to obtain an interest in the Company through the acquisition of shares of our common stock as\npart of their compensation.

These tax benefits\nwere partially offset by tax expense of $1.2 million for non-deductible executive compensation.\nOur effective income tax benefit rate for fiscal 2021 of 124.2 percent was primarily due to a $10.5 million reduction in\nour valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets, which was partially offset by the reduction of $0.8 million\nin foreign tax credit carryforwards resulting from tax withheld by foreign jurisdictions in excess of amounts allowable\nas credits against our U.S. income taxes. In fiscal 2020, as explained below, we recognized $11.3 million of additional\nincome tax expense resulting from the increase in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Due to the\nnear break-even amount of pre-tax income during fiscal 2020, the effect of non-temporary items on our effective\nincome tax rate was greatly amplified.\nIn consideration of the relevant accounting guidance, we reevaluated our deferred tax assets during fiscal 2020 and\nconsidered both positive and negative evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that some portion or\nall of our deferred tax assets will be realized. Because of the cumulative pre-tax losses over the prior three fiscal years,\ncombined with the expected continued disruptions and negative impact to our business resulting from uncertainties\nrelated to the recovery from the pandemic, we were unable to overcome accounting guidance indicating that it is\nmore-likely-than-not that insufficient taxable income will be available to realize all of our deferred tax assets before\nthey expire, primarily foreign tax credit carryforwards and a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards. Based on\nthis assessment, we increased the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, which generated $11.3 million of\nadditional income tax expense in fiscal 2020.\nOur strong financial performance during fiscal 2021 produced cumulative three-year pre-tax income through\nAugust 31, 2021. Because of better-than-expected earnings during fiscal 2021, as well as a favorable outlook for future\nearnings, particularly from sales of our All Access Pass, we reduced the valuation allowance against our deferred tax\nassets by $10.5 million during fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022, we reduced the valuation allowance against our deferred tax\nassets by $2.8 million, due primarily to foreign tax credits claimed on our fiscal 2021 U.S. federal income tax return\nwhich we previously concluded would expire unused.\nWe are subject to the anti-deferral provisions on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) under the Tax Cut and\nJobs Act of 2017. We have elected to treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a\ncurrent period expense when incurred (the Period Cost Method). We recorded an insignificant amount of income tax\nexpense in fiscal 2022 and no income tax expense in fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2020 under the GILTI provisions.

For reporting purposes, we define Adjusted EBITDA as net\nincome or loss excluding the impact of interest, income taxes, intangible asset amortization, depreciation, stock-based\ncompensation expense, and certain other items such as adjustments to the fair value of expected contingent\nconsideration liabilities arising from business acquisitions, and other unusual or infrequent items.\nOur operations are not capital intensive and we do not own any manufacturing facilities or equipment. Accordingly,\nwe do not allocate assets to the divisions for analysis purposes. Interest expense and interest income are primarily\ngenerated at the corporate level and are not allocated. Income taxes are likewise calculated and paid on a corporate\nlevel (except for entities that operate in foreign jurisdictions) and are not allocated for analysis purposes.\n134\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

As a result of FCOP’s structure as a\nlimited liability company with separate owner capital accounts, we determined that our investment in FCOP was more\nthan minor and we were required to account for our investment in FCOP using the equity method of accounting. We\nhave not recorded our share of FCOP’s losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive income (loss) because we have impaired and written off investment balances, as defined within the\napplicable accounting guidance, in excess of our share of FCOP’s losses.\nDue to significant operating losses incurred after the establishment of FCOP, we reconsidered whether FCOP was a\nvariable interest entity as defined under ASC 810, and determined that FCOP was a variable interest entity. We further\ndetermined that we were not the primary beneficiary of FCOP because we did not have the ability to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact FCOP’s economic performance, which primarily consisted of the day-to-day\nsale of planning products and related accessories, and we did not have an obligation to absorb losses or the right to\nreceive benefits from FCOP that could have been significant.\nOn November 4, 2019, FCOP sold substantially all of its assets to Franklin Planner Corporation (FPC), a new\nunrelated entity, and FCOP was dissolved. FPC has continued FCOP’s business of selling planners and other related\nconsumer products based on the license agreement which granted FCOP the exclusive rights described below.\nIn connection with this transaction, we exchanged approximately $3.2 million of receivables from FCOP to amend the\nterm and royalty provisions of the existing license agreement. The $3.2 million of consideration included a\n$2.6 million note receivable, which represented FCOP’s third-party bank debt that we purchased directly from the\nbank on the transaction date. The amended license agreement grants the exclusive right to use certain of our\ntrademarks and other intellectual property in connection with certain consumer products and provides us with\nminimum royalties of approximately $1.3 million per year. We are also entitled to receive additional variable royalties\nif certain FPC financial metrics exceed specified levels. FPC assumed the amended license agreement from FCOP\nupon the purchase of FCOP’s assets. We recorded the $3.2 million consideration for the amendment to the license\nagreement as a capitalized cost of the license agreement and will reduce our royalty revenue by amortizing this\namount over the remainder of the initial term of the license agreement, which ends in approximately 30 years. During\nthe fiscal years ended August 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we recognized $1.2 million, $1.4 million, and $2.0 million of\nroyalty revenues (net of the amortization of costs capitalized to obtain the contract) from the amended license\nagreement with FPC.\nWe do not have an ownership interest in FPC, do not have any obligation to provide additional subordinated support\nto FPC, do not have control over the day-to-day operations of FPC, and accordingly do not account for FPC as a\nvariable interest entity. We receive payments for royalties and rented space from FPC. At August 31, 2022 and\nAugust 31, 2021, we had $1.7 million and $1.8 million receivable, respectively, from FPC which are recorded in other\ncurrent assets. Since most of FPC’s sales and cash flows are seasonal and occur between October and January, we\nexpect to receive the majority of the required cash payments for royalties and outstanding receivables during our\nsecond and third quarters of each fiscal year. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we received $2.0 million and $1.5 million of\ncash from FPC as payment for royalties and reimbursable operating costs.\n138\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report"

CoveyLink conducts training and\nprovides consulting based upon the book The Speed of Trust by Stephen M.R. Covey, who is the brother of one of our\nexecutive officers.\nPrior to the acquisition date, CoveyLink had granted us a non-exclusive license for content related to The Speed of\nTrust book and related training courses for which we paid CoveyLink specified royalties. As part of the CoveyLink\nacquisition, we signed an amended and restated license for intellectual property that granted us an exclusive,\nperpetual, worldwide, transferable, royalty-bearing license to use, reproduce, display, distribute, sell, prepare\nderivative works of, and perform the licensed material in any format or medium and through any market or\ndistribution channel. We are required to pay Stephen M.R. Covey royalties for the use of certain intellectual property\ndeveloped by him. The amount expensed for these royalties totaled $1.8 million, $1.5 million, and $1.6 million during\nthe fiscal years ended August 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. As part of the acquisition of CoveyLink, we signed an amended\nlicense agreement as well as a speaker services agreement. Based on the provisions of the speakers’ services agreement,\nwe pay Stephen M.R. Covey a portion of the speaking revenues received for his presentations. We expensed\n$0.8 million, $0.6 million, and $0.8 million for payment on these presentations during the fiscal years ended\nAugust 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. We had $0.3 million and $0.2 million accrued for these royalties and speaking fees at\nAugust 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which were included as components of accrued liabilities on our consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nOther Related Party Transactions\nWe pay an executive officer of the Company a percentage of the royalty proceeds received from the sales of certain\nbooks authored by him in addition to his annual salary. During each of the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022, 2021,\nand 2020, we expensed $0.1 million for these royalties. We had an insignificant amount accrued to this executive\nofficer at August 31, 2022 and 2021 as payable under the terms of these arrangements. These amounts are included as\ncomponents of accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe pay a company owned by the brother of a member of our executive management team for the production of video\nsegments used in our offerings. During the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, we paid $0.3 million and\n$0.8 million to this company for services provided.\nFranklin Covey 2022 Annual Report\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n139"
