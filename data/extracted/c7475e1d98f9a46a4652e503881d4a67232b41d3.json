Despite this, \nNZME has made significant \nprogress and has delivered \nstrong earnings results.\nAdvertising revenue has grown, \nwhich shows the strength and \ntrust in our various platforms. \nOur digital transformation \nefforts continue to come to \nfruition, with record audiences \nacross radio and digital audio \nplatforms, as well as strong \ngrowth in publishing and digital \nplatforms, including OneRoof.\nNZME has demonstrated \nflexibility and agility, adapting \nthrough the challenging times \nto remain largely on track to \nachieve the 2023 targets that \nwere set under our three-year \nstrategy back in 2020.\nNZME’s Key Strategic Priorities\nTo recap, our strategic priorities \nare:\n•\t To be New Zealand’s leading \naudio company \n•\t For the NZ Herald to become \nNew Zealand’s Herald\n•\t And finally, for OneRoof \nto become your complete \nproperty destination. \nHaving a very clear and targeted \nstrategy has ensured a strong \nfocus on the initiatives that drive \ngrowth and transformation, \nensuring the long-term success \nof the business. \nFinancial Results Highlights\nThe 2022 operating EBITDA1 of \n$64.7 million was four percent \nhigher than the comparative \nresult for last year.

Advertising is \noften bundled to include publishing, audio \nand real estate components. In most cases \neach component of the bundle is treated as \na distinct performance obligation and the \ntransaction price is allocated on a relative \nstand-alone selling price basis. Experiential \ncampaigns are a type of bundling focused \non providing an experience utilising a mix of \ntraditional advertising mediums with bespoke \nelements like competitions, product sampling, \nstreet performances etc. These activities are \nhighly integrated and inter-dependent and \nare therefore a single performance obligation \nwith revenue recognised over the period of \nthe campaign. These campaigns often include \nelements that are provided by external parties \nand the Group acts as the principal in those \ninstances. These campaigns are typically run \nover a short period of time and are typically \ncompleted and billed for in the same reporting \nor billing period. Where the Group provides \nadvertising for non-cash consideration, \nrevenue is recognised at the fair value of the \nconsideration received, unless the Group \ncannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the \nnon-cash consideration; in which case revenue \nis recognised by reference to the stand-alone \nselling price of the advertising promised to the \ncustomer.

The Directors have \nalso determined that there are three cash generating units (CGU) for impairment testing because \nthese are the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely \nindependent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Note 3.12 contains the \nallocation of the Group's assets and liabilities across the CGUs except for financing and equity \naccounted investments. Those assets and liabilities that do not relate to one of the three CGUs \nare grouped as \"other\". This note also includes details of certain key estimates and assumptions \nmade during the impairment testing process. The Directors should assess, at each reporting date, \nwhether there is any indication that an impairment loss for an asset, other than goodwill, either no \nlonger exists or has decreased. The Directors have determined that, while there is improvement in \nthe headroom since the last impairment was recognised, no reversal of the previous impairment to \nmasthead brands and brands is required.\nThe recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based \non the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-\nin-use (VIU) calculations using management forecasts. \nThe recoverable amount of each CGU is compared \nagainst the carrying value of that CGU to determine \nwhether there has been impairment. Any impairment is \nrecognised immediately as an expense and in relation to \ngoodwill, is not subsequently reversed.\nA comprehensive impairment review was conducted \nat 31 December 2022. The recoverable amount of the \nCGUs has been determined based on VIU. Based on \nthe assumptions below no impairment of indefinite \nlife intangible assets has been recognised in the \nincome statement (2021: $nil) for any of the CGUs. The \nimpairment review used a set of assumptions which are \nconsidered the most appropriate for impairment testing \nbut are more conservative than the Group's medium \nterm plans.\nThe VIU calculations use Board approved cash flow \nprojections which cover a five-year period. Cash flows \nbeyond the five-year period are extrapolated using an \nestimated terminal growth rate, which is the weighted \naverage growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows \nbeyond the forecast period. This assessment is required \nto be made based on events and knowledge as at  \n31 December 2022.\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 71"

As part of this \nassessment the Group considers certain indicators \nsuch as whether the lease is for the major part of \nthe economic life of the asset.\nFor the purposes of classifying the sub-lease \nreference is to the right-of-use asset arising \nfrom the head lease, not with reference to the \nunderlying asset.\nAssets arising from a sub-lease are initially \nmeasured on a present value basis and include \nthe following:\n•\t\ninitial direct costs incurred in acquiring the \nsub-lease;\n•\t\nfixed payments (including in-substance \nfixed payments), less any lease incentives \npayable;\n•\t\nvariable lease payments that are based on \nan index or a rate;\n•\t\namounts expected to be receivable under \nresidual value guarantees;\n•\t\nthe exercise price of a purchase option if \nthe lessee is reasonably certain to exercise \nthat option; and\n•\t\npayments of penalties for terminating the \nlease, if the lease term reflects the lessee \nexercising that option.\nAccounting policy\nInventories are measured at cost and are expensed, using the first in first out (\"FIFO\") method, \nas used.

The \nGroup uses different methods to measure different \ntypes of risk to which it is exposed. These methods \ninclude sensitivity analysis in the case of interest \nrate and ageing analysis for credit risk.\nFinancial risk management is carried out by the \nGroup Treasury function. The Group Treasury \nfunction meet regularly with the Group CFO to \ncover specific areas, such as interest rate risk and \ncredit risk, use of derivative financial instruments \nand non-derivative financial instruments, and \ninvestment of excess liquidity. Due to the Group's \nlimited operations in foreign jurisdictions, \nthe Group does not have a significant foreign \nexchange exposure.\n4.7.2\t\nMarket risk\nCash flow and fair value interest rate risk\nLong term borrowings issued at variable rates \nexpose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. \nBorrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose \nthe Group to fair value interest rate risk. The \nGroup has undertaken hedging transactions \nto mitigate this risk (note 3.9). Current interest \nbearing debt is fixed for 30 days on a rolling basis.\nNZME’s interest rate risk is managed with interest \nrate derivatives. Hedge accounting is applied \nto derivatives that are effective in offsetting the \nchanges in fair value or cash flows of the hedged \nitems. The hedge relationship is documented \nand the effectiveness of such hedges is tested at \nregular intervals, at least on a semi-annual basis.\nBased on the outstanding net floating debt at  \n31 December 2022 a change in interest rates of \n+/-1% per annum with all other variables being \nconstant would have impacted post-tax profit \nand equity by $0.2 million lower / higher. The \nCompany had no debt at 31 December 2021 and \ntherefore no sensitivity analysis on changes in \ninterest rates was performed.\nPrice risk\nThe Group is not exposed to significant price \nrisk. There is some risk associated with other \nfinancial assets however this is not deemed to be \nsignificant.\n4.7.3\t Credit risk\nCredit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit \nrisk arises from cash and cash equivalents and \ndeposits with banks and financial institutions, as \nwell as credit exposures to wholesale and retail \ncustomers, including outstanding receivables and \ncommitted transactions. For banks and financial \ninstitutions, the creditworthiness is assessed prior \nto entering into arrangements and approved by \nthe Board. For other customers, NZME's credit \ncontrol department assesses the credit quality, \ntaking into account financial position, past \nexperience and other factors. The utilisation \nof credit limits is regularly monitored and the \nGroup does not normally obtain collateral from its \ncustomers.\nCONTINUED\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n96 NEW ZEALAND MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT"

For the year ended \n31 December 2022, the borrowing rates were \ndetermined to be between 3.8% and 7.2%  \n(2021: between 3.0% and 3.6%), depending on the \ntype of borrowing.

These valuation techniques \nmaximise the use of observable market data where \nit is available and rely as little as possible on entity \nspecific estimates. If all significant inputs required \nto fair value an instrument are observable, the \ninstrument is included in level 2.\nIf one or more of the significant inputs is not based \non observable market data, the instrument is \nincluded in level 3.\nThe Group uses Director valuation for its freehold \nland and buildings less subsequent depreciation for \nbuildings, to ensure that the carrying value of the \nassets is materially consistent with their fair value. \nThe land and buildings owned by the Group are \ntransmission sites and associated buildings, and as \nsuch are specialised and have limited saleability. \nThe best evidence of fair value is current prices in \nan active market for similar properties; however, \nthese are not readily available for such specialised \nsites in such locations. The Directors believe that the \ncurrent carrying value of the assets equates to their \nfair value given the nature and location of the assets. \nAll resulting fair value estimates for properties are \nincluded as level 3.\nANNUAL REPORT 2022 99"

      "text": "Our audit approach\nOverview\nOverall group materiality: $1,777,000, which represents 0.5% of total\nrevenue.\nWe chose total revenue as the benchmark because, in our view, it is\nthe benchmark against which the performance of the Group is most\ncommonly measured by users, and is a generally accepted\nbenchmark. In our judgement, revenue provides a more stable\nmeasure for establishing our materiality benchmark and best reflects\nperformance of the Group. We chose 0.5% based on our\nprofessional judgement, noting that it is also within the range of\ncommonly accepted thresholds for entities where revenue is\nconsidered the appropriate benchmark.\nWe performed a full scope audit over the consolidated information of\nthe Group\nAs reported above, we have two key audit matters, being:\n●\nImpairment assessment of indefinite life intangible assets\n●\nRecognition of revenue\n As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material\nmisstatement in the consolidated financial statements. In particular, we considered where\nmanagement made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates\nthat involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all\nof our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among\nother matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material\nmisstatement due to fraud.\nMateriality\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material\nmisstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if,\nindividually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of\nusers taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality,\nincluding the overall Group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole as set out\nabove. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit,\nthe nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both\nindividually and in aggregate, on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.\nHow we tailored our group audit scope\nWe tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion\non the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the\naccounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.\nPwC\n4\n112 NEW ZEALAND MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT"

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,\nbut is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (NZ) and ISAs will always\ndetect a material misstatement when it exists.
