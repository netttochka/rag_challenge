      "text": "Dear Fellow Shareholder, \n \nWe are pleased to provide you an update on the progress of your investments in ACRES \nCommercial Realty Corp. (“ACR” or the “Company”). During the past year, our manager has \ncontinued to make progress on the core tenets of its responsibilities to manage the existing assets \nin the portfolio, originate new loan assets, facilitate the financing of the assets, and control costs \nto drive earnings and increase book value per share. We are pleased to report that substantial \nprogress has been made on all fronts and we remain focused on these mandates going forward.   \nThe ACRES team continued to diligently manage our assets and provide exceptional service for \nour borrowers. We worked proactively with these borrowers to address their needs so that they \ncould maintain payments on their loans. These efforts have resulted in a high-quality, stabilized \nbook to build on.  \nWe are proud of the success we achieved in 2022 and are optimistic in our ability to deliver \nshareholder value over the long term. \n \nSelective Growth & Attractive Financing Vehicles \nDuring 2022, we selectively grew the Company’s loan portfolio by leveraging ACRES’s \ncomplementary lending pipeline and network of sponsor relationships. We are pleased to note that \nwe closed over $610 million of commercial real estate first-mortgage commitments in 2022.  \nAdditionally, we carefully pursued opportunities to make direct equity investments in real estate \nin 2022, ultimately acquiring two properties for a total of $51.6 million. We expect that these \ninvestments may yield enhanced returns in the long term that, we will be able to substantially \nshield from taxes due to the existence of ACR’s considerable tax assets and ultimately reinvest \ninto the loan origination pipeline. \nWe recognize that building on this momentum is essential. Therefore, the ACRES team is vigilant \nin identifying and executing on opportunities to grow asset-specific financing with duration at \nattractive coupon rates that can raise our capacity to originate loans. In addition, we have the \nreinvestment window available on our two ACR securitizations through May 2023 and December \n2023. The bulk of the Company’s current portfolio was originated in 2021 and 2022, comprising \n84% of the current par balance and have initial maturities of 2024 or later and extended maturities \nof 2026 or later. \n \nPortfolio Stability \nThe ACRES asset management team prides itself on its ability to tailor solutions that will keep \nborrowers on track despite challenges that may arise. Current volatility and uncertainty in the \nmarket have proved to be such challenges, but ones we’ve been able to manage as a result of our \nproactive asset management approach.  \nThanks to our asset management team, we’ve reduced our watch list to 5% of the loan portfolio at \nthe end of 2022, down from 8% at the end of 2021. In January 2023, one watch list loan, a hotel \nportfolio in the southwest region with a par value of $56.5 million was paid off in full, which \nreduced the value of our watch list loans in half as compared to year end 2022."

      "text": "As of December 31, 2022, 95% of the loan portfolio was performing in line or near underwritten \nexpectations and a significant majority of loans were current on contractual payments, which is an \nimprovement from 92% at December 31, 2021. \nAs of December 31, 2022, 100% of our loan portfolio by carrying value earned a floating rate of \ninterest and was financed entirely with liabilities that both pay interest at floating rates. \nAdditionally, 89% of the par value of our floating-rate loan portfolio was covered by borrower-\nowned interest rate caps that provided additional credit protection to the Company in the current \nrising interest rate environment. \n \nCapital Markets Flexibility \nWe worked closely with our lenders and executed as planned to provide the Company maximum \nflexibility given the challenging business environment in 2022.   \nWe finalized terms with Mass Mutual under its non-mark-to-market agreement to upsize the \ncommitment and to provide for individual loan series that will each have a five-year term from the \ndate of issuance. Additionally, we have warehouse lines open with JPM and Morgan Stanley, each \ncollateralized by performing loans and each with excess capacity to support future originations.     \nIn August 2022, we repaid the remaining outstanding 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes upon \nmaturity at par. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 849,000 shares of common stock at an \naverage price of $10.35, which contributed $1.32 per share to common stock book value since we \nwere able to repurchase the shares at prices significantly below our common stock book value. \nCommon stock book value was $24.54 at December 31, 2022, up 3% from December 31, 2021.  \n \nCorporate Responsibility  \nIn undertaking our ESG strategy, we are particularly focused on identifying and executing \nprograms that ensure our dedication to diversity and inclusion and emphasize ethical behavior.   \nWe are committed to integrating ESG policies and practices into our operational, investment and \ndevelopment strategies to build a sustainable future.   \nDuring 2022, we announced a new initiative called “ACRES Protects an Acre” initiative, in which \nACRES will make a donation in connection with each loan it closes to a nonprofit organization \nwhose mission is to protect acres of vulnerable land.  Additionally, early in 2023, we announced a \npartnership with Project Destined, an organization that provides training in financial literacy, \nentrepreneurship, and real estate to students from underserved communities. \n \nLooking Ahead \nAs we look ahead to 2023, we have established a goal to get the Company fully invested to drive \nmeaningful earnings that can be re-invested back into the loan origination pipeline. We expect our \naccomplishments in 2022 will help to pave the way to attaining that goal."

      "text": "5 \nPART I \nITEM 1. BUSINESS \nGeneral \nWe are a Maryland corporation, incorporated in 2005, and a real estate finance company that is organized and conducts our \noperations to qualify as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax purposes under Subchapter M of the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. On February 16, 2021, we amended our certificate of incorporation to change our \nname to ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. from Exantas Capital Corp. Our investment strategy is primarily focused on originating, \nholding and managing commercial real estate (“CRE”) mortgage loans and equity investments in commercial real estate property \nthrough direct ownership and joint ventures. We are externally managed by ACRES Capital, LLC (our “Manager”) a subsidiary of \nACRES Capital Corp. (collectively “ACRES”), a private commercial real estate lender exclusively dedicated to nationwide middle \nmarket CRE lending with a focus on multifamily, student housing, hospitality, industrial and office property in top United States, or \nU.S., markets. Our Manager draws upon the management team of ACRES and its collective investment experience to provide its \nservices. \nOur objective is to provide our stockholders with total returns over time, including the payment of quarterly distributions when \napproved by our board of directors, (our “Board”) and capital appreciation, while seeking to manage the risks associated with our \ninvestment strategies. We finance a substantial portion of our portfolio investments through borrowing strategies seeking to match the \nmaturities and repricing dates of our financings with the maturities and repricing dates of our investments. \nOur investment strategy targets the following CRE credit investments, including: \n•  \nFloating-rate first mortgage loans, which we refer to as whole loans; \n•  \nFirst priority interests in first mortgage loans, which we refer to as A-notes; \n•  \nSubordinated interests in first mortgage loans, which we refer to as B-notes; \n•  \nPreferred equity investments related to CRE that are subordinate to first mortgage loans and are not collateralized by the \nproperty underlying the investment; and \n•  \nCRE equity investments. \nWe generate our income primarily from the spread between the revenues we receive from our assets and the cost to finance our \nownership of those assets, including corporate debt. \nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was identified. The resulting spread of COVID-19 throughout \nthe globe led the World Health Organization to designate COVID-19 as a pandemic and numerous countries, including the U.S, to \ndeclare national emergencies. Many countries responded to the initial and ensuing outbreaks of COVID-19 by instituting quarantines \nand restrictions on travel and limiting operations of non-essential offices and retail centers, which resulted in the closure or remote \noperation of non-essential businesses and increased rates of unemployment and market disruption in connection with the economic \nuncertainty. While the U.S. and certain countries around the world have eased restrictions and financial markets and unemployment \nrates have stabilized to some degree, the pandemic continues to cause uncertainty in the U.S. and global economies, generally, and the \nCRE industry in particular.  \nThe aforementioned quarantines and travel restrictions contributed significantly to economic disruptions across the country \nthat directly impacted our borrowers and their ability to pay and to stay current with their debt obligations in 2019 and 2020, causing \nsignificant increases in our provisions for credit losses. During this height of the pandemic, we used a variety of legal and structural \noptions to manage credit risk effectively, including through forbearance and extension provisions or agreements. As of December 31, \n2022, we have substantially reversed those provisions due to significant improvements in our current and expected macroeconomic \noperating environments as well as due to improvements in collateral operating performance and market liquidity. \nWe continue to actively and responsibly manage corporate liquidity and operations in light of the market disruptions caused by \nCOVID-19. However, it is inherently difficult to accurately assess the continuing impact of the pandemic as well as other domestic or \nglobal events on our revenues, profitability and financial position. In response, we are focused on maintaining sufficient liquidity while \nstill growing our loan origination business. We continuously monitor the effects of domestic and global events on our operations and \nfinancial position to ensure that we remain responsive and adaptable to the dynamic changes in our operating environment.  \nThe negative impact of COVID-19 on our commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, investments and 2020 results \ncreated a net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and net capital loss carryforwards (“CLCFs”). Our 2020 tax return, completed in \nOctober 2021, resulted in NOL carryforwards of $47.7 million and CLCFs of $136.9 million, including net capital loss carryforwards"

Our 2021 tax return, completed in October 2022, resulted in NOL \nutilization of $1.1 million and CLCF utilization of $15.0 million. Additionally, we have NOL carryforwards of $60.1 million and CLCFs \nof $1.0 million at our taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). \nAs of December 31, 2022, we have acquired equity investments in CRE properties to utilize CLCFs in our QRSs. These equity \ninvestments offer the opportunity for enhanced capital appreciation returns that may be reinvested into the loan origination pipeline \nwhen and if realized. \nWe typically target transitional floating-rate CRE loans between $10.0 million and $100.0 million. During the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022 we originated 19 CRE loans with total commitments of $610.8 million. At December 31, 2022, our CRE loan \nportfolio comprised $2.1 billion of floating-rate CRE whole loans with a weighted average spread of 3.78% over the one-month \nbenchmark interest rates utilized, which have a weighted average floor of 0.68%, excluding one whole loan without a benchmark floor. \nAdditionally, our CRE loan portfolio comprised one fully reserved $4.7 million mezzanine loan at December 31, 2022. \nOur Business Strategy \nThe core components of our business strategy are: \nInvestment in CRE assets. We are currently invested in CRE whole loans, CRE mezzanine loans and CRE investments. Our \ngoal is to allocate 90% to 100% of our equity to our CRE assets. \nManaging our investment portfolio. At December 31, 2022, we managed $2.1 billion of assets, including $1.5 billion of assets \nthat were financed and held in variable interest entities. The core of our management process is credit analysis, which our Manager, \nwith the assistance of ACRES, uses to actively monitor our existing investments and as a basis for evaluating new investments. Senior \nmanagement of ACRES has extensive experience in underwriting the credit risk associated with our targeted asset classes and conducts \ndetailed due diligence on all investments. After we make investments, our Manager actively monitors them for early detection of trouble \nor deterioration. If a default occurs, we will use our senior management team’s asset management experience in seeking to mitigate the \nseverity of any loss and to optimize the recovery from assets collateralizing the investment. \nManaging our interest rate, pricing and liquidity risk. We engage in a number of business activities that are vulnerable to \ninterest rate, pricing and liquidity risk and we seek to manage those risks. The risks on our long-term financing agreements, principally \nour term financing facilities, are managed by seeking to match the maturity and repricing dates of our financed investments with the \nmaturities and repricing dates of our long-term financing facilities. Additionally, we seek to match investment and financing maturity \nand repricing dates using securitization vehicles structured by our Manager and, subject to the availability of markets for securitization \nfinancings, we expect to continue to use securitizations in the future to accomplish our long-term match funding financing strategy. \nAt December 31, 2022, our CRE securitizations, financing facilities with debt outstanding, and mortgage payable were as \nfollows (in thousands): \n \n \nOutstanding \nBorrowings (1) \n  Value of Collateral   \nEquity at Risk (2) \n \nAt December 31, 2022: \n \n \n \nCRE Securitizations \n \n \n \nACR 2021-FL1 \n $ \n671,397  $ \n802,643  $ \n127,420 \nACR 2021-FL2 \n  \n562,159   \n700,000   \n133,000 \nSenior Secured Financing Facility \n \n \n \nMassachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company \n $ \n87,890  $ \n196,837  $ \n105,818 \nCRE -Term Warehouse Financing Facilities \n \n \n \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. \n $ \n186,783  $ \n255,095  $ \n68,768 \nMorgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC \n  \n141,505   \n198,455   \n56,817 \nMortgage Payable \n \n \n \nReadycap Commercial, LLC \n $ \n18,244  $ \n25,400  $ \n6,602 \nTotal \n $ \n1,667,978  $ \n2,178,430  \n(1) \nCRE securitizations, senior secured financing facility and mortgage payable include deferred debt issuance costs.

      "text": "7 \nDiversification of investments. We manage our investment risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio of CRE mortgage loans \nand other CRE-related investments. As funds become available for investment or reinvestment, we seek to maintain diversification by \nproperty type and geographic location while allocating our capital to investment opportunities that we believe are the most economically \nattractive. The percentage of assets that we have invested in certain non-qualifying, non-core and other real estate-related investments \nis subject to the federal income tax requirements for REIT qualification and the requirements for exclusion from regulation under the \nInvestment Company Act of 1940, or the Investment Company Act. \nOur Operating Policies \nInvestment guidelines. We have established investment policies, procedures and guidelines that are reviewed and approved by \nour Manager’s investment committee and our Board. The investment committee and/or our Board, as applicable, meets regularly to \nconsider and approve proposed specific investments. Our Board monitors the execution of our overall investment strategies and targeted \nasset classes. We acquire our investments primarily for income. We do not have a policy that requires us to focus our investments in \none or more particular geographic areas or industries. \nFinancing policies. We use leverage in order to increase potential returns to our stockholders and for financing our portfolio. \nWe do not speculate on changes in interest rates. Although we have identified leverage targets for each of our targeted asset classes, our \ninvestment policies do not have any minimum or maximum leverage limits. Our Manager’s investment committee has the discretion, \nwithout the need for further approval by our Board, to increase the amount of leverage we incur above our targeted range for individual \nasset classes subject, however, to any leverage constraints that may be imposed by existing financing arrangements. \nWe use borrowing and securitization strategies to accomplish our long-term match funding financing strategy. Based upon \ncurrent conditions in the credit markets for collateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations (sometimes, collectively, \nreferred to as CDOs and CLOs) we expect to modestly increase leverage through new CRE debt securitizations and the continued use \nof our senior secured financing facility and term financing facilities. We may also seek other credit arrangements to finance new \ninvestments that we believe can generate attractive risk-adjusted returns, subject to availability. \nCredit and risk management policies. Our Manager focuses its attention on credit and risk assessment from the earliest stage \nof the investment selection process. In addition, our Manager screens and monitors all potential investments to determine their impact \non maintaining our REIT qualification under federal income tax laws and our exclusion from investment company status under the \nInvestment Company Act. Portfolio risks, including risks related to credit losses, interest rate volatility, liquidity and counterparty credit, \nare generally managed on an asset and portfolio type basis by our Manager. \nFloating-Rate Loan Portfolio and Borrowings \nAs discussed in the “Managing our interest rate, pricing and liquidity risk” section above, our investments in floating-rate assets \nand utilization of floating-rate borrowings expose us to interest rate risk. In a business environment where benchmark interest rates are \nincreasing significantly, cash flows of the CRE assets underlying our loans may not be sufficient to pay debt service on our loans, which \ncould result in non-performance or default. We partially mitigate this risk by generally requiring our borrowers to  purchase interest rate \ncap agreements with non-affiliated, well-capitalized third parties and by selectively requiring our borrowers to have and maintain debt \nservice reserves. These interest rate caps generally mature prior to the maturity date of the loan and the borrowers are required to pay to \nextend them. In most cases the sponsors will need to fund additional equity into the properties to cover these costs as the property may \nnot generate sufficient cash flow to pay these costs. At December 31, 2022, 88.8% of the par value of our CRE loan portfolio had interest \nrate caps in place with a weighted-average maturity of 1.1 years. \nHistorically, we have used the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as the benchmark interest rate for our floating-rate \nwhole loans and we have been exposed to LIBOR through our floating-rate borrowings. Many of our floating-rate whole loans, CRE \nsecuritizations and term warehouse financing facilities included one-month LIBOR as the original contractual benchmark interest rate. \nOur unsecured junior subordinated debentures use three-month LIBOR as the contractual benchmark interest rate. In March 2021, the \nUnited Kingdom’s, or U.K.’s, Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that it would cease publication of the one-week and the \ntwo-month USD LIBOR immediately after December 31, 2021, and cease publication of the remaining tenors immediately after June \n30, 2023. In July 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee \ncomprising large U.S. financial institutions, has identified Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as its preferred alternative rate \nfor LIBOR. \nAll variable rate loans originated by us beginning January 1, 2022 have been benchmarked to SOFR. Additionally, all of our \nfloating-rate whole loans contain provisions that provide for the transition of the contractual benchmark interest rate to an alternative \nrate.  At December 31, 2022, our loan portfolio had a carrying value of $2.0 billion of floating rate loans, 68.3% or $1.4 billion of which \nhave interest rates tied to LIBOR and 31.7% or $646.2 million of which have interest rates tied to SOFR."

(“JPMorgan \nChase”) and Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), respectively, were amended to allow for the \ntransition to alternative rates, including rates tied to SOFR, subject to benchmark transition events. Additionally, during the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022, we entered into a loan agreement to finance the acquisition of a student housing complex, which uses SOFR as its \nbenchmark interest rate. At December 31, 2022, we had $1.7 billion of floating rate borrowings, 75.8% or $1.3 billion of which have \ninterest rates tied to LIBOR and 24.2% or $419.2 million of which have interest rates tied to SOFR.  \nWe expect to complete the process of converting our LIBOR-based loans and borrowings to an applicable benchmark interest \nrate during 2023. \n Refer to “Part I. - Item 1A.

We predominantly originate floating-rate first mortgage loans, or whole loans, directly to \nborrowers. The direct origination of whole loans enables us to better control the structure of the loans and to maintain direct lending \nrelationships with borrowers. Additionally, we may acquire whole loans from third parties that conform to our investment strategy. We \nmay create tranches of a loan we originate, consisting of an A-note (described below) and a B-note (described below), as well as \nmezzanine loans or other participations, which we may hold or sell to third parties. We do not obtain ratings on these investments. With \nrespect to our portfolio at December 31, 2022, our whole loan investments had loan-to-collateral value, or LTV, ratios that typically do \nnot exceed 85%. Typically, our whole loans are structured with an original term of up to three years, with one-year extensions that bring \nthe loan to a maximum term of five years. Substantially all of our CRE loans held at December 31, 2022 were whole loans. We expect \nto hold our whole loans to maturity. \nSenior interests in whole loans (A-notes). We may invest in senior interests in whole loans, referred to as A-notes, either \ndirectly originated or purchased from third parties. We do not intend to obtain ratings on these investments. We expect our typical A-\nnote investments to have LTV ratios not exceeding 70% and will generally be structured with an original term of up to three years, with \none-year extensions that bring the loan to a maximum term of five years. We expect to hold any A-note investments to maturity. We did \nnot hold any A-note investments at December 31, 2022."

      "text": "9 \nSubordinate interests in whole loans (B-notes). To a lesser extent, we may invest in subordinate interests in whole loans, \nreferred to as B-notes, which we will either directly originate or purchase from third parties. B-notes are loans secured by a first mortgage \nbut are subordinated to an A-note. The subordination of a B-note is generally evidenced by an intercreditor or participation agreement \nbetween the holders of the A-note and the B-note. In some instances, the B-note lender may require a security interest in the stock or \nother equity interests of the borrower as part of the transaction. B-note lenders have the same obligations, collateral and borrower as the \nA-note lender, but typically are subordinated in recovery upon a default to the A-note lender. B-notes share certain credit characteristics \nwith second mortgages in that both are subject to greater credit risk with respect to the underlying mortgage collateral than the \ncorresponding first mortgage or A-note. We do not intend to obtain ratings on these investments. We expect our typical B-note \ninvestments to have LTV ratios between 55% and 80% and will generally be structured with an original term of up to three years, with \none-year extensions that bring the loan to a maximum term of five years. We expect to hold any B-note investments to maturity. We did \nnot hold any B-note investments at December 31, 2022. \nIn addition to the accrued interest receivable on a B-note, we may earn fees charged to the borrower under the note or additional \nincome by receiving principal payments in excess of the discounted price (below par value) we paid to acquire the note. Our ownership \nof a B-note with controlling class rights may, in the event the financing fails to perform according to its terms, cause us to pursue our \nremedies as owner of the B-note, which may include foreclosure on, or modification of, the note. In some cases, the owner of the A-\nnote may be able to foreclose or modify the note against our wishes as owner of the B-note. As a result, our economic and business \ninterests may diverge from the interests of the owner of the A-note. \nMezzanine financing. Historically, we have invested in mezzanine loans that are senior to the borrower’s equity in, and \nsubordinate to the mortgage loan on, a property. A mezzanine loan is typically secured by a pledge of the ownership interests in the \nentity that directly owns the real property or by a second lien mortgage loan on the property. In addition, mezzanine loans typically \ninclude credit enhancements such as letters of credit, personal guarantees of the principals of the borrower, or collateral unrelated to the \nproperty. A mezzanine loan may be structured so that we receive a stated fixed or variable interest rate on the loan as well as a percentage \nof gross revenues and a percentage of the increase in the fair market value of the property securing the loan, payable upon maturity, \nrefinancing or sale of the property. Mezzanine loans may also have prepayment lockouts, penalties, minimum profit hurdles and other \nmechanisms to protect and enhance returns in the event of premature repayment. At December 31, 2022, our loan portfolio included one \nmezzanine loan with no carrying value. \nPreferred equity investments. Historically, we have invested in preferred equity investments in entities that own or acquire \nCRE properties. These investments are subordinate to first mortgage loans and mezzanine debt and are typically structured to provide \nsome credit enhancement differentiating it from the common equity. We expect our preferred equity investments to have LTV ratios \nbetween 65% and 90% with stated maturities from three to eight years. We expect to hold preferred equity investments to maturity. We \ndid not hold any preferred equity investments at December 31, 2022."

The terms were substantially the \nsame as the previous management agreement, except for the term, board designation rights, termination fee, Manager compensation and \ndefinition of incentive compensation, all discussed in detail below. \nThe Management Agreement requires our Manager to manage our business affairs in conformity with the policies and \ninvestment guidelines established by our Board. Our Manager provides its services under the supervision and direction of our Board. \nOur Manager is responsible for the selection, purchase and sale of our portfolio investments, our financing activities and providing us \nwith investment advisory services. Our Manager and its affiliates also provide us with a Chief Financial Officer and a sufficient number \nof additional accounting, finance, tax and investor relations professionals. Our Manager receives fees and is reimbursed for its expenses \nas follows: \n•  \nA monthly base management fee equal to 1/12th of the amount of our equity multiplied by 1.50%; provided, however, that \nfor each calendar month through July 31, 2022, such fee was equal to a minimum of $442,000. At December 31, 2022, the \ncalculated fee was in excess of the minimum fee charged. Under the Management Agreement, “equity” is equal to the net \nproceeds from issuances of shares of capital stock (or the value of common shares upon the conversion of convertible \nsecurities), after deducting any underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses and costs relating to such \nissuance, plus or minus our retained earnings (excluding non-cash equity compensation incurred in current or prior periods) \nless all amounts we have paid for common stock and preferred stock repurchases. The calculation is adjusted for one-time \nevents due to changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, as well as other non-cash charges, \nupon approval of our independent directors. \n•  \nIncentive compensation, calculated quarterly until the quarter ended December 31, 2022 as follows: (A) 20% of the amount \nby which our Earnings Available for Distribution (\"EAD\") (as defined in the Management Agreement) for a quarter \nexceeded the product of (i) the weighted average of (x) the book value divided by 10,293,783 and (y) the per share price \n(including the conversion price, if applicable) paid for our common shares in each offering (or issuance upon the \nconversion of convertible securities) by us subsequent to September 30, 2017, multiplied by (ii) the greater of (x) 1.75% \nand (y) 0.4375% plus one-fourth of the Ten Year Treasury Rate for such quarter; multiplied by (B) the weighted average \nnumber of common shares outstanding during such quarter; subject to adjustment (a) to exclude events pursuant to changes \nin GAAP or the application of GAAP as well as non-recurring or unusual transactions or events, after discussion between \nour Manager and the independent directors and approval by a majority of the independent directors in the case of non-\nrecurring or unusual transactions or events, and (b) to deduct an amount equal to any fees paid directly by a TRS (or any \nsubsidiary thereof) to employees, agents and/or affiliates of the Manager with respect to profits of such TRS (or subsidiary \nthereof) generated from the services of such employees, agents and/or affiliates, the fee structure of which shall have been \napproved by a majority of the independent directors and which fees may not exceed 20% of the net income (before such \nfees) of such TRS (or subsidiary thereof). \nWith respect to each fiscal quarter commencing with the quarter ending December 31, 2022, an incentive management fee \ncalculated and payable in arrears in an amount, not less than zero, equal to: \n•  \nfor the first full calendar quarter ending December 31, 2022, the product of (a) 20% and (b) the excess of (i) \nEAD of the Company for such calendar quarter, over (ii) the product of (A) the Company’s book value equity as \nof the end of such calendar quarter, and (B) 7% per annum; \n•  \nfor each of the second, third and fourth full calendar quarters following the calendar quarter ending December \n31, 2022, the excess of (1) the product of (a) 20% and (b) the excess of (i) EAD of the Company for the calendar \nquarter(s) following September 30, 2022, over (ii) the product of (A) the Company’s book value equity in the \ncalendar quarter(s) following September 30, 2022, and (B) 7% per annum, over (2) the sum of any incentive \ncompensation paid to the Manager with respect to the prior calendar quarter(s) following September 30, 2022 \n(other than the most recent calendar quarter); and \n•  \nfor each calendar quarter thereafter, the excess of (1) the product of (a) 20% and (b) the excess of (i) EAD of \nthe Company for the previous 12-month period, over (ii) the product of (A) the Company’s book value equity in \nthe previous 12-month period, and (B) 7% per annum, over (2) the sum of any incentive compensation paid to \nthe Manager with respect to the first three calendar quarters of such previous 12-month period; provided, however, \nthat no incentive compensation shall be payable with respect to any calendar quarter unless EAD for the twelve \nmost recently completed calendar quarters (or such lesser number of completed calendar quarters from September \n30, 2022) in the aggregate is greater than zero."

Up to 75% of the incentive \ncompensation is payable in cash and at least 25% is payable in the form of an award of common stock. Our Manager may elect to receive \nmore than 25% of its incentive compensation in common stock. All shares are fully vested upon issuance; however, our Manager may \nnot sell such shares for one year after the incentive compensation becomes due and payable unless the Management Agreement is \nterminated.

Our Board reviews our Manager’s performance annually. The \nManagement Agreement may be terminated annually upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors, or by \nthe affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, based upon unsatisfactory \nperformance that is materially detrimental to us or a determination by our independent directors that the management fees payable to \nour Manager are not fair, subject to our Manager’s right to prevent such a compensation termination by accepting a mutually acceptable \nreduction of management fees. Our Board must provide 180 days’ prior notice of any such termination. If we terminate the Management \nAgreement, our Manager is entitled to a termination fee equal to four times the sum of the average annual base management fee and the \naverage annual incentive compensation earned by our Manager during the two 12-month periods immediately preceding the date of \ntermination, calculated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter before the date of termination. \nWe may also terminate the Management Agreement for cause with 30 days’ prior written notice from our Board. No termination \nfee is payable in the event of a termination for cause. The Management Agreement defines cause as: \n•  \nour Manager’s continued material breach of any provision of the Management Agreement following a period of 30 days \nafter written notice thereof; \n•  \nour Manager’s fraud, misappropriation of funds, or embezzlement against us; \n•  \nour Manager’s gross negligence in the performance of its duties under the Management Agreement; \n•  \nthe dissolution, bankruptcy or insolvency, or the filing of a voluntary bankruptcy petition by our Manager; or \n•  \na change of control (as defined in the Management Agreement) of our Manager if a majority of our independent directors \ndetermines, at any point during the 18 months following the change of control, that the change of control was detrimental \nto the ability of our Manager to perform its duties in substantially the same manner conducted before the change of control. \nCause does not include unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to our business. \nOur Manager may terminate the Management Agreement at its option, (A) in the event that we default in the performance or \nobservance of any material term, condition or covenant contained in the Management Agreement and such default continues for a period \nof 30 days after written notice thereof, or (B) without payment of a termination fee by us, if we become regulated as an investment \ncompany under the Investment Company Act, with such termination deemed to occur immediately before such event."

      "text": "14 \nRegulatory Aspects of Our Investment Strategy: \nExclusion from Regulation Under the Investment Company Act \nWe operate our business so as to be excluded from regulation under the Investment Company Act. Because we conduct our \nbusiness through wholly-owned subsidiaries, we must ensure not only that we qualify for an exclusion from regulation under the \nInvestment Company Act, but also that each of our subsidiaries also qualifies. \nWe believe that ACRES Realty Funding, Inc., (“ACRES RF”) the subsidiary that at December 31, 2022 held substantially all \nof our CRE loan assets, is excluded from Investment Company Act regulation under Section 3(c)(5)(C), a provision designed for \ncompanies that do not issue redeemable securities and are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring \nmortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate. To qualify for this exclusion, at least 55% of ACRES RF’s assets must consist \nof mortgage loans and other assets that are considered the functional equivalent of mortgage loans for purposes of the Investment \nCompany Act and interests in real properties, which we refer to as Qualifying Interests. Moreover, 80% of ACRES RF’s assets must \nconsist of Qualifying Interests and other real estate-related assets. ACRES RF has not issued, and does not intend to issue, redeemable \nsecurities. \nWe treat our investments in CRE whole loans, A-notes, specific types of B-notes and specific types of mezzanine loans as \nQualifying Interests for purposes of determining our eligibility for the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) to the extent such \ntreatment is consistent with guidance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, or its staff. We believe that SEC \nstaff guidance allows us to treat B-notes as Qualifying Interests where we have unilateral rights to instruct the servicer to foreclose upon \na defaulted mortgage loan, replace the servicer in the event the servicer, in its discretion, elects not to foreclose on such a loan, and \npurchase the A-note in the event of a default on the mortgage loan. We believe, based upon an analysis of existing SEC staff guidance, \nthat we may treat mezzanine loans as Qualifying Interests where (i) the borrower is a special purpose bankruptcy-remote entity whose \nsole purpose is to hold all of the ownership interests in another special purpose entity that owns commercial real property, (ii) both \nentities are organized as limited liability companies or limited partnerships, (iii) under their organizational documents and the loan \ndocuments, neither entity may engage in any other business, (iv) the ownership interests of either entity have no value apart from the \nunderlying real property which is essentially the only asset held by the property-owning entity, (v) the value of the underlying property \nin excess of the amount of senior obligations is in excess of the amount of the mezzanine loan, (vi) the borrower pledges its entire \ninterest in the property-owning entity to the lender which obtains a perfected security interest in the collateral and (vii) the relative rights \nand priorities between the mezzanine lender and the senior lenders with respect to claims on the underlying property are set forth in an \nintercreditor agreement between the parties which gives the mezzanine lender certain cure and purchase rights in case there is a default \non the senior loan. If the SEC staff provides future guidance that these investments are not Qualifying Interests, then we will treat them, \nfor purposes of determining our eligibility for the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C), as real estate-related assets or miscellaneous \nassets, as appropriate. Historically, we have held “whole pool certificates” in mortgage loans, although, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, \nwe had no whole pool certificates in our portfolios. Pursuant to existing SEC staff guidance, we consider whole pool certificates to be \nQualifying Interests. A whole pool certificate is a certificate that represents the entire beneficial interest in an underlying pool of \nmortgage loans. By contrast, a certificate that represents less than the entire beneficial interest in the underlying mortgage loans is not \nconsidered to be a Qualifying Interest for purposes of the 55% test, but constitutes a real estate-related asset for purposes of the 80% \ntest. \nTo the extent ACRES RF holds its CRE loan assets through wholly or majority-owned CRE debt securitization vehicles or \nspecial purpose entities, or SPEs, ACRES RF also intends to conduct its operations so that it will not come within the definition of an \ninvestment company set forth in Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act because less than 40% of the value of its total assets \n(exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis will consist of “investment securities,” which we refer \nto as the 40% test. “Investment securities” exclude U.S. government securities and securities of majority-owned subsidiaries that are not \nthemselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(1) \nor Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. Certain of the wholly-owned CRE debt securitization subsidiaries of ACRES RF \nrely on Section 3(c)(5)(C) for their Investment Company Act exemption, with the result that ACRES RF’s interests in the CRE debt \nsecuritization subsidiaries do not constitute “investment securities” for the purpose of the 40% test. \nOur other subsidiaries, RCC Commercial, Inc., or RCC Commercial, RCC Commercial II, Inc., or Commercial II, RCC \nCommercial III, Inc., or Commercial III, RCC TRS, LLC, or RCC TRS, Resource TRS, LLC, or Resource TRS, and RSO EquityCo, \nLLC, or RSO Equity, do not qualify for the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion. However, we believe they qualify for exclusion under either \nSection 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7). As required by these exclusions, we will not allow any of these entities to make, or propose to make, a public \noffering of its securities. In addition, with respect to those subsidiaries for which we rely upon the Section 3(c)(1) exclusion, and as \nrequired thereby, we limit the number of holders of their securities to not more than 100 persons calculated in accordance with the \nattribution rules of Section 3(c)(1), and with respect to those subsidiaries for which we rely on the Section 3(c)(7) exclusion, and as \nrequired thereby, we limit ownership of their securities to “qualified purchasers.” If we form other subsidiaries, we must ensure that \nthey qualify for an exemption or exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act."

We do so by monitoring the value of our interests in our subsidiaries so that we can ensure that ACRES \nCommercial Realty Corp. satisfies the 40% test.

In connection with the forward-looking statements that appear in \nthis annual report, you should carefully review the factors discussed below and the cautionary statements referred to in “Forward-\nLooking Statements.” \nRisk Factors Summary \nOur risk factors include discussion of risks to our business attributable to the impact of current economic conditions, risks \nrelated to our financing, risks related to our operations, risks related to our investments, risks related to our Manager, risks related to our \norganization and structure, tax risks and general risks, including as follows: \n \nIf current economic and market conditions were to deteriorate, our ability to obtain the capital and financing necessary for growth \nmay be limited, which could limit our profitability, ability to make distributions and the market price of our common stock. \n \nThe outbreak of widespread contagious disease, such as COVID-19, has caused, and may continue to cause, disruptions to the \nUnited States and global economy and to our business, which has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial \ncondition, our results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources. \n \nOur portfolio has been financed in material part through the use of leverage that may reduce the return on our investments and cash \navailable for distribution. \n \nOur repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities and other short-term financings have credit risks that could result in losses. \n \nWe are exposed to loss if lenders under our repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities, senior secured financing facility or other \nshort-term financings liquidate the assets securing those facilities. Moreover, assets acquired by us pursuant to our repurchase \nagreements, warehouse facilities, senior secured financing facility or other short-term financings may not be suitable for refinancing \nthrough long-term arrangements that may require us to liquidate some or all of the related assets. \n \nWe will incur losses on our repurchase transactions if the counterparty to the transactions defaults on its obligation to resell the \nunderlying assets back to us at the end of the transaction term, or if the value of the underlying assets has declined as of the end of \nthe term or if we default in our obligations to purchase the assets. \n \nWe may have to repurchase assets that we have sold in connection with CRE debt securitizations and other securitizations. \n \nFinancing our REIT qualifying assets with repurchase agreements and warehouse facilities could adversely affect our ability to \nqualify as a REIT. \n \nHistorically, we have financed most of our investments through CRE debt securitizations and have retained the equity. CRE debt \nsecuritization equity receives distributions from the CRE debt securitization only if the CRE debt securitization generates enough \nincome to first pay the holders of its debt securities and its expenses. \n \nIf our CRE debt securitization financings fail to meet their performance tests, including over-collateralization requirements, our net \nincome and cash flow from these CRE debt securitizations will be eliminated. \n \nIf we issue debt securities, the terms may restrict our ability to make cash distributions, require us to obtain approval to sell our \nassets or otherwise restrict our operations in ways that could make it difficult to execute our investment strategy and achieve our \ninvestment objectives. \n \nDepending upon market conditions, we intend to seek financing through CRE debt securitizations, which would expose us to risks \nrelating to the accumulation of assets for use in the CRE debt securitizations. \n \nWe may change our investment strategy without stockholder consent, which may result in riskier investments than those currently \ntargeted. \n \nOur business is highly dependent on communications and information systems, and systems failures or cybersecurity incidents \ncould significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability \nto operate our business. \n \nDeclines in the market values of our investments may reduce periodic reported results, credit availability and our ability to make \ndistributions. \n \nIncreases in interest rates and other factors could reduce the value of our investments, result in reduced earnings or losses and reduce \nour ability to pay distributions."

We may not be able to dispose of properties when desired or on favorable terms. \n \nIf our allowance for credit losses is not adequate to cover actual future loan and lease losses, our earnings may decline. \n \nThe current expected credit losses, or CECL, model may require us to increase our allowance for credit losses and therefore may \nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n \nOur investment portfolio may have material geographic, sector, property-type and sponsor concentrations. \n \nWe may be exposed to environmental liabilities with respect to properties that we own or take title to in the future. \n \nWe depend on our Manager and ACRES to develop and operate our business and may not find suitable replacements if the \nManagement Agreement terminates. \n \nOur Manager’s fee structure may not create proper incentives, and the incentive compensation we pay our Manager may increase \nthe investment risk of our portfolio. \n \nOur Manager manages our portfolio pursuant to very broad investment guidelines and our Board does not approve each investment \ndecision, which may result in our making riskier investments. \n \nOur Manager and ACRES will face conflicts of interest relating to the allocation of investment opportunities and such conflicts \nmay not be resolved in our favor, which could limit our ability to acquire assets and, in turn, limit our ability to make distributions \nand reduce your overall investment return. \n \nOur officers and many of the investment professionals that provide services to us through our Manager are also officers or employees \nof ACRES and may face conflicts regarding the allocation of their time. \n \nOur charter and bylaws contain provisions that may inhibit potential acquisition bids that you and other stockholders may consider \nfavorable, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result. \n \nMaryland takeover statutes may prevent a change in control of us, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a \nresult. \n \nOur rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited, which could limit your \nrecourse in the event of actions not in your best interests. \n \nWe have not established a minimum distribution payment level and we cannot assure you of our ability to make distributions in the \nfuture. In the future, we may use uninvested offering proceeds or borrowed funds to make distributions. \n \nLoss of our exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act would require significant changes in our operations and \ncould reduce the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions. \n \nLegislative, regulatory or administrative changes could adversely affect our stockholders or us."

      "text": "18 \nRisks Related to Impact of Current Economic Conditions \nIf current economic and market conditions were to deteriorate, our ability to obtain the capital and financing necessary for growth \nmay be limited, which could limit our profitability, ability to make distributions and the market price of our common stock. \nWe depend upon the availability of adequate debt and equity capital for growth in our operations. Although historically we \nhave been able to raise both debt and equity capital, recent market and economic conditions have made obtaining additional equity \ncapital highly dilutive to existing shareholders and may possibly affect our ability to raise debt capital. If current economic conditions \nwere to deteriorate, our ability to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms, could be further limited, which could limit our ability \nto generate growth, our profitability, our ability to make distributions and the market price of our common stock. In addition, as a REIT, \nwe must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid \nand excluding net capital gain, to our stockholders and are therefore not able to retain significant amounts of our earnings for new \ninvestments, except where the existence of NOL and net capital loss carryforwards enable us to do so. While we may, through our TRSs \nretain earnings as new capital, we are subject to REIT qualification requirements that limit the value of TRS stock and securities relative \nto the other assets owned by a REIT. \nThe outbreak of widespread contagious disease, such as COVID-19, has caused, and may continue to cause, disruptions to the U.S. \nand global economy and to our business, which has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial condition, \nour results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources. \nIn December 2019, COVID-19 was identified and the resulting global proliferation of the virus led the World Health \nOrganization to designate COVID-19 as a pandemic and numerous countries, including the U.S., to declare national emergencies. Many \ncountries have responded to the outbreak by instituting quarantines and restrictions on travel, which has resulted in the closure or remote \noperation of non-essential businesses. While the U.S. and certain countries around the world have eased restrictions and financial markets \nand unemployment rates have stabilized to some degree, the pandemic continues to cause uncertainty on the U.S. and global economies, \ngenerally, and the CRE business in particular. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our financial condition, liquidity \nand results of operations and the market price of our common stock and preferred stock. We expect that these impacts are likely to \ncontinue to some extent as the longer-term macro-economic effects of the pandemic continue. Although many or all facets of our \nbusiness have been or could be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we currently believe the following impacts to be among the most \nmaterial to us: \n•  \nCOVID-19 could have a significant long-term impact on the broader economy and the CRE market generally, which would \nnegatively impact the value of the properties collateralizing our loans. Our portfolio includes loans collateralized by hotel, \nretail, office, multifamily and other property types that are particularly negatively impacted by the pandemic. While we \nbelieve the principal amount of our loans is currently generally adequately protected by underlying value, there can be no \nassurance that as the pandemic continues these values will not be adversely affected, which could impact our ability to \nrealize the entire principal value of some or all of our investments. \n•  \nWe are actively engaged in discussions with our borrowers, some of whom we expect may face challenges in complying \nwith the terms of their loans. In the past, we have executed extension and forbearance agreements of CRE loans in an effort \nto reduce the credit risk created as a result of financial difficulties related to the pandemic. We anticipate the future \nexecution of modifications of our loans and potentially instances of default or foreclosure on assets underlying our loans, \nwhich may adversely affect the credit profile and realizable value of our assets, our results of operations and our financial \ncondition. \n•  \nThe shocks to global markets, particularly the real estate credit markets, adversely impacted the market pricing of our CRE \nsecurities. Depending on the magnitude and duration of the pandemic’s impact, the assets underlying these securities may \ndefault on their terms, requiring that we incur credit losses on our portfolio that exceed the allowance for credit losses we \nhave established."

      "text": "19 \n•  \nWe have warehouse facilities with numerous lenders and, when utilized, continuously engage in discussions around the \nvalue of pledged assets as defined in our agreements with such lenders, potential deleveraging, the application of certain \nprovisions of such agreements to these circumstances and other structural elements under the agreements. When utilized, \nif we do not have the funds available to make required payments, it would likely result in defaults under the particular \nfacilities affected that, because of cross-default provisions, could result in defaults under other debt instruments as well as \npotential loss of our assets to the lenders unless we are able to raise the funds from alternative sources, including by selling \nor financing assets or raising capital, each of which we may be required to do under adverse market conditions or at an \ninopportune time or on unfavorable terms, or may be unable to do at all. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it very \ndifficult for businesses generally, including us, to access liquidity sources at terms commensurate with those prior to this \npandemic, or at all. Pledging additional collateral or otherwise paying down facilities to satisfy our lenders and avoid \npotential margin calls and loan defaults would reduce our cash available to meet subsequent margin calls and/or future \nfunding requests as well as make other, higher yielding investments, thereby decreasing our liquidity, return on equity, \navailable cash, net income and ability to implement our investment strategy. If we cannot meet lender requirements related \nto margin calls or other terms of our credit agreements, the lender or counterparty could accelerate our indebtedness, \nincrease the interest rate on advanced funds and terminate our ability to borrow additional funds, which would materially \nand adversely affect our financial condition and ability to implement our investment strategy. \n•  \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has in the past reduced, and may reduce, the availability of liquidity sources, but our \nrequirements for liquidity, including future funding commitments and potential margin calls, likely will not be \ncommensurately reduced. If we do not have funds available to meet our obligations, we would have to raise funds from \nalternative sources, which may be at unfavorable terms or may not be available to us due to the impacts of COVID-19. We \nexpect that the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our liquidity position and could limit our \nability to grow our business and fully execute our business strategy. We seek to preserve and build our liquidity to best \nposition us to weather near-term market uncertainty, satisfy our loan future funding requests and to potentially make new \ninvestments, which will cause us to take some or all of the following actions: borrow additional capital, sell assets and /or \nchange our dividend distributions consistent with REIT distribution requirements. \n•  \nInterest rates and credit spreads have been significantly impacted since the outbreak of COVID-19. This can result in \nvolatile changes to the fair value of our floating rate loans, fixed-rate loans and CRE securities and also the interest \nobligations on our floating-rate borrowings, which could result in an increase to our interest expense. \nWe also have experienced and may continue to experience other negative impacts to our business as a result of the pandemic \nthat could exacerbate other risks, including: \n•  \nlack of liquidity in our assets; \n•  \ngreater risk of loss on our mezzanine loans; \n•  \nrisk associated with loans that are in transition; \n•  \nthe concentration of our loans and investments in certain geographies, property types or relationships in areas that may be \ndisproportionately affected by the pandemic; \n•  \nrisks associated with our securitizations that we use to finance our loans; \n•  \ndowngrades in credit ratings assigned to our investments; \n•  \nthe difficulty of estimating provisions for credit losses; \n•  \nborrower and counterparty risks; \n•  \noperational impacts on ourselves and our third-party advisors, service providers, vendors and counterparties; and \n•  \nlimitations on our ability to ensure business continuity in the event our, or our third-party advisors’ and service providers’, \ncontinuity of operations plan is not effective or improperly implemented or deployed during the disruption caused by the \npandemic."

      "text": "20 \nThe rapid development of the pandemic and the resulting economic effects have created uncertainty surrounding the ultimate \nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy generally, and the CRE business in particular. As a result, we cannot project \nthe ultimate adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy or our business, including our financial condition and \nperformance. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 will depend on future developments, including new information that may emerge \nabout the severity of the pandemic, the timing, scope and effectiveness of additional governmental responses to the pandemic, including \nthe potential re-imposition of quarantines, states of emergencies, restrictions on travel and stay-at-home orders  and the ensuing reactions \nby consumers, companies, governmental entities and global markets. \nA prolonged economic slowdown or lengthy or severe recession causing declining real estate values could impair our investments \nand harm our operations. \nWe believe the risks associated with our business will be more severe during periods of economic slowdown or recession if \nthese periods are accompanied by declining real estate values. Declining real estate values will likely reduce the level of new mortgage \nloan originations and other real estate-related investment activities since borrowers often use the appreciation in their existing real estate \nholdings or the expected appreciation in value-add projects to support the purchase of or incremental investment in additional properties. \nFurther, declining real estate values significantly increase the likelihood that we will incur losses on our loans in the event of default \nbecause the value of our collateral may be insufficient to cover our investment in the loan. Any sustained period of increased payment \ndelinquencies, foreclosures or losses could adversely affect our ability to invest in, sell or securitize loans, which could materially and \nadversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and our ability to pay distributions. \n \nRisks Related to Our Financing \nOur portfolio has been financed in material part through the use of leverage that may reduce the return on our investments and cash \navailable for distribution. \nOur portfolio has been financed in material part through the use of leverage and, as credit market conditions permit, we will \nseek such financing in the future. Using leverage subjects us to risks associated with debt financing, including the risks that: \n•  \nthe cash provided by our operating activities will not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest,  \n•  \nthe cost of financing may increase relative to the income from the assets financed, reducing the income we have available \nto pay distributions, and  \n•  \nour investments may have maturities that differ from the maturities of the related financing and, consequently, the risk that \nthe terms of any refinancing we obtain will not be as favorable as the terms of existing financing.  \nIf we are unable to secure refinancing of our currently outstanding financing, when due, on acceptable terms, we may be forced \nto dispose of some of our assets at disadvantageous terms or to obtain financing at unfavorable terms, either of which may result in \nlosses to us or reduce the cash flow available to meet our debt service obligations or to pay distributions. \nFinancing that we may obtain and financing we have obtained through CRE debt securitizations typically require, or will \nrequire, us to maintain a specified ratio of the amount of the financing to the value of the assets financed. A decrease in the value of \nthese assets may lead to margin calls or calls for the pledge of additional assets, which we will have to satisfy. We may not have sufficient \nfunds or unpledged assets to satisfy any such calls, which could result in our loss of distributions from and interests in affected CRE \ndebt securitizations, which would reduce our assets, income and ability to make distributions. \nOur repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities and other short-term financings have credit risks that could result in losses. \nIf we accumulate assets for a CRE debt securitization on a short-term credit facility and do not complete the CRE debt \nsecuritization financing, or if a default occurs under the facility, the short-term lender may sell the assets and we would be responsible \nfor the amount by which the original purchase price of the assets exceeds their sale price, up to the amount of our investment or guaranty. \nWe may lose money on our repurchase transactions if the counterparty to the transaction defaults on its obligation to resell the \nunderlying security back to us at the end of the transaction term, or if the value of the underlying security has declined as of the end of \nthe term or if we default on our obligations under the repurchase agreements."

      "text": "21 \nWe are exposed to loss if lenders under our repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities, senior secured financing facility or other \nshort-term financings liquidate the assets securing those facilities. Moreover, assets acquired by us pursuant to our repurchase \nagreements, warehouse facilities, senior secured financing facility or other short-term financings may not be suitable for refinancing \nthrough long-term arrangements and may require us to liquidate some or all of the related assets. \nWe have entered into repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities and senior secured financing facility and expect in the future \nto seek additional debt to finance our growth. Lenders typically have the right to liquidate assets securing or acquired under these \nfacilities upon the occurrence of specified events, such as an event of default. We are exposed to loss if the proceeds received by the \nlender upon liquidation are insufficient to satisfy our obligation to the lender. We are also subject to the risk that the assets subject to \nsuch repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities or other debt might not be suitable for long-term refinancing or securitization \ntransactions. If we are unable to refinance these assets on a long-term basis, or if long-term financing is more expensive than we \nanticipated at the time of our acquisition of the assets to be financed, we might be required to liquidate assets. \nWe will incur losses on our repurchase transactions if the counterparty to the transactions defaults on its obligation to resell the \nunderlying assets back to us at the end of the transaction term, or if the value of the underlying assets has declined as of the end of \nthe term or if we default in our obligations to purchase the assets. \nWhen engaged in repurchase transactions, we generally sell assets to the transaction counterparty and receive cash from the \ncounterparty. The counterparty must resell the assets back to us at the end of the term of the transaction. Because the cash we receive \nfrom the counterparty when we initially sell the assets is less than the market value of those assets, if the counterparty defaults on its \nobligation to resell the assets back to us we will incur a loss on the transaction. We will also incur a loss if the value of the underlying \nassets has declined as of the end of the transaction term, as we will have to repurchase the assets for their initial value but would receive \nassets worth less than that amount. If we default upon our obligation to repurchase the assets, the counterparty may liquidate them at a \nloss, which we are obligated to repay. Any losses we incur on our repurchase transactions would reduce our equity and our earnings, \nand thus our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. \nWe may have to repurchase assets that we have sold in connection with CRE debt securitizations and other securitizations. \nIf any of the assets that we originate or acquire and sell or securitize do not comply with representations and warranties that we \nmake about them, we may have to repurchase these assets from the CRE debt securitization or securitization vehicle, or replace them. \nIn addition, we may have to indemnify purchasers for losses or expenses incurred as a result of a breach of a representation or warranty. \nAny significant repurchases or indemnification payments could materially reduce our liquidity, earnings and ability to make \ndistributions. \nFinancing our REIT qualifying assets with repurchase agreements and warehouse facilities could adversely affect our ability to \nqualify as a REIT. \nWe have entered into and intend to enter into, sale and repurchase agreements under which we nominally sell certain REIT \nqualifying assets to a counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to repurchase the sold assets. We believe that we will be \ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the owner of the assets that are the subject of any such agreement, notwithstanding that \nwe may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement. It is possible, however, that the \nInternal Revenue Service, or IRS, could assert that we did not own the assets during the term of the sale and repurchase agreement, in \nwhich case our ability to qualify as a REIT would be adversely affected. If any of our REIT qualifying assets are subject to a repurchase \nagreement and are sold by the counterparty in connection with a margin call, the loss of those assets could impair our ability to qualify \nas a REIT. Accordingly, unlike other REITs, we may be subject to additional risk regarding our ability to qualify and maintain our \nqualification as a REIT. \nHistorically, we have financed most of our investments through CRE debt securitizations and have retained the equity. CRE debt \nsecuritization equity receives distributions from the CRE debt securitization only if the CRE debt securitization generates enough \nincome to first pay the holders of its debt securities and its expenses. \nHistorically, we have financed most of our investments through CRE debt securitizations in which we retained the equity \ninterest. Depending on market conditions and credit availability, we intend to use CRE debt securitizations to finance our investments \nin the future. The equity interests of a CRE debt securitization are subordinate in right of payment to all other securities issued by the \nCRE debt securitization. The equity is usually entitled to all of the income generated by the CRE debt securitization after the CRE debt \nsecuritization pays all of the interest due on the debt securities and its other expenses. However, there will be little or no income available \nto the CLO equity if there are excessive defaults by the issuers of the underlying collateral, which would significantly reduce the value \nof that interest. Reductions in the value of the equity interests we have in a CRE debt securitization, if we determine that they are other-\nthan-temporary, will reduce our earnings. In addition, the liquidity of the equity securities of CLOs is constrained and, because they \nrepresent a leveraged investment in the CRE debt securitization’s assets, the value of the equity securities will generally have greater \nfluctuations than the value of the underlying collateral."

Accordingly, if over-\ncollateralization tests are not met, distributions on the subordinated debt and equity we hold in these CLOs will cease, resulting in a \nsubstantial reduction in our cash flow. Other tests (based on delinquency levels, interest coverage or other criteria) may restrict our \nability to receive cash distributions from assets collateralizing the securities issued by the CRE debt securitization entity. Although at \nDecember 31, 2022, all of our CRE debt securitizations met their performance tests, we cannot assure you that our CRE debt \nsecuritizations will satisfy the performance tests in the future. For information concerning compliance by our CRE debt securitizations \nwith their over-collateralization tests, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of \nOperation - Liquidity and Capital Resources.” \nIf any of our CRE debt securitizations fail to meet collateralization or other tests relevant to the most senior debt issued and \noutstanding by the CRE debt securitization issuer, an event of default may occur under that CRE debt securitization. If that occurs, our \nManager’s ability to manage the CRE debt securitization likely would be terminated and our ability to attempt to cure any defaults in \nthe CRE debt securitization would be limited, which would increase the likelihood of a reduction or elimination of cash flow and returns \nto us in those CLOs for an indefinite time. \nIf we issue debt securities, the terms may restrict our ability to make cash distributions, require us to obtain approval to sell our \nassets or otherwise restrict our operations in ways that could make it difficult to execute our investment strategy and achieve our \ninvestment objectives. \nAny debt securities we may issue in the future will likely be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants \nrestricting our operating flexibility. Holders of senior securities may be granted the right to hold a perfected security interest in certain \nof our assets, to accelerate payments due under the indenture if we breach financial or other covenants, to restrict distributions, and to \nrequire us to obtain their approval to sell assets. These covenants could limit our ability to operate our business or manage our assets \neffectively. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges more \nfavorable than those of our common stock. We, and indirectly our stockholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. \nDepending upon market conditions, we intend to seek financing through CRE debt securitizations, which would expose us to risks \nrelating to the accumulation of assets for use in the CRE debt securitizations. \nHistorically, we have financed a significant portion of our assets through the use of CRE debt securitizations, and have \naccumulated assets for these financings through short-term credit facilities, typically repurchase agreements or warehouse facilities. \nDepending upon market conditions, and, consequently, the extent to which such financing is available to us, we expect to seek similar \nfinancing arrangements in the future. In addition to risks discussed above, these arrangements could expose us to other credit risks, \nincluding the following: \n•  \nAn event of default under one short-term facility may constitute a default under other credit facilities we may have, \npotentially resulting in asset sales and losses to us, as well as increasing our financing costs or reducing the amount of \ninvestable funds available to us. \n•  \nWe may be unable to acquire a sufficient amount of eligible assets to maximize the efficiency of a CRE debt securitization \nissuance, which would require us to seek other forms of term financing or liquidate the assets. We may not be able to \nobtain term financing on acceptable terms, or at all, and liquidation of the assets may be at prices less than those we paid, \nresulting in losses to us. \n•  \nUsing short-term financing to accumulate assets for a CRE debt securitization issuance may require us to obtain new \nfinancing as the short-term financing matures. Residual financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. \nMoreover, an increase in short-term interest rates at the time that we seek to enter into new borrowings may reduce the \nspread between the income on our assets and the cost of our borrowings. This would reduce returns on our assets, which \nwould reduce earnings and, in turn, cash available for distribution to our stockholders."

Non-performance on such obligations may \ncause losses to us in excess of the capital invested in our subsidiary or the relevant joint venture and there is no assurance that we will \nhave sufficient capital to cover any such losses. \nThe debt facilities that we use to finance our investments may require us to provide additional collateral. \nIf the market value of the loans or investments pledged or sold by us to a funding source decline in value, we may be required \nby the lender to provide additional collateral or pay down a portion of the funds advanced. We may not have the funds available to pay \ndown such future debt, which could result in defaults. Posting additional collateral to support these facilities would reduce our liquidity \nand limit our ability to leverage our assets. In the event we do not have sufficient liquidity to meet such requirements, lenders can \naccelerate the indebtedness, increase interest rates and terminate our ability to borrow. Further, lenders may require us to maintain a \ncertain amount of uninvested cash or set aside unlevered assets sufficient to maintain a specified liquidity position. As a result, we may \nnot be able to leverage our assets as fully as we would choose, which could reduce our return on assets. In the event that we are unable \nto meet these collateral obligations, our financial condition could deteriorate rapidly. \n \nRisks Related to Our Operations \nWe may change our investment strategy without stockholder consent, which may result in riskier investments than those currently \ntargeted. \nSubject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act, we \nmay change our investment strategy, including the percentage of assets that may be invested in each asset class, or in the case of \nsecurities, in a single issuer, at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in our making investments that are \ndifferent from, and possibly riskier than, the investments described in this report. A change in our investment strategy may increase our \nexposure to interest rate, credit market and real estate market fluctuations, all of which may reduce the market price of our common \nstock and reduce our ability to make distributions to stockholders. Furthermore, a change in our asset allocation could result in our \nmaking investments in asset categories different from those described in this report. \nWe believe earnings available for distribution (\"EAD\"), a non-GAAP financial measure, is an appropriate measure to evaluate our \nperformance and ability to pay dividends; however, in certain instances EAD may not be reflective of actual economic results. \nWe utilize EAD as a measure to evaluate our performance and ability to pay dividends and believe that it is useful to analysts, \ninvestors and other parties in the evaluations of REITs. We believe EAD is a useful measure of our performance and ability to pay \ndividends because it excludes the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of \nour current CRE loan origination portfolio and other CRE-related investments and operations. EAD excludes (i) non-cash equity \ncompensation expense, (ii) unrealized gains or losses, (iii) non-cash provision for loan losses, (iv) non-cash impairments on securities, \n(v) non-cash amortization of discounts or premiums associated with borrowings, (vi) net income or loss from limited partnership interests \nowned at the initial measurement date, (vii) net income or loss from non-core assets, (viii) real estate depreciation and amortization, (ix) \nforeign currency gains or losses and (x) income or losses from discontinued operations. EAD may also be adjusted periodically to \nexclude certain one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash items. Although pursuant to the Management \nAgreement we calculate incentive compensation using EAD excluding incentive compensation payable to our Manager, we include \nincentive compensation payable to our Manager in EAD for reporting purposes. EAD does not represent net income or cash generated \nfrom operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income or as a measure of liquidity under GAAP. \nOur methodology for calculating EAD may differ from methodologies used by other companies to calculate similar supplemental \nperformance measures, and accordingly, our reported EAD may not be comparable to similar performance measures used by other \ncompanies. \nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent \nfraud. \nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control, fail to correct any flaws in the design or operating effectiveness \nof internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure, or fail to prevent fraud, our stockholders could lose confidence in our \nfinancial and other reporting, which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock."

In making the assessment and otherwise \nconducting customary due diligence, we will rely on the resources available to us and, in some cases, an investigation by third parties. \nOur due diligence processes, however, may not uncover all facts that may be relevant to an investment decision. \nOur business is highly dependent on communications and information systems, and systems failures or cybersecurity incidents could \nsignificantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to \noperate our business. \nWe depend on the information systems of our Manager, ACRES and third parties. Any failure or interruption of our systems \nor cyber-attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems could cause delays or other problems in our lending activities. A \ndisruption or breach could also lead to unauthorized access to and release, misuse, loss or destruction of our confidential information or \npersonal or confidential information of our Manager, ACRES or third parties, which could lead to regulatory fines, litigation, costs of \nremediating the breach and reputational harm. In addition, we also face the risk of operational failure, termination or capacity constraints \nof any of the third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including clearing agents or other financial \nintermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions, if their respective systems experience failure, interruption, cyber-attacks, \nor security breaches. If unauthorized parties gain access to our technology systems, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify \nprivate and sensitive information. Although we have implemented various measures to manage risks relating to these types of events, \nsuch systems could prove to be inadequate and, if compromised, could become inoperable for extended periods of time, cease to function \nproperly or fail to adequately secure private information, including material nonpublic information. We may face increased costs as we \ncontinue to evolve our cyber defenses in order to contend with changing risks. These costs and losses associated with these risks are \ndifficult to predict and quantify, but could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results. \nThe costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. As \nour and our borrowers’ reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our information systems, both internal and those \nprovided by third party service providers, and the information systems of our borrowers. We have implemented processes, procedures \nand internal controls to help mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions, but these measures, as well as our increased awareness of \nthe nature and extent of a risk of a cyber-incident, do not guarantee that a cyber-incident will not occur and/or that our operations or \nconfidential information will not be negatively impacted by such an incident. \nComputer malware, viruses, computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent in our industry and may occur \non our systems. We rely heavily on our financial, accounting and other data processing systems. Although we have not detected a \nmaterial cybersecurity breach to date, other financial services institutions have reported material breaches of their systems, some of \nwhich have been significant. Even with all reasonable security efforts, not every breach can be prevented or even detected. It is possible \nthat we have experienced an undetected breach. There is no assurance that we, or the third parties that facilitate our business activities, \nhave not or will not experience a breach. Cyber-attacks on our network or other systems could have a material adverse effect on our \nbusiness and results of operations, due to, among other things, the loss of investor or proprietary data, interruptions or delays in the \noperation of our business and damage to our reputation. There can be no assurance that measures we take to ensure the integrity of our \nsystems will provide protection, especially because cyberattack techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until successful. \nIt is difficult to determine what, if any, negative impact may directly result from any specific interruption or cyber-attacks or security \nbreaches of our networks or systems (or the networks or systems of third parties that facilitate our business activities) or any failure to \nmaintain performance, reliability and security of our technical infrastructure, but such computer malware, viruses and computer hacking \nand phishing attacks may negatively affect our operations. \n \nRisks Related to Our Investments \nDeclines in the market values of our investments may reduce periodic reported results, credit availability and our ability to make \ndistributions. \nHistorically, we have classified a substantial portion of our assets for accounting purposes as “available-for-sale.” As a result, \nreductions in the market values of those assets were directly charged to accumulated other comprehensive loss and reduce our \nstockholders’ equity. A decline in these values would reduce the book value of our assets. Moreover, if there is an indication of credit \nquality issues for a specific investment, under the current expected credit losses, or CECL, accounting guidance, we must record a \nprovision to our earnings in order to estimate expected losses."

      "text": "25 \nA decline in the market value of our assets may also adversely affect us in instances where we have borrowed money based on \nthe market value of those assets. If the market value of those assets declines, the lender may require us to post additional collateral to \nsupport the loan. If we are unable to post the additional collateral, we would have to repay some portion or all of the loan, which may \nrequire us to sell assets, which could potentially be under adverse market conditions. As a result, our earnings would be reduced or we \ncould sustain losses, and cash available to make distributions could be reduced or eliminated. \nIncreases in interest rates and other factors could reduce the value of our investments, result in reduced earnings or losses and \nreduce our ability to pay distributions. \nA significant risk associated with our investment in CRE-related loans, and, historically, our CMBS and other debt investments \nis the risk that either or both of long-term and short-term interest rates increase significantly. If long-term rates increase, the market \nvalue of our assets would decline. Even if assets underlying investments we may own in the future are guaranteed by one or more \npersons, including government or government-sponsored agencies, those guarantees do not protect against declines in market value of \nthe related assets caused by interest rate changes. At the same time, with respect to assets that are not match-funded or that have been \nacquired with variable rate or short-term financing, an increase in short-term interest rates would increase our interest expense, reducing \nour net interest spread or possibly result in negative cash flow from those assets. This could result in reduced profitability and \ndistributions or losses. \nChanges in the method for determining the benchmark rate (LIBOR or a replacement of LIBOR) may adversely affect the value of \nour loans, investments and borrowings and could affect our results of operations. \nHistorically, we have utilized LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate for the pricing of our CRE loans and have been exposed to \nLIBOR through our issuance of notes on our securitizations and the use of term facilities and repurchase agreements. In July 2017, the \nU.K. FCA announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. In March 2021, the FCA announced that it \nwould cease publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR immediately after December 31, 2021 and cease publication of \nthe remaining tenors immediately after June 30, 2023. Additionally, the U.S. Federal Reserve encouraged companies to cease using \nLIBOR as a benchmark rate by December 31, 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates \nCommittee, a steering committee comprising large U.S. financial institutions, has identified SOFR, a new index calculated by short-\nterm repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR.  \nIn connection with such recommendations and developments, all variable rate loans originated by us beginning January 1, 2022 \nhave been benchmarked to SOFR. All of our floating-rate loans contain terms that allow for the transition to alternative rates. In \nSeptember 2021 and January 2022, the term warehouse financing facilities with JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, respectively, \nwere amended to allow for the transition to alternative rates, including rates tied to SOFR, subject to benchmark transition events. When \nLIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to amend our remaining loan and borrowing agreements that utilize LIBOR as a factor in \ndetermining the interest rate or hedge against fluctuations in LIBOR based on a new standard that is established, if any. Any resulting \ndifferences in interest rate standards among our assets and our borrowings may result in interest rate mismatches between our assets and \nthe borrowings used to fund such assets. The transition from LIBOR to SOFR or to another alternative rate may result in financial market \ndisruptions and significant increases in benchmark rates, resulting in increased financing costs to us, any of which could have an adverse \neffect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock.  \nInvesting in mezzanine debt, preferred equity, mezzanine or other subordinated tranches of CMBS involves greater risks of loss than \nsenior secured debt investments. \nSubject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act, we may \ninvest in mezzanine debt, preferred equity and mezzanine or other subordinated tranches of CMBS. We currently have investments in \nmezzanine debt. These types of investments carry a higher degree of risk of loss than senior secured debt investments such as our whole \nloan investments because, in the event of default and foreclosure, holders of senior liens will be paid in full before mezzanine investors. \nDepending on the value of the underlying collateral at the time of foreclosure, there may not be sufficient assets to pay all or any part of \namounts owed to mezzanine investors. Moreover, mezzanine and other subordinate debt investments may have higher LTV than \nconventional senior lien financing, resulting in less equity in the collateral and increasing the risk of loss of principal. If a borrower \ndefaults or declares bankruptcy, we may be subject to agreements restricting or eliminating our rights as a creditor, including rights to \ncall a default, cure a default, foreclose on collateral, and accelerate maturity or control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings. In \naddition, the prices of lower credit quality securities are generally less sensitive to interest rate changes than more highly rated \ninvestments, but more sensitive to economic downturns or individual issuer developments because the ability of obligors of investments \nunderlying the securities to make principal and interest payments may be impaired. In such event, existing credit support relating to the \nsecurities’ structure may not be sufficient to protect us against loss of our principal. For additional risks regarding real estate-related \nloans, see “Risks Related to Investments- Our commercial mortgage loans and mezzanine loans are subject to the risks inherent in \nowning the real estate securing or underlying those investments that could result in losses to us.”"

      "text": "26 \nOur investments in preferred equity involve a greater risk of loss than traditional first mortgage debt investments we make. \nWe may make preferred equity investments in entities that own or acquire CRE properties. Preferred equity investments involve \na higher degree of risk than first mortgage loans due to a variety of factors, including the risk that, similar to mezzanine loans, such \ninvestments are subordinate to first mortgage loans and are not collateralized by property underlying the investment. Unlike mezzanine \nloans, preferred equity investments generally do not have a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the \nentity owning the property. Although as a holder of preferred equity we may enhance our position with covenants that limit the activities \nof the entity in which we hold an interest and protect our equity by obtaining an exclusive right to control the underlying property after \nan event of default, should such a default occur on our investment, we would only be able to proceed against the entity in which we hold \nan interest, and not the property owned by such entity and underlying our investment. As a result, we may not recover some or all of our \ninvestment. \nWe record some of our portfolio investments, including those classified as assets held for sale, at fair value as estimated by our \nmanagement and, as a result, there will be uncertainty as to the value of these investments. \nWe currently hold, and expect that we will hold in the future, portfolio investments that are not publicly traded. The fair value \nof securities and other investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable. We value these investments quarterly \nat fair value as determined under policies approved by our Board. Because such valuations are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over \nshort periods of time and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that we \nwould have obtained if a ready market for them existed. The value of our common stock will likely decrease if our determinations \nregarding the fair value of these investments are materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon their disposal. \nWe may face competition for suitable investments. \nThere are numerous REITs and other financial investors seeking to invest in the types of assets we target. This competition \nmay cause us to forgo particular investments or to accept economic terms or structural features that we would not otherwise have \naccepted, and it may cause us to seek investments outside of our currently targeted areas. Competition for investment assets may slow \nour growth or limit our profitability and ability to make distributions to our stockholders. \nWe may not have control over certain of our CRE loans and CRE investments. \nOur ability to manage our portfolio of loans and investments may be limited by the form in which they are made. In certain \nsituations, we may: \n•  \nacquire investments subject to rights of senior classes and servicers under inter-creditor or servicing agreements; \n•  \nacquire only a minority and/or non-controlling participation in an underlying investment; \n•  \nco-invest with third parties through partnerships, joint ventures or other entities, thereby acquiring non-controlling \ninterests; or  \n•  \nrely on independent third-party management or strategic partners with respect to the management of an asset. \nTherefore, we may not be able to exercise control over the loan or investment. Such financial assets may involve risks not \npresent in investments where senior creditors, servicers or third-party controlling investors are not involved. Our rights to control the \nprocess following a borrower default may be subject to the rights of senior creditors or servicers whose interests may not be aligned \nwith ours. A third party partner or co-venturer may have financial difficulties resulting in a negative impact on such asset, may have \neconomic or business interest or goals which are inconsistent with ours, or may be in a position to take action contrary to our investment \nobjectives. In addition, in certain circumstances we may be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or co-venturers.  \nMany of our investments may be illiquid, which may result in our realizing less than their recorded value should we need to sell such \ninvestments quickly. \nIf we determine to sell one or more of our investments, we may encounter difficulties in finding buyers in a timely manner as \nreal estate debt and other of our investments generally cannot be disposed of quickly, especially when market conditions are poor. \nMoreover, some of these assets may be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale. If we are required to liquidate all or a portion of \nour portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our investments. In addition, \nwe may face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a business entity to the extent that we, our Manager or ACRES \nhas or could be attributed with material non-public information regarding such business entity. These factors may limit our ability to \nvary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions and may also limit our ability to use portfolio sales \nas a source of liquidity, which could limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or repay debt."

The ability of a borrower to repay a loan or make distributions secured by or \ndependent upon an income-producing property typically depends primarily upon the successful operation of the property rather than \nupon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower. If the net operating income of the property is reduced, the borrower’s \nability to repay the loan or ability to make distributions may be impaired. Net operating income of an income producing property can \nbe affected by, among other things: \n•  \ntenant mix, success of tenant businesses, tenant bankruptcies and property management decisions; \n•  \nproperty location and condition; \n•  \ncompetition from comparable types of properties; \n•  \nshifts in consumer habits or adoption of telework policies; \n•  \nchanges in laws that increase operating expenses or limit rents that may be charged; \n•  \nany need to address environmental contamination at the property; \n•  \nthe occurrence of any uninsured casualty at the property; \n•  \nchanges in national, regional or local economic conditions and/or the conditions of specific industry segments in which \nthe lessees may operate; \n•  \ndeclines in regional or local real estate values; \n•  \ndeclines in regional or local rental or occupancy rates; \n•  \nincreases in interest rates, real estate tax rates and other operating expenses; \n•  \nthe availability of debt or equity financing; \n•  \nincreases in costs of construction material; \n•  \nchanges in governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, including environmental legislation and zoning laws; and  \n•  \nacts of God, terrorism, pandemic, social unrest and civil disturbances.  \nWe risk loss of principal on defaulted CRE loans we hold to the extent of any deficiency between the value we can realize from \nthe sale of the collateral securing the loan upon foreclosure and the loan’s principal and accrued interest. Moreover, foreclosure of a \nmortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process that could reduce the net amount we can realize on the foreclosed mortgage \nloan. In a bankruptcy of a mortgage loan borrower, the mortgage loan will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of \nthe underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy as determined by the bankruptcy court, and the lien securing the mortgage loan will \nbe subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state \nlaw. \nWe may be obligated to fund a portion of the loan at one or more future dates. We may not have the funds available at such \nfuture date(s) to meet our funding obligation under the loan. In that event, we would likely be in breach of the loan documents unless \nwe are able to raise the capital, which we may not be able to achieve on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, if we are in breach of \nthe loan documents, the borrower may file a claim against us for failure to perform under the loan documents. \nFor a discussion of additional risks associated with mezzanine loans, see “Risks Related to Our Investments - Investing in \nmezzanine debt, preferred equity and mezzanine or other subordinated debt investments involves greater risks of loss than senior secured \ndebt investments.”"

We base our allowance for credit losses on historical loss experience, current portfolio and market \nconditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts for the duration of each respective loan. However, losses have in the past, and may \nin the future, exceed our current estimates, and the difference could be substantial. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes \nin economic, operating and other conditions that may be beyond our control and difficult to estimate, including changes in interest rates, \nchanges in borrowers’ creditworthiness and the value of collateral securing loans. Additionally, if we seek to expand our loan portfolios, \nwe may need to make additional provisions for credit losses to ensure that the allowance remains at levels deemed appropriate by our \nmanagement for the size and quality of our portfolios. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022 is \nadequate to cover our anticipated losses, we cannot assure you that it will not increase in the future. Any increase in our allowance for \ncredit losses will reduce our income and, if sufficiently large, could cause us to incur significant losses. \nThe CECL model may require us to increase our allowance for credit losses and therefore may have a material adverse effect on our \nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. \nThe CECL allowance required is a valuation account that is deducted from the related loans’ and debt securities’ amortized \ncost basis on our consolidated balance sheets, which reduces our total stockholders’ equity. Additional changes to the CECL allowance \nare recognized through net income on our consolidated statements of operations. While the guidance does not require any particular \nmethod for determining the CECL allowance, it does specify the allowance should be based on relevant information about past events, \nincluding historical loss experience, current portfolio and market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts for the duration \nof each respective loan. Because our methodology for determining CECL allowances may differ from the methodologies employed by \nother companies, our CECL allowances may not be comparable with the CECL allowances reported by other companies. In addition, \nother than pursuant to a few narrow exceptions, the guidance requires that all financial instruments subject to the CECL model have \nsome amount of reserve to reflect the GAAP principal underlying the CECL model that all loans, debt securities, and similar assets have \nsome inherent risk of loss, regardless of credit quality, subordinate capital, or other mitigating factors. Accordingly, the adoption of the \nCECL model materially affected our determination of the allowance for credit losses and required us to increase our allowance upon \nadoption and recognize provisions for credit losses earlier in the lending cycle. Moreover, the CECL model has created more volatility \nin the level of our allowance for credit losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for credit losses for any \nreason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nOur investment portfolio may have material geographic, sector, property-type and sponsor concentrations. \nWe may have material geographic concentrations related to our direct or indirect investments in real estate loans and properties. \nWe also may have material concentrations in the property types and industry sectors that are in our loan portfolio. Where we have any \nkind of concentration risk in our investments, we may be affected by sector-specific economic or other problems that are not reflected \nin the national economy generally or in more diverse portfolios. Where we have a significant concentration of investments with a small \nnumber of sponsors, we may be materially affected by an individual sponsors’ performance. An adverse development in that area of \nconcentration could reduce the value of our investment and our return on that investment and, if the concentration affects a material \namount of our investments, impair our ability to execute our investment strategies successfully, reduce our earnings and reduce our \nability to make distributions. \nThe B-notes in which we may invest may be subject to additional risks relating to the privately negotiated structure and terms of the \ntransaction, which may result in losses to us. \nWe may invest in B-notes. A B-note is a loan typically secured by a first mortgage on a single large commercial property or \ngroup of related properties and subordinated to a senior note secured by the same first mortgage on the same collateral. As a result, if a \nborrower defaults, there may not be sufficient funds remaining for B-note owners after payment to the senior note owners. Since each \ntransaction is privately negotiated, B-notes can vary in their structural characteristics and risks. For example, the rights of holders of B-\nnotes to control the process following a borrower default may be limited in certain investments. Depending upon market and economic \nconditions, we may make B-note investments at any time. B-notes are less liquid than other forms of CRE debt investments, such as \nCMBS, and, as a result, we may be able to dispose of underperforming or non-performing B-note investments only at a significant \ndiscount to book value."

When we do take title to any property, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to it. In such \na circumstance, we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation \nand clean-up costs they incur as a result of environmental contamination, or may have to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic \nsubstances, or chemical releases at a property.

Our officers, portfolio managers, administrative personnel and support personnel are employees \nof ACRES. We have no separate facilities and completely rely on our Manager; and ACRES has significant discretion as to the \nimplementation of our operating policies and investment strategies. If our Management Agreement terminates, we may be unable to \nfind a suitable replacement for our Manager. Moreover, we believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the experience \nof the portfolio managers and officers of our Manager and ACRES who provide services to us, whose continued service is not \nguaranteed. The departure of any such persons could harm our investment performance. \nOur Manager’s fee structure may not create proper incentives, and the incentive compensation we pay our Manager may increase \nthe investment risk of our portfolio. \nOur Manager is entitled to receive a base management fee equal to 1/12th of our equity, as defined in the Management \nAgreement, multiplied by 1.50%; provided, however, that for each calendar month through July 31, 2022, such fee was equal to a \nminimum of $442,000. Since the base management fee is based on our outstanding equity, our Manager could be incentivized to \nrecommend strategies that increase our equity, and there may be circumstances where increasing our equity will not optimize the returns \nfor our stockholders. \nIn addition to its base management fee, our Manager is entitled to receive incentive compensation. Until the quarter ended \nDecember 31, 2022, this compensation was equal to 20% of the amount by which our EAD, as defined in the Management Agreement, \nfor a quarter exceeded the product of the weighted average of the book value divided by 10,293,783 and the per share price (including \nthe conversion price, if applicable) paid for our common shares in each offering (or issuance upon the conversion of convertible \nsecurities) by us subsequent to September 30, 2017, multiplied by the greater of 1.75% or 0.4375% plus one-fourth of the average ten-\nyear U.S. Treasury rate for such quarter, multiplied by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the quarter, \nsubject to certain adjustments.  \nFor the first full calendar quarter ended December 31, 2022, the incentive compensation was equal to 20% of the amount by \nwhich our EAD for the quarter exceeded the product of our book value equity as of the end of such calendar quarter, and 7% per annum. \nFor each of the second, third and fourth full calendar quarters following the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2022, the calculation \nwill be the excess of the product of 20% and the excess of our EAD for the calendar quarter(s) following September 30, 2022, over the \nproduct of our book value equity in the calendar quarter(s) following September 30, 2022, and 7% per annum, over the sum of any \nincentive compensation paid to our Manager with respect to the prior calendar quarter(s) following September 30, 2022 (other than the \nmost recent calendar quarter). \nIn evaluating investments and other management strategies, the opportunity to earn incentive compensation based on EAD may \nlead our Manager to place undue emphasis on the maximization of EAD at the expense of other criteria, such as preservation of capital, \nin order to achieve higher incentive compensation. Investments with higher yields generally have higher risk of loss than investments \nwith lower yields. If our interests and those of our Manager are not aligned, the execution of our business plan and our results of \noperations could be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \nOur Manager manages our portfolio pursuant to very broad investment guidelines and our Board does not approve each investment \ndecision, which may result in our making riskier investments. \nOur Manager is authorized to follow very broad investment guidelines. While our directors periodically review our investment \nguidelines and our investment portfolio, they do not review all of our proposed investments. In addition, in conducting periodic reviews, \nthe directors may rely primarily on information provided to them by our Manager. Furthermore, our Manager may use complex \nstrategies, and transactions entered into by our Manager, which may be difficult or impossible to unwind by the time they are reviewed \nby the directors. Our Manager has great latitude within the broad investment guidelines in determining the types of investments it makes \nfor us. Poor investment decisions could impair our ability to make distributions to our stockholders."

These \nprovisions include the following: \n•  \nThere are ownership limits and restrictions on transferability and ownership in our charter. For purposes of assisting us \nin maintaining our REIT qualification under the Code, our charter generally prohibits any person from beneficially or \nconstructively owning more than 9.8% in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of any class or series \nof our outstanding capital stock. This restriction may: \n•  \ndiscourage a tender offer or other transactions or a change in the composition of our Board or control that might \ninvolve a premium price for our shares or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders; or  \n•  \nresult in shares issued or transferred in violation of such restrictions being automatically transferred to a trust for \na charitable beneficiary, resulting in the forfeiture of those shares.  \n•  \nOur charter permits our Board to issue stock with terms that may discourage a third-party from acquiring us. Our Board \nmay amend our charter without stockholder approval to increase the total number of authorized shares of stock or the \nnumber of shares of any class or series and issue common or preferred stock having preferences, conversion or other rights, \nvoting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications, or terms or conditions of redemption as \ndetermined by our Board. Thus, our Board could authorize the issuance of stock with terms and conditions that could have \nthe effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of some or a majority of our shares might receive \na premium for their shares over the then-prevailing market price. \n•  \nOur charter and bylaws contain other possible anti-takeover provisions. Our charter and bylaws contain other provisions, \nincluding advance notice procedures for the introduction of business and the nomination of directors, that may have the \neffect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or the removal of existing directors and, as a result, could prevent \nour stockholders from being paid a premium for their common stock over the then-prevailing market price. \nMaryland takeover statutes may prevent a change in control of us, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a \nresult. \nMaryland Control Share Acquisition Act. Maryland law provides that “control shares” of a corporation acquired in a “control \nshare acquisition” will have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes eligible to be cast on the \nmatter under the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act, or the Maryland Act. The Maryland Act defines “control shares” as voting \nshares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquirer or in respect of which the acquirer is able to \nexercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquirer to exercise \nvoting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power: one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-\nthird or more but less than a majority, or a majority or more of all voting power. A “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of \ncontrol shares, subject to specific exceptions. \nIf voting rights or control shares acquired in a control share acquisition are not approved at a stockholders’ meeting or if the \nacquiring person does not deliver an acquiring person statement as required by the Maryland Act then, subject to specific conditions and \nlimitations, the issuer may redeem any or all of the control shares for fair value. If voting rights of such control shares are approved at a \nstockholders’ meeting and the acquirer becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote, all other stockholders may \nexercise appraisal rights. \nOur bylaws contain a provision exempting acquisitions of our shares from the Maryland Act. However, our Board may amend \nour bylaws in the future to repeal this exemption. \nBusiness combinations. Under Maryland law, “business combinations” between a Maryland corporation and an interested \nstockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested \nstockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in \ncircumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. An interested stockholder is \ndefined as: \n•  \nany person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the corporation’s shares; or"

However, in approving a transaction, the board of directors \nmay provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the \nboard. \nAfter the five-year prohibition, any business combination between the Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder \ngenerally must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least: \n•  \n80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation; and \n•  \ntwo-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the \ninterested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate \nor associate of the interested stockholder. \nThese super-majority vote requirements do not apply if the corporation’s common stockholders receive a minimum price, as \ndefined under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the \ninterested stockholder for its shares. \nThe statute permits exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors \nbefore the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. \nOur rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited, which could limit your \nrecourse in the event of actions not in your best interests. \nOur charter limits the liability of our directors and officers to our stockholders and us for money damages, except for liability \nresulting from: \n•  \nactual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or  \n•  \na final judgment based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was material to the \ncause of action adjudicated.  \nIn addition, our charter authorizes us to, and we do, indemnify our present and former directors and officers for actions taken \nby them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. Our bylaws require us to indemnify each present or \nformer director or officer, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is \nmade, or threatened to be made, a party by reason of his or her service to us. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs \nincurred by our directors and officers. \nOur right to take action against our Manager is limited. \nThe obligation of our Manager under the Management Agreement is to render its services in good faith. It will not be responsible \nfor any action taken by our Board or investment committee in following or declining to follow its advice and recommendations. \nFurthermore, as discussed above under - “Risks Related to Our Manager,” it will be difficult and costly for us to terminate the \nManagement Agreement without cause.

      "text": "34 \nWe have not established a minimum distribution payment level and we cannot assure you of our ability to make distributions in the \nfuture. In the future, we may use uninvested offering proceeds or borrowed funds to make distributions. \nWe expect to make quarterly distributions to our stockholders in amounts such that we distribute all or substantially all of our \ntaxable income in each year, subject to certain adjustments. We have not established a minimum distribution payment level, and our \nability to make distributions may be impaired by the risk factors described in this report. All distributions will be made at the discretion \nof our Board and will depend on our earnings, our financial condition, maintenance of our REIT qualification and other factors as our \nBoard may deem relevant from time to time. We may not be able to make distributions in the future. In addition, some of our distributions \nmay include a return of capital. To the extent that we decide to make distributions in excess of our current and accumulated taxable \nearnings and profits, such distributions would generally be considered a return of capital for federal income tax purposes. A return of \ncapital is not taxable, but it has the effect of reducing the holder’s tax basis in its investment. Although we currently do not expect that \nwe will do so, we have in the past and may in the future also use proceeds from any offering of our securities that we have not invested \nor borrowed funds to make distributions. If we use uninvested offering proceeds to pay distributions in the future, we will have less \nfunds available for investment and, as a result, our earnings and cash available for distribution would be less than we might otherwise \nhave realized had such funds been invested. Similarly, if we borrow to fund distributions, our future interest costs would increase, \nthereby reducing our future earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been. \nLoss of our exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act would require significant changes in our operations and \ncould reduce the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions. \nWe rely on an exclusion from registration as an investment company afforded by Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company \nAct. To qualify for this exclusion, we do not engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading securities and \nwe do not own “investment securities” with a value that exceeds 40% of the value of our total assets (exclusive of government securities \nand cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We may not be able to maintain such a mix of assets in the future, and attempts to maintain \nsuch an asset mix may impair our ability to pursue otherwise attractive investments. In addition, these rules are subject to change and \nsuch changes may have an adverse impact on us. We may need to avail ourselves of alternative exclusions and exemptions that may \nrequire a change in the organizational structure of our business.  \nFurthermore, as it relates to our investment in our real estate subsidiary, ACRES RF, we rely on an exclusion from registration \nas an investment company afforded by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Given the material size of ACRES RF \nrelative to our 3(a)(1)(C) exclusion, were ACRES RF to be deemed to be an investment company (other than by application of the \nSection 3(c)(1) exemption for closely held companies and the Section 3(c)(7) exemption for companies owned by “qualified \npurchasers”), we would not qualify for our 3(a)(1)(C) exclusion. Under the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion, ACRES RF is required to \nmaintain, on the basis of positions taken by the SEC staff in interpretive and no-action letters, a minimum of 55% of the value of the \ntotal assets of its portfolio in Qualifying Interests and a minimum of 80% in Qualifying Interests and real estate-related assets, with the \nremainder permitted to be miscellaneous assets. Because registration as an investment company would significantly affect ACRES RF’s \nability to engage in certain transactions or to organize itself in the manner it is currently organized, we intend to maintain its qualification \nfor this exclusion from registration. \nHistorically, we treat our investments in mezzanine loans and our investments in CMBS as Qualifying Interests for purposes \nof determining our eligibility for the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) to the extent such treatment is consistent with guidance \nprovided by the SEC or its staff. In the absence of specific guidance or guidance that otherwise supports the treatment of these \ninvestments as Qualifying Interests, we will treat them, for purposes of determining our eligibility for the exclusion provided by Section \n3(c)(5)(C), as real estate-related assets or miscellaneous assets, as appropriate. \nIf ACRES RF’s portfolio does not comply with the requirements of the exclusion we rely upon, it could be forced to alter its \nportfolio by selling or otherwise disposing of a substantial portion of the assets that are not Qualifying Interests or by acquiring a \nsignificant position in assets that are Qualifying Interests. Altering its portfolio in this manner may have an adverse effect on its \ninvestments if it is forced to dispose of or acquire assets in an unfavorable market, and may adversely affect our stock price. \nIf it were established that we were an unregistered investment company, there would be a risk that we would be subject to \nmonetary penalties and injunctive relief in an action brought by the SEC that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties, \nthat third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions undertaken during the period it was established that we were an \nunregistered investment company, and that we would be subject to limitations on corporate leverage that would have an adverse impact \non our investment returns."

      "text": "35 \nRapid changes in the values of our real estate-related investments may make it more difficult for us to maintain our qualification as \na REIT or exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act. \nIf the market value or income potential of our real estate-related investments declines as a result of economic conditions, \nincreased interest rates, prepayment rates or other factors, we may need to increase our real estate-related investments and income and/or \nliquidate our non-qualifying assets in order to maintain our REIT qualification or exclusion from registration under the Investment \nCompany Act. If the decline in real estate asset values and/or income occurs quickly, this may be especially difficult to accomplish. We \nmay have to make investment decisions that we otherwise would not make absent REIT qualification and Investment Company Act \nconsiderations. \n \nRisks Related to Our REIT Status and Certain Other Tax Items \nComplying with REIT requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities. \nTo qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy various tests regarding the sources of our \nincome, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our common \nstock. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forgo investments we might otherwise make. Thus, compliance with the REIT \nrequirements may hinder our investment performance. \nIn particular, at least 75% of our assets at the end of each calendar quarter must consist of real estate assets, government \nsecurities, cash and cash items. For this purpose, “real estate assets” generally include interests in real property, such as land, buildings, \nleasehold interests in real property, stock of other entities that qualify as REITs, interests in mortgage loans secured by real property, \ninvestments in stock or debt investments during the one-year period following the receipt of new capital and regular or residual interests \nin a real estate mortgage investment conduit (“REMIC”). In addition, the amount of securities of a single issuer, other than a TRS, that \nwe hold must generally not exceed either 5% of the value of our gross assets or 10% of the vote or value of such issuer’s outstanding \nsecurities. \nCertain of the assets that we hold are not qualified and will not be qualified real estate assets for purposes of the REIT asset \ntests. CMBS securities should generally qualify as real estate assets. However, to the extent that we own non-REMIC collateralized \nmortgage obligations or other debt investments secured by mortgage loans (rather than by real property) or secured by non-real estate \nassets, or debt securities that are not secured by mortgages on real property, those securities are likely not qualifying real estate assets \nfor purposes of the REIT asset test, and will not produce qualifying real estate income. Further, whether securities held by warehouse \nlenders or financed using repurchase agreements are treated as qualifying assets or as generating qualifying real estate income for \npurposes of the REIT asset and income tests depends on the terms of the warehouse or repurchase financing arrangement. \nWe generally will be treated as the owner of any assets that collateralize CRE debt securitization transactions to the extent that \nwe retain all of the equity of the securitization vehicle and do not make an election to treat such securitization vehicle as a TRS, as \ndescribed in further detail below. It may be possible to reduce the impact of the REIT asset and gross income requirements by holding \ncertain assets through our TRSs, subject to certain limitations as described below. \nOur qualification as a REIT and exemption from U.S. federal income tax with respect to certain assets may depend on the accuracy \nof legal opinions or advice rendered or given or statements by the issuers of securities in which we invest, and the inaccuracy of any \nsuch opinions, advice or statements may adversely affect our REIT qualification and result in significant corporate level tax. \nWhen purchasing securities, we have relied and may rely on opinions or advice of counsel for the issuer of such securities, or \nstatements made in related offering documents, for purposes of determining whether such securities represent debt or equity securities \nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes, and also to what extent those securities constitute REIT real estate assets for purposes of the REIT \nasset tests and produce income that qualifies under the 75% REIT gross income test. In addition, when purchasing CLO equity, we have \nrelied and may rely on opinions or advice of counsel regarding the qualification of interests in the debt of such CLOs for U.S. federal \nincome tax purposes. The inaccuracy of any such opinions, advice or statements may adversely affect our REIT qualification and result \nin significant corporate-level tax. \nWe may realize excess inclusion income that would increase our tax liability and that of our stockholders. \nExcess inclusion income could result if we hold a residual interest in a REMIC or if we were to own an interest in a taxable \nmortgage pool. Excess inclusion income also is generated if we issue debt obligations, such as certain CRE debt securitizations, with \ntwo or more maturities and the terms of the payments on these obligations bore a relationship to the payments that we received on our \nmortgage related securities securing those debt obligations. While we do not expect to acquire significant amounts of residual interests \nin REMICs, nor do we currently own residual interests in taxable mortgage pools, we do issue debt in certain CRE debt securitizations \nthat generates excess inclusion income."

If the stockholder is a tax-exempt entity, then this income would be fully taxable as unrelated business taxable income \nunder Section 512 of the Code. If the stockholder is a foreign person, it would be subject to federal income tax withholding on this \nincome without reduction or exemption pursuant to any otherwise applicable income tax treaty. \nIf we realize excess inclusion income, we will be taxed at the highest corporate income tax rate on a portion of such income \nthat is allocable to the percentage of our stock held in record name by “disqualified organizations,” which are generally cooperatives, \ngovernmental entities and tax-exempt organizations that are exempt from unrelated business taxable income. To the extent that our stock \nowned by “disqualified organizations” is held in record name by a broker-dealer or other nominee, the broker/dealer or other nominee \nwould be liable for the corporate level tax on the portion of our excess inclusion income allocable to the stock held by the broker-dealer \nor other nominee on behalf of “disqualified organizations.” We expect that disqualified organizations will own our stock. Because this \ntax would be imposed on us, all of our investors, including investors that are not disqualified organizations, would bear a portion of the \ntax cost associated with the classification of us or a portion of our assets as a taxable mortgage pool. A regulated investment company \nor other pass through entity owning stock in record name will be subject to tax at the highest corporate rate on any excess inclusion \nincome allocated to its owners that are disqualified organizations. Finally, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, our taxable mortgage pool \nsecuritizations will be treated as separate corporations, for federal income tax purposes that cannot be included in any consolidated \ncorporate tax return. \nFailure to qualify as a REIT would subject us to federal income tax, which would reduce the cash available for distribution to our \nstockholders. \nWe believe that we have been organized and operated in a manner that has enabled us to qualify as a REIT for federal income \ntax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended on December 31, 2005. However, the federal income tax laws governing REITs \nare extremely complex, and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT are limited. Qualifying as \na REIT requires us to meet various tests regarding the nature of our assets and our income, the ownership of our outstanding stock, and \nthe amount of our distributions on an ongoing basis. \nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT in any calendar year and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be \nsubject to federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income, at regular corporate rates. \nDistributions to stockholders would not be deductible in computing our taxable income. Corporate tax liability would reduce the amount \nof cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Under some circumstances, we might need to borrow money or sell assets in order \nto pay that tax. Furthermore, if we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT and we do not qualify for the statutory relief provisions, \nwe no longer would be required to distribute substantially all of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends \npaid deduction and excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders. Unless our failure to qualify as a REIT was excused under federal \ntax laws, we could not re-elect to qualify as a REIT until the fifth calendar year following the year in which we failed to qualify. In \naddition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, our taxable mortgage pool securitizations will be treated as separate corporations for U.S. \nfederal income tax purposes. \nA determination that we have not made required distributions would subject us to tax or require us to pay a deficiency dividend; \npayment of tax would reduce the cash available for distribution to our stockholders. \nIn order to qualify as a REIT, in each calendar year we must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable \nincome, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. To the extent that we satisfy the \n90% distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax \non our undistributed income. In addition, we will incur a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which our distributions \nin any calendar year are less than the sum of: \n•  \n85% of our ordinary income for that year;  \n•  \n95% of our capital gain net income for that year; and  \n•  \n100% our undistributed taxable income from prior years. \nWe intend to make distributions to our stockholders in a manner intended to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement and to \ndistribute all or substantially all of our net taxable income to avoid both corporate income tax and the 4% nondeductible excise tax. \nThere is no requirement that a domestic TRS distribute its after-tax net income to its parent REIT or their stockholders and our U.S. \nTRSs may determine not to make any distributions to us. However, non-U.S. TRSs will generally be deemed to distribute their earnings \nto us on an annual basis for federal income tax purposes, regardless of whether such TRSs actually distribute their earnings."

In addition, \nwe may invest in assets that generate taxable income in excess of economic income or in advance of the corresponding cash flow from \nthe assets, referred to as phantom income. Although some types of phantom income are excluded to the extent they exceed 5% of our \nREIT taxable income in determining the 90% distribution requirement, we will incur corporate income tax and the 4% nondeductible \nexcise tax with respect to any phantom income items if we do not distribute those items on an annual basis. As a result, we may generate \nless cash flow than taxable income in a particular year. It is also possible that a loss that we treat as an ordinary loss would be \nrecharacterized as a capital loss. In such event we might have to pay tax for the year in question or pay a deficiency dividend so that we \nmeet the dividends paid requirement for that year. In all such events, we may be required to use cash reserves, incur debt, or liquidate \nnon-cash assets at rates or times that we regard as unfavorable in order to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid corporate \nincome tax and the 4% nondeductible excise tax in that year. \nIf we make distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, they will be treated as a return of capital, \nwhich will reduce the adjusted basis of your stock. To the extent such distributions exceed your adjusted basis, you may recognize a \ncapital gain upon distribution. \nUnless you are a tax-exempt entity, distributions that we make to you generally will be subject to tax as ordinary income to the \nextent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined for federal income tax purposes. If the amount we distribute \nto you exceeds your allocable share of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, the excess will be treated as a return of capital \nto the extent of your adjusted basis in your stock, which will reduce your basis in your stock but will not be subject to tax. To the extent \nthe amount we distribute to you exceeds both your allocable share of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and your adjusted \nbasis, this excess amount will be treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset. For risks related to the use of uninvested \noffering proceeds or borrowings to fund distributions to stockholders, see - “Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure. - We have \nnot established a minimum distribution payment level and we cannot assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future.” \nOur ownership of and relationship with our TRSs will be limited and a failure to comply with the limits would jeopardize our REIT \nqualification and may result in the application of a 100% excise tax. \nA REIT may own up to 100% of the securities of one or more TRSs. A TRS may earn specified types of income or hold \nspecified assets that would not be qualifying income or assets if earned or held directly by the parent REIT. Both the subsidiary and the \nREIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a TRS. A corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of \nthe voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a TRS. Overall, no more than 20% of the value of a REIT’s assets \nmay consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs. A TRS will pay federal, state and local income tax at regular corporate rates on \nany income that it earns, whether or not it distributes that income to us. In addition, the TRS rules limit the deductibility of interest paid \nor accrued by a TRS to its parent REIT to assure that the TRS is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation. The rules also \nimpose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm’s-length basis. \nExantas Real Estate TRS, Inc. (“XAN RE TRS”) will pay federal, state and local income tax on its taxable income, and its \nafter-tax net income is available for distribution to us but is not required to be distributed to us. Income that is not distributed to us by \nour U.S. TRS will not be subject to the REIT 90% distribution requirement and therefore will not be available for distributions to our \nstockholders. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the securities we hold in our TRS will be less than 20% of the value of our total \nassets, including our TRS securities. We will monitor the compliance of our investments in TRSs with the rules relating to value of \nassets and transactions not on an arm’s-length basis. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to comply with such rules. \nComplying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively. \nThe REIT provisions of the Code substantially limit our ability to hedge MBS and related borrowings. Under these provisions, \nour annual gross income from qualifying and non-qualifying hedges of our borrowings, together with any other income not generated \nfrom qualifying real estate assets, cannot exceed 25% of our gross income. In addition, our aggregate gross income from non-qualifying \nhedges, fees and certain other non-qualifying sources cannot exceed 5% of our annual gross income determined without regard to income \nfrom qualifying hedges. As a result, we might have to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges \nthrough XAN RE TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in \ninterest rates than we would otherwise want to bear."

      "text": "38 \nThe tax on prohibited transactions will limit our ability to engage in transactions, including certain methods of securitizing mortgage \nloans that would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes. \nA REIT’s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other \ndispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, but including mortgage loans, held primarily for sale to customers in the \nordinary course of business. We might be subject to this tax if we were able to sell or securitize loans in a manner that was treated as a \nsale of the loans for federal income tax purposes. Therefore, in order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax, we may choose not to \nengage in certain sales of loans and may limit the structures we utilize for our securitization transactions even though such sales or \nstructures might otherwise be beneficial to us. \nLegislative, regulatory or administrative changes could adversely affect our stockholders or us. \nLegislative, regulatory or administrative changes could be enacted or promulgated at any time, either prospectively or with \nretroactive effect, and may adversely affect our stockholders and/or us.  \nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, made significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules for taxation of individuals \nand corporations, generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. In addition to reducing corporate and \nindividual tax rates, the TCJA eliminates or restricts various deductions. Most of the changes applicable to individuals are temporary \nand apply only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. The TCJA makes numerous large and \nsmall changes to the tax rules that do not affect the REIT qualification rules directly but may otherwise affect us or our stockholders. \nWhile the changes in the TCJA generally appear to be favorable with respect to REITs, the extensive changes to non-REIT \nprovisions in the Code may have unanticipated effects on our stockholders or us. Moreover, Congressional leaders have recognized that \nthe process of adopting extensive tax legislation in a short amount of time without hearings and substantial time for review is likely to \nhave led to drafting errors, issues needing clarification and unintended consequences that will have to be revisited in subsequent tax \nlegislation. It is not clear if or when Congress will address these issues or when the IRS will issue administrative guidance on the changes \nmade in the TCJA. \nWe urge you to consult with your own tax advisor with respect to the status of the TCJA and other legislative, regulatory or \nadministrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in shares of our common stock. \nDividends paid by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates provided for under current law. \nDividends paid by REITs are generally not eligible for the reduced 15% maximum tax rate for dividends paid to individuals \n(20% for those with taxable income above certain thresholds that are adjusted annually under current law). The more favorable rates \napplicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively \nless attractive than investments in the stock of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends to which more favorable rates apply, which \ncould reduce the value of the stocks of REITs. However, under the TCJA, regular dividends from REITs are treated as income from a \npass-through entity and are eligible for a 20% deduction. As a result, our regular dividends are taxed at 80% of an individual’s marginal \ntax rate. The current maximum rate is 37% resulting in a maximum tax rate of 29.6%. Dividends from REITs as well as regular corporate \ndividends will also be subject to a 3.8% Medicare surtax for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income above $200,000 (if single) \nor $250,000 (if married and filing jointly). \nWe may lose our REIT qualification or be subject to a penalty tax if we modify mortgage loans or acquire distressed debt in a way \nthat causes us to fail our REIT gross income or asset tests. \nMany of the terms of our mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and B-notes and the loans supporting our MBS have been modified \nand may in the future be modified to avoid foreclosure actions and for other reasons. If the terms of the loan are modified in a manner \nconstituting a “significant modification,” such modification triggers a deemed exchange for tax purposes of the original loan for the \nmodified loan. Under existing Treasury Regulations, if a loan is secured by real property and other property and the highest principal \namount of the loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing the loan as of (1) the \ndate we agreed to acquire or originate the loan or (2) in the event of certain significant modifications, the date we modified the loan, \nthen a portion of the interest income from such a loan will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, but will \nbe qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test. Although the law is not entirely clear, a portion of the loan may not be \ntreated as a qualifying “real estate asset” for purposes of the 75% asset test. The non-qualifying portion of such a loan would be subject \nto, among other requirements, the 10% value test."

      "text": "39 \nRevenue Procedure 2011-16, as modified and superseded by Revenue Procedure 2014-51, provides a safe harbor pursuant to \nwhich we will not be required to redetermine the fair market value of the real property securing a loan for purposes of the REIT gross \nincome and asset tests in connection with a loan modification that is: (1) occasioned by a borrower default; or (2) made at a time when \nwe reasonably believe that the modification to the loan will substantially reduce a significant risk of default on the original loan. We \ncannot assure you that all of our loan modifications have qualified or will qualify for the safe harbor in Revenue Procedure 2011-16, as \nmodified and superseded by Revenue Procedure 2014-51. To the extent we significantly modify loans in a manner that does not qualify \nfor that safe harbor, we will be required to redetermine the value of the real property securing the loan at the time it was significantly \nmodified. In determining the value of the real property securing such a loan, we may not obtain third-party appraisals, but rather may \nrely on internal valuations. No assurance can be provided that the IRS will not successfully challenge our internal valuations. If the \nterms of our mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and B-notes and loans supporting our MBS are significantly modified in a manner that \ndoes not qualify for the safe harbor in Revenue Procedure 2011-16, as modified and superseded by Revenue Procedure 2014-51, and \nthe fair market value of the real property securing such loans has decreased significantly, we could fail the 75% gross income test, the \n75% asset test and/or the 10% value test. Unless we qualified for relief under certain cure provisions in the Code, such failures could \ncause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. \nOur subsidiaries and we have invested and may invest in the future in distressed debt, including distressed mortgage loans, \nmezzanine loans, B-notes and MBS. Revenue Procedure 2011-16, as modified and superseded by Revenue Procedure 2014-51, provides \nthat the IRS will treat a distressed mortgage loan acquired by a REIT that is secured by real property and other property as producing in \npart non-qualifying income for the 75% gross income test. Specifically, Revenue Procedure 2011-16, as modified and superseded by \nRevenue Procedure 2014-51, indicates that interest income on a loan will be treated as qualifying income based on the ratio of (1) the \nfair market value of the real property securing the loan determined as of the date the REIT committed to acquire the loan and (2) the \nface amount of the loan (and not the purchase price or current value of the loan). The face amount of a distressed mortgage loan and \nother distressed debt will typically exceed the fair market value of the real property securing the debt on the date the REIT commits to \nacquire the debt. We believe that we will continue to invest in distressed debt in a manner consistent with complying with the 75% gross \nincome test and maintaining our qualification as a REIT. \nThe failure of a loan subject to a repurchase agreement, a mezzanine loan or a preferred equity investment to qualify as a real estate \nasset would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. \nWe have entered into and we intend to continue to enter into sale and repurchase agreements under which we nominally sell \ncertain of our loan assets to a counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to repurchase the sold assets. We believe that we \nhave been and will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the owner of the loan assets that are the subject of any such \nagreement notwithstanding that the agreement may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the \nagreement. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert that we did not own the loan assets during the term of the sale and repurchase \nagreement, in which case we could fail to qualify as a REIT. \nIn addition, we have acquired in the past and may continue to acquire mezzanine loans, which are loans secured by equity \ninterest in a partnership or limited liability company that directly or indirectly owns real property, and preferred equity investments, \nwhich are senior equity interests in entities that own or acquire real properties. In Revenue Procedure 2003-65, or the Revenue Procedure, \nthe IRS provided a safe harbor pursuant to which a mezzanine loan, if it meets each of the requirements contained in the Revenue \nProcedure, will be treated by the IRS as a real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, and interest derived from the mezzanine \nloan will be treated as qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the REIT 75% income test. Although the Revenue Procedure provides \na safe harbor on which taxpayers may rely, it does not prescribe rules of substantive tax law. We have acquired and may continue to \nacquire mezzanine loans that may not meet all of the requirements for reliance on this safe harbor. In the event we own a mezzanine \nloan that does not meet the safe harbor, the IRS could challenge the loan’s treatment as a real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset \nand income tests, and if the challenge were sustained, we could fail to qualify as a REIT. \n \nGeneral Risk Factors \nWe cannot predict the effects on us of actions taken by the U.S. government and governmental agencies in response to economic \nconditions in the U.S. \nIn response to economic and market conditions, U.S. and foreign governments and governmental agencies have established or \nproposed a number of programs designed to improve the financial system and credit markets, and to stimulate economic growth. Many \ngovernments, including federal, state and local governments in the U.S., are incurring substantial budget deficits and seeking financing \nin international and national credit markets as well as proposing or enacting austerity programs that seek to reduce government spending, \nraise taxes, or both. Many credit providers, including banks, may need to obtain additional capital before they will be able to expand \ntheir lending activities. We are unable to evaluate the effects these programs and conditions will have upon our financial condition, \nincome, or ability to make distributions to our stockholders."

As a result of losses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 in connection \nwith the economic impact of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, we received significant net operating loss (“NOL”) \ncarryforwards. NOLs are able to offset future taxable income, limiting the requirement for common share distributions. We also \nrecognized net capital loss carryforwards as finalized in our 2020 tax return. During the year ended December 31, 2022, all taxable \nincome was distributed in the form of a preferred share distribution, and therefore, no common share distribution was required. As we \ncontinue to take steps necessary to stabilize our earnings available for distribution (\"EAD\"), our board of directors, (our \"Board\"), will \nestablish a plan for the prudent resumption of the payment of common share distributions. No assurance, however, can be given as to \nthe amounts or timing of future distributions as such distributions are subject to our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements \nand such other factors as our Board deems relevant. \nThe following table summarizes our current and estimated tax loss carryforwards (dollars in millions): \n \n \n \nTax Year \nRecognized \n \nREIT (QRS) Tax Loss Carryforwards   \nTRS Tax Loss Carryforwards \n \nTax Asset Item \n \n \n \nOperating \n  \nCapital \n  \nOperating \n  \nCapital \n \nNet Operating Loss \nCarryforwards: \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nCumulative as of 2021 \n \n2021 Return\n $ \n46.6 \n$ \n— \n$ \n60.1 \n$ \n— \n \n \n \n \nNet Capital Loss Carryforwards:  \n \n \nCumulative as of 2021 \n \n2021 Return\n \n— \n \n121.9 \n \n— \n \n1.0 \nTotal tax asset estimates \n \n $ \n46.6 \n$ \n121.9 \n$ \n60.1 \n$ \n1.0 \nUseful life \n \n \n \nUnlimited\n5 years  \nVarious\n5 years\n \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated $1.1 million of taxable income which was offset by our cumulative \nNOL, leaving $46.6 million to carry forward to future years. NOL can generally be carried forward to offset both ordinary taxable \nincome and capital gains in future years. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) along with revisions made by the Coronavirus Aid, \nRelief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES”) reduced the deduction for NOLs to 80% of taxable income and granted an indefinite \ncarryforward period. \nAdditionally, $15.0 million of net capital gains was reported on our tax return for the year ended December 31, 2021.  This \nwas offset with our cumulative total net capital losses, leaving $121.9 million to carry forward to future years. No capital losses expired \nduring 2021. \nWe also have tax assets in our taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”). These tax assets are analyzed and disclosed quarterly in our \nfinancial statements. As of December 31, 2022, our TRSs have $39.9 million of pre-TCJA NOLs, some of which are set to expire \nbeginning in 2044, $20.2 million of NOLs with an indefinite carryforward period and net capital loss carryforwards of $1.0 million.  \nOn February 16, 2021, we completed a one-for-three reverse stock split, which reduced the number of shares of our common \nstock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the reverse stock split. At the date of the stock split, the \nnumber of shares of our authorized common stock was not affected by the reverse stock split and the par value of our common stock \nremained unchanged at $0.001 per share.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF \nOPERATIONS \nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes \nincluded in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this annual report on Form 10-K. \nWe have omitted discussion of the earliest of the three years covered by our consolidated financial statements presented in this \nreport as that disclosure is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the Securities \nand Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 9, 2022. You are encouraged to reference the discussion and analysis of our results of \noperations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion \nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” within that report. \nOverview \nWe are a Maryland corporation and an externally managed REIT that is primarily focused on originating, holding and managing \ncommercial real estate (“CRE”) mortgage loans and other commercial real estate-related debt investments. On July 31, 2020, our \nmanagement contract was acquired from Exantas Capital Manager Inc., a subsidiary of C-III Capital Partners LLC, by ACRES Capital, \nLLC (our “Manager”), a subsidiary of ACRES Capital Corp. (collectively, “ACRES”), a private commercial real estate lender \nexclusively dedicated to nationwide middle market CRE lending with a focus on multifamily, student housing, hospitality, office and \nindustrial in top United States (“U.S.”) markets (the “ACRES acquisition”). Our Manager draws upon the management team of ACRES \nand its collective investment experience to provide its services. Our objective is to provide our stockholders with total returns over time, \nincluding quarterly distributions and capital appreciation, while seeking to manage the risks associated with our investment strategies \nas well as to maximize long-term stockholder value by maintaining stability through our available liquidity and diversified CRE loan \nportfolio. \nAn important aspect of the ACRES acquisition was that it delivered operational liquidity in order to mitigate additional potential \nmargin call risk as a result of the market volatility that was created by the COVID-19 pandemic (see below), which allowed us to focus \non asset management within the portfolio in efforts to restart loan originations and underwriting. Our Manager has and expects to \ncontinue to leverage the complementary nature of our lending platforms, its experience and its network of relationships to enhance our \nnew business loan pipeline. Additionally, our Manager continuously monitors for new capital opportunities and executes on agreements \nthat enhance our returns. \nIn December 2019, COVID-19 was identified. The resulting spread of COVID-19 throughout the globe led the World Health \nOrganization to designate COVID-19 as a pandemic and numerous countries, including the U.S, to declare national emergencies. Many \ncountries responded to the initial and ensuing outbreaks of COVID-19 by instituting quarantines and restrictions on travel and limiting \noperations of non-essential offices and retail centers, which resulted in the closure or remote operation of non-essential businesses, \nincreased rates of unemployment and market disruption in connection with the economic uncertainty. The aforementioned quarantines \nand travel restrictions contributed significantly to economic disruptions across the country that directly impacted our borrowers and \ntheir ability to pay and to stay current with their debt obligations in 2020 and 2021, causing significant increases in our provisions for \ncredit losses. During the height of the pandemic, we used a variety of legal and structural options to manage credit risk effectively, \nincluding through forbearance and extension provisions or other agreements. \nDue in large part to the development and distribution of vaccines and other treatments, the U.S. and other countries around the \nworld have eased or removed restrictions entirely, financial markets are more liquid, collateral performance has improved and \nunemployment rates have stabilized to some degree; as such, at December 31, 2022, we have substantially reversed provisions for credit \nlosses related to macroeconomic factors impacted by COVID-19. For additional discussion with respect to the potential impact of \nCOVID-19 on our liquidity and capital resources, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” \nCurrently, domestic and global markets are grappling with managing rising inflation rates, supply chain disruptions and energy \nmarket dislocations. These additional market pressures are manifesting themselves in higher consumer prices and have led domestic and \nglobal monetary policy makers to raise historically low short-term interest rates at rates much faster than originally anticipated by \ndomestic and global financial markets in hopes of containing inflation and staving off or tempering an economic recession. The U.S. \nFederal Reserve has raised the Federal Funds rate by 4.25% in seven rate hikes between March 2022 and December 2022 to combat \ninflation, and more rate hikes are expected in the near future. These increases in the cost of capital and goods are expected to cause \nshort-term dislocations in various investment and financing markets in which we participate as we and other market participants adjust \nto the new financing environment.  \nWe continuously monitor the effects of domestic and global events, including but not limited to the current and expected \nimpacts of inflation, labor shortages, supply chain matters and rising interest rates, on our operations and financial position to ensure \nthat we remain responsive and adaptable to the dynamic changes in our operating environment. However, it is inherently difficult to \naccurately assess the continuing impact of domestic or global macroeconomic events on our revenues, profitability and financial \nposition. In response, we continue to actively and responsibly manage corporate liquidity and operations in light of changing"

In October 2021, we and our Manager entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “Preferred ATM Agreement”) with \nJonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, as placement agent (“JonesTrading”), pursuant to which we may issue and sell from time to \ntime up to 2.2 million shares of the Series D Preferred Stock. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we received net proceeds of \n$194,000 from the issuance of 7,857 shares of Series D Preferred Stock governed by the Preferred ATM Agreement. During the year \nended December 31, 2022, the Company did not issue any Series D Preferred Stock through this agreement. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued $150.0 million of principal of new 5.75% senior unsecured notes due \n2026 (“5.75% Senior Unsecured Notes”) for net proceeds of $146.7 million, which includes debt issuance costs. Using the proceeds, we \nfully redeemed our $50.0 million of principal of 12.00% senior unsecured notes (“12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes”) for $55.3 million, \nwhich included a $5.0 million make-whole amount, and partially repurchased $55.7 million of principal of 4.50% convertible senior \nnotes due 2022 (“4.50% Convertible Senior Notes”) during the year ended December 31, 2021. We incurred a loss on extinguishment \nof $9.0 million, which comprised a $5.0 million make-whole amount on the 12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes and $4.0 million of \nacceleration of the unamortized market discounts. We also accelerated the amortization of debt issuance costs of $522,000, which are \nreflected in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2021. \nIn February 2022, we repurchased $39.8 million par value of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes. In conjunction with the \nrepurchase, we accelerated $460,000 of the convertible note discount, which was recorded as an extinguishment of debt cost, and \n$114,000 of deferred debt issuance costs, which were recorded in interest expense. In August 2022, the remaining $48.2 million of \noutstanding 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes were paid off upon maturity at par. \nThe remaining proceeds from these transactions are intended to be used for loan originations and for general corporate purposes \nin order to improve and grow book value and earnings. \nWe target originating transitional floating-rate CRE loans between $10.0 million and $100.0 million. In March 2020, due to \nthe market disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we halted loan originations to manage our liquidity. In conjunction with the \ncapital commitments secured through the ACRES acquisition, we resumed originating floating-rate CRE loans in November 2020. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we originated 19 floating-rate CRE whole loans with total commitments of $610.8 million. \nLoan payoffs during the year ended December 31, 2022 were $399.6 million and net unfunded commitments were $21.2 million, \nproducing a net increase to the portfolio of $190.0 million. \nOur CRE loan portfolio, which had a $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion carrying value at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, \ncomprised: \n•  \nFirst mortgage loans, which we refer to as whole loans. These loans are typically secured by first liens on CRE property, \nincluding the following property types: multifamily, office, hotel, self-storage, retail, student housing, manufactured \nhousing, industrial, healthcare and mixed-use. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our whole loans had a carrying value of \n$2.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, or 100.0% and 99.8%, respectively, of the CRE loan portfolio. \n•  \nMezzanine debt that is senior to borrower’s equity but is subordinated to other third-party debt. These loans are \nsubordinated CRE loans, usually secured by a pledge of the borrower’s equity ownership in the entity that owns the \nproperty or by a second lien mortgage on the property. At December 31, 2021, our mezzanine loans had a carrying value \nof $4.4 million, or 0.2%, of the CRE loan portfolio. At December 31, 2022, our mezzanine loans had no carrying value. \n•  \nPreferred equity investments that are subordinate to first mortgage loans and mezzanine debt. At December 31, 2020, our \npreferred equity investments had a carrying value of $26.0 million, or 1.7% respectively, of the CRE loan portfolio. During \nthe year ended December 31, 2021, our preferred equity investments paid off, generating $28.8 million of proceeds.  \nWe generate our income primarily from the spread between the revenues we receive from our assets and the cost to finance our \nownership of those assets, including corporate debt."

      "text": "46 \nWhile the CRE whole loans included in the CRE loan portfolio are substantially composed of floating-rate loans benchmarked \nto market rates including the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), asset \nyields are protected through the use of benchmark floors and minimum interest periods that typically range from 12 to 18 months at the \ntime of a loan’s origination. Our benchmark floors provide asset yield protection when the benchmark interest rate falls below an in-\nplace benchmark floor. Our net investment returns are enhanced by a decline in the cost of our floating-rate liabilities that do not have \nbenchmark floors. Our net investment returns will be negatively impacted by the rising cost of our floating-rate liabilities that do not \nhave floors until the benchmark interest rate is above the benchmark floor, at which point our floating-rate loans and floating-rate \nliabilities will be match funded, effectively locking in our net interest margin until the benchmark floor rate is activated again or the \nfloating-rate loan is paid off or refinanced.  \nIn a business environment where benchmark interest rates are increasing significantly, cash flows of the CRE assets underlying \nour loans may not be sufficient to pay debt service on our loans, which could result in non-performance or default. We partially mitigate \nthis risk by generally requiring our borrowers to purchase interest rate cap agreements with non-affiliated, well-capitalized third parties \nand by selectively requiring our borrowers to have and maintain debt service reserves. These interest rate caps generally mature prior to \nthe maturity date of the loan and the borrowers are required to pay to extend them. In most cases the sponsors will need to fund additional \nequity into the properties to cover these costs as the property may not generate sufficient cash flow to pay these costs. At December 31, \n2022, 88.8% of the par value of our CRE loan portfolio had interest rate caps in place with a weighted-average maturity of 1.1 years.    \nAt December 31, 2022, our par-value $2.1 billion floating-rate CRE loan portfolio, which includes one whole loan without a \nbenchmark floor, had a weighted average benchmark floor of 0.68%. At December 31, 2021, our par-value $1.9 billion floating rate \nCRE loan portfolio, which includes one whole loan without a benchmark floor, had a weighted average benchmark floor of 0.75%. The \ndecrease in the weighted average benchmark floor was a result of older CRE floating-rate loans with higher floors paying off and being \nreplaced with newer loans with lower floors. With the trend of rising benchmark interest rates in 2022 (both LIBOR and SOFR), we \nhave seen the coupons on all of our floating-rate assets and debt rise accordingly. Because we have equity invested in each floating-rate \nloan, and because in all instances the benchmark interest rates are above our loan floors, the rise in interest rates expected by the market \nwill result in an increase in our net interest income. See “Interest Rate Risk” in “Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures \nAbout Market Risk.”"

      "text": "49 \nWe use leverage to enhance our returns. The cost of borrowings to finance our investments is a significant part of our expenses. \nOur net interest income depends on our ability to control these expenses relative to our revenue. Our CRE loans may initially be financed \nwith term facilities, such as CRE loan warehouse financing facilities, in anticipation of their ultimate securitization. We ultimately seek \nto finance our CRE loans through the use of non-recourse long-term, match-funded CRE debt securitizations. \nOur asset-specific borrowings comprised CRE debt securitizations, term warehouse financing facilities and our senior secured \nfinancing facility. In May 2021, we closed ACRES Commercial Realty 2021-FL1 Issuer, Ltd. (“ACR 2021-FL1”), a new CRE debt \nsecuritization financing $802.6 million of CRE loans with $675.2 million of non-recourse, floating-rate notes at a weighted average cost \nof one-month LIBOR plus 1.49%. Simultaneously, we executed the optional redemption on Exantas Capital Corp. 2019-RSO7, Ltd. \n(“XAN 2019-RSO7”) and paid off the remaining notes. In December 2021, we closed ACRES Commercial Realty 2021-FL2 Issuer, \nLtd. (“ACR 2021-FL2”), a new CRE debt securitization financing $700.0 million of CRE loans with $567.0 million of non-recourse, \nfloating-rate notes at a weighted average cost of one-month LIBOR plus 1.80%. Each of these 2021 CLOs provides for a two-year \nreinvestment period that allows us to reinvest CRE loan payoffs and principal paydown proceeds into the securitizations, pending certain \neligibility criteria are met and rating agency approval is obtained. The reinvestment feature of the securitizations will allow us to extend \nthe securitizations’ financing lives at favorable interest rates through the reinvestment of loan payoff proceeds into new loans. \nIn February 2022 and March 2022, we exercised the optional redemptions of Exantas Capital Corp. 2020-RSO8, Ltd. (“XAN \n2020-RSO8”) and Exantas Capital Corp. 2020-RSO9, Ltd. (“XAN 2020-RSO9”), respectively, and all of the outstanding senior notes \nwere paid off from the sales proceeds of certain of the securitizations’ assets. \nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had outstanding balances on our CRE loan term warehouse financing facilities of $328.3 \nmillion and $66.8 million, respectively, or 17.6% and 3.7%, respectively, of total outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2022 and \n2021, we had outstanding balances of $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, on CRE debt securitizations, or 66.1% and 80.8%, \nrespectively, of total outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding borrowings on our senior secured financing \nfacility of $87.9 million, or 4.7% of total outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings on our \nsenior secured financing facility. \nIn January 2020, we adopted updated accounting guidance that replaced the incurred loss approach with the CECL model for \nthe determination of our allowance for loan losses. We reevaluate our CECL allowance quarterly, incorporating our current expectations \nof macroeconomic factors considered in the determination of our CECL reserves. The CECL model projected significantly increased \nexpected credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $34.3 million in connection with the adverse market conditions \ncaused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a net reversal of credit losses, which reflected improvements in \nmacroeconomic conditions, improved collateral operating performance and improvements in individually-evaluated loans. At December \n31, 2021, the CECL allowance on our CRE loan portfolio was $8.8 million or 0.5% of our $1.9 billion loan portfolio.  \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a provision of credit losses, which reflected changes in macroeconomic \nconditions and a specific, full reserve on one mezzanine loan with a par value of $4.7 million. At December 31, 2022, the CECL \nallowance on our CRE loan portfolio was $18.8 million or 0.9% of our $2.1 billion loan portfolio. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded charge-offs of $2.3 million primarily attributable to the January 2022 \nrepayment of a CRE loan with a $2.3 million allowance. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded charge-offs of $4.2 million primarily attributable to: (i) the receipt of \nthe deed-in-lieu of foreclosure of a property formerly-collateralizing a CRE loan with a $2.3 million allowance at the time of transaction \nin October 2021 and (ii) the November 2021 sale of a CRE loan note for $7.6 million of proceeds, net of costs, with a $1.7 million \nallowance at the time of sale, including $60,000 of reversing realized gains from the September 30, 2021 allowance. \nWe historically used derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk \nassociated with our borrowings. In April 2020, we terminated all interest rate hedges in conjunction with the disposition of our financed \ncommercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) portfolio. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had unrealized losses in connection \nwith the terminated hedges of $6.6 million and $8.5 million, respectively, which will be amortized into interest expense over the \nremaining life of the debt. During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized amortization expense on these terminated \ncontracts of $1.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively. \nCommon stock book value was $24.54 per share at December 31, 2022, a $0.67 per share, or 3%, increase from December 31, \n2021."

      "text": "50 \nImpact of Reference Rate Reform \nAs discussed in the “Overview” section above, our CRE whole loans and our asset-specific borrowings are primarily \nbenchmarked to one-month LIBOR and one-month Term SOFR. In March 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority \nannounced that it would cease publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR immediately after December 31, 2021 and \ncease publication of the remaining tenors immediately after June 30, 2023. In July 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with \nthe Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprising large U.S. financial institutions, has identified SOFR as \nits preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. \nAll variable rate loans originated by us beginning January 1, 2022 have been benchmarked to SOFR. Additionally, all of our \nfloating-rate whole loans contain provisions that provide for the transition of the contractual benchmark interest rate to an alternative \nrate. At December 31, 2022, our loan portfolio had a carrying value of $2.0 billion of floating rate loans, 68.3% or $1.4 billion of which \nhave interest rates tied to LIBOR and 31.7% or $646.2 million of which have interest rates tied to SOFR. \n In September 2021 and January 2022, the term warehouse financing facilities with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan \nChase”) and Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), respectively, were amended to allow for the \ntransition to alternative rates, including rates tied to SOFR, subject to benchmark transition events. Additionally, during the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022, we entered into a loan agreement to finance the acquisition of a student housing complex, which uses SOFR as its \nbenchmark interest rate. At December 31, 2022, we had $1.7 billion of floating rate borrowings, 75.8% or $1.3 billion of which have \ninterest rates tied to LIBOR and 24.2% or $419.2 million of which have interest rates tied to SOFR.  \nWe expect to complete the process of converting our LIBOR-based loans and borrowings to an applicable benchmark interest \nrate during 2023. \nThe transition from LIBOR to SOFR or to another alternative rate may result in financial market disruptions and significant \nincreases in benchmark interest rates, resulting in increased financing costs to us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our \nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock. See “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors - \nChanges in the method for determining the benchmark rate (LIBOR or a replacement of LIBOR) may adversely affect the value of our \nloans, investments and borrowings and could affect our results of operations” for additional discussion on the risk related to ongoing \nreference rate reform. \nResults of Operations \nOur net loss allocable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $8.8 million, or $(1.00) per share-basic \n($(1.00) per share-diluted), as compared to net income allocable to common shares of $18.0 million, or $1.85 per share-basic ($1.85 per \nshare-diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2021."

These unfunded loan \ncommitments are advanced as the borrowers formally request additional funding, as permitted under the loan agreement, and any necessary approvals have been \nobtained. \nAt December 31, 2022, 23.2%, 21.5% and 16.2% of our CRE loan portfolio was concentrated in the Southwest, Southeast and \nMountain regions, respectively, based on carrying value, as defined by NCREIF. At December 31, 2021, 28.4%, 18.4% and 15.2% of \nour CRE loan portfolio was concentrated in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, respectively, based on carrying value. \nNo single loan or investment represented more than 10% of our total assets and no single investment group generated over 10% of our \ntotal revenue. \nInvestments in unconsolidated entities. Our investments in unconsolidated entities at December 31, 2022 and 2021 comprised \na 100% interest in the common shares of Resource Capital Trust I (“RCT I”) and RCC Trust II (“RCT II”), respectively, with a value \nof $1.5 million in the aggregate, or 3.0% of each trust. We record our investments in RCT I’s and RCT II’s common shares as investments \nin unconsolidated entities using the cost method, recording dividend income when declared by RCT I and RCT II. During  the years \nended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded dividends from the investments in RCT I’s and RCT II’s common shares, reported in \nother revenue on the consolidated statements of operations, of $91,000 and $65,000, respectively.  \nInvestments in real estate and property held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we acquired two new real \nestate properties through direct equity investments. We determined that the acquisition of the two properties should be accounted for as \nasset acquisitions. The combined acquisition-date fair value of $51.6 million was determined using third-party valuations.  \nIn September 2022, we sold an office property in the East North Central region that we previously designated as a property \nheld for sale. The office property sold for $19.3 million with selling costs of $532,000, resulting in a gain on sale of $1.9 million. \nIn July 2022, we received the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on a hotel property in the Northeast region. We determined that the \nacquisition of the property should be accounted for as an asset acquisition, and the acquisition-date fair value of $14.3 million was \ndetermined using a third-party valuation. The carrying value of the property was $13.5 million at December 31, 2022 and was reported \nas property held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. There was no gain or loss recognized on conversion of the loan to property \nheld for sale. In February 2023, this property was sold for $15.1 million and we expect to record a modest gain on the sale in the first \nquarter of 2023. \nIn September 2022, we reclassified another hotel property in the Northeast region with a carrying value of $36.9 million to \nproperty held for sale."

      "text": "59 \n \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, higher expected unemployment and increased volatility in CRE asset pricing and \nliquidity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted assumptions in our CECL estimates and resulted in a net provision \nfor credit losses of $30.8 million. However, the discovery and distribution of vaccines and other treatments for COVID-19 led to a \nrecovery of the global economy and markets worldwide, which resulted in a net reversal of credit losses of $21.3 million during the year \nended December 31, 2021. The ensuing macroeconomic factors, including expected increases in inflation, short-term interest rates, \nenergy prices and continued global supply chain dislocation trending negative, compounded by an increase in portfolio credit risk \nindicated in property-level cash flows that collateralize our loans, resulted in a net provision of expected credit losses of $12.3 million \nduring the year ended December 31, 2022. \nIn addition to our general estimate of credit losses, we may also be required to individually evaluate collateral-dependent loans \nfor credit losses if it has determined that foreclosure or sale of the loan or the underlying collateral is probable. At December 31, 2022 \nand 2021, $4.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively, of our allowance for credit losses resulted from collateral-dependent loans that \nwere individually evaluated for credit losses, details of which follow: \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we individually evaluated the following loans: \n•  \nOne office mezzanine loan in the Northeast region with a principal balance of $4.7 million. We fully reserved this loan in \nthe fourth quarter of 2022. \n•  \nOne retail loan in the Northeast region with a principal balance of $8.0 million. This property has an as-is appraised value \nin excess of its principal balance, and, as such, had no CECL allowance at December 31, 2022. \n•  \nOne office loan in the Southwest region with a principal balance of $20.7 million. This property has an as-is appraised \nvalue in excess of its principal balance, and, as such, had no CECL allowance at December 31, 2022. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we individually evaluated the following loans: \n•  \nAn office loan in the East North Central region with a $19.9 million principal balance. We recorded a $2.3 million CECL \nallowance in the third quarter of 2021 to reflect the as-is appraised value of the property of $17.6 million. Upon receipt of \nthe property in full satisfaction of the loan in the fourth quarter of 2021, we charged off the $2.3 million CECL allowance \nand recorded the property as a property held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets at its fair value of $17.6 million. \n•  \nA hotel loan in the Northeast region with a $9.3 million principal balance. We recorded a $1.8 million CECL allowance \nin the third quarter of 2021 that reflected our estimate of fair value less costs of sale of $7.5 million at September 30, 2021. \nUpon sale of the loan in November 2021, we received proceeds of $7.6 million, net of costs of sale, and charged off the \nremaining $1.7 million CECL allowance. \n•  \nA retail loan in the Pacific region with an $11.5 million principal balance. At December 31, 2021, we had a recorded $2.3 \nmillion CECL allowance that reflected the loss taken on the loan as a result of a discounted payoff received on the loan in \nJanuary 2022 in full satisfaction of the loan. \n•  \nA hotel loan in the East North Central region with an $8.4 million principal balance. We received payment in full on this \nloan in January 2022; and, as such, there was no CECL allowance recorded at December 31, 2021. \n•  \nA hotel loan in the Northeast region with a $14.0 million principal balance. The hotel loan has an as-is appraised value in \nexcess of its principal balance, and, as such, had no CECL allowance at December 31, 2021. \nCredit quality indicators \nCommercial Real Estate Loans \nCRE loans are collateralized by a diversified mix of real estate properties and are assessed for credit quality based on the \ncollective evaluation of several factors, including but not limited to: collateral performance relative to underwritten plan, time since \norigination, current implied and/or re-underwritten loan-to-collateral value (“LTV”) ratios, loan structure and exit plan. Depending on \nthe loan’s performance against these various factors, loans are rated on a scale from 1 to 5, with loans rated 1 representing loans with \nthe highest credit quality and loans rated 5 representing the loans with the lowest credit quality. The factors evaluated provide general \ncriteria to monitor credit migration in our loan portfolio; as such, a loan’s rating may improve or worsen, depending on new information \nreceived."

Performance criteria and loan covenants\nhave required occasional waivers. \n  \n  • Occupancy is not stabilized and the property has a large amount of tenancy rollover. \n  \n    \n5 \n  \n• Property performance is significantly worse than underwritten expectations. The loan is not in compliance with loan\ncovenants and performance criteria and may be in default. Expected sale proceeds would not be sufficient to pay off\nthe loan at maturity. \n  \n  • The property has a material vacancy rate and significant rollover of remaining tenants. \n  \n  • An updated appraisal is required upon designation and updated on an as-needed basis. \nAll CRE loans are evaluated for any credit deterioration by debt asset management and certain finance personnel on at least a \nquarterly basis. Historically, mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments may have experienced greater credit risks due to their \nnature as subordinated investments. \nFor the purpose of calculating the quarterly provision for credit losses under CECL, we pool CRE loans based on the underlying \ncollateral property type and utilize a probability of default and loss given default methodology for approximately one year after which \nwe immediately revert to a historical mean loss ratio. In order to calculate the historical mean loss ratio, we utilize our full, 16 year \nunderwriting history in the determination of historical losses, along with the market loss history from a selected population from an \nengaged third-party provider’s database that were similar to our loan types, loan sizes, durations, interest rate structure and general LTV \nprofiles. \nCredit risk profiles of CRE loans, at amortized cost, were as follows (in thousands, except amounts in the footnote): \n \n \n \nRating 1   \nRating 2 \n  \nRating 3   \nRating 4   \nRating 5   \nTotal (1) \n \nAt December 31, 2022: \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nWhole loans, floating-rate \n $ \n—  $ 1,635,376   309,491  $ 85,226  $ 22,797  $ 2,052,890 \nMezzanine loan \n  \n—   \n—   \n—   \n—   \n4,700   \n4,700 \nTotal \n $ \n—  $ 1,635,376  $ 309,491  $ 85,226  $ 27,497  $ 2,057,590 \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAt December 31, 2021: \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \nWhole loans, floating-rate \n $ \n—  $ 1,456,330  $ 273,078  $ 123,762  $ 24,681  $ 1,877,851 \nMezzanine loan \n  \n—   \n—   \n—   \n4,700   \n—   \n4,700 \nTotal \n $ \n—  $ 1,456,330  $ 273,078  $ 128,462  $ 24,681  $ 1,882,551 \n \n(1) \nThe total amortized cost of CRE loans excluded accrued interest receivable of $11.9 million and $6.1 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively."

      "text": "62 \nAt  December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had three whole loans in maturity default, with total amortized costs of $51.6 million and \n$27.9 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we received the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on a hotel property \nin the Northeast region that collateralized a whole loan with an amortized cost of $14.0 million and that was in maturity default at June \n30, 2022. In February 2023, we sold the hotel property in the Northeast region for $15.1 million. During the year ended December 31, \n2021, we received the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on an office property in the East North Central region that collateralized a whole loan \nthat was in maturity default at December 31, 2020 with an amortized cost of $19.9 million. In September 2022, the office property sold \nfor $19.3 million with selling costs of $532,000, resulting in a gain on sale of $1.9 million. \nAt December 31, 2022, one whole loan, with a total amortized cost of $8.0 million, was past due on interest payments.  \nAt December 31, 2021, three whole loans, including two loans that had maturity defaults, with a total amortized cost of $30.4 \nmillion were past due on interest payments.  \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, two whole loans in maturity default at December 31, 2021, including one loan that \nwas past due on interest payments at December 31, 2021, paid off principal of $17.6 million. The payoff on one loan was the result of a \ndiscounted payoff and resulted in a realized loss of $2.3 million for which a CECL allowance was established as of December 31, 2021. \nTroubled-Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”)  \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we entered into 12 agreements that extended eight loans by a weighted average \nperiod of four months and, in certain cases, modified certain other loan terms. One formerly forborne loan was in maturity default at \nDecember 31, 2022.  \nNo loan modifications during the year ended December 31, 2022 resulted in TDRs. \nRestricted Cash \nAt December 31, 2022, we had restricted cash of $38.6 million, which consisted of $38.2 million held within our five \nconsolidated securitization entities and $400,000 held in escrow for deposits or tax payments at our real estate properties or pledged \nwith minimum reserve balance requirements. At December 31, 2021, we had restricted cash of $248.4 million, which consisted of $248.1 \nmillion held within our seven consolidated securitization entities and $360,000 held in various reserve accounts.  \nThe decrease of $209.8 million was primarily attributable to the close of ACR 2021-FL1 and ACR 2021-FL2, executed in May \nand December 2021, respectively, which hold reinvestment capabilities at the securitization level. ACR 2021-FL1 and ACR 2021-FL2 \nheld $138.1 million and $99.0 million, respectively, in restricted cash at December 31, 2021. We expect to utilize a significant portion \nof the restricted cash at ACR 2021-FL1 and ACR 2021-FL2 at December 31, 2022 to acquire loans or future funding participations for \nthe securitizations’ portfolios, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” \nAccrued Interest Receivable \nThe following table summarizes our accrued interest receivable at December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): \n \n \n \nDecember 31, \n  \n \n \n \n \n2022 \n  \n2021 \n  \nNet Change \n \nAccrued interest receivable from loans \n $ \n11,936  $ \n6,106  $ \n5,830 \nAccrued interest receivable from promissory note, escrow, sweep and reserve \naccounts \n  \n33   \n6   \n27 \nTotal \n $ \n11,969  $ \n6,112  $ \n5,857 \n \nThe increase of $5.9 million in accrued interest receivable during the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable \nto rising benchmark rates."

That receipt \nwas offset by a $814,000 increase in other prepaid expenses, resulting from the prepayment of property taxes on a hotel property acquired \nin November 2020 and two office properties acquired in October 2021. \nDeferred Tax Assets \nAt both December 31, 2022 and 2021, our net deferred tax asset was zero, resulting from a full valuation allowance of $21.2 \nmillion and $21.4 million, respectively, on our gross deferred tax asset as we believed it was more likely than not that some or all of the \ndeferred tax assets would not be realized. We will continue to evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax \nassets by analyzing forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing \ntemporary differences, taxable income in prior carry back years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies. \nDerivative Instruments \nHistorically, a significant market risk to us was interest rate risk. We had sought to manage the extent to which net income \nchanges as a result of fluctuation of changes in interest rates by matching adjustable-rate assets with variable-rate borrowings. We sought \nto mitigate the potential impact on net income (loss) of adverse fluctuations in interest rates incurred on our borrowings by entering into \nhedging agreements. We classified our interest rate hedges as cash flow hedges, which are hedges that eliminate the risk of changes in \nthe cash flows of a financial asset or liability. \nWe terminated all of our interest rate swap positions associated with our prior financed CMBS portfolio in April 2020. At \ntermination, we realized a loss of $11.8 million. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had losses of $6.6 million and $8.5 million, \nrespectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which will be amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the \ndebt. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded amortization expense, reported in interest expense on the \nconsolidated statements of operations, of $1.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively.  \nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had unrealized gains of $256,000 and $347,000, respectively, attributable to two \nterminated interest rate swaps, in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets, to be accreted into earnings \nover the remaining life of the debt. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded accretion income, reported in \ninterest expense on the consolidated statements of operations, of $91,000 in each year.  \nThe following table presents the effect of derivative instruments on our consolidated statements of operations for the years \npresented (in thousands): \n \n  \n \nRealized and Unrealized Gain (Loss) (1) \n \n \n \nConsolidated Statements of Operations Location \n \nYear Ended \nDecember 31, 2022  \nYear Ended \nDecember 31, 2021  \nInterest rate swap contracts, hedging \n Interest expense \n $ \n(1,733) $ \n(1,851) \n \n(1) \nNegative values indicate a decrease to the associated consolidated statements of operations line items."

The asset-based revolving loan \nfacility (the “MassMutual Facility”) provided under the MassMutual Loan Agreement has been used to finance our core CRE lending \nbusiness. The MassMutual Facility initially had an interest rate of 5.75% per annum payable monthly and matured on July 31, 2027. \nWe paid a commitment fee as well as other reasonable closing costs. The loans under the MassMutual Facility were available for drawing \nduring the first two years of the MassMutual Facility (the “Availability Period”). During the Availability Period, an unused commitment \nfee of 0.50% per annum (payable monthly) on unused commitments under the MassMutual Loan Agreement was payable for each day \non which less than 75% of the total commitment is drawn. \nPursuant to the MassMutual Loan Agreement, the Borrower’s obligations under the MassMutual Loan Agreement are secured \nby the Borrower’s assets and Holdings’ equity interests in the Borrower, including all distributions, proceeds and profits from Holdings’ \ninterests in the Borrower. \nIn September 2020, the MassMutual Loan Agreement was amended pursuant to which (i) the initial portfolio assets were \nrevised and an agreed advance rate for each initial portfolio asset (each, an “Initial Portfolio Asset Advance Rate”) was set, and (ii) the \nrevolving loan facility under the MassMutual Loan Agreement was amended to require the initial lender (currently MassMutual) to \nprovide a specific advance rate for any future eligible portfolio assets and to limit the aggregate total amount of advances outstanding \nat any time to both the total facility amount and, in lieu of a 55% LTV, a borrowing base as of any required date of determination equal \nto the sum of, in each case, the product of the advance rate for such eligible portfolio asset (including in respect of the initial portfolio \nassets, the applicable Initial Portfolio Asset Advance Rate therefor) and the then determined value of such eligible portfolio asset. \nIn May 2021, the MassMutual Loan Agreement was amended pursuant to which (i) Mass Mutual consented to Borrower’s \nformation of certain subsidiaries to hold real estate and (ii) such subsidiaries agreed to entered into guaranty agreements in favor of the \nsecured parties under the Mass Mutual Loan Agreement."

Each loan series \nwill be available for three months after the closing date agreed upon by the Borrower and Lender (“Commitment Period”), subject to \nthe maximum dollar amount agreed upon for that series. The Commitment Period is subject to immediate termination upon the \noccurrence of an event of default. Each loan series will have a final maturity of five years from the end of the issuance date for the loan \nseries unless an additional time is mutually agreed upon by Lenders and Borrower. The advance rate on portfolio assets will be mutually \nagreed upon by Lenders and Borrower.

We also have the right to request an extension for an additional one-year period. \nMortgage Payable \nIn April 2022, Chapel Drive West, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Charles Street – ACRES FSU Student Venture, LLC \n(the \"FSU Student Venture\") entered into a loan agreement (the “Mortgage”) with Readycap Commercial, LLC (“Readycap”) to finance \nthe acquisition of a student housing complex. The Mortgage is interest only and has a maximum principal balance of $20.4 million, of \nwhich, $18.7 million was advanced in the initial funding. Initially, the Mortgage charged interest of 30-day average SOFR plus a spread \nof 3.80%. In October 2022, the Mortgage was amended to charge interest of one-month Term SOFR. The Mortgage matures in April \n2025, subject to two one-year extension options. \nThe Mortgage contains events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods, customary for this type of \nfinancing arrangement. The remedies for such events of default are also customary for this type of transaction. \nConstruction Loan \nIn January 2023, Chapel Drive East, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the FSU Student Venture, entered into a loan \nagreement (the \"Construction Loan Agreement\") with Oceanview Life and Annuity Company (\"Oceanview\") to finance the construction \nof a student housing complex (the \"Construction Loan\"). The Construction Loan is interest only and has a maximum principal balance \nof $48.0 million. The Construction Loan charges one-month Term SOFR plus a spread of 6.00% and matures in February 2025, subject \nto three one-year extension options. \nIn addition to the Construction Loan, we entered into a financing agreement with Florida Pace Funding Agency to fund energy \nefficient building improvements  and has a maximum principal balance of $15.5 million.  This agreement charges fixed interest of 7.26% \nand matures in July 2053. \nIn connection with our investment in the student housing complex, ACRES RF entered into guarantees related to the \nConstruction Loan made by Chapel Drive East, LLC. Pursuant to the guarantees, Jason Pollack, Frank Dellaglio and ACRES RF \n(collectively, the \"Guarantors\"), for the benefit of Oceanview, provided limited \"bad boy\" guaranties to Oceanview pursuant to the \nConstruction Loan Agreement until the earlier of the payment in full of the indebtedness or the date of a sale of the property pursuant \nto a foreclosure of the mortgage or deed or other transfer in lieu of foreclosure is accepted by Oceanview. The Guarantors also entered \ninto a Completion Guaranty Agreement for the benefit of Oceanview to guaranty the timely completion of the project in accordance \nwith the Construction Loan Agreement, as well as a Carry Guaranty Agreement, for the benefit of Oceanview to guaranty and the \nunconditional payment by Chapel Drive East, LLC of all customary or necessary costs and expenses incurred in connection with the \noperation, maintenance and management of the property and an Environmental Indemnity Agreement jointly and severally in favor of \nOceanview whereby the Guarantors serving as Indemnitors provided environmental representations and warranties, covenants and \nindemnifications (collectively the \"Guaranties\"). The Guaranties include certain financial covenants required of ACRES RF, including \nrequired net worth and liquidity requirements."

EAD is a non-GAAP financial measure intended to supplement our financial results computed in \naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and we believe EAD will serve \nas a useful indicator for investors in evaluating our performance and ability to pay dividends. \nEAD excludes the effects of certain transactions and adjustments in accordance with GAAP that we believe are not necessarily \nindicative of our current CRE loan portfolio and other CRE-related investments and operations. EAD excludes income (loss) from all \nnon-core assets such as commercial finance, middle market lending, residential mortgage lending, certain legacy CRE loans and other \nnon-CRE assets designated as assets held for sale at the initial measurement date of December 31, 2016. \nEAD, for reporting purposes, is defined as GAAP net income (loss) allocable to common shares, excluding (i) non-cash equity \ncompensation expense, (ii) unrealized gains and losses, (iii) non-cash provisions for credit losses, (iv) non-cash impairments on \nsecurities, (v) non-cash amortization of discounts or premiums associated with borrowings, (vi) net income or loss from a limited \npartnership interest owned at the initial measurement date, (vii) net income or loss from non-core assets, (viii) real estate depreciation \nand amortization, (ix) foreign currency gains or losses and (x) income or loss from discontinued operations.

Our ability to meet our on-going liquidity needs is subject to our ability to generate cash from operating \nactivities and our ability to maintain and/or obtain additional debt financing and equity capital together with the funds referred to below. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity were: (i) gross proceeds of $404.9 million from \nour CRE - term warehouse financing facilities, (ii) gross proceeds of $245.0 million from CRE whole loan purchases by our managed \nCRE securitizations ACR 2021-FL1 and ACR 2021-FL2, (iii) proceeds of $101.7 million from our senior secured financing facility, \n(iv) net proceeds of $57.9 million from repayments on our CRE portfolio, (v) proceeds of $57.6 million the from purchase of loan \nadvances by our managed CRE securitizations ACR 2021-FL1 and ACR 2021-FL2, (vi) net proceeds of $18.7 million from the sale of \na real estate property held for sale, (vii) net proceeds of $18.7 million for a mortgage payable for one of our real estate investments and, \n(viii) net proceeds of $13.7 million  from the liquidation of one of our CRE securitizations. These sources of liquidity were offset by \nour deployments in CRE whole loans and real estate investments, the partial repurchase and extinguishment of our 4.50% Convertible \nSenior Notes, repurchases of common stock, distributions on our preferred stock and ongoing operating expenses and substantially \nresulted in the $66.2 million of unrestricted cash we held at December 31, 2022. \nThe outstanding balance of our loan to ACRES Capital Corp., the parent of our Manager, was $11.3 million and $11.6 million \nat December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

      "text": "73 \nWe utilize a variety of financing arrangements to finance certain assets. We generally utilize the following five types of \nfinancing arrangements: \n1. Senior Secured Financing Facility: Our senior secured financing facility allows us to borrow against loans and real estate \ninvestments that we own. This facility has an individual floating rate loan series structure that have a three month \ncommitment period after the financing is approved by the lender, subject to the maximum dollar amount agreed upon for \nthe series.  Each floating rate loan series will have mutually agreed upon terms including (i) total commitment, including \nthe capacity to fund future funding commitments, where applicable; (ii) advance rate on portfolio assets; (iii) interest rate \ncomposed of one-month Term SOFR plus a market rate spread; and (iv) maturity date of five years from the issuance date \nfor the loan series unless an additional time is mutually agreed upon by the parties.  The facility has a maximum portfolio \nLTV of 85% and contains customary events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods, \ncustomary for this type of financing arrangement. \n2. Term Warehouse Financing Facilities (CRE loans): Term warehouse financing facilities effectively allow us to borrow \nagainst loans that we own. Under these agreements, we transfer loans to a counterparty and agree to purchase the same \nloans from the counterparty at a price equal to the transfer price plus interest. The counterparty retains the sole discretion \nover both whether to purchase the loan from us and, subject to certain conditions, the collateral value of such loan for \npurposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the counterparty. Generally, if the lender determines \n(subject to certain conditions) that the value of the collateral in a repurchase transaction has decreased by more than a \ndefined minimum amount, we would be required to repay any amounts borrowed in excess of the product of (i) the revised \ncollateral or market value multiplied by (ii) the applicable advance rate. During the term of these agreements, we receive \nthe principal and interest on the related loans and pay interest to the counterparty. \n3. Securitizations: We seek non-recourse long-term financing from securitizations of our investments in CRE loans. The \nsecuritizations generally involve a senior portion of our loan but may involve the entire loan. Securitization generally \ninvolves transferring notes to a special purpose vehicle (or the issuing entity), which then issues one or more classes of \nnon-recourse notes pursuant to the terms of an indenture. The notes are secured by the pool of assets. In exchange for the \ntransfer of assets to the issuing entity, we receive cash proceeds from the sale of non-recourse notes. Securitizations of our \nportfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because the retained subordinate \ninterest in any particular overall loan would be subordinate to the loan components sold and we would, therefore, absorb \nall losses sustained with respect to the overall loan before the owners of the senior notes experience any losses with respect \nto the loan in question. \n4. Mortgage payable: We have entered into a loan agreement to finance the acquisition of a student housing complex. This \nloan is interest only and has a maximum principal balance, most of which was advanced in the initial funding. The loan \nagreement contains events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods, customary for this type \nof financing arrangement. The remedies for such events of default are also customary for this type of transaction. \n5. Construction loan: We have entered into a loan agreement to finance the construction of a student housing complex. This \nloan is interest only and has a maximum principal balance of $48.0 million. The loan agreement contains events of default, \nsubject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods, customary for this type of financing arrangement. The remedies \nfor such events of default are also customary for this type of transaction.  Additionally, we have entered into a financing \nagreement to fund energy efficient building improvements at this student housing complex, with a maximum principal \nbalance of $15.5 million. \nThe issuances of ACR 2021-FL1 and ACR 2021-FL2 include 24-month reinvestment periods ending in May 2023 and \nDecember 2023, respectively, that allow us to reinvest CRE loan payoffs and paydowns into the securitizations upon the satisfaction of \ncertain eligibility and reinvestment criteria along with rating agency approval. The reinvestment feature of the securitizations will allow \nus to extend the securitizations’ financing capability by increasing the useful lives of the senior notes through the reinvestment of loan \nproceeds into new loans. We are also able to acquire future funding participations of the collateral in the securitizations during the \nreinvestment period. \nWe were in compliance with all of our covenants at December 31, 2022 in accordance with the terms provided in agreements \nwith our lenders. \nWe are continuing to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on us, the borrowers underlying our commercial real \nestate-related loans (and their tenants), our financing sources, and the economy as a whole. Because the severity, magnitude and duration \nof the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict, the pandemic’s \nimpact on our operations and liquidity remains uncertain and difficult to predict. Further discussion of the potential impacts on us from \nthe COVID-19 pandemic is provided in the section entitled “Risk Factors-Impact of Current Economic Conditions” in Part I, Item 1A \nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K."

This \nwas offset with our cumulative total net capital losses, leaving $121.9 million to carry forward to future years. No capital losses expired \nduring 2021 or 2022. \nWe also have tax assets in our taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”). These tax assets are analyzed and disclosed quarterly in our \nfinancial statements. As of December 31, 2021, our TRSs have $39.9 million of pre-TCJA NOLs, some of which are set to expire \nbeginning in 2044, $20.2 million of NOLs with an indefinite carryforward period and net capital loss carryforwards of $1.0 million. \nDistributions \nWe did not pay distributions on our common shares during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 as we were \nfocused on prudently retaining and managing sufficient excess liquidity in connection with the economic impact of the COVID-19 \npandemic. As a result of losses during that year, we received significant NOL carryforwards and net capital loss carryforwards, as \nfinalized in our 2020 tax return. We intend to retain taxable income by utilizing our NOL carryforwards and expect to generate capital \ngains to use a portion of our net capital loss carryforwards, thereby growing book value and our investable equity base. As we continue \nto take steps necessary to stabilize our earnings available for distribution, our Board will establish a plan for the prudent resumption of \nthe payment of common share distributions. No assurance, however, can be given as to the amounts or timing of future distributions as \nsuch distributions are subject to our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors as our Board deems \nrelevant. \nWe intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our preferred stock. \nU.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income annually, \ndetermined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate \nrates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its taxable income. Before we pay any dividend, whether for U.S. federal \nincome tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating and debt service requirements on our repurchase agreements \nand other debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow \nfunds to make cash distributions, or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or \ndistribution of debt securities. \nContractual Obligations and Commitments \n \n \n \nContractual Commitments \n \n \n \n(dollars in thousands, except amounts in footnotes) \n \n \n \nPayments due by Period \n \n \n \nTotal \n  \nLess than 1 \nyear \n  \n1 - 3 years \n  \n3 - 5 years \n  \nMore than 5 \nyears \n \nAt December 31, 2022: \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nCRE securitizations \n $ 1,242,223  $ \n—  $ \n—  $ \n—  $ 1,242,223 \nSenior secured financing facility (1) \n  \n91,549   \n—   \n—   \n91,549   \n— \nCRE - term warehouse financing facilities (2)(3) \n  \n330,849   \n—   \n330,849   \n—   \n— \nMortgage payable (4) \n  \n18,710   \n—   \n18,710   \n—   \n— \n5.75% Senior Unsecured Notes (5) \n  \n150,000   \n—   \n—   \n150,000   \n— \nUnsecured junior subordinated debentures (6) \n  \n51,548   \n—   \n—   \n—   \n51,548 \nLease liabilities (7) \n  \n856,189   \n1,583   \n5,490   \n6,000   \n843,116 \nUnfunded commitments on CRE loans (8) \n  \n158,195   \n8,985   \n149,210   \n—   \n— \nBase management fees (9) \n  \n6,701   \n6,701   \n—   \n—   \n— \nTotal \n $ 2,905,964  $ \n17,269  $ 504,259  $ 247,549  $ 2,136,887 \n \n(1) \nExcludes $202,000 of accrued interest payable at December 31, 2022. \n(2) \nIncludes $894,000 of accrued interest payable at December 31, 2022. \n(3) \nIn October 2022, we allowed our Barclays term warehouse financing facility to mature. \n(4) \nExcludes $88,000 of accrued interest payable at December 31, 2022. \n(5) \nExcludes $34.5 million of interest expense payable through maturity in August 2026. \n(6) \nExcludes $27.5 million and $28.5 million of estimated interest expense payable through maturity, in June 2036 and October 2036, respectively. \n(7) \nLease liabilities includes a ground rent lease for a hotel property with a remaining term of 93 years and an annual growth rate of 3%. \n(8) \nUnfunded commitments on our originated CRE loans generally fall into two categories: (i) pre-approved capital improvement projects and (ii) new or additional \nconstruction costs subject, in each case, to the borrower meeting specified criteria.

      "text": "77 \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \nGeneral \nAt December 31, 2022, we did not maintain any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships that were \nestablished for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or contractually narrow or limited purposes, although we do \nhave interests in unconsolidated entities not established for those purposes. Except as set forth below, at December 31, 2022, we had \nnot guaranteed obligations of any unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or letter of intent to provide additional funding \nto any such entities. \nUnfunded CRE Loan Commitments \nIn the ordinary course of business, we make commitments to borrowers whose loans are in our CRE loan portfolio to provide \nadditional loan funding in the future. Disbursement of funds pursuant to these commitments is subject to the borrower meeting pre-\nspecified criteria. These commitments are subject to the same underwriting requirements and ongoing portfolio maintenance as are the \non-balance sheet financial investments that we hold. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total \ncommitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Whole loans had $158.2 million and $157.6 million in \nunfunded loan commitments at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Preferred equity investments had $2.5 million in unfunded \ninvestment commitments at December 31, 2020. The preferred equity investments paid off during the year ended December 31, 2021. \nUnfunded commitments are not considered in the CECL reserve if they are unconditionally cancellable. \nGuarantees and Indemnifications \nIn the ordinary course of business, we may provide guarantees and indemnifications that contingently obligate us to make \npayments to the guaranteed or indemnified party based on changes in the value of an asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed \nor indemnified party. As such, we may be obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entity’s failure to perform \nor achieve specified performance criteria, or we may have an indirect guarantee of the indebtedness of others. \nAs part of our May 2017 sale of our equity interest in Pearlmark Mezz, we entered into an indemnification agreement whereby \nwe indemnified the purchaser against realized losses of up to $4.3 million on one mezzanine loan until its final maturity date in 2020. \nAs a result of the indemnified party’s partial sale of the mezzanine loan, our maximum exposure was reduced to $536,000 in 2019. In \nOctober 2020, the mezzanine loan paid off its balance to the indemnified party, resulting in the extinguishment of our liability. \nIn January 2023, Chapel Drive East, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the FSU Student Venture, entered into a loan \nagreement (the \"Construction Loan Agreement\") with Oceanview Life and Annuity Company (\"Oceanview\") to finance the construction \nof a student housing complex (the \"Construction Loan\").  \nIn connection with our investment in the student housing complex, ACRES RF entered into guarantees related to the \nConstruction Loan. Pursuant to the guarantees, Jason Pollack, Frank Dellaglio and ACRES RF (collectively, the \"Guarantors\"), for the \nbenefit of Oceanview, provided limited \"bad boy\" guaranties to Oceanview pursuant to the Construction Loan Agreement until the \nearlier of the payment in full of the indebtedness or the date of a sale of the property pursuant to a foreclosure of the mortgage or deed \nor other transfer in lieu of foreclosure is accepted by Oceanview. The Guarantors also entered into a Completion Guaranty Agreement \nfor the benefit of Oceanview to guaranty the timely completion of the project in accordance with the Construction Loan Agreement, as \nwell as a Carry Guaranty Agreement, for the benefit of Oceanview to guaranty and unconditional payment by Chapel Drive East, LLC \nof all customary or necessary costs and expenses incurred in connection with the operation, maintenance and management of the property \nand an Environmental Indemnity Agreement jointly and severally in favor of Oceanview whereby the Guarantors serving as Indemnitors \nprovided environmental representations and warranties, covenants and indemnifications (collectively the \"Guaranties\"). The Guaranties \ninclude certain financial covenants required of ACRES RF, including required net worth and liquidity requirements. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared by management in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial \nstatements in conformity with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities \nand disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and our financial results. We believe that certain \nof our policies are critical because they require us to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently \nuncertain. The critical policies summarized below relate to valuation of investment securities, accounting for derivative financial \ninstruments and hedging activities, income taxes, allowance for credit losses and variable interest entities (“VIEs”). We have reviewed \nthese accounting policies with our Board and believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are \nbased were reasonable at the time made based upon information available to us at the time."

      "text": "78 \nAllowance for Credit Losses \nWe maintain an allowance for credit loss on our loans held for investment. CRE loans that are held for investment are carried \nat cost, net of unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees and origination costs as applicable. Effective January 1, 2020, \nwe determine our allowance for credit losses, consistent with GAAP, by measuring CECL on the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis. We \nutilize a probability of default and loss given default methodology over a reasonable and supportable forecast period after which we \nrevert to the historical mean loss ratio, utilizing a blended approach sourced from our own historical losses and the market losses from \nan engaged third party’s database, to be applied for the remaining estimable period. The CECL model requires us to make significant \njudgments, including: (i) the selection of a reasonable and supportable forecast period, (ii) the selection and weighting of appropriate \nmacroeconomic forecast scenarios, (iii) projections for the amounts and timing of future fundings of committed balances and \nprepayments on CRE investments, (iv) the determination of the risk characteristics in which to pool financial assets, and (v) the \nappropriate historical loss data to use in the model. Unfunded commitments are not considered in the CECL reserve if they are \nunconditionally cancellable by us. \nWe measure the loan portfolio’s credit losses by grouping loans based on similar risk characteristics under CECL, which is \ntypically based on the loan’s collateral type. We regularly evaluate the risk characteristics of our loan portfolio to determine whether a \ndifferent pooling methodology is more accurate. Further, if we determine that foreclosure of a loan’s collateral is probable or repayment \nof the loan is expected through sale or operation of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, expected credit \nlosses are measured as the difference between the current fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the loan. Fair value may \nbe determined based on (i) the present value of estimated cash flows; (ii) the market price, if available; or (iii) the fair value of the \ncollateral less estimated disposition costs. \nWhile a loan exhibiting credit quality deterioration may remain on accrual status, the loan is placed on non-accrual status at \nsuch time as (i) management believes that scheduled debt service payments will not be met within the coming 12 months; (ii) the loan \nbecomes 90 days past due; (iii) management determines the borrower is incapable of, or has ceased efforts toward, curing the cause of \nthe credit deterioration; or (iv) the net realizable value of the loan’s underlying collateral approximates our carrying value for such loan. \nWhile on non-accrual status, we recognize interest income only when an actual payment is received if a credit analysis supports the \nborrower’s principal repayment capacity. When a loan is placed on non-accrual, previously accrued interest is reversed from interest \nincome. \nWe utilize the contractual life of our loans to estimate the period over which we measure expected credit losses. Estimates for \nprepayments and extensions are incorporated into the inputs for our CECL model. Modifications to loan terms, such as a modification \nin connection with a TDR, where a concession is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, may result in the extension of \nthe loan’s life and an increase in the allowance for credit losses. In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) \nconcurred with a joint statement of federal and state banking regulators that eased the requirements to classify a modification as a TDR \nif the modification was granted in connection with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The measurement of the impact of TDRs on \nthe expected credit losses occurs when a TDR is reasonably expected. If the concession granted on a TDR can only be captured through \na discounted cash flow analysis, then we will individually assess the loan for expected credit losses using the discounted cash flow \nmethod. \nIn order to calculate the historical mean loss ratio applied to the loan portfolio, we utilize historical losses from our full \nunderwriting history, along with the market loss history of a selected population of loans from a third party’s database that are similar \nto our loan types, loan sizes, durations, interest rate structure and general LTV profiles. We may make adjustments to the historical loss \nhistory for qualitative or environmental factors if we believe there is evidence that the estimate for expected credit losses should be \nincreased or decreased. \nWe record write-offs against the allowance for credit losses if we deem that all or a portion of a loan’s balance is uncollectible. \nIf we receive cash in excess of some or all of the amounts we previously wrote off, we record a recovery to increase the allowance for \ncredit losses. \nAs part of the evaluation of the loan portfolio, we assess the performance of each loan and assign a risk rating based on the \ncollective evaluation of several factors, including but not limited to: collateral performance relative to underwritten plan, time since \norigination, current implied and/or re-underwritten LTV ratios, risk inherent in the loan structure and exit plan. Loans are rated “1” \nthrough “5,” from least risk to greatest risk, in connection with this review. \nPrior to the implementation of CECL, we calculated our allowance for credit losses through the calculation of general and \nspecific reserves. The general reserve, established for loans not determined to be impaired individually, was based on our loan risk \nratings. We recorded a general reserve equal to 1.5% of the aggregate face values of loans with a risk rating of “3,” plus 5.0% of the \naggregate face values of loans with a risk rating of “4.” Loans with a risk rating of “5” were individually measured for impairment to be \nincluded in a specific reserve on a quarterly basis."

      "text": "79 \nInvestment in Real Estate \nWe acquire investments in real estate through direct equity investments and as a result of our lending activities (i.e. through  \nforeclosure or the receipt of the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on a property). Acquired investments in real estate assets are recorded initially \nat fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We allocate the purchase price of our acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on the \nrelative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  \nWe evaluate whether property obtained as a result of our lending activities should be identified as held for sale. If a property is \ndetermined to be held for sale, all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities will be recorded in property held for sale on the \nconsolidated balance sheets and recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Once a property is classified as held for sale, depreciation \nexpense is no longer recorded. \nInvestments in real estate are carried net of accumulated depreciation. We depreciate real property, building and tenant \nimprovements and furniture, fixtures, and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We \namortize any acquired intangible assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets. We \namortize the value allocated to lease right of use assets and related in-place lease liabilities, when determined to be operating leases, \nusing the straight-line method over the remaining lease term. The value allocated to any associated above or below market lease \nintangible asset or liability is amortized to lease expense over the remaining lease term. \nOrdinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Costs related to the improvement of the real property are capitalized \nand depreciated over their useful lives. \nWe depreciate investments in real estate and amortize intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: \n \nCategory \n \nTerm \nBuilding \n \n35 to 40 years \nBuilding improvements \n \n8 to 35 years \nSite improvements \n \n10 years \nTenant improvements \n \nShorter of lease term or expected useful life \nFurniture, fixtures and equipment \n \n3 to 12 years \nRight of use assets \n \n7 to 94 years \nIntangible assets \n \n90 days to 18 years \nLease liabilities \n \n7 to 94 years \n \nRevenue Recognition \nInterest income from our loan portfolio is recognized over the life of each loan using the effective interest method and is \nrecorded on the accrual basis. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into income using the effective yield method. If a loan \nwith a premium or discount is prepaid, we immediately recognize the unamortized portion as a decrease or increase to interest income. \nIn addition, we defer loan origination and extension fees and loan origination costs and recognize them over the life of the related loan \nwith interest income using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective yield method. Income recognition is suspended \nfor loans at the earlier of the date at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in our opinion, a full recovery of principal and \nincome becomes doubtful. When the ultimate collectability of the principal is in doubt, all payments received are applied to principal \nunder the cost recovery method. When the ultimate collectability of the principal is not in doubt, contractual interest is recorded as \ninterest income when received, under the cash method, until an accrual is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and \nperformance is demonstrated to be resumed. \nThrough our investments in real estate, we earn revenue associated with rental operations and hotel operations, which are \npresented in real estate income on the consolidated statements of operations.  \nRental operating revenue consists of fixed contractual base rent arising from tenant leases at our office properties under \noperating leases. Revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable terms of the related leases. For leases that have \nfixed and measurable rent escalations, the difference between such rental income earned and the cash rent due under the provisions of \nthe lease is recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. We move to cash basis operating lease income recognition in the period in \nwhich collectability of all lease payments is no longer considered probable. At such time, any uncollectible receivable balance will be \nwritten off."

      "text": "80 \nHotel operating revenue consists of amounts derived from hotel operations, including room sales and other hotel revenues. We \nrecognize hotel operating revenue when guest rooms are occupied, services have been provided or fees have been earned. Revenues are \nrecorded net of any sales, occupancy or other taxes collected from customers on behalf of third parties. The following provides additional \ndetail on room revenue and other operating revenue: \n•  \nRoom revenue is recognized when our hotel satisfies its performance obligation of providing a hotel room. The hotel reservation \ndefines the terms of the agreement including an agreed-upon rate and length of stay. Payment is typically due and paid in full \nat the end of the stay with some customers prepaying for their rooms prior to the stay. Payments received from a customer prior \nto arrival are recorded as an advance deposit and are recognized as revenue at the time of occupancy. \n•  \nOther operating revenue is recognized at the time when the goods or services are provided to the customer or when the \nperformance obligation is satisfied. Payment is due at the time that goods or services are rendered or billed. \nVariable Interest Entities \nWe consolidate entities that are VIEs where we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of such entities. Once it \nis determined that we hold a variable interest in a VIE, management performs a qualitative analysis to determine (i) if we have the power \nto direct the matters that most significantly impact the VIE’s financial performance; and (ii) if we have the obligation to absorb the \nlosses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive the benefits of the VIE that could potentially be \nsignificant to the VIE. If our variable interest possesses both of these characteristics, we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and \nwould be required to consolidate the VIE. This assessment must be done on an ongoing basis. \nAt December 31, 2022, we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of five VIEs that are consolidated. \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2022 \nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance that removes certain separation models \nfor convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock that require the separation into a debt component and an equity or \nderivative component. Consequently, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized \ncost, if no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives and the convertible instrument is not issued with substantial \npremiums accounted for as paid-in capital. By removing those separation models, the interest rate of convertible debt instruments \ntypically will be closer to the coupon interest rate. The guidance also revises the derivative scope exception for contracts in an entity’s \nown equity and improves the consistency of EPS calculations. Adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial \nstatements. \nAccounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Periods \nIn March 2022, the FASB issued an amendment eliminating certain previously issued accounting guidance for troubled debt \nrestructurings (“TDRs”) and enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding refinancings, restructurings, and write-offs. Current GAAP \nprovides an exception to general recognition and measurement guidance for loan restructurings if they meet specific criteria to be \nconsidered TDRs. If a modification is a TDR, incremental expected losses are recorded in the allowance for credit losses upon \nmodification and specific disclosures are required. The new amendment eliminates the TDR recognition and measurement guidance and \nrequires the reporting entity to evaluate whether the modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan, consistent \nwith accounting for other loan modifications. The amendment also requires public business entities to disclose current-period gross \nwrite-offs by year of origination for certain financing receivables and net investments in leases. For entities that have adopted the \npreviously issued guidance amended by this update, which we did during the year ended December 31, 2020, this update is effective for \nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for \nentities that have adopted the previously issued guidance amended by this update. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this \nguidance. \nInflation \nVirtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence \nour performance far more than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in \ninflation rates. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and our distributions are determined by \nour Board based primarily on our maintaining our REIT qualification; in each case, our activities and balance sheet are measured with \nreference to historical cost and/or fair market value without considering inflation."

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \nAt December 31, 2022, the primary components of our market risk were credit risk, counterparty risk, financing risk and interest \nrate risk, as described below. While we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we do seek to assume risk that can be quantified from \nhistorical experience, to actively manage that risk, to earn sufficient compensation to justify assuming that risk and to maintain capital \nlevels consistent with the risk we undertake or to which we are exposed. \nCredit Risks \nOur loans and investments are subject to credit risk. The performance and value of our loans and investments depend upon the \nsponsors’ ability to operate the properties that serve as our collateral so that they produce cash flows adequate to pay interest and \nprincipal due to us. To monitor this risk, ACRES Capital, LLC’s asset management team reviews our investment portfolios and in certain \ninstances is in regular contact with our borrowers, monitoring performance of the collateral and enforcing our rights as necessary. \nIn addition, we are exposed to the risks generally associated with the commercial real estate (“CRE”) market, including \nvariances in occupancy rates, capitalization rates, absorption rates, and other macroeconomic factors beyond our control. We seek to \nmanage these risks through our underwriting and asset management processes. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the CRE markets as numerous state, local, and federal regulations were issued \nthat imposed restrictions on travel and economic activity to contain the spread of the contagion, causing reduced occupancy, requests \nfrom tenants for rent deferral or abatement, and delays in construction and development projects. While many of these restrictions have \nbeen lifted, the reduced economic activity experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic could still severely impact borrowers’ \nbusinesses, financial condition and liquidity and may result in borrowers being unwilling or unable to meet their obligations to us in part \nor in full. \nIn a business environment where benchmark interest rates are increasing significantly, cash flows of the CRE assets underlying \nour loans may not be sufficient to pay debt service on our loans, which could result in non-performance or default. We partially mitigate \nthis risk by generally requiring our borrowers to purchase interest rate cap agreements with non-affiliated, well-capitalized third parties \nand by selectively requiring our borrowers to have and maintain debt service reserves. These interest rate caps generally mature prior to \nthe maturity date of the loan and the borrowers are required to pay to extend them. In most cases the sponsors will need to fund additional \nequity into the properties to cover these costs as the property may not generate sufficient cash flow to pay these costs. At December 31, \n2022, 88.8% of par value of our CRE loan portfolio had interest rate caps in place with a weighted-average maturity of 1.1 years. \nThese macroeconomic conditions may persist into the future and impair our borrowers’ ability to comply with the terms under \nour loan agreements. We maintain a robust asset management relationship with our borrowers and have utilized these relationships to \naddress the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising interest rates and other macroeconomic factors on our loans secured \nby properties experiencing cash flow pressure. While we believe the principal amounts of our loans are generally adequately protected \nby underlying collateral value, there is a risk that we will not realize the entire principal value of certain investments. In order to mitigate \nthat risk, we have proactively engaged with our borrowers, particularly with those with near-term maturities, in order to maximize \nrecovery. \nCounterparty Risk \nThe nature of our business requires us to hold our cash and cash equivalents and obtain financing from with various financial \ninstitutions. This exposes us to the risk that these financial institutions may not fulfill their obligations to us under these various \ncontractual arrangements. We mitigate this exposure by depositing our cash and cash equivalents and entering into financing agreements \nwith high credit-quality institutions. \nFinancing Risk \nWe finance our target assets using our CRE debt securitizations, a senior secured financing facility and warehouse financing \nfacilities. Over time, as market conditions change, we may use other forms of leverage in addition to these methods of financing. \nWeakness or volatility in the financial markets, the CRE and mortgage markets or the economy generally, such as through the impact \nof the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect one or more of our lenders or potential lenders and could cause one or more of our \nlenders or potential lenders to be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing, or to decrease the amount of our available financing, \nor to increase the costs of that financing."

Floating-rate loans \nfinanced with fixed rate liabilities have a negative correlation with declining interest rates to the extent of our financing. The remaining \n0.2% of our CRE loan portfolio by par value earned a fixed rate of interest and may be financed with liabilities that pay interest at fixed \nrates.

(a Maryland corporation) and \nsubsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive \nincome (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related \nnotes and financial statement schedules included under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, \nthe financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, \nand the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with \naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), \nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal \nControl—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and \nour report dated March 7, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion.  \nBasis for opinion \nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the \nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to \nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations \nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit \nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. \nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error \nor fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding \nthe amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and \nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that \nour audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nCritical audit matter \nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was \ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material \nto the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the \ncritical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating \nthe critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they \nrelate.  \nAllowance for credit losses on CRE whole loans \nAs described in Note 2 and Note 7 to the financial statements, and in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 326, Financial \nInstruments – Credit Losses, the Company utilizes a current expected credit loss methodology to determine the allowance for credit \nlosses on its commercial real estate (CRE) whole loans. The Company measures lifetime expected credit losses on CRE whole loans on \na pooled basis, based on shared risk characteristics or individually for collateral-dependent loans. To estimate the allowance for credit \nlosses on pooled CRE whole loans, the Company utilizes a probability of default times loss given default methodology, which \nincorporates individual loan characteristics, historical loss experience and the weighting of forecasted economic scenarios. For loans \ndetermined to be collateral-dependent that are individually evaluated, the reserve is calculated based on the difference between the \ncurrent fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the loan. We identified the allowance for credit losses as a critical audit \nmatter.  \nThe principal considerations for our determination that the allowance for credit losses is a critical audit matter are that management is \nrequired to make significant judgments in determining the accuracy of loan level data input into the estimate, the weighing of the \nforecasted economic scenarios, and in evaluating whether factors are present that indicate if an individual loan does not share risk \ncharacteristics of the pool.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nDECEMBER 31, 2022 \nNOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION \nACRES Commercial Realty Corp., a Maryland corporation, along with its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”), is a \nREIT that is primarily focused on originating, holding and managing commercial real estate (“CRE”) mortgage loans and equity \ninvestments in commercial real estate properties through direct ownership and joint ventures. On July 31, 2020, the Company’s \nmanagement contract was acquired from Exantas Capital Manager Inc. (the “Prior Manager”), a subsidiary of C-III Capital Partners \nLLC (“C-III”), by ACRES Capital, LLC (the “Manager”), a subsidiary of ACRES Capital Corp. (collectively, “ACRES”), a private \ncommercial real estate lender exclusively dedicated to nationwide middle market CRE lending with a focus on multifamily, student \nhousing, hospitality, office and industrial property in top United States (“U.S.”) markets (the “ACRES acquisition”). \nThe Company has qualified, and expects to qualify in the current fiscal year, as a REIT. \nThe Company conducts its operations through the use of subsidiaries that it consolidates into its financial statements. The \nCompany’s core assets are consolidated through its investment in ACRES Realty Funding, Inc. (“ACRES RF”), a wholly-owned \nsubsidiary that holds CRE loans, CRE-related securities and investments in CRE securitizations, which are consolidated as VIEs as \ndiscussed in Note 3, and special purpose entities. \nReverse Stock Split \nEffective February 16, 2021, the Company completed a one-for-three reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock. The \naccompanying financial statements and notes to the financial statements give retroactive effect to the reverse stock split for all periods \npresented. In addition, the Company adopted articles of amendment to its charter, which provided that the par value of the Company’s \ncommon stock remained $0.001 immediately after effect was given for the reverse stock split. No fractional shares were issued in \nconnection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders who otherwise held fractional shares of the Company’s common stock as a result \nof the reverse stock split received a cash payment in lieu of such fractional shares.  \nIn May 2021, the Company adopted articles of amendment to its charter to decrease its authorized shares of capital stock from \n225,000,000 shares, consisting of 125,000,000 shares of common stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock to 141,666,666 shares \nconsisting of 41,666,666 shares of common stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock. \nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \nPrinciples of Consolidation \nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally \naccepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, majority-owned or \ncontrolled subsidiaries and VIEs for which the Company is considered the primary beneficiary. All inter-company transactions and \nbalances have been eliminated in consolidation. \nVariable Interest Entities \nA VIE is defined as an entity in which equity investors (i) do not have a controlling financial interest and/or (ii) do not have \nsufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. A VIE \nis required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party that (a) has the power to control the activities that \nmost significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (b) has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially \nbe significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. \nThe Company considers the following criteria in determining whether an entity is a VIE: \n1.\nThe equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated\nfinancial support provided by any parties, including the equity holders.\n2.\nThe equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest.\na.\nThe direct ability to make decisions about the entity’s activities through voting rights or similar rights.\nb.\nThe obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity."

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) \nDECEMBER 31, 2022 \n \n96 \nc. \nThe right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity. The equity investors have voting rights that are not \nproportionate to their economic interests, and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an \ninvestor with a disproportionately small voting interest. \nIn determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company reviews governing contracts, formation \ndocuments and any other contractual arrangements for any relevant terms and determines the activities that have the most significant \nimpact on the VIE and who has the power to direct those activities. The Company also looks for kick-out rights, protective rights and \nparticipating rights as well as any financial or other support provided to the VIE and the reason for that support, and the terms of any \nexplicit or implicit arrangements that may require the Company to provide future support. The Company then makes a determination \nbased on its power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and/or a financial interest that is potentially significant. In instances \nwhen a VIE is owned by both the Company and related parties, the Company considers whether there is a single party in the related \nparty group that meets both the power and losses or benefits criteria on its own as though no related party relationship existed. If one \nparty within the related party group meets both these criteria, such reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of the VIE and no further \nanalysis is needed. If no party within the related party group on its own meets both the power and losses or benefits criteria, but the \nrelated party group as a whole meets these two criteria, the determination of primary beneficiary within the related party group is based \nupon an analysis of the facts and circumstances with the objective of determining which party is most closely associated with the VIE. \nDetermining the primary beneficiary requires significant judgment. The Company continuously analyzes entities in which it holds \nvariable interests, including when there is a reconsideration event, to determine whether such entities are VIEs and whether such potential \nVIEs should be consolidated or deconsolidated. \nVoting Interest Entities \nA voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities \nindependently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic \nperformance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition \nfor a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If the Company has a majority \nvoting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated. The Company does not consolidate a voting interest \nentity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or through a simple majority \nvote.  \nThe Company performs on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework \nhave become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework.  \nUse of Estimates \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions \nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial \nstatements and within the period of financial results. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates affecting the \naccompanying consolidated financial statements include but are not limited to the net realizable and fair values of the Company’s \ninvestments and derivatives, the estimated useful lives used to calculate depreciation, the expected lives over which to amortize \npremiums and accrete discounts, provisions for or reversals of expected credit losses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. \nCash and Cash Equivalents \nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or \nless at the time of purchase. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, $63.3 million and $33.3 million, respectively, of the reported cash balances \nexceeded the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Securities Investor Protection Corporation deposit insurance limits of $250,000 \nper respective depository or brokerage institution. However, all of the Company’s cash deposits are held at multiple, established financial \ninstitutions, in multiple accounts associated with its parent and respective consolidated subsidiaries, to minimize credit risk exposure. \nRestricted cash includes required account balance minimums as well as cash held for primarily for the Company’s CRE debt \nsecuritizations as well as cash held in the CRE debt securitizations and the syndicated corporate loan collateralized debt obligations \n(“CDOs”)."

      "text": "ACRES COMMERCIAL REALTY CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) \nDECEMBER 31, 2022 \n \n97 \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets \nto the total amount shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands): \n \n \n \nDecember 31, \n \n \n \n2022 \n  \n2021 \n \nCash and cash equivalents \n $ \n66,232  $ \n35,500 \nRestricted cash \n  \n38,579   \n248,431 \nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown on the Company’s consolidated \nstatements of cash flows \n $ \n104,811  $ \n283,931 \n \nInvestment in Unconsolidated Entities \nThe Company’s non-controlling investments in unconsolidated entities are included in investments in unconsolidated entities \non the consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for under the cost method. Under the cost method, the Company records dividend \nincome when declared to the extent it is not considered a return of capital, which is recorded as a reduction of the cost of the investment. \nLoans \nThe Company acquires loans through direct origination and occasionally through purchases from third-parties and had \nhistorically acquired corporate leveraged loans in the secondary market and through syndications of newly originated loans. Loans are \nheld for investment; therefore, the Company initially records loans at the amount funded for originated loans or at the acquisition price \nfor loans purchased, and subsequently, accounts for them based on their outstanding principal plus or minus unamortized premiums or \ndiscounts. The Company may sell a loan held for investment where the credit fundamentals underlying a particular loan have changed \nin such a manner that the Company’s expected return on investment may decrease. Once the determination has been made by the \nCompany that it no longer will hold the loan for investment, the Company identifies these loans as loans held for sale. Any credit-related \nwrite-off considerations prior to the transfer of the loan to loans held for sale are accounted for through the allowance for credit losses \non the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. \nThe Company reports its loans held for sale at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. To determine fair value, the Company \nprimarily uses appraisals of underlying collateral obtained from third-parties as a practical expedient. Key assumptions used in those \nappraisals are reviewed by the Company. If there is a material difference between the value provided by the appraiser and information \nused by the Company to validate the appraisal, the Company will evaluate the difference with the appraiser, which could result in an \nupdated appraisal. The Company may also use the present value of estimated cash flows, market price, if available, or other determinants \nof the fair value of the collateral less estimated disposition costs. Any determined changes in the fair value of loans held for sale are \nrecorded in fair value adjustments on financial assets held for sale on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Based on a \nprioritization of inputs used in the valuation of each position, the Company categorizes these investments as either Level 2 or Level 3 \nin the fair value hierarchy. \nLoan Interest Income Recognition \nInterest income on loans includes interest at stated rates adjusted for amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts based \non the contractual payment terms of the loan. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into income using the effective yield \nmethod. If a loan with a premium or discount is prepaid, the Company immediately recognizes the unamortized portion as a decrease or \nincrease to interest income. In addition, the Company defers loan origination and extension fees and loan origination costs and recognizes \nthem over the life of the related loan against interest income using the straight line method, which approximates the effective yield \nmethod. Income recognition is suspended for loans at the earlier of the date at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in the \nopinion of management, a full recovery of principal and income becomes doubtful. When the ultimate collectability of the principal is \nin doubt, all payments received are applied to principal under the cost recovery method. On the other hand, when the ultimate \ncollectability of the principal is not in doubt, contractual interest is recorded as interest income when received, under the cash method, \nuntil an accrual is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed. A loan is \nwritten off when it is no longer realizable and/or legally discharged. \nThe Company records interest receivable on its loans in accrued interest receivable on its consolidated balance sheets. The \nCompany analyzes the interest receivable balances on a timely basis, or at least quarterly, to determine if they are uncollectible. If an \ninterest receivable amount is deemed uncollectible, then the Company writes off that uncollectible amount of the interest receivable \nthrough a reversal of interest income."

      "text": "ACRES COMMERCIAL REALTY CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) \nDECEMBER 31, 2022 \n \n98 \nPreferred Equity Investment \nHistorically, the Company invested in preferred equity investments. Preferred equity investments, which are subordinate to any \nloans but senior to common equity, depending on the investment’s characteristics, could be accounted for as real estate, joint ventures \nor as mortgage loans. The Company’s preferred equity investments were accounted for as CRE loans held for investment, were carried \nat cost, net of unamortized loan fees and origination costs, and were included within CRE loans on the Company’s consolidated balance \nsheets. The Company accreted or amortized any discounts or premiums over the life of the related loan utilizing the effective interest \nmethod. Interest and fees were recognized as income subject to recoverability, which was substantiated by obtaining annual appraisals \non the underlying property. \nAllowance for Credit Losses \nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit loss on its loans held for investment. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company \ndetermines its allowance for credit losses by measuring the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) on the loan portfolio on a quarterly \nbasis. The Company utilizes a probability of default and loss given default methodology together with collateral-specific data for each \nloan over a reasonable and supportable forecast period after which it reverts to its historical mean loss ratio, utilizing a blended approach \nsourced from its own historical losses and the market losses from an engaged third party’s database, to be applied for the remaining \nestimable period. The CECL model requires the Company to make significant judgments, including: (i) the selection of a reasonable \nand supportable forecast period, (ii) the selection and weighting of appropriate macroeconomic forecast scenarios, (iii) projections for \nthe amounts and timing of future fundings of committed balances and prepayments on CRE investments, (iv) the determination of the \nrisk characteristics in which to pool financial assets, and (v) the appropriate historical loss data to use in the model. Unfunded \ncommitments are not considered in the CECL reserve if they are unconditionally cancellable by the Company. \nThe Company measures the loan portfolio’s credit losses by grouping loans based on similar risk characteristics under CECL, \nwhich is typically based on the loan’s collateral type. The Company regularly evaluates the risk characteristics of its loan portfolio to \ndetermine whether a different pooling methodology is more accurate. Further, if the Company determines that foreclosure of a loan’s \ncollateral is probable or repayment of the loan is expected through sale or operation of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing \nfinancial difficulty, expected credit losses are measured as the difference between the current fair value of the collateral and the amortized \ncost of the loan. Fair value may be determined based on (i) the present value of estimated cash flows; (ii) the market price, if available; \nor (iii) the fair value of the collateral less estimated disposition costs. \nWhile a loan exhibiting credit quality deterioration may remain on accrual status, the loan is placed on non-accrual status at \nsuch time as (i) management believes that scheduled debt service payments will not be met within the coming 12 months; (ii) the loan \nbecomes 90 days past due; (iii) management determines the borrower is incapable of, or has ceased efforts toward, curing the cause of \nthe credit deterioration; or (iv) the net realizable value of the loan’s underlying collateral approximates the Company’s carrying value \nfor such loan. While on non-accrual status, the Company recognizes interest income only when an actual payment is received if a credit \nanalysis supports the borrower’s principal repayment capacity. When a loan is placed on non-accrual, previously accrued  and \nuncollected interest is reversed from interest income. \nThe Company utilizes the contractual life of its loans to estimate the period over which it measures expected credit losses. \nEstimates for prepayments and extensions are incorporated into the inputs for the Company’s CECL model. Modifications to loan terms, \nsuch as a modification in connection with a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”), where a concession is granted to a borrower \nexperiencing financial difficulty, may result in the extension of the loan’s life and an increase in the allowance for credit losses. In March \n2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) concurred with a joint statement of federal and state banking regulators that \neased the requirements to classify a modification as a TDR if the modification was granted in connection with the effects of the COVID-\n19 pandemic. If the concession granted on a TDR can only be captured through a discounted cash flow analysis, then the Company will \nindividually assess the loan for expected credit losses using the discounted cash flow method. \nIn order to calculate the historical mean loss ratio applied to the loan portfolio, the Company utilizes historical losses from its \nfull underwriting history, along with the market loss history of a selected population of loans from a third party’s database that are \nsimilar to the Company’s loan types, loan sizes, durations, interest rate structure and general loan-to-collateral value (“LTV”) profiles. \nThe Company may make adjustments to the historical loss history for qualitative or environmental factors if it believes there is evidence \nthat the estimate for expected credit losses should be increased or decreased. \nThe Company records write-offs against the allowance for credit losses if it deems that all or a portion of a loan’s balance is \nuncollectible. If the Company receives cash in excess of some or all of the amounts it previously wrote off, it records the recovery by \nincreasing the allowance for credit losses."

      "text": "ACRES COMMERCIAL REALTY CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) \nDECEMBER 31, 2022 \n \n99 \nAs part of the evaluation of the loan portfolio, the Company assesses the performance of each loan and assigns a risk rating \nbased on the collective evaluation of several factors, including but not limited to: collateral performance relative to underwritten plan, \ntime since origination, current implied and/or re-underwritten LTV ratios, risk inherent in the loan structure and exit plan. Loans are \nrated “1” through “5,” from the least risk to the greatest risk, in connection with this review. \nPrior to the implementation of CECL, the Company calculated its allowance for credit losses through the calculation of general \nand specific reserves. The general reserve, established for loans not determined to be impaired individually, was based on the Company’s \nloan risk ratings. The Company recorded a general reserve equal to 1.5% of the aggregate face values of loans with a risk rating of “3,” \nplus 5.0% of the aggregate face values of loans with a risk rating of “4.” Loans with a risk rating of “5” were individually measured for \nimpairment to be included in a specific reserve on a quarterly basis. \nOperating Revenue at Properties \nThrough its investments in real estate, the Company earns revenue associated with rental operations and hotel operations, which \nare presented in real estate income on the consolidated statements of operations.  \nThe Company’s rental operating revenue consists of fixed contractual base rent arising from tenant leases at the Company’s \noffice and student housing properties under operating leases. Revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable \nterms of the related leases. For leases that have fixed and measurable rent escalations, the difference between such rental income earned \nand the cash rent due under the provisions of the lease is recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company moves \nto cash basis operating lease income recognition in the period in which collectability of all lease payments is no longer considered \nprobable. At such time, any uncollectible receivable balance will be written off. \nHotel operating revenue consists of amounts derived from hotel operations, including room sales and other hotel revenues. The \nCompany recognizes hotel operating revenue when guest rooms are occupied, services have been provided or fees have been earned. \nRevenues are recorded net of any sales, occupancy or other taxes collected from customers on behalf of third parties. The following \nprovides additional detail on room revenue and other operating revenue: \n•  \nRoom revenue is recognized when the Company’s hotel satisfies its performance obligation of providing a hotel room. \nThe hotel reservation defines the terms of the agreement including an agreed-upon rate and length of stay. Payment is \ntypically due and paid in full at the end of the stay with some customers prepaying for their rooms prior to the stay. \nPayments received from a customer prior to arrival are recorded as an advance deposit and are recognized as revenue at \nthe time of occupancy. \n•  \nOther operating revenue is recognized at the time when the goods or services are provided to the customer or when the \nperformance obligation is satisfied. Payment is due at the time that goods or services are rendered or billed. \nInvestment in Real Estate \nThe Company acquires investments in real estate through direct equity investments and as a result of its lending activities (i.e. \nthrough foreclosure or the receipt of the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on a property). Acquired investments in real estate assets are recorded \ninitially at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company allocates the purchase price of its acquired assets and assumed \nliabilities based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company accounts for leases that it acquires \nas operating leases.  \nThe Company evaluates whether property obtained as a result of its lending activities should be identified as held for sale. If a \nproperty is determined to be held for sale, all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities will be recorded in property held for sale on \nthe consolidation balance sheet and recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, see the “Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale” section \nbelow. Once a property is classified as held for sale, depreciation expense is no longer recorded. \nInvestments in real estate are carried net of accumulated depreciation. The Company depreciates real property, building and \ntenant improvements and furniture, fixtures, and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets \nunless the asset is designated as held for sale. The Company amortizes any acquired intangible assets using the straight-line method over \nthe estimated useful lives of the intangible assets. The Company amortizes the value allocated to lease right of use assets and related in-\nplace lease liabilities, when determined to be operating leases, using the straight-line method over the remaining lease term. The value \nallocated to any associated above or below market lease intangible asset or liability is amortized to lease expense over the remaining \nlease term."

Any loss resulting from the transfer of long-lived assets or disposal groups to assets held for sale is recognized in \nthe period in which the held for sale criteria are met.  \nThe fair values of assets held for sale are assessed each reporting period and changes in such fair values are reported as an \nadjustment to the carrying value of the asset or disposal group with an offset to fair value adjustments on financial assets held for sale \non the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, to the extent that any subsequent changes in fair value do not exceed the cost \nbasis of the asset or disposal group. \nAdditionally, upon determining that a long-lived asset or disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the \nCompany reports the assets and liabilities of the disposal group, if material, in the line items assets or liabilities held for sale, respectively, \non the consolidated balance sheets."

To maintain REIT status for federal income tax purposes, the Company is generally required to distribute \nat least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its shareholders as well as comply with certain other qualification requirements as defined \nunder the Code. As a REIT, the Company is not subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent that it distributes 100% of its REIT \ntaxable income each year. \nTaxable income, from non-REIT activities managed through the Company’s taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), is subject to \nfederal, state and local income taxes. The Company’s TRS’ income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under \nthe asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis \nand tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and liabilities and recognizes a \nvaluation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will not be \nrealized. In evaluating the realizability of the deferred tax asset or liability, the Company will consider the expected future taxable \nincome, existing and projected book to tax differences as well as tax planning strategies. This analysis is inherently subjective, as it is \nbased on forecasted earning and business and economic activity. Changes in estimates of deferred tax asset realizability, if any, are \nincluded in income tax (expense) benefit on the consolidated statements of operations. \nIn addition, several of the Company’s foreign TRSs, are organized as exempted companies incorporated with limited liability \nunder the laws of the Cayman Islands. Despite their status as TRSs, they generally will not be subject to corporate tax on their earnings \nand no provision for income taxes is required. However, because they are either controlled foreign corporations or passive foreign \ninvestment companies (in which the Company has made a Qualified Electing Fund election), the Company will generally be required \nto include its share of current taxable income from the foreign TRSs in its calculation of REIT taxable income. \nThe Company accounts for taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing \ntransaction (e.g., sales, use, value added) on a net (excluded from revenue) basis. \nThe Company established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset that was tax effected at $21.2 million and \n$21.4 million, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as the Company believed it was more likely than not that all of the deferred \ntax assets would not be realized. This assessment was based on the Company’s cumulative historical losses and uncertainties as to the \namount of taxable income that would be generated in future years in its TRSs. \nThe Company evaluates and recognizes tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon \nexamination by the appropriate taxing authority. A tax position that meets this threshold is measured as the largest amount of benefit \nthat is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company classifies any tax penalties as other operating \nexpenses and any interest as interest expense. The Company does not have any unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the \nCompany’s financial position."

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) \nDECEMBER 31, 2022 \n \n102 \nStock Based Compensation \nIssuances of restricted stock and options are initially measured at fair value on the grant date and expensed monthly on a \nstraight-line basis over the service period to equity compensation expense on the consolidated statements of operations, with a \ncorresponding entry to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with GAAP, the fair value of all \nunvested issuances of restricted stock and options is not remeasured after the initial grant date.  \nEarnings Per Share \nThe Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”). Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by \ndividing net income (loss) allocable to common shares by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted \nEPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted \ninto common stock, where such exercise or conversion would result in a lower EPS amount. \nFair Value Measurements \nIn analyzing the fair value of its investments accounted for on a fair value basis, the Company uses the fair value hierarchy, \nwhich requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair \nvalue. The Company determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or, if quoted prices are not available, through the use \nof alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality \nand duration of the investment. The hierarchy defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: \nLevel 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. \nLevel 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets \nthat are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value inputs are observable. \nLevel 3 - Prices are determined using significant unobservable inputs. In situations where quoted prices or observable inputs \nare unavailable, for example, when there is little or no market activity for an investment at the end of the period, unobservable inputs \nmay be used. \nThe level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input \nthat is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy \nrequires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter; depending on various factors, it is possible \nthat an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter. Transfers between levels are determined by the Company \nat the end of the reporting period. However, the Company expects that changes in classifications between levels will be rare.  \nReference Rate Reform \nHistorically, the Company has used LIBOR as the benchmark interest rate for its floating-rate whole loans and the Company \nhas been exposed to LIBOR through its floating-rate borrowings. Many of its floating-rate whole loans, CRE securitizations and term \nwarehouse financing facilities included one-month LIBOR as the original contractual benchmark interest rate. The Company's unsecured \njunior subordinated debentures use three-month LIBOR as the contractual benchmark rate. In March 2021, the United Kingdom’s, or \nU.K.’s, Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that it would cease publication of the one-week and the two-month USD \nLIBOR immediately after December 31, 2021, and cease publication of the remaining tenors immediately after June 30, 2023. In July \n2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprising large \nU.S. financial institutions, has identified Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. \nAll variable rate loans originated by the Company beginning January 1, 2022 have been benchmarked to SOFR. Additionally, \nall of its floating-rate whole loans contain provisions that provide for the transition of the contractual benchmark rate to an alternative \nrate. At December 31, 2022, the Company's loan portfolio had a carrying value of $2.0 billion of floating rate loans, 68.3% or $1.4 \nbillion of which have interest rates tied to LIBOR and 31.7% or $646.2 million of which have interest rates tied to SOFR.  \nIn September 2021 and January 2022, the term warehouse financing facilities with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan \nChase”) and Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), respectively, were amended to allow for the \ntransition to alternative rates, including rates tied to SOFR, subject to benchmark transition events. Additionally, during the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022, the Company entered into a loan agreement to finance the acquisition of a student housing complex, which uses \nSOFR as its benchmark interest rate. At December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.7 billion of floating rate borrowings, 75.8% or $1.3 \nbillion of which have interest rates tied to LIBOR and 24.2% or $419.2 million of which have interest rates tied to SOFR."

      "text": "ACRES COMMERCIAL REALTY CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) \nDECEMBER 31, 2022 \n \n103 \nThe Company expects to complete the process of converting its LIBOR-based loans and borrowings to an applicable benchmark \ninterest rate during 2023. \nRecent Accounting Standards \nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2022 \nIn August 2020, the FASB issued guidance that removes certain separation models for convertible debt instruments and \nconvertible preferred stock that require the separation into a debt component and an equity or derivative component. Consequently, a \nconvertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, if no other features require \nbifurcation and recognition as derivatives and the convertible instrument is not issued with substantial premiums accounted for as paid-\nin capital. By removing those separation models, the interest rate of convertible debt instruments typically will be closer to the coupon \ninterest rate. The guidance also revises the derivative scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity and improves the \nconsistency of EPS calculations. Adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. \nAccounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Periods \nIn March 2022, the FASB issued an amendment eliminating certain previously issued accounting guidance for troubled debt \nrestructurings (“TDRs”) and enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding refinancings, restructurings, and write-offs. Current GAAP \nprovides an exception to general recognition and measurement guidance for loan restructurings if they meet specific criteria to be \nconsidered TDRs. If a modification is a TDR, incremental expected losses are recorded in the allowance for credit losses upon \nmodification and specific disclosures are required. The new amendment eliminates the TDR recognition and measurement guidance and \nrequires the reporting entity to evaluate whether the modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan, consistent \nwith accounting for other loan modifications. The amendment also requires public business entities to disclose current-period gross \nwrite-offs by year of origination for certain financing receivables and net investments in leases. For entities that have adopted the \npreviously issued guidance amended by this update, which the Company did during the year ended December 31, 2020, this update is \neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is \npermitted for entities that have adopted the previously issued guidance amended by this update. The Company is in the process of \nevaluating the impact of this guidance. \nReclassifications \nCertain reclassifications have been made to the 2020 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2021 presentation. \nThese reclassifications had no effect on net loss reported. \nNOTE 3 - VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES \nThe Company has evaluated its loans, investments in unconsolidated entities, liabilities to subsidiary trusts issuing preferred \nsecurities (consisting of unsecured junior subordinated notes), securitizations, guarantees and other financial contracts in order to \ndetermine if they are variable interests in VIEs. The Company regularly monitors these legal interests and contracts and, to the extent it \nhas determined that it has a variable interest, analyzes the related entity for potential consolidation. \nConsolidated VIEs (the Company is the primary beneficiary) \nBased on management’s analysis, the Company was the primary beneficiary of five and seven VIEs at December 31, 2022 and \n2021, respectively (collectively, the “Consolidated VIEs”). \nThe Consolidated VIEs are CRE securitizations and CDOs that were formed on behalf of the Company to invest in real estate-\nrelated securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”), syndicated corporate loans and corporate bonds were financed by \nthe issuance of debt securities. By financing these assets with long-term borrowings through the issuance of debt securities, the Company \nseeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted equity returns and to match the term of its assets and liabilities. The primary beneficiary \ndetermination for each of these VIEs was made at each VIE’s inception and is continually assessed. \nIn April 2022, the Company contributed an initial investment of $13.0 million for a 72.1% interest in Charles Street-ACRES \nFSU Student Venture, LLC (the “FSU Student Venture”). The FSU Student Venture, a joint venture between the Company and two \nunrelated third parties, was formed for the purpose of developing a student housing project. The FSU Student Venture was determined \nnot to be a VIE as there was sufficient equity at risk, it does not have disproportionate voting rights and its members all have the \nfollowing characteristics: (1) the power to direct activities, (2) the obligation to absorb losses and (3) the right to receive residual returns. \nHowever, the Company consolidated the FSU Student Venture due to its 72.1% interest that provides the Company with unilateral"

The Company is entitled to receive payments of principal and interest on the debt securities it holds and, \nto the extent revenues exceed debt service requirements and other expenses of the securitizations, distributions with respect to its \npreferred equity interests. As a result of consolidation, the debt and equity interests the Company holds in these securitizations have \nbeen eliminated, and the Company’s consolidated balance sheets reflect the assets held, debt issued by the securitizations to third parties \nand any accrued payables to third parties. The Company’s operating results and cash flows include the gross amounts related to the \nsecuritizations’ assets and liabilities as opposed to the Company’s net economic interests in the securitizations. Assets and liabilities \nrelated to the securitizations are disclosed, in the aggregate, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

Accordingly, the \nfollowing VIEs are not consolidated in the Company’s financial statements at December 31, 2022. The Company continuously \nreassesses whether it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of its unconsolidated VIEs. The Company’s maximum exposure to risk \nfor each of these unconsolidated VIEs is set forth in the “Maximum Exposure to Loss” column in the table below. \nUnsecured Junior Subordinated Debentures \nThe Company has a 100% interest in the common shares of Resource Capital Trust I (“RCT I”) and RCC Trust II (“RCT II”), \nrespectively, with a value of $1.5 million in the aggregate, or 3.0% of each trust, at December 31, 2022. RCT I and RCT II were formed \nfor the purposes of providing debt financing to the Company. The Company completed a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is \nthe primary beneficiary of each of the trusts and determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of either trust because it does not \nhave the power to direct the activities most significant to the trusts, which include the collection of principal and interest through \nservicing rights. Accordingly, neither trust is consolidated into the Company’s consolidated financial statements."

At December 31, 2022, the Company had no loan principal paydowns receivable. \nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had $14.9 million of loan principal paydowns receivable, all of which was received by the \nCompany during January 2022. \nNOTE 7 - FINANCING RECEIVABLES \nThe following tables show the activity in the allowance for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in \nthousands): \n \n \n \nYears Ended December 31, \n \n \n \n2022 \n  \n2021 \n \nAllowance for credit losses at beginning of year \n $ \n8,805  $ \n34,310 \nProvision for (reversal of) credit losses \n  \n12,295   \n(21,262) \nCharge offs \n  \n(2,297)   \n(4,243) \nAllowance for credit losses at end of year \n $ \n18,803  $ \n8,805 \n \n \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, higher expected unemployment and increased volatility in CRE asset pricing and \nliquidity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted assumptions in the Company’s CECL estimates and resulted in \na net provision for credit losses of $30.8 million. However, the discovery and distribution of vaccines and other treatments for COVID-\n19 led to a recovery of the global economy and markets worldwide, which resulted in a net reversal of credit losses of $21.3 million \nduring the year ended December 31, 2021. The ensuing macroeconomic factors, including expected increases in inflation, short-term \ninterest rates that collateralize the Company's loans, energy prices and continued global supply chain dislocation trending negative, \ncompounded by an increase in portfolio credit risk indicated in property-level cash flows, resulted in a net provision of expected credit \nlosses of $12.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. \nIn addition to the Company’s general estimate of credit losses, the Company may also be required to individually evaluate \ncollateral-dependent loans for credit losses if it has determined that foreclosure or sale of the loan or the underlying collateral is probable. \nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, $4.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively, of the Company’s allowance for credit losses resulted \nfrom collateral-dependent loans that were individually evaluated for credit losses, details of which follow: \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company individually evaluated the following loans: \n \nOne office mezzanine loan in the Northeast region with a principal balance of $4.7 million. The Company fully reserved \nthis loan in the fourth quarter of 2022. \n \nOne retail loan in the Northeast region and one office loan in the Southwest region with principal balances of $8.0 million \nand $20.7 million, respectively, for which foreclosure was determined to be probable. Each loan had an as-is appraised \nvalue in excess of its principal and interest balances, and, as such, had no CECL allowance at December 31, 2022. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company individually evaluated the following loans: \n \nAn office loan in the East North Central region with a $19.9 million principal balance. The Company recorded a $2.3 million \nCECL allowance in the third quarter of 2021 to reflect the as-is appraised value of the property of $17.6 million. Upon \nreceipt of the property in full satisfaction of the loan in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company charged off the $2.3 million \nCECL allowance and recorded the property as a property held for sale on its consolidated balance sheets at its fair value of \n$17.6 million. (see Note 8)."

Upon sale of the loan in November 2021, the Company received proceeds of $7.6 million, net of \ncosts of sale, and charged off the remaining $1.7 million CECL allowance. \n \nA retail loan in the Pacific region with an $11.5 million principal balance. At December 31, 2021, the Company had a \nrecorded $2.3 million CECL allowance that reflected the loss taken on the loan as a result of a discounted payoff received \non the loan in January 2022 in full satisfaction of the loan. \n \nA hotel loan in the East North Central region with an $8.4 million principal balance. The Company received payment in full \non this loan in January 2022; and, as such, there was no CECL allowance recorded at December 31, 2021. \n \nA hotel loan in the Northeast region with a $14.0 million principal balance.

In \nNovember 2020, the Company received the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on the property. In conjunction with the receipt of \nthe deed, the Company obtained an updated appraisal that indicated an as-is appraised value of $39.8 million (see Note 8) \nand consequently reversed the then-outstanding $8.0 million CECL allowance and recorded the property as an investment \nin real estate on the consolidated balance sheets at its appraised value. \n \nA office loan in the East North Central region with a $19.9 million principal balance and a hotel loan in the Northeast region \nwith a $14.0 million par balance for which foreclosure was determined to be probable. The Company determined that these \nloans had CECL allowances of $1.9 million and $0, respectively, calculated as the difference between the as-is appraised \nvalues and the loans’ amortized costs. In September 2022, the Company sold the office property for $19.3 million with \nselling costs of $532,000, resulting in a gain on sale of $1.9 million. In February 2023, the Company sold the hotel property \nfor $15.1 million (see Note 8). \n \nIn June 2020, the Company sold one CRE whole loan note for $17.4 million, which resulted in a realized loss of $1.0 million \nrecorded in the provision for credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2020. \nCredit quality indicators \nCommercial Real Estate Loans \nCRE loans are collateralized by a diversified mix of real estate properties and are assessed for credit quality based on the \ncollective evaluation of several factors, including but not limited to: collateral performance relative to underwritten plan, time since \norigination, current implied and/or re-underwritten LTV ratios, loan structure and exit plan. Depending on the loan’s performance against \nthese various factors, loans are rated on a scale from 1 to 5, with loans rated 1 representing loans with the highest credit quality and \nloans rated 5 representing loans with the lowest credit quality. The factors evaluated provide general criteria to monitor credit migration \nin the Company’s loan portfolio; as such, a loan’s rating may improve or worsen, depending on new information received."

Performance criteria and loan covenants\nhave required occasional waivers. \n  \n  • Occupancy is not stabilized and the property has a large amount of tenancy rollover. \n  \n    \n5 \n  \n• Property performance is significantly worse than underwritten expectations. The loan is not in compliance with loan\ncovenants and performance criteria and may be in default. Expected sale proceeds would not be sufficient to pay off\nthe loan at maturity. \n  \n  • The property has a material vacancy rate and significant rollover of remaining tenants. \n  \n  • An updated appraisal is required upon designation and updated on an as-needed basis. \nAll CRE loans are evaluated for any credit deterioration by debt asset management and certain finance personnel on at least a \nquarterly basis. Mezzanine loans may experience greater credit risks due to their nature as subordinated investments. \nFor the purpose of calculating the quarterly provision for credit losses under CECL, the Company pools CRE loans based on \nthe underlying collateral property type and utilizes a probability of default and loss given default methodology for approximately one \nyear after which it immediately reverts to a historical mean loss ratio. \nCredit risk profiles of CRE loans at amortized cost were as follows (in thousands, except amounts in the footnote): \n \n \n \nRating 1   \nRating 2 \n  \nRating 3   \nRating 4   \nRating 5   \nTotal (1) \n \nAt December 31, 2022: \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nWhole loans, floating-rate \n $ \n—  $ 1,635,376   309,491  $ 85,226  $ 22,797  $ 2,052,890 \nMezzanine loan \n  \n—   \n—   \n—   \n—   \n4,700   \n4,700 \nTotal \n $ \n—  $ 1,635,376  $ 309,491  $ 85,226  $ 27,497  $ 2,057,590 \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAt December 31, 2021: \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \nWhole loans, floating-rate \n $ \n—  $ 1,456,330  $ 273,078  $ 123,762  $ 24,681  $ 1,877,851 \nMezzanine loan \n  \n—   \n—   \n—   \n4,700   \n—   \n4,700 \nTotal \n $ \n—  $ 1,456,330  $ 273,078  $ 128,462  $ 24,681  $ 1,882,551 \n(1) \nThe total amortized cost of CRE loans excluded accrued interest receivable of $11.9 million and $6.1 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively."

This \ntriggered substantial margin calls by the Company’s counterparties and, in certain cases, formal notices of events of default, all of which \nwere withdrawn or rescinded as of April 19, 2020. As a result of these circumstances and the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 \npandemic, substantially all the Company’s remaining CMBS available-for-sale were sold as of April 2020. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred losses of $186.4 million on its CMBS portfolio, including \nrealized losses of $180.3 million primarily attributable to the sale of 67 CMBS as of April 2020. The remaining unrealized losses of \n$6.1 million were recorded on two securities that previously had fair values below the amortized cost bases and which were expected to \nbe sold prior to their recoveries, with an offsetting charge directly to their amortized cost bases. In March 2021, the Company sold these \ntwo positions, resulting in cash proceeds of $3.0 million and gains of $878,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021.  \nThe Company had no remaining CMBS positions at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \nNOTE 11 - INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES \nThe Company’s investments in unconsolidated entities at December 31, 2022 and 2021 comprised a 100% interest in the \ncommon shares of RCT I and RCT II with a value of $1.5 million in the aggregate, or 3.0% of each trust.

During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded \ndividends from its investments in RCT I’s and RCT II’s common shares, reported in other revenue on the consolidated statements of \noperations, of $91,000, $65,000, and $76,000, respectively."

The asset-based revolving loan facility (the “MassMutual Facility”) \nprovided under the MassMutual Loan Agreement has been used to finance the Company’s core CRE lending business. The MassMutual \nFacility initially had an interest rate of 5.75% per annum payable monthly and matured on July 31, 2027. The Company paid a \ncommitment fee as well as other reasonable closing costs. The loans under the MassMutual Facility are available for drawing during the \nfirst two years of the MassMutual Facility (the “Availability Period”). During the Availability Period, an unused commitment fee of \n0.50% per annum (payable monthly) on unused commitments under the MassMutual Loan Agreement is payable for each day on which \nless than 75% of the total commitment is drawn. \nPursuant to the MassMutual Loan Agreement, the Borrower’s obligations under the MassMutual Loan Agreement are secured \nby the Borrower’s assets and Holdings’ equity interests in the Borrower, including all distributions, proceeds and profits from Holdings’ \ninterests in the Borrower. \nIn September 2020, the MassMutual Loan Agreement was amended pursuant to which (i) the initial portfolio assets were \nrevised and an agreed advance rate for each initial portfolio asset (each, an “Initial Portfolio Asset Advance Rate”) was set, and (ii) the \nrevolving loan facility under the MassMutual Loan Agreement was amended to require the initial lender (currently MassMutual) to \nprovide a specific advance rate for any future eligible portfolio assets and to limit the aggregate total amount of advances outstanding \nat any time to both the total facility amount and, in lieu of a 55% LTV, a borrowing base as of any required date of determination equal \nto the sum of, in each case, the product of the advance rate for such eligible portfolio asset (including in respect of the initial portfolio \nassets, the applicable Initial Portfolio Asset Advance Rate therefor) and the then determined value of such eligible portfolio asset. \nIn May 2021, the MassMutual Loan Agreement was amended pursuant to which (i) Mass Mutual consented to Borrower’s \nformation of certain subsidiaries to hold real estate and (ii) such subsidiaries agreed to entered into guaranty agreements in favor of the \nsecured parties under the MassMutual Loan Agreement.  \nIn connection with the MassMutual Loan Agreement, the Company entered into a Guaranty (the “MassMutual Guaranty”) \namong the Company, Exantas Real Estate Funding 2018-RSO6 Investor, LLC (“RSO6”), Exantas Real Estate Funding 2019-RSO7 \nInvestor, LLC (“RSO7”) and Exantas Real Estate Funding 2020-RSO8 Investor, LLC (“RSO8”), each an indirect, wholly owned \nsubsidiary of the Company, in favor of the secured parties under the MassMutual Loan Agreement.

Pursuant to the MassMutual Guaranty, the Company fully guaranteed all payments and performance \nof Holdings and the Borrower under the MassMutual Loan Agreement. Additionally, the Company, and previously RSO6, RSO7 and \nRSO8, made certain representations and warranties and agreed to not incur debt or liens, each subject to certain exceptions, and agreed \nto provide the Lenders with certain information. \nThe MassMutual Loan Agreement contained events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods, \ncustomary for this type of financing arrangement. The remedies for such events of default are also customary for this type of transaction. \nThe MassMutual Loan Agreement was further amended in several instances pursuant to which (i) MassMutual consented to \nthe formation of certain subsidiaries to hold real estate and (ii) such subsidiaries agreed to enter into guaranty agreements in favor of the \nsecured parties under the MassMutual Loan Agreement. \nIn July 2022, Holdings, the Borrower and the Lenders entered into the Fifth Amendment to the MassMutual Loan Agreement \n(the “July 2022 Amendment”) to (i) extend the availability period from July 31, 2022 to August 31, 2022 and (ii) amend the interest rate \non the outstanding principal amount of the borrowings, with respect to borrowings made in connection with eligible portfolio assets \ntransferred to any borrower after the effective date of the July 2022 Amendment to the rate per annum determined by the initial lender \nor otherwise 5.75% per annum. In August 2022, Holdings, the Borrower and the Lenders entered into the Sixth Amendment to the \nMassMutual Loan Agreement to extend the availability period from August 31, 2022 to October 15, 2022.   \nIn December 2022, Holdings, the Borrower and the Lenders entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Servicing \nAgreement, which amends and restates the existing loan and servicing agreement, and reflects a senior secured term loan facility, not to \nexceed $500.0 million, composed of individual loan series issued upon mutual agreement of the Borrower and Lenders. Each loan series \nwill be available for three months after the closing date agreed upon by the Borrower and Lender (“Commitment Period”), subject to \nthe maximum dollar amount agreed upon for that series.

In addition, the \nCompany must distribute 100% of its taxable income in order to not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on retained income. \nThe Company anticipates it will distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its stockholders. Because taxable income differs \nfrom cash flow from operations due to non-cash revenues or expenses (such as provisions for loan and lease losses and depreciation) \nand tax loss carryforwards, in certain circumstances the Company may generate operating cash flow in excess of its distributions or, \nalternatively, may be required to borrow funds to make sufficient distribution payments. \nThe Company’s 2023 distributions are, and will be, determined by the Company’s Board, which will also consider the \ncomposition of any distributions declared, including the option of paying a portion in cash and the balance in additional shares of \ncommon stock. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not pay any common share distributions."

Under the \nManagement Agreement, “equity” is equal to the net proceeds from issuances of shares of capital stock (or the value of \ncommon shares upon the conversion of convertible securities), after deducting any underwriting discounts and \ncommissions and other expenses and costs relating to such issuance, plus or minus the Company’s retained earnings \n(excluding non-cash equity compensation incurred in current or prior periods) less all amounts the Company has paid for \ncommon stock and preferred stock repurchases. The calculation is adjusted for one-time events due to changes in GAAP, \nas well as other non-cash charges, upon approval of the Company’s independent directors."

Par values of loans with variable interest rates are expected to approximate fair value unless evidence of credit \ndeterioration exists, in which case the fair value approximates the par value less the loan’s allowance estimated through individual \nevaluation. Fair values of loans with fixed rates are calculated using the net present values of future cash flows, discounted at market \nrates.

These changes in market conditions may adversely impact \nthe Company’s financial performance and are referred to as “market risks.” When deemed appropriate, the Company used derivatives \nas a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company \nthrough the use of derivative instruments were interest rate risk and market price risk. \nThe Company also historically managed its interest rate risk with interest rate swaps. Interest rate swaps are contracts between \ntwo parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. \nThe Company seeks to manage the extent to which net income changes as a function of changes in interest rates by matching \nadjustable-rate assets with variable-rate borrowings. \nThe Company classified its interest rate swap contracts as cash flow hedges, which are hedges that eliminate the risk of changes \nin the cash flows of a financial asset or liability.  \nThe Company terminated all of its interest rate swap positions associated with its financed CMBS portfolio in April 2020. At \ntermination, the Company realized a loss of $11.8 million. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had losses of $6.6 million \nand $8.5 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which will be amortized into earnings over the \nremaining life of the debt. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded amortization expense, \nreported in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations, of $1.8 million, $1.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively. \nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had an unrealized gain of $256,000 and $347,000, respectively, attributable to \ntwo terminated interest rate swaps in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets, to be accreted into \nearnings over the remaining life of the debt. The Company recorded accretion income, reported in interest expense on the consolidated \nstatements of operations, of $91,000, $91,000 and $92,000 into earnings during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, \nrespectively.  \nThe Company’s prior origination of fixed-rate CRE whole loans exposed it to market pricing risk in connection with the \nfluctuations of market interest rates. As market interest rates increase or decrease, the fair value of the fixed-rate CRE whole loans will \ndecrease or increase accordingly. In order to mitigate this market price risk, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts in \nwhich it pays a fixed rate of interest in exchange for a variable rate of interest, usually three-month LIBOR. Unrealized gains and losses \non the value of these swap contracts were recorded in other income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. In December \n2020, these interest rate swap contracts were terminated. \nThe following table presents the effect of the derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of operations during the \nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: \n \n \n  \n \nRealized and Unrealized Gain (Loss) (1) \n \n \n \nConsolidated Statements of Operations Location \n \nYear Ended \nDecember 31, \n2022 \n \nYear Ended \nDecember 31, \n2021 \n \nYear Ended \nDecember 31, \n2020 \n \nInterest rate swap contracts, \nhedging \n \nInterest expense \n $ \n(1,733) $ \n(1,851) $ \n(1,562) \nInterest rate swap contracts \n Other (expense) income \n $ \n— $ \n— $ \n(10) \n \n(1) \nNegative values indicate a decrease to the associated consolidated statements of operations line items."

Due to changes in management’s focus regarding the non-core asset classes, the Company determined that \nit no longer expected to have sufficient forecasted taxable income to completely realize the tax benefits of the deferred tax assets at \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. Therefore, a full valuation allowance with a tax effected expense of $21.2 million and $21.4 million has \nbeen recorded against the deferred tax asset at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Management will continue to assess its \nestimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that the Company will be able to utilize. \nThe Company is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for calendar years including and subsequent to 2019, \nand is subject to examination by state and local jurisdictions for calendar years including and subsequent to 2019."

In addition, the Company may enter into settlements on certain matters \nin order to avoid the additional costs of engaging in litigation. Except as discussed below, the Company is unaware of any contingencies \narising from such litigation that would require accrual or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2022. \nPrimary Capital Mortgage, LLC (“PCM”) is subject to potential litigation related to claims for repurchases or indemnifications \non loans that PCM has sold to third parties. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, no such litigation demand was outstanding. Reserves for \nsuch potential litigation demands are included in the reserve for mortgage repurchases and indemnifications that totaled $1.2 million \nand $1.3 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The reserves for mortgage repurchases and indemnifications are included \nin liabilities held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets.  \nThe Company did not have any general litigation reserve at December 31, 2022 or 2021. \nOther Contingencies \nAs part of the May 2017 sale of its equity interest in Pearlmark Mezzanine Realty Partners IV, L.P., the Company entered into \nan indemnification agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to indemnify the purchaser against realized losses of up to $4.3 \nmillion on one mezzanine loan until its final maturity date in 2020. As a result of the indemnified party’s partial sale of the mezzanine \nloan, the maximum exposure was reduced to $536,000 in 2019. In October 2020, the mezzanine loan paid off its balance to the \nindemnified party, resulting in the extinguishment of the Company’s liability."

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) \nDECEMBER 31, 2022 \n \n138 \nPCM is subject to additional claims for repurchases or indemnifications on loans that PCM has sold to investors. At \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, outstanding demands for indemnification, repurchase or make whole payments totaled $3.3 million. The \nCompany’s estimated exposure for such outstanding claims, as well as unasserted claims, is included in its reserve for mortgage \nrepurchases and indemnifications. \nOther Guarantees \nIn January 2023, Chapel Drive East, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the FSU Student Venture, entered into a loan \nagreement (the \"Construction Loan Agreement\") with Oceanview Life and Annuity Company (\"Oceanview\") to finance the construction \nof a student housing complex (the \"Construction Loan\").  \nIn connection with the Company's investment in the student housing complex, ACRES RF entered into guarantees related to \nthe Construction Loan. Pursuant to the guarantees, Jason Pollack, Frank Dellaglio and ACRES RF (collectively, the \"Guarantors\"), for \nthe benefit of Oceanview, provided limited \"bad boy\" guaranties to Oceanview pursuant to the Construction Loan Agreement until the \nearlier of the payment in full of the indebtedness or the date of a sale of the property pursuant to a foreclosure of the mortgage or deed \nor other transfer in lieu of foreclosure is accepted by Oceanview. The Guarantors also entered into a Completion Guaranty Agreement \nfor the benefit of Oceanview to guaranty the timely completion of the project in accordance with the Construction Loan Agreement, as \nwell as a Carry Guaranty Agreement, for the benefit of Oceanview to guaranty and unconditional payment by Chapel Drive East, LLC \nof all customary or necessary costs and expenses incurred in connection with the operation, maintenance and management of the property \nand an Environmental Indemnity Agreement jointly and severally in favor of Oceanview whereby the Guarantors serving as Indemnitors \nprovided environmental representations and warranties, covenants and indemnifications (collectively the \"Guaranties\"). The Guaranties \ninclude certain financial covenants required of ACRES RF, including required net worth and liquidity requirements. \nUnfunded Commitments \nUnfunded commitments on the Company’s originated CRE loans generally fall into two categories: (1) pre-approved capital \nimprovement projects; and (2) new or additional construction costs subject, in each case, to the borrower meeting specified criteria. \nUpon completion of the improvements or construction, the Company would receive additional interest income on the advanced amount. \nWhole loans had $158.2 million and $157.6 million in unfunded loan commitments at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \nPreferred equity investments had $2.5 million in unfunded investment commitments at December 31, 2020 and were paid off during the \nyear ended December 31, 2021. \nNOTE 25 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS \nThe Company has evaluated subsequent events through the filing of this report and determined that, except for the subsequent \nevents referred to in Note 7, Note 8, Note 12 and Note 24, there have not been any events that have occurred that would require \nadjustments to or disclosures in the consolidated financial statements."

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \nDisclosure Controls and Procedures \nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the \ntime periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and \ncommunicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow \ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management \nrecognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of \nachieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-\nbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. \nUnder the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have carried out an evaluation of the \neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, \nour Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the \nreasonable assurance level. \nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined \nin Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting \nmay not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that \ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \ndeteriorate. \nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022. In making this \nassessment, management used the criteria set forth in the 2013 version of the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the \nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based upon this assessment, management concluded that our \ninternal control over financial reporting is effective at December 31, 2022. \nOur independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP, audited our internal control over financial reporting \nat December 31, 2022. Their report, dated March 7, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on our internal control over financial \nreporting. This report is included in this Item 9A. \nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have \nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting."

(a Maryland corporation) and \nsubsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated \nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the \nCompany maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on \ncriteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), \nthe consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, and our report dated March 7, \n2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. \nBasis for opinion \nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of \nthe effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control \nover Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based \non our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company \nin accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission \nand the PCAOB.  \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to \nobtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness \nexists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such \nother procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of \nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the \nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the \ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in \naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in \naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention \nor timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the \nfinancial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections \nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in \nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP \n \n \nSan Francisco, California \nMarch 7, 2023"
