      "text": "Table of Contents\n- 8 -\nPART I\nItem 1. Business\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company utilizing our differentiated platform primarily to discover and\ndevelop novel antibody-based therapeutics to treat a range of solid tumor types. While more traditional oncology drug\ndiscovery approaches attempt to generate antibodies against known targets, our approach relies on the human immune\nsystem to direct us to unique antibody-target pairs from patients experiencing a clinically meaningful, active immune\nresponse against their tumors. These unique antibody-target pairs represent a potentially novel and previously unexplored\nlandscape of oncology targets. We believe the fact that our approach has the potential to deliver novel, previously\nunexplored oncology targets provides us with a significant competitive advantage over traditional approaches, which focus\non known targets that many companies are aware of and can pursue. We have utilized our drug discovery approach to\nidentify over 2,000 distinct human antibodies that bind preferentially to tumor tissue from patients who are not the source\nof the antibody.\nOur most advanced product candidate, ATRC-101, is a monoclonal antibody with a novel mechanism of action\nand target derived from an antibody identified using our discovery platform. ATRC-101 reacts in vitro with a majority of\nhuman ovarian, non-small cell lung, colorectal and breast cancer samples from multiple patients. It has demonstrated\nrobust anti-tumor activity as a single agent in multiple preclinical models, including one model in which PD-1 checkpoint\ninhibitors typically display limited activity. In 2020, we commenced clinical development of ATRC-101 with a Phase 1b\nclinical trial evaluating ATRC-101 as a monotherapy in patients with select solid tumors which is ongoing, and in 2021 we\nexpanded clinical development by opening a new cohort to evaluate ATRC-101 in combination with pembrolizumab, a PD-\n1 checkpoint inhibitor. In 2022, we began limiting enrollment of subjects in our clinical trials to those with biopsies\npositive for the target of ATRC-101 as determined by a CAP-CLIA certified assay. To date, ATRC-101 continues to be well\ntolerated, and we have observed longer progression free survival in patients with high target expression in this study.\nEnrollment in both cohorts is ongoing, and 69 participants have been enrolled and dosed as of December 31, 2022. We\nexpect additional data from both cohorts over the course of 2023, and we expect to make potential Phase 2 development\ndecisions in late 2023.\nOur efforts beyond ATRC-101 are focused on expanding our clinical pipeline by advancing additional product\ncandidates using our discovery platform. We expect the focus of our pre-clinical development efforts will be on lead-stage\noncology programs, including APN-497444, an ADC against a novel tumor glycan target, and APN-346958, a CD3\nbispecific T-cell engager against an RNA-binding protein target. We continue to aim for one additional IND per year in\noncology with our next IND targeted in late 2024. In addition, we continue to develop our platform capabilities and to\nexpand the weaponization technologies we have access to so that we can combine the novel antibodies that are generated\nby our platform with these antibody weaponization technologies to generate clinical candidates. In February 2023, we\nannounced the first joint program, mutually selected with Xencor, Inc., or Xencor, for advancement under our existing\nstrategic collaboration, combining an Atreca-discovered antibody with Xencor’s XmAb® bispecific Fc domain and a\ncytotoxic T-cell binding domain or CD3. The joint program is based on APN-346958, an Atreca-discovered antibody.\nAPN-346958 recognizes an RNA-binding protein that is normally sequestered in the nucleus but is mislocalized to the cell\nsurface in tumors. In preclinical studies, the XmAb bispecific antibody engineered against APN-346958’s target has\ndemonstrated compelling anti-tumor activity and robust immune activation as evidenced by an increase in IFN gamma\nlevels in plasma, and expansion of CD8+ T cells in the blood. Atreca and Xencor targeted to name a candidate from the\nprogram later in 2023, and Atreca targets an IND submission by early 2025.\nIn April 2022, we provided an update on our preclinical pipeline in oncology, and we announced our next clinical\ncandidate, ATRC-301. ATRC-301 is an antibody drug conjugate, or ADC, that selectively targets a novel, membrane-\nproximal epitope on erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor A2, or EphA2. We initiated IND-enabling studies for\nATRC-301, including a non-human primate toxicology study in September 2022. In November 2022, we announced that\nthis study revealed safety signals, including bleeding, and as a result, we discontinued the development of ATRC-301. We\ncontinue to evaluate our anti-EphA2 antibodies in multiple weaponized formats."

      "text": "Table of Contents\n- 9 -\nBeyond oncology, in October 2021, we entered into a licensing agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical\nResearch Institute or Gates MRI to allow Gates MRI to develop and commercialize MAM01/ATRC-501 for the prevention\nof malaria in GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, eligible countries located in malaria-endemic regions of the world, to advance its\ncharitable purposes. MAM01/ATRC-501 is an engineered version of an antibody that we discovered using our platform\nthat targets the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum, the protozoan that causes the deadliest form of\nmalaria. In November 2022, we announced that an IND for MAM01/ATRC-501 is expected to be filed by Gates MRI in\nthe first half of 2023, and that Gates MRI expects to commence clinical development by the second half of 2023. We retain\ncommercial rights in the U.S., Europe and parts of Asia, and potential product development opportunities in those regions\ninclude prevention of malaria for those traveling to malaria endemic regions.\nOur Strategy\nOur goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company by utilizing our differentiated platform to discover\nand develop antibody-based therapeutics against novel targets. In pursuit of that strategy, we intend to:\n◾Rapidly advance our most advanced product candidate, ATRC-101, through clinical trials in multiple\ntypes of solid tumors. ATRC-101 is the first candidate identified using our discovery platform that has\nadvanced into a clinical trial. ATRC-101 displays broad reactivity across a variety of human solid tumor\nsamples and has demonstrated potent single-agent anti-tumor activity in preclinical models via a unique\nmechanism of action, which we term Driver Antigen Engagement. In February 2020, we commenced clinical\nstudies to evaluate ATRC-101 in a monotherapy setting and in September 2021 we opened a new cohort to\nevaluate ATRC-101 in combination with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor. In 2022, we began limiting enrollment of\nsubjects in our clinical trials to those with biopsies positive for the target of ATRC-101 as determined by a\nCAP-CLIA certified assay. To date, ATRC-101 continues to be well tolerated, and we have observed longer\nprogression free survival in patients with high target expression in this study. We may also evaluate this\ncandidate in combination with other agents in one or more solid tumors in the future.\n◾Continue efforts to develop a pipeline of antibody-based product candidates for oncology. While our only\nproduct candidate that is currently in clinical development is ATRC-101, we have utilized our differentiated\ndrug discovery approach to identify over 2,000 distinct human antibodies targeting human tumors that can\npotentially provide the basis for additional product candidates. Our ongoing efforts are focused on identifying,\nanalyzing and refining antibodies to generate clinical candidates that take advantage of various mechanisms of\naction and novel targets. We engineer some of our antibodies into various drug formats, such as ADCs and T-\ncell engaging bispecific antibodies, to drive anti-tumor activity. We intend to build out a proprietary pipeline of\nproduct candidates addressing large populations of patients across a range of solid tumors. We currently own\nworldwide rights to the oncology product candidates derived from our platform. Product candidates developed\npursuant to activities undertaken with our collaborators may be subject to certain collaborator rights.\n◾Selectively enter into collaborations to enhance and expand our product pipeline as well as our drug\ndevelopment capabilities. We believe that the single agent anti-tumor activity of many of the antibodies\ndiscovered using our platform could be enhanced by incorporating potential collaborator technologies. We\nintend to continue to selectively form collaborations with partners to gain access to complementary\ntechnologies and expertise in order to develop product candidates with increased potential for anti-tumor\nactivity.\n◾Continue to invest in our discovery platform to further enhance our ability to identify novel antibodies\nand to generate clinical candidates from our growing hit library. A key pillar of our discovery platform is\nour proprietary sample repository, which includes over 1,800 blood-derived samples sourced from over 500\npatients representing over 30 different types of solid tumors. We plan to expand the scope of our repository and\nenhance other portions of our platform in order to maintain our leadership position in the discovery of novel\ntargets including hematologic malignancies, non-autologous tumor tissue and antibodies that bind to them. We\nalso plan to continue to enhance our capabilities to translate these proprietary findings into product candidates\nsuch as through further expansion of our target identification capabilities.\n◾Selectively enter into drug discovery partnerships with other life sciences companies to leverage the\nbreadth and scale of our discovery platform. Our discovery platform has been optimized to allow us to\noperate effectively at scale, and by entering into discovery collaborations with larger pharma and biotech"

Given the significant need in oncology for novel targets,\nand antibodies that target them as potential therapeutics, leveraging our platform in this manner can be an\nefficient way to help support the capital requirements of the platform both for our internal use as well as for the\nneeds of our potential partners.   \n◾Continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio to further protect our discovery platform and the\nnovel product candidates it may generate. The intellectual property surrounding our platform consists of\npatents and patent applications, trade secrets and know-how, and we plan to expand our intellectual property as\nwe continue to develop our platform. We also intend to protect our product candidates by pursuing\ncomposition-of-matter and method-of-use patents typical for antibody-based therapeutics. Furthermore, as our\nplatform identifies novel antibody-target pairs in which a human antibody may bind to a previously\nunderappreciated target in a useful manner, we plan to pursue additional intellectual property supporting our\ncandidates deriving from their interactions with targets.\nThe Atreca Drug Discovery Platform\nWe believe we may be able to address certain key limitations of the current oncology drug discovery paradigm by\nfocusing on the common phenomenon driving clinical responses in cancer immunotherapy—an active human anti-tumor\nimmune response. Our platform allows us to interrogate an active B cell response within an individual cancer patient to\nidentify novel and relevant antibodies and their targets, which may enable us to develop antibody-based product candidates\nto treat large populations of patients with solid tumors. We believe that the significant time and capital invested in\ndeveloping, refining and applying our differentiated discovery platform have provided us with significant first-mover\nadvantages and created barriers to entry.\nFor example, establishing our non-interventional clinical studies to obtain patient samples, enabling longitudinal\nanalyses, required approximately 1 to 2 years per study. We have built our bioinformatics expertise in assembling and\nanalyzing our antibodies over nine years of operations. Our hit antibody generation process has been enhanced to deliver\nhits at a high rate, has already generated over 2,000 hit antibodies and is supported by a growing intellectual property\nportfolio. Additionally, our investments of capital and time to build industrialized wet-lab and supporting bioinformatics\ncapacity across our platform, including the time required to identify and hire very qualified personnel, were substantial.\nOur discovery process begins by gathering blood samples, mostly through company-sponsored non-interventional\nclinical studies, from cancer patients before, during and after they undergo treatment, which can induce an active anti-\ntumor immune response. Through this process, we have built a broad repository of over 1,800 samples from over 500\ndonors, representing over 30 different solid tumor types. We then examine these samples for rare antibody-producing B\ncells called plasmablasts that are normally elevated during an active immune response. We believe that these human\nimmune responses, which often occur over an extended period of time, generate antibodies accessible with our platform\nthat would be difficult to obtain through shorter term, non-human immunization or in vitro strategies.\nFrom the plasmablasts in a particular sample, we then employ a multi-step process to generate a potential product\ncandidate. We start by isolating single plasmablasts and determining the sequences of the co-expressed antibody genes\nusing our proprietary Immune Repertoire Capture® technology. We analyze these sequences to select antibodies, which we\nsynthesize as recombinant proteins. We then test these antibodies to identify those that bind to tumor tissue from patients\nwho are not the source of the antibody, referred to as non-autologous tumor tissue, preferentially over normal tissue. We\nthen analyze these \"hit\" antibodies using a number of in vitro and in vivo assays, and often make structural changes to\ngenerate leads. A select number of these leads are refined further using protein engineering to enhance their drug-like\nproperties as we identify and characterize their targets in parallel prior to initiating preclinical development and IND-\nenabling studies."

We instead allow the human immune system to direct our efforts. We believe this\napproach provides us access to a broad underexploited antibody and drug target space. Our approach may lead us to\nantibodies that are unlikely to have arisen via more traditional approaches with targets or epitopes that otherwise may not\nhave been discoverable. We believe our approach and discovery platform provide us with the ability to:\n◾Generate antibodies made by the human immune system.\n◾Deliver potentially useful antibodies at a high rate and in a scalable fashion.\n◾Access a potentially large and underexploited tumor target space.\n◾Identify antibodies useful for targeting tumor tissue and their targets.\n◾Generate candidates that attack tumor tissue.\n◾Develop potential treatments for large populations of patients across multiple tumor types.\nPipeline Programs\nATRC-101\nATRC-101 is a monoclonal antibody derived from an antibody identified using our discovery platform in the\nactive immune response of a patient. We believe that ATRC-101 may have broad potential as an immunotherapeutic agent\nin a range of solid tumors. ATRC-101 reacts in vitro with a majority of human ovarian, non-small cell lung, colorectal and\nbreast cancer samples from multiple patients. It has also demonstrated robust anti-tumor activity as a single agent in\nmultiple preclinical syngeneic tumor models, including one model in which PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors typically display\nlimited activity. ATRC-101 has also demonstrated preclinical activity in combination with other immunotherapeutics,\nincluding PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, and we have demonstrated that certain chemotherapeutic agents can drive expression\nof the target of ATRC-101 in a variety of solid tumors. Both the mechanism of action of ATRC-101, which we refer to as\nDriver Antigen Engagement, and its target appear unlike those of other anti-tumor antibodies that have been or are\ncurrently in clinical development. In histology studies, we did not observe binding above background levels across a range\nof normal human tissues. Additionally, in repeat-dose safety studies in both mice and non-human primates, we did not\nobserve a safety signal. We have identified the target of ATRC-101 as a ribonucleoprotein, or RNP, complex, containing\nRNA and a number of RNA binding proteins, to which ATRC-101 binds via a tumor-specific epitope.\nWe believe the mechanism of action of ATRC-101 involves systemic delivery of an agent targeting a RNP, which\ncauses remodeling of the tumor microenvironment and the destruction of tumor cells via activating first the innate immune\nsystem, which then leads to an adaptive immune response that targets tumor tissue. While we believe that this mechanism\nis novel for a candidate therapeutic in oncology, the mechanism is known to drive immune responses in humans in\nautoimmune and infectious disease. With our knowledge of the target of ATRC-101, we believe other targets may exist that\nare capable of driving such activity when bound by an antibody.\nWe launched an open-label dose escalation monotherapy trial in patients with solid tumors in early 2020 and\nadvanced into monotherapy expansion cohorts in 2021 based on the activity and safety profile we observed in the dose\nescalation portion of the study. We also opened a new cohort in late 2021 to evaluate ATRC-101 in combination with a PD-\n1 checkpoint inhibitor and we may explore ATRC-101 in combination with other agents as well, including with potentially\nselect chemotherapeutics. In 2022, we began limiting enrollment of subjects in our clinical trials to those with biopsies\npositive for the target of ATRC-101 as determined by a CAP-CLIA certified assay. To date, ATRC-101 continues to be well\ntolerated, and we have observed longer progression free survival in patients with high target expression in this study.\nATRC-101 demonstrates the ability of our platform to generate antibody candidates with novel targets and mechanisms of\naction.\nWe own worldwide rights to ATRC-101. We have filed multiple U.S. provisional patent applications relating to\nATRC-101 and its variants. In February 2020, we filed a nonprovisional patent application in the U.S., an international"

We have\nentered into a licensing agreement with the Gates MRI for the development and commercialization of MAM01/ATRC-501\nfor the prevention of malaria. Under the agreement, Gates MRI will lead the development of MAM01/ATRC-501 and\nreceive commercial rights in GAVI-eligible countries located in malaria-endemic regions of the world, while Atreca will\nretain commercial rights in the U.S., Europe and parts of Asia. Potential product development opportunities for Atreca\ninclude developing MAM01/ATRC-501 for prevention of malaria for those traveling to regions where the infection may be\ncirculating.\nIn support of our efforts to improve the potency of MAM01/ATRC-501, in October 2022, we entered into the\nGrant Agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation under which we were awarded a grant totaling up to $1.2\nmillion for our continued work on the malaria program.\nWeaponization Approaches\nThe adaptive immune response against tumor tissue in a patient, from which our platform identifies hit antibodies,\ngenerates antibodies that often recognize tumor tissue, but not necessarily those, delivered as a monoclonal, that can cause\npotent tumor cell killing via binding of these “naked” antibodies to their targets. In order to drive tumor cell killing using\ntumor-targeting antibodies, such antibodies can be “weaponized” to include additional protein domains or small molecules\nthat engage both immunotherapeutic and other mechanisms. Two such weaponization approaches that we are pursuing are\nbuilding T cell engagers and ADCs.\nT cell engagers\nOur hit antibodies are defined by their ability to react with non-autologous tumor tissue preferentially over normal\nadjacent tissue. In principle, therefore, their Fv regions can be used to direct cells of the immune system, such as T cells, to\ntumor cells. Furthermore, if the T cells can be activated when they are brought to the tumor cell, then tumor cell killing can\noccur. This \"T cell engagement\" is a well-validated approach utilized in both approved and clinical stage products. In this\napproach, tumor-targeting domains derived from antibodies are linked to protein domains that typically bind to a particular\nprotein (e.g., CD3 or CD137/4-1BB) on the surface of T cells, both bringing the T cell to the tumor cell while\nsimultaneously activating it. These antibody-derived biologics are sometimes termed \"bispecific\", in that they are capable\nof binding to two different targets: the tumor target and the T cell target.\nWe are pursuing the discovery and development of bispecifics using our proprietary collection of novel tumor-\ntargeting antibodies. To screen for the potential utility of an antibody-target pair, we first use antibody sequence \ninformation to create a bispecific T cell engager in one or more formats. We then test this bispecific for activity in vitro in \nindustry-standard assays for T cell dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or TDCC. In these assays, primary human T cells \nisolated from a patient blood sample are co-incubated with tumor cells. The bispecific, in which the antibody-derived \nportion from our hit library is known to interact with the tumor cell, is added into the assay, and tumor cell killing is \nassessed over time. In this assay, a number of our hit antibodies converted into bispecifics display significant tumor cell \nkilling activity.  \nIn July 2020, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Xencor to research, develop and\ncommercialize novel CD3 bispecific antibodies as potential therapeutics in oncology. This agreement calls for a three-year\nresearch program in which we will provide antibodies against novel tumor targets through our discovery platform from\nwhich Xencor. will engineer XmAb bispecific antibodies that also bind to the CD3 receptor on T cells.\nIn February 2023, we announced the first joint program, mutually selected with Xencor under our existing\nstrategic collaboration, combining an Atreca-discovered antibody with Xencor’s XmAb® bispecific Fc domain and a"

APN-\n346958 recognizes an RNA-binding protein that is normally sequestered in the nucleus but is mislocalized to the cell\nsurface in tumors. In preclinical studies, the XmAb bispecific antibody engineered against APN-346958’s target has\ndemonstrated compelling anti-tumor activity and robust immune activation as evidenced by an increase in IFN gamma\nlevels in plasma, and expansion of CD8+ T cells in the blood. Atreca and Xencor expect to name a candidate from the\nprogram later this year and Atreca target an IND submission no later than early 2025.\nIn the future, we also may selectively pursue additional partnerships to access additional bispecific formats,\ntechnologies and know-how in order to discover and develop T cell engagers based on novel antibody-target pairs\ndiscovered using our platform.\nAntibody-drug conjugates\nCellular toxins can be conjugated to certain antibodies to generate cytotoxicity against tumor cells expressing their\ntargets. Such ADCs require antibodies that internalize upon binding to their target. Once antibodies internalize, they also\nmust be delivered to an intracellular compartment suitable for release of the toxin into the cell.\nWe have established in vitro assays to assess first whether our hit antibodies can internalize once they bind to their\ntargets on tumor cells, and if they internalize, then whether they can deliver a toxin to an internal compartment such that\nthe toxin is released to kill the cells. Our second assay measures cytotoxicity as driven by release of toxin bound to an\ninternalized antibody (a cytotoxic payload). In this assay, internalizing hit antibodies are pre-incubated with a second\nantibody that is both capable of binding the internalizing antibody and has a conjugated cytotoxin. The pre-incubated\nantibody mixture is then incubated with tumor cells for a period of time, and cell killing is measured.\nOur ADC strategy includes pursuing partnerships to access technologies and know-how to discover and develop\nproduct candidates with an ADC mechanism of action based on novel antibody-target pairs discovered using our platform.\nIn April 2022 we announced we had entered into a License Agreement with Zymeworks Inc., or Zymeworks, which\nprovided a two year research term for us to utilize their ZymeLink™ technology to develop novel ADCs. In addition, we\nannounced our next clinical candidate, ATRC-301 which was an ADC utilizing the ZymeLink technology that selectively\ntargets a novel, membrane-proximal epitope on erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor A2, or EphA2. We\ninitiated IND-enabling studies for ATRC-301, including a non-human primate toxicology study in September 2022. In\nNovember 2022, we announced that this study revealed safety signals, including bleeding, and as a result, we discontinued\nthe development of ATRC-301. As a result, we are only evaluating our anti-EphA2 antibodies in other weaponized\nformats; however, we continue to evaluate many of our antibodies in an ADC format, including APN-497444, which is\nbeing evaluated as an ADC against a novel tumor glycan target.\nManufacturing\nWe use a third-party manufacturer to produce our antibodies and reagents for use in preclinical assessment of\nproduct candidates. We do not have, and we do not currently plan to acquire or develop, the infrastructure, facilities or\ncapabilities to manufacture current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, bulk drug substance or filled drug product for\nuse in human clinical trials. We intend to continue to utilize third-party manufacturers such as contract development\nmanufacturing organizations, or CDMOs, to produce, test and release cGMP bulk drug substance and drug product for our\nplanned clinical trials. We expect to continue to rely on such third parties to manufacture clinical trial material for the\nforeseeable future. We currently have a service agreement with a CDMO to develop and manufacture material in support of\nour Phase 1b clinical studies, and engaged with additional CDMOs as potential suppliers to ensure sufficient clinical\nmaterial for our existing trials and provides a path to generate the required manufacturing information that is part of a BLA\nand initial commercial supplies.\nOur current and expected future contractual CDMOs have a long, successful track record of manufacturing\nproducts for other companies under cGMP compliance and have previously been inspected by regulatory authorities for\ncompliance with cGMP standards."

In addition, these companies compete with us in recruiting scientific and\nmanagerial talent. Our success will partially depend on our ability to obtain, maintain, enforce and defend patents and other\nintellectual property rights with respect to antibodies that are safer and more effective than competing products. Our\ncommercial opportunity and success will be reduced or eliminated if competing products that are safer, more effective, or\nless expensive than the antibodies we develop are or become available.\nWe expect to compete with antibody, biologics and other therapeutic platforms and development companies who\nare also pursuing a similar discovery approach, including, but not limited to, companies such as Adaptive Biotechnologies\nCorporation, Neurimmune Holding AG, OncoResponse, Inc., Immunome, Inc., and Vir Biotechnology, Inc.

These laws and\ntheir corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, clinical trial, testing,\nmanufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other\npromotional practices involving biological products. FDA approval must be obtained before the marketing of biological\nproducts. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state,\nlocal and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.\nThe process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally\ninvolves the following:\n◾completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP,\nand applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;\n◾submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials\nmay begin;\n◾approval of the protocol and related documentation by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or\nethics committee at each clinical trial site before each study may be initiated;\n◾performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA's regulations\ncommonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection\nof human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed\nbiological product for its intended use;\n◾submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes\nsubstantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;\n◾payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA (unless a fee waiver applies);\n◾a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA whether or not to accept the filing for\nreview;\n◾satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological\nproduct is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, to assure"

Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product biological\ncharacteristics, chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of\nthe product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements\nincluding GLP.\nThe clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information,\nanalytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND.\nSome preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND is a request for authorization from the\nFDA to ship an unapproved, investigational product in interstate commerce and to administer it to humans and must\nbecome effective before clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the\nFDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND\nsponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA also may impose\nclinical holds or partial clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to,\namong other considerations, unreasonable and significant safety risk, inability to assess safety risk, lack of qualified\ninvestigators, a misleading or materially incomplete investigator brochure, or study design deficiencies. If the FDA\nimposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by\nthe FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin,\nor that, once begun, issues or circumstances will not arise that delay, suspend or terminate such studies.\nClinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients\nunder the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor's control.\nClinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing\nprocedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including\nstopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any\namendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and\nmonitored in accordance with the FDA's regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all\nresearch subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial and its related documentation must be reviewed and\napproved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with\nprotecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals\nparticipating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also\napproves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal\nrepresentative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.\nClinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:\n◾Phase 1. The biological product is studied in oncology indications, and the investigational product is initially\nintroduced into patients with the target disease or condition. These trials are designed to test the safety, dosage\ntolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, to identify possible\nside effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.\n◾Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects\nand safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to\ndetermine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.\n◾Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an\nexpanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.

These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the\nintended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.\nDuring all phases of clinical development, the FDA requires extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical\nactivities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials\nmust be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for\nserious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that\nsuggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse\nreaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15\ncalendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the\nFDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor's\ninitial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any\nspecified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor, acting on its own or based on a recommendation from the sponsor's data\nsafety monitoring board, may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research\nsubjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval\nof a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if\nthe biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.\nConcurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop\nadditional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for\nmanufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the\nintroduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, emphasis is placed on the importance of manufacturing\ncontrol for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of\nconsistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop\nmethods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally,\nappropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the\nbiological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.\nU.S. review and approval processes\nAfter the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before\ncommercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and\nanimal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and\nother relevant information.\nWithin 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is\nsubstantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete\nor not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must\nbe resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA\naccepts it for filing. In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee, although the fee\nmay be waived under certain circumstances. Under the performance goals and policies implemented by the FDA under the\nPrescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA targets ten months from the filing date in which to\ncomplete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an\napplication with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often\nsignificantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. This review in total typically takes\ntwelve months from the date the BLA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a\nfiling decision. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the\nBLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or"

The FDA\nreviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its\nintended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with\ncGMP to assure and preserve the product's identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer\napplications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult or novel questions of safety or\nefficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a\nrecommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by\nthe recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.\nDuring the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation\nStrategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed,\nthe sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.\nBefore approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The\nFDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance\nwith cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.\nAdditionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical\ntrials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP\ncompliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record\nkeeping, production and quality control.\nUnder the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, a BLA or supplement to a BLA for a novel\nproduct (e.g., new active ingredient, new indication, etc.) must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the\nbiological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and\nadministration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals\nfor submission of data or full or partial waivers.\nNotwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA\ndoes not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always\nconclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the FDA decides not to approve\nthe BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific\ndeficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling\nchanges, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include\nrecommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete\nresponse letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the\nletter, or withdraw the application.\nIf a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and\ndosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, including to subpopulations of patients, which could restrict\nthe commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, precautions or\ndrug-drug interactions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product\ndistribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition,\nthe FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further\nassess a biological product's safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of\napproved products that have been commercialized.\nExpedited development and review programs\nThe FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated\napproval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of\ndrugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.

To be\neligible for fast track designation, new drugs and biological products must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening\ncondition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to\nthe combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or\nbiologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a fast track product at any time during the clinical\ndevelopment of the product. One benefit of fast track designation, for example, is that the FDA may consider for review\nsections of the marketing application for a product that has received fast track designation on a rolling basis before the\ncomplete application is submitted.\nUnder the FDA's breakthrough therapy program, products may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough\ntherapy if they are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-\nthreatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates that such product may have substantial\nimprovement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The benefits of breakthrough therapy\ndesignation include the same benefits as fast track designation plus the FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a\nbreakthrough therapy product receives timely advice and interactive communications to help the sponsor design and\nconduct a development program as efficiently as possible.\nAny product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no\nsatisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease\ncompared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for\na new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Under priority review,\nthe FDA's goal is to review an application in six months once it is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review.\nAdditionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their\nsafety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over\nexisting treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and\nwell-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to\npredict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible\nmorbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving\naccelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently\nrequires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the\ntiming of the commercial launch of the product.\nPost-approval requirements\nMaintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the\nexpenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products\ncontinues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP. As the manufacturer of our products we are required to comply\nwith applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of\nrecords and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of cGMP\ndeviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping\nrequirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with\nelectronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot\nrelease. As part of the manufacturing process, we are required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is\nreleased for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, we shall submit samples of each lot of\nproduct to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the\nresults of all of the tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some\nproducts, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory\nresearch related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.\nWe also must comply with the FDA's advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-\nconsumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described"

Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at\nany time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant or\nmanufacturer to administrative or judicial actions, civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could\ninclude refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license revocation, clinical holds, warning or\nuntitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines,\nrefusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors or other stakeholders,\ndebarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action\ncould have a material adverse effect on us.\nBiological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved\nbiological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to\nperiodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.\nAccordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control\nto maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product,\nmanufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to\nthe manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of\nchanges to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further\nFDA review and approval.\nGovernment regulation outside of the United States\nWhether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory\nauthorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries.\nCertain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial\napplication, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for\nexample, a CTA must be submitted for each clinical trial to each country's national health authority and an independent\nethics committee, much like the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country's\nrequirements, the corresponding clinical trial may proceed.\nThe requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and\nreimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and\nthe applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.\nOther Healthcare Laws\nIn addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical and biological products, several other types of\nstate and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the\nbiopharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include, among others, anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes\nand other healthcare laws and regulations, some of which are described below.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying,\nsoliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase,\nlease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed\nhealthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education\nReconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no\nlonger needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This\nstatute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and\nprescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. Although there are a number of statutory\nexceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions,\nthe exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration"

This includes claims made to\nprograms where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal\ngovernment is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Recently, several\npharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices\nthey report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement\nrates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal\nprograms for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false\nclaims laws. Additionally, the ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can\nserve as a basis for liability under the federal civil False Claims Act. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under\nMedicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.\nOther federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which\nprohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror\nor payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from\na particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or\nattempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent\npretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit\nprogram in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or\nHITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013,\nimpose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities,\nas well as their business associates and their covered subcontractors that perform certain services involving the storage, use\nor disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to\nsafeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification\nto affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health\ninformation. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business\nassociates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or\ninjunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing\nfederal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain\ncircumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, and often are\nnot pre-empted by HIPAA.\nFurther, pursuant to the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created as part of the ACA, certain\nmanufacturers of prescription drugs are required to collect and report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid\nServices, or CMS, information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists,\noptometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) , other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse\npractitioners), and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family\nmembers. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.\nIn addition, several states now require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain expenses relating to the\nmarketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these\nstates. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals.\nStill other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the\nreporting of certain drug pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases, or prohibit\nprescription drug price gouging.

Certain states and local jurisdictions also require the registration of\npharmaceutical sales representatives.\nEfforts to ensure that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and\nregulations involve substantial costs. If a biopharmaceutical manufacturer's operations are found to be in violation of any\nsuch requirements, it may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties,\ndamages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, loss of eligibility to obtain\napprovals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other\nfederal or state government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting\nobligations, and reputational harm. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and\nprosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action for an alleged or suspected\nviolation can cause a drug company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management's attention from the\noperation of the business, even if such action is successfully defended.\nU.S. healthcare reform\nIn the United States there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the federal government, state governments,\nregulators and third party payors to control or manage the increased costs of healthcare and, more generally, to reform the\nU.S. healthcare system. The biopharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been\nsignificantly affected by major legislative initiatives For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which intended to\nbroaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud\nand abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and\nfees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms, substantially changed the way healthcare is\nfinanced by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry.\nThere have been executive and Congressional efforts to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain\nprovisions of, the ACA. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the\nACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. On August 16, 2022,\nPresident Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced\nsubsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also\neliminates the coverage gap known as the \"donut hole\" under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by\nsignificantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program.\nThe ACA may be subject to additional judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such\nchallenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA.\nRecently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which biopharmaceutical \nmanufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, Presidential \nexecutive orders, and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more \ntransparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform \ngovernment program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden \nadministration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions \naimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, in September 2021, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, or HHS, released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for \ndrug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these \nprinciples. Further, the IRA, among other things (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-\nsource drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to \npenalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, \nalthough they may be subject to legal challenges. Additionally, the Biden administration released an additional executive \norder on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be \nfurther leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.  At the state level, \nlegislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and \nbiological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts,"

Sales of any approved products will depend, in part, on the extent\nto which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs in the\nUnited States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for\ndetermining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or\nreimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly\nchallenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products\nand services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may also limit coverage to specific products on an\napproved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.\nIn the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party\npayors. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their\nreimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations.\nTherefore, coverage and reimbursement for products in the United States can differ significantly from payor to payor. In\norder to secure coverage and reimbursement for any biological product that is approved for sale, a biopharmaceutical\nmanufacturer may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and\ncost-effectiveness of the product. A payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug or biological product does not imply\nthat an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price\nlevels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. Similar challenges to obtaining\ncoverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, will apply to our companion diagnostics.\nThe containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the\nprices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-\ncontainment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic\nproducts. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in\njurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company's revenue generated from the sale of any\napproved drug or biological product. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even\nif favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more drug or biological products for which a\ncompany or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be\nimplemented in the future.\nHuman Capital Resources\nWe believe our culture and commitment to our employees provides unique value to our company and our\nstockholders.

Since our inception, we have devoted\nsubstantially all of our resources to research and development, raising capital, building our management team and building\nour intellectual property portfolio, and we have incurred significant operating losses. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021,\nwe had accumulated deficits of $456.9 million and $359.8 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022\nand 2021, our net losses were $97.2 million and $109.3 million, respectively. Substantially all of our losses have resulted\nfrom expenses incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative\ncosts associated with our operations. To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales, and we have not\nsought or obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate. Furthermore, we do not expect to generate any revenue\nfrom product sales for the foreseeable future, and we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the\nforeseeable future due to the cost of research and development, preclinical studies and clinical trials and the regulatory\napproval process for our current and potential future product candidates.\nWe expect our net losses to increase substantially as we continue clinical development of our most advanced\nproduct candidate, ATRC-101, and continue to expand our pipeline. However, the amount of our future losses is uncertain.\nOur ability to achieve or sustain profitability, if ever, will depend on, among other things, successfully developing product\ncandidates, obtaining regulatory approvals to market and commercialize product candidates, manufacturing any approved\nproducts on commercially reasonable terms, entering into potential future partnerships, establishing a sales and marketing\norganization or suitable third-party alternatives for any approved product and raising sufficient funds to finance business\nactivities. If we, or our potential future partners, are unable to commercialize one or more of our product candidates, or if\nsales revenue from any product candidate that receives approval is insufficient, we will not achieve or sustain profitability,\nwhich could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAny predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history\nof successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern requires that we obtain sufficient funding to finance our operations, which\nmay not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. A failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed could force us\nto delay, limit, reduce or terminate our drug development efforts, which may materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn accordance with the accounting guidance related to the presentation of financial statements, when preparing\nfinancial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, our management evaluates whether there are conditions\nor events that, when considered in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. In making its assessment, our management\nconsidered the Company’s current financial condition and liquidity sources. Our management expects to generate operating\nlosses and negative operating cash flows in the future and our management believes the need for additional funding to\nsupport our planned operations raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of\none year from the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nTo mitigate our funding needs, we have taken, and plan to continue to take, proactive measures to enhance our\nliquidity position and provide additional financial flexibility, including, among other things, equity financing in fiscal year\n2023 and reduced spending in fiscal years 2023 and 2024. While our management believes that our plan to address and\nalleviate the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern is probable of being achieved, and our\nconsolidated financial statements have accordingly been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, there\ncan be no assurance the necessary financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

The substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a\ngoing concern may also affect the price of our Class A common stock, negatively impact relationships with third parties\nwith whom we do business, including vendors, lenders and employees, prevent us from identifying, hiring or retaining the\nkey personnel that may be necessary to operate and grow our business and limit our ability to raise additional capital. Any\nof the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects.\nATRC-101 is in clinical trials. It may fail in development or suffer delays that materially and adversely affect its\ncommercial viability.\nIn February 2020, we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial for ATRC-101 in patients with solid tumors, and in 2021\nwe expanded clinical development by opening a new cohort to evaluate ATRC-101 in combination with pembrolizumab, a\nPD-1 checkpoint inhibitor. We have no products on the market or that have gained regulatory approval. Other than ATRC-\n101, we currently have no product candidates and none of our potential future product candidates have ever been tested in\nhumans. Our ability to achieve and sustain profitability depends on obtaining regulatory approvals for and successfully\ncommercializing product candidates, either alone or with partners.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial distribution of product candidates, we or a partner must\nconduct extensive preclinical studies, followed by clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product\ncandidates in humans. We cannot be certain of the timely completion or outcome of our preclinical studies, and we cannot\npredict if the FDA or other regulatory authorities will accept our proposed clinical programs or if the outcome of our\npreclinical studies will ultimately support the further development of our preclinical programs. As a result, we cannot be\nsure that we will be able to submit INDs or similar applications for our preclinical programs on the timelines we expect, if\nat all, and we cannot be sure that submission of INDs or similar applications will result in the FDA or other regulatory\nauthorities allowing clinical trials to begin.\nIn response to COVID-19, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have been periodically prevented from\nconducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, and if this continues to occur it could\nsignificantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory\nsubmissions, which could have an adverse effect on the timing and progress of our current or future clinical trials and our\nbusiness.\nATRC-101 is in early clinical development, and we are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development\nof product candidates based on novel approaches, targets and mechanisms of action. Accordingly, you should consider our\nprospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by clinical stage\nbiopharmaceutical companies such as ours.\nWe may not have the financial resources to continue development of, or to enter into new collaborations for,\nATRC-101 or any potential future product candidates. This may be exacerbated if we experience any issues that delay or\nprevent regulatory approval of, or our ability to commercialize, ATRC-101 or any potential future product candidate, such\nas:"

For example, we have experienced delays in initiating sites, achieving patient\ncompliance with study-related procedures, and enrolling and treating patients. We have worked, and continue to work,\nclosely with our current and potential clinical trial sites to mitigate any disruptions or delays. However, COVID-19 may\ncontinue to have a negative impact on our clinical trial activities for ATRC-101, but we cannot predict the full extent of\nsuch impact at this time.\nFurther, we and our potential future partners may never receive approval to market and commercialize any\nproduct candidate. Even if we or a potential future partner obtains regulatory approval, the approval may be for targets,\ndisease indications or patient populations that are not as broad as we intended or desired or may require labeling that\nincludes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings.

For example, although ATRC-101 has exhibited encouraging results in certain animal studies, including anti-\ntumor activity and safety, it may not demonstrate the same properties in humans and may interact with human biological\nsystems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways. As a result, we may never succeed in developing a marketable product\nbased on ATRC-101. If ATRC-101 or any of our potential future product candidates prove to be ineffective, unsafe or\ncommercially unviable, our entire pipeline could have little, if any, value, which could require us to change our focus and\napproach to antibody discovery and development, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business and could have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness and our operations, as well as the business and operations of our manufacturers, CROs or other third parties\nwith whom we conduct business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business and could have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness and operations as well as the business and operations of our manufacturers, CROs and other third parties with\nwhom we conduct our business.

To achieve this, we may seek to develop and commercialize such companion diagnostics\nourselves or through third-party collaborators. For example, for ATRC-101, we have developed a diagnostic to select\nparticipants based on ATRC-101 target expression. Companion diagnostics are generally developed in conjunction with\nclinical programs for the associated product and can be helpful in enrolling patients in clinical studies who may be more\nlikely to respond to the specific therapeutic being developed. The approval of a companion diagnostic as part of the product\nlabel could limit the use of the product candidate to those patients whose companion diagnostic test is positive for ATRC-\n101 target.\nCompanion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities as medical devices\nand typically require separate clearance or approval prior to their commercialization or certain uses in clinical trials. To\ndate, the FDA has required premarket approval of companion diagnostics for oncology therapies. We and our third-party\ncollaborators may encounter difficulties in developing and obtaining approval for these companion diagnostics. Any delay\nor failure by us or third-party collaborators to develop or obtain regulatory approval of a companion diagnostic could delay\nor prevent approval of our corresponding product candidates. The time and cost associated with developing a companion\ndiagnostic may not prove to have been necessary in order to successfully obtain regulatory approvals or market the\nproduct.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to use and expand our discovery platform to build a pipeline of product\ncandidates and develop and commercialize them.\nA key element of our strategy is to use and expand our discovery platform to build a pipeline of product\ncandidates. Our discovery platform is evolving, and we are only beginning to build a pipeline of product candidates. To\ndate, our research and development efforts have resulted in our discovery of ATRC-101 and earlier stage preclinical assets.\nATRC-101 and any of our other assets may not advance through research and development and ultimately be safe or\neffective as a cancer treatment, and we may not be able to develop any other product candidates. In addition, as a result of\nCOVID-19, we have experienced disruptions and delays in our efforts, both internally and externally with third parties, to\nuse and expand our discovery platform.\nEven if we are successful in building our pipeline of product candidates, we may not be able to progress them\nthrough preclinical and clinical development and commercialization for the treatment of various diseases. We may not have\nthe substantial technical, financial, and personnel resources to progress any potential product candidates that we identify, or\nwe may not allocate these resources to the most commercially viable product candidate. In addition, the potential product\ncandidates that we identify may not be suitable for preclinical or clinical development or generate acceptable data,\nincluding as a result of being shown to have unacceptable toxicity or other characteristics that indicate that they are\nunlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities or achieve market\nacceptance. If we do not successfully build a pipeline of product candidates and develop and commercialize them, we will\nnot be able to generate product revenue in the future.\nOur approach to developing and identifying antibodies using our discovery platform is novel and unproven and may not\nresult in marketable products.\nWe are developing a pipeline of product candidates using our discovery platform. We believe that we may be able\nto overcome certain key limitations of the current oncology drug discovery paradigm by focusing on an active human anti-\ntumor immune response that develops over time. However, our scientific research that forms the basis of our efforts to\ndiscover product candidates based on our discovery platform is ongoing. Further, the scientific evidence to support the\nfeasibility of developing therapeutic antibodies based on our platform has not been established.

It is likely that there will be side effects associated with the\nuse of ATRC-101 or any potential future product candidate. Results of our clinical trials could reveal a high and\nunacceptable severity and prevalence of these side effects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated\nand the FDA or other regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of a product\ncandidate for any or all targeted indications.

Because the length of time and\nactivities associated with successful research and development of product candidates is highly uncertain, we are unable to\nestimate the actual funds we will require for development and any approved marketing and commercialization activities.\nThe timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:\n◾\nthe timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;\n◾\nthe timing and progress of our development of our discovery platform;\n◾\nthe price and pricing structure that we are able to obtain from our third-party contract manufacturers to\nmanufacture our preclinical study and clinical trial materials and supplies;\n◾\nthe number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;\n◾\nour ability to maintain our current licenses and research and development programs and to establish new\ncollaborations;\n◾\nthe progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we may in the future enter into collaboration\nand research and development agreements;\n◾\nthe costs involved in obtaining, maintaining, enforcing and defending patents and other intellectual property\nrights;\n◾\nthe cost and timing of regulatory approvals; and\n◾\nour efforts to enhance operational systems, secure sufficient laboratory space and hire additional personnel,\nincluding personnel to support development of our product candidates and satisfy our obligations as a public\ncompany.\nTo date, we have primarily financed our operations through the sale of equity securities and payments and other\nincome received under discovery services agreements not related to our primary business.

To the extent that\nwe raise additional capital through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may\nhave to relinquish valuable rights to our current and potential future product candidates, future revenue streams or research\nprograms or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we do raise additional capital through public or\nprivate equity or convertible debt offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the\nterms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders’ rights. If we\nraise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take\nspecific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nWe do not expect to realize revenue from product sales or royalties from licensed products in the foreseeable\nfuture, if at all, and unless and until our current and potential future product candidates are clinically tested, approved for\ncommercialization and successfully marketed.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate and fail to capitalize on product\ncandidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we intend to focus our efforts on specific research\nand development programs, including clinical development of ATRC-101. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of\nother opportunities, including with potential future product candidates that later prove to have greater commercial\npotential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable\nmarket opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for\nspecific indications may not yield any commercially viable product candidates.

Because our current and potential future product candidates are based on new\ntechnologies and discovery approaches, we expect that they will require extensive research and development and have\nsubstantial manufacturing and processing costs. In addition, costs to treat patients and to treat potential side effects that\nmay result from our product candidates may be significant. Accordingly, our clinical trial costs are likely to be high and\ncould have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed\nor otherwise adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our current or potential future product candidates if we\nare unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA\nor other regulatory authorities. In particular, we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial for ATRC-101 in patients with a limited\nnumber of tumor types. We cannot predict how difficult it will be to enroll patients for trials in these indications. We may\nexperience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of reasons. The enrollment of patients\ndepends on many factors, including:\n◾\nthe severity of the disease under investigation;\n◾\nthe patient eligibility criteria defined in the clinical trial protocol;\n◾\nthe size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial’s primary endpoints;\n◾\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n◾\nthe patient referral practices of physicians;\n◾\nour ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n◾\nclinicians’ and patients’ perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in\nrelation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are\ninvestigating;\n◾\nour ability to obtain and maintain patient consents; and\n◾\nthe risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion.\nIn our clinical trial for ATRC-101, we experienced delays related to COVID-19 in 2020, 2021, and 2022, and we\nmay continue to experience such delays in 2023, primarily in enrolling and treating patients due to COVID-19 protocols\nand site staff shortages. In addition, we are experiencing delays in enrolling and treating patients due to broader staff\nshortages in healthcare facilities, including at our clinical trial sites, and due to our updated clinical trial protocol that\nrequires patients to have target expression in the tumor types under investigation. We are working closely with our current\nand potential clinical trial sites to mitigate any potential disruptions and delays. However, COVID-19, site staff shortages,\nour updated protocol, and other factors may continue to impact our clinical trial, including significant disruptions or\nmaterial delays in our ability to enroll patients, which could adversely impact the cost, timing, or outcome of our clinical\ntrial for ATRC-101 and our ability to advance the development of ATRC-101.\nIn addition, our future clinical trials will compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the\nsame therapeutic areas as our product candidates, and this competition will reduce the number and types of patients\navailable to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being\nconducted by one of our competitors. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we expect to conduct\nsome of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of\npatients who are available for our clinical trials at such clinical trial sites. Additionally, because some of our clinical trials\nwill be in patients with advanced solid tumors, the patients are typically in the late stages of the disease and may\nexperience disease progression or adverse events independent from our product candidates, making them unevaluable for\npurposes of the trial and requiring additional enrollment. Delays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may\naffect the timing or outcome of the planned clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely\naffect our ability to advance the development of our product candidates."

To\nthe extent the activities of these groups are successful, our research and development activities may be interrupted or\ndelayed.\nBecause we may rely on third parties for manufacturing and supply of our product candidates, some of which are or\nmay be sole source vendors, for preclinical and clinical development materials and commercial supplies, our supply may\nbecome limited or interrupted or may not be of satisfactory quantity or quality.\nWe currently rely on third-party contract manufacturers for our preclinical and future clinical trial product\nmaterials and supplies. We do not produce any meaningful quantity of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical\ndevelopment, and we do not currently own manufacturing facilities for producing such supplies.

We cannot assure you that our preclinical or future clinical development\nproduct supplies and commercial supplies will not be limited or interrupted or will be of satisfactory quality or continue to\nbe available at acceptable prices.

Establishing additional or replacement vendors, if required, may not be\naccomplished quickly. Any delays, whether due to COVID-19 or otherwise, resulting from manufacturing or supply\ninterruptions associated with our reliance on third-party manufacturing and supply partners, including those that are sole\nsource, could impede, delay, limit or prevent our drug development efforts, which could harm our business, result of\noperations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe continue to work closely with our third-party manufacturers to mitigate any potential disruptions or delays to\nthe supply of our preclinical, clinical, and commercial materials due to COVID-19. However, COVID-19 may lead to\nsignificant disruptions or material delays in our ability to receive these materials, and our ability to engage new third-party\nmanufacturers, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe manufacturing process for a product candidate is subject to FDA and other regulatory authority review.\nSuppliers and manufacturers must meet applicable manufacturing requirements and undergo rigorous facility and process\nvalidation tests required by regulatory authorities in order to comply with regulatory standards, such as current Good\nManufacturing Practices, or cGMP. In the event that any of our manufacturers fails to comply with such requirements or to\nperform its obligations to us in relation to quality, timing or otherwise, or if our supply of components or other materials\nbecomes limited or interrupted for other reasons, we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves, for which we\ncurrently do not have the capabilities or resources, or enter into an agreement with another third party, which we may not\nbe able to do on reasonable terms, or at all. In some cases, the technical skills or technology required to manufacture our\ncurrent and future product candidates may be unique or proprietary to the original manufacturer and we may have difficulty\ntransferring such skills or technology to another third party and a feasible alternative may not exist. These factors would\nincrease our reliance on such manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from such manufacturer in order to have\nanother third party manufacture our product candidates. If we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will\nbe required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and\nwith all applicable regulations and guidelines.

Our manufacturing partners may be unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity\nfor any current or potential future product candidate in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. In addition, quality\nissues may arise during scale-up activities. If our manufacturing partners are unable to successfully scale the manufacture\nof any current or potential future product candidate in sufficient quality and quantity, the development, testing and clinical\ntrials of that product candidate may be delayed or infeasible, and regulatory approval or commercial launch of any\npotential resulting product may be delayed or not obtained, which could significantly harm our business.\nIf the market opportunities for our current and potential future product candidates, including ATRC-101, are smaller\nthan we believe they are, our future product revenues may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nOur understanding of the number of people who suffer from certain types of cancers and tumors that may be able\nto be treated with antibodies that have been and may in the future be identified by our discovery platform, including\nATRC-101, is based on estimates. These estimates may prove to be incorrect, and new studies may reduce the estimated\nincidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of patients in the United States or elsewhere may turn out to be\nlower than expected, may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our current or potential future product candidates or\npatients may become increasingly difficult to identify and access, all of which would adversely affect our business\nprospects and financial condition. In particular, the treatable population for ATRC-101 may be further reduced if our\nestimates of addressable populations are erroneous or sub-populations of patients do not derive benefit from ATRC-101.\nFurther, there are several factors that could contribute to making the actual number of patients who receive our\ncurrent or potential future product candidates less than the potentially addressable market. These include the lack of\nwidespread availability of, and limited reimbursement for, new therapies in many underdeveloped markets.\nWe face competition from entities that have developed or may develop product candidates for the treatment of the\ndiseases that we may target, including companies developing novel treatments and technology platforms. If these\ncompanies develop technologies or product candidates more rapidly than we do, or if their technologies or product\ncandidates are more effective, our ability to develop and successfully commercialize product candidates may be\nadversely affected.\nThe development and commercialization of drugs and therapeutic biologics is highly competitive.

Competitive therapeutic treatments\ninclude those that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community and any new treatments that are\ncurrently in development or that enter the market. We believe that a significant number of products are currently under\ndevelopment, and may become commercially available in the future, for the treatment of conditions for which we may try\nto develop product candidates. There is intense and rapidly evolving competition in the biotechnology, biopharmaceutical\nand antibody and immuno-oncology fields. We believe that while our discovery platform, its associated intellectual\nproperty, the characteristics of ATRC-101, and other potential future product candidates and our scientific and technical\nknow-how together give us a competitive advantage in this space, competition from many sources remains.\nWe are aware of a number of companies that are developing antibodies for the treatment of cancer. Many of these\ncompanies are well-capitalized and, in contrast to us, have significant clinical experience, and may include our future\npartners. In addition, these companies compete with us in recruiting scientific and managerial talent. Our success will\npartially depend on our ability to obtain, maintain, enforce and defend patents and other intellectual property rights with\nrespect to antibodies that are safer and more effective than competing products. Our commercial opportunity and success\nwill be reduced or eliminated if competing products that are safer, more effective, or less expensive than the antibodies we\ndevelop are or become available.\nWe expect to compete with antibody, biologics and other therapeutic platforms and development companies,\nincluding, but not limited to, companies such as Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation, Neurimmune Holding AG,\nOncoResponse, Inc., Immunome, Inc., and Vir Biotechnology, Inc.

If\nATRC-101 or potential future product candidates are eventually approved, they will compete with a range of treatments\nthat are either in development or currently marketed. For example, we expect that ATRC-101 and our potential future\nproduct candidates may compete against traditional cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy, as well as cell-based\ntreatments for cancer, such as CAR-T therapies.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and\nsupply resources or experience than we do.

Competing\nproducts could present superior treatment alternatives, including by being more effective, safer, less expensive or marketed\nand sold more effectively than any products we may develop. Competitive products may make any product we develop\nobsolete or noncompetitive before we recover the expense of developing and commercializing such product. Such\ncompetitors could also recruit our employees, which could negatively impact our level of expertise and our ability to\nexecute our business plan.\nAny inability to attract and retain qualified key management, technical personnel and employees would impair our\nability to implement our business plan.\nOur success largely depends on the continued service of key management, advisors and other specialized\npersonnel, including John A.

In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time\nafter receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure exerted by governments\nand other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost-containment measures. Political,\neconomic and regulatory developments, in the United States or internationally, may further complicate pricing negotiations,\nand pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European\nUnion member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further\nreduce prices. In some countries, we or future partners may be required to conduct clinical trials or other studies that\ncompare the cost-effectiveness of a product candidate to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain\nreimbursement or pricing approval.

If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in\ndefending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a material and adverse effect on our business and\nfinancial condition, including the imposition of significant criminal, civil, and administrative fines or other sanctions, such\nas monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government-funded\nhealthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity obligations, reputational harm and the curtailment or\nrestructuring of our operations.\nFailure to comply with health and data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions\n(which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our\noperating results and business.\nWe and our current and potential collaborators may be subject to federal, state and foreign data protection laws\nand regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). In the United States, numerous federal\nand state laws and regulations, including federal health information privacy laws (e.g., the Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act,\nor HITECH), state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer\nprotection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure and\nprotection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our\ncollaborators. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (including research institutions from which\nwe obtain clinical trial data) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, as amended by HITECH,\nor other privacy and data security laws. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be subject to significant\npenalties if we obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity\nor business associate in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.\nInternational data protection laws, including Regulation 2016/679, known as the General Data Protection\nRegulation, or GDPR, may also apply to health-related and other personal information obtained outside of the United\nStates. The GDPR went into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR introduced new data protection requirements in the\nEuropean Union, as well as potential fines for noncompliant companies of up to the greater of e20 million or 4% of annual\nglobal revenue. The regulation imposes numerous new requirements for the collection, use and disclosure of personal\ninformation, including more stringent requirements relating to consent and the information that must be shared with data\nsubjects about how their personal information is used, the obligation to notify regulators and affected individuals of\npersonal data breaches, extensive new internal privacy governance obligations and obligations to honor expanded rights of\nindividuals in relation to their personal information (e.g., the right to access, correct and delete their data). In addition, the\nGDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. The GDPR will increase our responsibility and liability in\nrelation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to the GDPR, and we may be required to put in\nplace additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including as implemented by individual countries. A\nrecent decision of the European Court of Justice, or CJEU, may increase the risk of GDPR litigation. Under the CJEU\ndecision, a consumer protection association may bring representative actions alleging breaches of the GDPR even though a\nspecific individual does not mandate the consumer protection association to act and a specific breach of any individual’s\ndata protection rights is not demonstrated. Further, the United Kingdom’s vote in favor of exiting the EU, often referred to\nas Brexit, has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. In particular, it is\nunclear how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated.\nIn addition, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which creates individual privacy\nrights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities\nhandling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosure to\nconsumers about such companies’ data collection, use and sharing practices, provide such consumers new"

The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General may bring enforcement actions\nfor violations beginning July 1, 2020. The CCPA was amended on September 23, 2018, and it remains unclear what, if any,\nfurther modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. As currently written, the CCPA may\nimpact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment\nrelated to personal data and protected health information.\nCompliance with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more\nonerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our\nability to operate in certain jurisdictions. Failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations\ncould result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation or\nadverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Moreover, clinical trial subjects about\nwhom we or our potential collaborators obtain information, as well as the providers who share this information with us,\nmay contractually limit our ability to use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy\nrights, failed to comply with data protection laws, or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable,\ncould be expensive and time consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.\nIf we experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, or destruction of\nour proprietary or confidential data, employee data or personal data, we may face costs, significant liabilities, harm to\nour brand and business disruption.\nIn connection with our discovery platform and efforts, we may collect and use a variety of personal data, such as\nname, mailing address, email addresses, phone number and clinical trial information. Although we have extensive\nmeasures in place to prevent the sharing and loss of patient data in our sample collection process associated with our\ndiscovery platform, any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, use of, or disclosure of our\nclinical data or patients’ personal data could result in significant liability under state (e.g., state breach notification laws),\nfederal (e.g., HIPAA, as amended by HITECH), and international law (e.g., the GDPR). Any failure to prevent or mitigate\nsecurity breaches or improper access to, use of, or disclosure of our clinical data or patients’ personal data may cause a\nmaterial adverse impact to our reputation, affect our ability to conduct new studies and potentially disrupt our business. We\nmay also rely on third-party service providers to host or otherwise process some of our data and that of users, and any\nfailure by such third party to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of such information\ncould have similarly adverse consequences for us. If we are unable to prevent or mitigate the impact of such security or\ndata privacy breaches, we could be exposed to litigation and governmental investigations, which could lead to a potential\ndisruption to our business.\nWe depend on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business and a cyber-attack or other breach\nof these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on information technology systems that we or our third-party vendors operate to process, transmit and\nstore electronic information in our day-to-day operations. The size and complexity of our information technology systems\nmakes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy or other\nsignificant disruption. A successful attack could result in the theft or destruction of intellectual property, data, or other\nmisappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations.\nCyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent. We have invested in our systems and the protection and\nrecoverability of our data to reduce the risk of an intrusion or interruption, and we monitor and test our systems on an\nongoing basis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent\nfuture interruptions or breakdowns. If we or our third-party vendors fail to maintain or protect our information technology\nsystems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate, plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems, we or\nour third-party vendors could have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling such cyber-attacks and any such attacks\ncould result in losses described above as well as disputes with physicians, patients and our partners, regulatory sanctions or\npenalties, increases in operating expenses, expenses or lost revenues or other adverse consequences, any of which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and cash flows."

A significant\ndisruption in the availability of our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems could cause\ninterruptions and delays in our research and development work.\nIf we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business\ncould be adversely affected.\nOur research, development and manufacturing involves the use of hazardous materials and various chemicals. We\nmaintain quantities of various flammable and toxic chemicals in our facilities that are required for our research,\ndevelopment and manufacturing activities. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the\nuse, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. We believe our procedures for storing,\nhandling and disposing of these materials in our facilities comply with the relevant guidelines of the state of California and\nthe Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor. Although we believe that our safety\nprocedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards mandated by applicable regulations,\nthe risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. If an accident occurs, we could be\nheld liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and\nworkplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne\npathogens and the handling of animals and biohazardous materials. Although we maintain workers’ compensation\ninsurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these\nmaterials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Although we have some\nenvironmental liability insurance covering certain of our facilities, we may not maintain adequate insurance for all\nenvironmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of\nbiological or hazardous materials. Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be\nadopted in the future. We may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of\nthese laws or regulations.\nOur current operations are concentrated in one location, and we or the third parties upon whom we depend may be\nadversely affected by natural or other disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not\nadequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nOur current operations are concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area. Any unplanned event, such as flood, fire,\nexplosion, extreme weather condition, medical epidemics, power shortage, telecommunication failure or other natural or\nmanmade accidents or incidents that result in us being unable to fully utilize our facilities or the manufacturing facilities of\nour third-party contract manufacturers, or lose our repository of blood-based and other valuable laboratory samples, may\nhave a material and adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, particularly on a daily basis, and have significant\nnegative consequences on our financial and operating conditions. Loss of access to these facilities may result in increased\ncosts, delays in the development of our product candidates or interruption of our business operations. Natural disasters such\nas earthquakes or wildfires, both of which are prevalent in Northern California, floods or tsunamis could further disrupt our\noperations, and have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If\na natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our\nheadquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our research facilities or the manufacturing facilities of our third-\nparty contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for\nus to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in\nplace may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a\nresult of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business. As part of our risk management policy, we maintain insurance coverage at levels that we believe are\nappropriate for our business. However, in the event of an accident or incident at these facilities, we cannot assure you that\nthe amounts of insurance will be sufficient to satisfy any damages and losses.

Any business interruption may have a material and adverse effect\non our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our technology and current or future product\ncandidates, or if our intellectual property rights are inadequate, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection for our owned and in-licensed\nintellectual property rights and proprietary technology. We rely on patents and other forms of intellectual property rights,\nincluding in-licenses of intellectual property rights and biologic materials of others, to protect our current or future\ndiscovery platform, product candidates, methods used to manufacture our current or future product candidates, and\nmethods for treating patients using our current or future product candidates.\nWe in-license exclusive rights, including patents and patent applications relating to our discovery platform, from\nthe Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, or Stanford University. Patent applications for this in-\nlicensed technology are still pending before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and other national patent offices. There\nis no guarantee that such patent applications will issue as patents, nor any guarantee that any issued patents that we have or\nmay obtain will provide adequate protection for the in-licensed technology or any meaningful competitive advantage.\nWe also own several patents and applications on our own technology relating to our discovery platform. There is\nno guarantee that any patents covering this technology will issue from the patent applications we own. Nor is there any\nguarantee that issued patents that we have or may obtain will provide adequate protection for our discovery platform or any\nmeaningful competitive advantage.\nWe own a U.S. patent and patent applications pending before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and other\nnational patent offices in connection with ATRC-101 and related antibody variants. We also have filed non-provisional\npatent applications related to other product candidates. However, there is no guarantee that such patent applications will\nissue as patents, nor any guarantee that issued patents that we have or may obtain will effectively protect ATRC-101 or\nother product candidates or will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive products.\nWe have filed and may also file additional provisional patent applications in the United Stated related to our\nproduct candidates. A provisional patent application is not eligible to become an issued patent until, among other things,\nwe file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of the filing date of the provisional patent application. If we\ndo not timely file non-provisional patent applications for our potential future provisional patent applications, we may lose\nour priority date with respect to our provisional patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in\nour provisional patent applications.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive, complex and time-consuming. Patent license negotiations also can be\ncomplex and protracted, with uncertain results. We may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce or license all\nnecessary or desirable patents and patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we\nwill fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent\nprotection. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents, and, even if they do issue\nas patents, such patents may not cover our current or future technologies or product candidates in the United States or in\nother countries or provide sufficient protection from competitors. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application\ncan be significantly reduced before the patent is issued and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Accordingly, we\nalso rely on our ability to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or violating\nour proprietary rights and to operate without infringing, misappropriating, or violating the proprietary rights of others.\nFurther, although we make reasonable efforts to ensure patentability of our inventions, we cannot guarantee that\nall of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our owned or in-licensed patents and patent applications has been found.\nFor example, publications of discoveries in scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent"

Additionally, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be\nlater amended in a manner that could cover our discovery platform, our product candidates, or the use of our technologies.\nWe thus cannot know with certainty whether we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our\nowned or in-licensed patents or pending applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection\nof such inventions. There is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to our owned or in-licensed patents\nand patent applications has been found. For this reason, and because there is no guarantee that any prior art search is\nabsolutely correct and comprehensive, we may be unaware of prior art that could be used to invalidate an issued patent or\nto prevent our owned or in-licensed pending patent applications from issuing as patents. Invalidation of any of our patent\nrights, including in-licensed patent rights, could materially harm our business.\nMoreover, the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies are generally uncertain because they may involve\ncomplex legal and factual considerations that have, in recent years, been the subject of legal development and change. As a\nresult, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our pending patent rights is uncertain. The\nstandards applied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and foreign patent offices in granting\npatents are not always certain and moreover, are not always applied uniformly or predictably. For example, there is no\nuniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter or the scope of claims allowable in patents. Changes in\neither the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of\nour owned or in-licensed patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nEven if patents do successfully issue and even if such patents cover our current or any future technologies or\nproduct candidates, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents\nbeing narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable. Any successful challenge to these patents or any other patents owned\nby or licensed to us could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any current or future\ntechnologies or product candidates that we may develop. Likewise, if patent applications we own or have in-licensed with\nrespect to our development programs and current or future technologies or product candidates fail to issue, if their breadth\nor strength is threatened, or if they fail to provide meaningful exclusivity, other companies could be dissuaded from\ncollaborating with us to develop current or future technologies or product candidates. Lack of valid and enforceable patent\nprotection could threaten our ability to commercialize current or future products and could prevent us from maintaining\nexclusivity with respect to the invention or feature claimed in the patent applications. Any failure to obtain or any loss of\npatent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business and ability to achieve profitability. We may be\nunable to prevent competitors from entering the market with a product that is similar to or the same as ATRC-101 or future\nproduct candidates.\nThe filing of a patent application or the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its ownership, inventorship,\nscope, patentability, validity or enforceability. Issued patents and patent applications may be challenged in the courts and in\nthe patent office in the United States and abroad. For example, our applications or applications filed by our licensors may\nbe challenged through third-party submissions, opposition or derivation proceedings. By further example, our issued\npatents or the issued patents we in-license may be challenged through reexamination, inter partes review or post-grant\nreview proceedings before the patent office, or in declaratory judgment actions or counterclaims. An adverse determination\nin any such submission, proceeding or litigation could prevent the issuance of, reduce the scope of, invalidate or render\nunenforceable our owned or in-licensed patent rights; limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar\nor identical platforms and products; allow third parties to compete directly with us without payment to us; or result in our\ninability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth\nor strength of protection provided by our owned or in-licensed patents and patent applications is threatened, it could\ndissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future platforms or product\ncandidates. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects.\nMoreover, some of our owned and in-licensed patents and patent applications are or may in the future be co-\nowned with third parties. If we are unable to obtain an exclusive license to any such third party co-owners’ interest in such\npatents or patent application, such co-owners may be able to license their rights to other third-parties, including our\ncompetitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology. We may need the cooperation of any\nsuch co-owners of our patents to enforce such patents against third parties, and such cooperation may not be provided to"

Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business prospects and financial\nconditions.\nOur in-licensed patent rights may be subject to a reservation of rights by one or more third parties. For example,\nwe in-license certain patent rights from Stanford University, which co-owns rights with a governmental entity. As a result,\nthe U.S. government may have certain rights, including so-called march-in rights, to such patent rights and any products or\ntechnology developed from such patent rights. When new technologies are developed with U.S. government funding, the\nU.S. government generally obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a nonexclusive license authorizing the\nU.S. government to use the invention for non-commercial purposes. These rights may permit the U.S. government to\ndisclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise march-in rights to use or to allow third parties to use\nour licensed technology. The U.S. government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary\nbecause we fail to achieve the practical application of government-funded technology, because action is necessary to\nalleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations, or to give preference to U.S. industry. In\naddition, our rights in such inventions may be subject to certain requirements to manufacture products embodying such\ninventions in the United States. Any exercise by the U.S. government of such rights could harm our competitive position,\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under any license, collaboration or other intellectual property-related\nagreements, we may be required to pay damages and could lose intellectual property rights that may be necessary for\ndeveloping, commercializing and protecting our current or future technologies or product candidates or we could lose\ncertain rights to grant sublicenses.\nWe are heavily reliant upon in-licenses to certain patent rights and proprietary technology from third parties that\nare important or necessary to our discovery platform and development of product candidates. For example, we rely on an\nintellectual property license from Stanford University for our discovery platform.\nOur current license agreements impose, and any future license agreements we enter into are likely to impose,\nvarious development, commercialization, funding, milestone, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution\nand enforcement or other obligations on us. If we breach any of these obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed\nto us in an unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to terminate the\nlicense. License termination could result in our inability to develop, manufacture and sell products that are covered by the\nlicensed technology or could enable a competitor to gain access to the licensed technology. In certain circumstances, our\nlicensed patent rights are subject to our reimbursing our licensors for their patent prosecution and maintenance costs. For\nexample, our license agreement with Stanford University requires us to bear the costs of filing and maintaining patent\napplications.\nFurthermore, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, enforcement\nand defense of patents and patent applications that we license from third parties. For example, pursuant to our license\nagreement with Stanford University, while we direct and are responsible for the preparation, filing, prosecution and\nmaintenance, and, in certain circumstances, enforcement and defense of the patents and patent applications, all of these\nactions are subject to Stanford University’s final approval. Given Stanford University’s right of final approval, we therefore\ncannot be certain that these patents and patent applications will be prepared, filed, prosecuted, maintained, enforced and\ndefended in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If our licensors and future licensors fail to\nprosecute, maintain, enforce and defend patents we may license, or lose rights to licensed patents or patent applications,\nour license rights may be reduced or eliminated. In such circumstances, our right to develop and commercialize any of our\nproducts or product candidates that is the subject of such licensed rights could be materially adversely affected.\nMoreover, our licensors may own or control intellectual property that has not been licensed to us and, as a result,\nwe may be subject to claims, regardless of their merit, that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the\nlicensor’s intellectual property rights. In addition, while we cannot currently determine the amount of the royalty\nobligations we would be required to pay on sales of future products if infringement or misappropriation were found, those\namounts could be significant. The amount of our future royalty obligations will depend on the technology"

Therefore, even if we\nsuccessfully develop and commercialize products, we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties\nare complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of\nany contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the\nrelevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the\nrelevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and ability to achieve\nprofitability. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain\nour current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and\ncommercialize any affected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial\nconditions.\nPatent terms may not be able to protect our competitive position for an adequate period of time with respect to our\ncurrent or future technologies or product candidates.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the standard patent term is typically 20 years after filing.\nVarious extensions may be available. Even so, the life of a patent and the protection it affords are limited. As a result, our\nowned and in-licensed patent portfolio provides us with limited rights that may not last for a sufficient period of time to\nexclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. For example, given the large amount of time\nrequired for the research, development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such\ncandidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized.\nExtensions of patent term are available, but there is no guarantee that we would succeed in obtaining any\nparticular extension—and no guarantee any such extension would confer patent term for a sufficient period of time to\nexclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. In the United States, the Drug Price Competition\nand Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the normal expiration\nof the patent, which is limited to the approved indication (or any additional indications approved during the period of\nextension). A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond 14 years from the date of product\napproval; only one patent may be extended; and extension is available for only those claims covering the approved drug, a\nmethod for using it, or a method for manufacturing it. The applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the\nUnited States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether\nsuch extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than\nwe request. An extension may not be granted or may be limited where there is, for example, a failure to exercise due\ndiligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failure to apply within applicable deadlines, failure to\napply before expiration of relevant patents, or some other failure to satisfy applicable requirements. If this occurs, our\ncompetitors may be able to launch their products earlier by taking advantage of our investment in development and clinical\ntrials along with our clinical and preclinical data. This could have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to\nachieve profitability.\nChanges in U.S. patent law or the patent law of other countries or jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in\ngeneral, thereby impairing our ability to protect our current or any future technologies or product candidates.\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States or elsewhere could\nincrease the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of\nissued patents. The United States has enacted and implemented wide-ranging patent reform legislation. On September 16,\n2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law, which could increase the\nuncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our owned or in-licensed patent applications and the enforcement or\ndefense of our owned or in-licensed issued patents. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S.\npatent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, may affect\npatent litigation and switch the U.S. patent system from a ‘‘first-to-invent’’ system to a ‘‘first-to-file’’ system. Under a first-\nto-file system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application\ngenerally will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention\nearlier. These provisions also allow third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO"

The USPTO developed additional regulations and procedures to govern administration of the\nLeahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and, in\nparticular, the first-to-file provisions, became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact\nthe Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. The Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could\nincrease the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our owned or in-licensed patent applications and the\nenforcement or defense of our issued owned or in-licensed patents, all of which could have a material adverse impact on\nour business prospects and financial condition.\nAs referenced above, for example, courts in the U.S. continue to refine the heavily fact-and-circumstance-\ndependent jurisprudence defining the scope of patent protection available for therapeutic antibodies, narrowing the scope of\npatent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. This\ncreates uncertainty about our ability to obtain patents in the future and the value of such patents. We cannot provide\nassurance that future developments in U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO will not adversely impact our\nowned or in-licensed patents or patent applications. The laws and regulations governing patents could change in\nunpredictable ways that could weaken our and our licensors’ ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing owned\nor in-licensed patents and patents that we might obtain or in-license in the future. Similarly, changes in patent law and\nregulations in other countries or jurisdictions or changes in the governmental bodies that enforce them or changes in how\nthe relevant governmental authority enforces patent laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our and our\nlicensors’ ability to obtain new patents or to protect and enforce our owned or in-licensed patents or patents that we may\nobtain or in-license in the future.\nOther companies or organizations may challenge our or our licensors’ patent rights or may assert patent rights that\nprevent us from developing and commercializing our current or future products.\nAs the field of antibody-based immunotherapeutics matures, patent applications are being processed by national\npatent offices around the world. There is uncertainty about which patents will issue, and, if they do, there is uncertainty as\nto when, to whom, and with what claims. In addition, third parties may attempt to invalidate our or our licensors’\nintellectual property rights. Even if such rights are not directly challenged, disputes could lead to the weakening of our or\nour licensors’ intellectual property rights. Our defense against any attempt by third parties to circumvent or invalidate our\nintellectual property rights could be costly to us, could require significant time and attention of our management, and could\nhave a material and adverse impact on our profitability, financial condition and prospects or ability to successfully\ncompete.\nThere are many issued and pending patents that claim aspects of our current or potential future product candidates\nand modifications that we may need to apply to our current or potential future product candidates. There are also many\nissued patents that claim antibodies or portions of antibodies that may be relevant for products we wish to develop.\nFurther, we cannot guarantee that we are aware of all of patents and patent applications potentially relevant to our\ntechnology or products. We may not be aware of potentially relevant third-party patents or applications for several reasons.\nFor example, U.S. applications filed before November 29, 2000, and certain U.S. applications filed after that date that will\nnot be filed outside the U.S. remain confidential until patents issue. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere\nare published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date\nbeing commonly referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our product candidates or platform\ntechnologies could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications that have\nbeen published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our platform, our product\ncandidates or the use of our technologies.\nThus, it is possible that one or more third parties will hold patent rights to which we will need a license, which\nmay not be available on reasonable terms or at all. If such third parties refuse to grant us a license to such patent rights on\nreasonable terms or at all, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to redesign our technology, product\ncandidates or the methods for manufacturing our product candidates, or to develop or license replacement"

In such case, we may not be able to market such\ntechnology or product candidates and may not be able to perform research and development or other activities covered by\nthese patents. This could have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize our product candidates and our\nbusiness and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could negatively impact our\nbusiness.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on current or future technologies or product candidates in all countries\nthroughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors or other third parties may use our technologies in\njurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export\ninfringing products to territories where we have patent protection or licenses but enforcement is not as strong as that in the\nUnited States. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not\nbe effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nAdditionally, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as\nthe laws in the United States. Many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such\nrights in such jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, including certain developing countries, do not favor the\nenforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology, which could\nmake it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our owned and in-licensed patents or the marketing of competing\nproducts in violation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our owned or in-\nlicensed intellectual property and proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and could divert\nour efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Such proceedings could also put our owned or in-licensed\npatents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our owned or in-licensed patent applications at risk of\nnot issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us or our licensors. We or our licensors may not prevail\nin any lawsuits or other adversarial proceedings that we or our licensors initiate, and the damages or other remedies\nawarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our and our licensors’ efforts to enforce such\nintellectual property and proprietary rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial\nadvantage from the intellectual property that we develop or in-license.\nFurther, many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant\nlicenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or\ngovernment contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish\nthe value of its patents. If we or any of our licensors are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents\nrelevant to our business, our competitive position in the relevant jurisdiction may be impaired and our business prospects\nmay be materially adversely affected.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing, misappropriating or violating their\nintellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse impact on the\nsuccess of our business.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, upon our ability or the ability of our potential future collaborators to\ndevelop, manufacture, market and sell our current or any future product candidates and to use our proprietary technologies\nwithout infringing, misappropriating or violating the proprietary and intellectual property rights of third parties. The\nbiotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive and complex litigation regarding patents and\nother intellectual property rights.\nWe or our licensors, or any future strategic partners, may be party to, or be threatened with, adversarial\nproceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our current or any potential future product\ncandidates and technologies, including derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference\nproceedings before the USPTO and similar proceedings in jurisdictions outside of the United States such as opposition\nproceedings. In some instances, we may be required to indemnify our licensors for the costs associated with any such\nadversarial proceedings or litigation. For example, we are obligated under our license agreement with Stanford University\nto indemnify, hold harmless and defend Stanford University for damages from any claim of any kind arising"

Third parties may assert infringement claims against us,\nour licensors or our strategic partners based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future, regardless of\ntheir merit. There is a risk that third parties may choose to engage in litigation or other adversarial proceedings with us, our\nlicensors or our strategic partners to enforce or otherwise assert their patent rights. Even if we believe such claims are\nwithout merit, a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid, enforceable and\ninfringed, which could have a material adverse impact on our ability to utilize our discovery platform or to commercialize\nour current or any future product candidates. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any such U.S. patent in\nfederal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity by presenting clear and convincing evidence of\ninvalidity. There is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction, even if presented with evidence we believe to be\nclear and convincing, would invalidate the claims of any such U.S. patent.\nFurther, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve such adversarial\nproceedings or litigation. If we are unable to successfully settle future claims on terms acceptable to us, we may be\nrequired to engage in or to continue costly, unpredictable and time-consuming litigation and may be prevented from or\nexperience substantial delays in marketing our product candidates. If we, or our licensors, or any future strategic partners\nare found to infringe, misappropriate or violate a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could be\nrequired to pay damages, including treble damages and attorney’s fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed. In\naddition, we, or our licensors, or any future strategic partners may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from a\nthird party, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Even if a license can be obtained on\ncommercially reasonable terms, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same\ntechnology or intellectual property rights licensed to us, and we could be required to make substantial licensing and royalty\npayments. We also could be forced, including by court order, to cease utilizing, developing, manufacturing and\ncommercializing our discovery platform or product candidates deemed to be infringing. We may be forced to redesign\ncurrent or future technologies or products. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our ability to\ngenerate revenue or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our\noperations.\nIn addition, we or our licensors may find it necessary to pursue claims or to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce\nour owned or in-licensed patent or other intellectual property rights. The cost to us in defending or initiating any litigation\nor other proceeding relating to our owned or in-licensed patent or other intellectual property rights, even if resolved in our\nfavor, could be substantial, and any litigation or other proceeding would divert our management’s attention. Such litigation\nor proceedings could materially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities\nor any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. Some of our competitors may be able to more effectively to sustain\nthe costs of complex patent litigation because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the\ninitiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could delay our research and development efforts and\nmaterially limit our ability to continue our operations. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery\nrequired in connection with certain such proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be\ncompromised by disclosure. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other\ninterim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, such\nannouncements could have a material adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock.\nIf we or our licensors were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of\nour product candidates or our technology, the defendant could counterclaim that such patent is invalid or unenforceable. In\npatent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace.\nGrounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example,\nclaiming patent-ineligible subject matter, lack of novelty, indefiniteness, lack of written description, non-enablement,\nanticipation or obviousness. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with\nprosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during\nprosecution. The outcome of such invalidity and unenforceability claims is unpredictable. With respect to the validity\nquestion, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we or our licensors and the\npatent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or\nunenforceability, we could lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection for one or more of our product\ncandidates or certain aspects of our platform technology.

Patents and other intellectual\nproperty rights also will not protect our product candidates and technologies if competitors or third parties design around\nsuch product candidates and technologies without legally infringing, misappropriating or violating our owned or in-\nlicensed patents or other intellectual property rights.\nIntellectual property rights of third parties could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our current or future\ntechnologies or product candidates, and we might be required to litigate or obtain licenses from third parties to develop\nor market our current or future technologies or product candidates, which may not be available on commercially\nreasonable terms or at all.\nBecause the antibody landscape is still evolving, it is difficult to conclusively assess our freedom to operate\nwithout infringing, misappropriating or violating third-party rights. There are numerous companies that have pending\npatent applications and issued patents broadly covering antibodies generally or covering antibodies directed against the\nsame targets as, or targets similar to, those we are pursuing. Our competitive position may materially suffer if patents\nissued to third parties or other third-party intellectual property rights cover our current or future technologies product\ncandidates or elements thereof or our manufacture or uses relevant to our development plans. In such cases, we may not be\nin a position to develop or commercialize current or future technologies, product candidates unless we successfully pursue\nlitigation to nullify or invalidate the third-party intellectual property right concerned, or enter into a license agreement with\nthe intellectual property right holder, if available on commercially reasonable terms. There may be issued patents of which\nwe are not aware, held by third parties that, if found to be valid and enforceable, could be alleged to be infringed by our\ncurrent or future technologies or product candidates. There also may be pending patent applications of which we are not\naware that may result in issued patents, which could be alleged to be infringed by our current or future technologies or\nproduct candidates. If such an infringement claim should successfully be brought, we may be required to pay substantial\ndamages or be forced to abandon our current or future technologies or product candidates or to seek a license from any\npatent holders. No assurances can be given that a license will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nThird party intellectual property right holders may also actively bring infringement, misappropriation or violation\nor other claims alleging violations of intellectual property rights against us. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to\nsuccessfully settle or otherwise resolve such claims. If we are unable to successfully settle future claims on terms\nacceptable to us, we may be required to engage in or to continue costly, unpredictable and time-consuming litigation and\nmay be prevented from or experience substantial delays in marketing our product candidates. If we fail in any such dispute,\nin addition to being forced to pay damages, we may be temporarily or permanently prohibited from commercializing any of\nour current or future technologies or product candidates that are held to be infringing, misappropriating or otherwise\nviolating third-party intellectual property rights. We might, if possible, also be forced to redesign current or future\ntechnologies or product candidates so that we no longer infringe, misappropriate or violate the third-party intellectual\nproperty rights. Any of these events, even if we were ultimately to prevail, could require us to divert substantial financial\nand management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be\nharmed.\nAs referenced above, in addition to seeking patent protection for certain aspects of our current or future\ntechnologies and product candidates, we also consider trade secrets, including confidential and unpatented know-how,\nimportant to the maintenance of our competitive position. However, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect.\nWe protect and plan to protect trade secrets and confidential and unpatented know-how, in part, by entering into non-\ndisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to such knowledge, such as our employees,\ncorporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other\nthird parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and\nconsultants under which they are obligated to maintain confidentiality and to assign their inventions to us. Despite these\nefforts, we may not obtain these agreements in all circumstances. Moreover, individuals with whom we have such\nagreements may not comply with their terms.

We may also become involved in inventorship disputes relating to inventions and patents developed by our\nemployees or consultants under such agreements. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a\ntrade secret, or securing title to an employee- or consultant-developed invention if a dispute arises, is difficult, expensive\nand time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts in the United States and certain foreign\njurisdictions disfavor or are unwilling to protect trade secrets. Further, if any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully\nobtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent that competitor from using the\ntechnology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently\ndeveloped by a competitor, our competitive position would be materially and adversely harmed.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade\nsecrets or other proprietary information of our employees’ or consultants’ former employers or their clients.\nMany of our employees or consultants and our licensors’ employees or consultants were previously employed at\nuniversities or biotechnology or biopharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may\nbe subject to claims that one or more of these employees or consultants or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or\ndisclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of former employers. Litigation or arbitration may be necessary to\ndefend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose\nvaluable intellectual property rights or personnel or may be enjoined from using such intellectual property. Any such\nproceedings and possible aftermath would likely divert significant resources from our core business, including distracting\nour technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. A loss of key research personnel or their work\nproduct could limit our ability to commercialize, or prevent us from commercializing, our current or future technologies or\nproduct candidates, which could materially harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against any such\nclaims, litigation or arbitration could result in substantial costs and could be a distraction to management.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document\nsubmission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection\ncould be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other government fees on patents or\napplications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various government patent agencies outside of the United States over\nthe lifetime of our owned and in-licensed patents or applications and any patent rights we may own or in-license in the\nfuture. The USPTO and various non-U.S. government patent agencies require compliance with several procedural,\ndocumentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law\nfirms and other professionals to help us comply with these requirements, and we are also dependent on our licensors to take\nthe necessary action to comply with these requirements with respect to our in-licensed intellectual property. In many cases,\nan inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. There\nare situations, however, in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application,\nresulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors\nmight be able to enter the market with similar or identical products or platforms, which could have a material adverse effect\non our business prospects and financial condition.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in\nour markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic or determined to be\ninfringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names or may be forced\nto stop using these names, which we use for name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest.\nIf we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete\neffectively and our business may be materially adversely affected."

It is\nimpossible to predict when or if ATRC-101 or any potential future product candidates will prove effective and safe in\nhumans or will receive regulatory approval. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of\nany product candidate, we must complete preclinical studies and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the\nsafety and efficacy of that product candidate in humans. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete,\nand its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the development process. The results of\npreclinical studies and early clinical trials of any of our current or potential future product candidates may not be predictive\nof the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired\nsafety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of\ncompanies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of\nefficacy or safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials.\nWe may experience delays in completing our preclinical studies and initiating or completing clinical trials of\nATRC-101 or potential future product candidates. We do not know whether planned preclinical studies and clinical trials\nwill be completed on schedule or at all, or whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll\npatients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all.

Further, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, our partners,\nthe IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, the Data Safety Monitoring Board for such trial or by\nthe FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in\naccordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by\nthe FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse\nside effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug or therapeutic biologic, changes in governmental regulations\nor administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. If we experience delays in the\ncompletion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of any of our current or potential future product candidates, the\ncommercial prospects of such product candidate will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue from such\nproduct candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow our\nproduct development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue.\nAny of these occurrences may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical\ntrials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our current or potential future product candidates.\nWe may be unable to obtain U.S. or foreign regulatory approval and, as a result, be unable to commercialize ATRC-101\nor potential future product candidates.\nATRC-101 and any potential future product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating\nto, among other things, research, testing, development, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, approval, recordkeeping, reporting,\nlabeling, storage, packaging, advertising and promotion, pricing, marketing and distribution of drugs and therapeutic\nbiologics. Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process are required to be\nsuccessfully completed in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new drug or therapeutic biologic can be\nmarketed. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time-consuming, uncertain and subject to\nunanticipated delays. It is possible that none of the product candidates we may develop will obtain the regulatory approvals\nnecessary for us or our potential future partners to begin selling them.\nWe have very limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory\napprovals, including approval by the FDA. The time required to obtain FDA and other approvals is unpredictable but\ntypically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the type, complexity and\nnovelty of the product candidate.

While we believe\nthese product candidates are regulated as therapeutic biologics that are subject to requirements for review and approval of a\nBiologics License Application, or BLA, by the FDA, the lack of policies, practices or guidelines may hinder or slow\nreview by the FDA of any regulatory filings that we may submit. Moreover, the FDA may respond to these submissions by\ndefining requirements we may not have anticipated. Such responses could lead to significant delays in the clinical\ndevelopment of these product candidates, including ATRC-101. In addition, because there may be approved treatments for\nsome of the diseases for which we may seek approval, in order to receive regulatory approval, we may need to demonstrate\nthrough clinical trials that the current or potential future product candidates we develop to treat these diseases, if any, are\nnot only safe and effective, but safer or more effective than existing products.\nAny delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to\ngenerate revenue from the particular product candidate for which we are seeking approval. Further, we and our potential\nfuture partners may never receive approval to market and commercialize any product candidate. Even if we or a potential\nfuture partner obtains regulatory approval, the approval may be for targets, disease indications or patient populations that\nare not as broad as we intended or desired or may require labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or\nsafety warnings. We or a potential future partner may be subject to post-marketing testing requirements to maintain\nregulatory approval. If ATRC-101 or any of our potential future product candidates prove to be ineffective, unsafe or\ncommercially unviable, we may have to re-engineer ATRC-101 or our potential future product candidates, and our entire\npipeline could have little, if any, value, which could require us to change our focus and approach to antibody discovery and\ndevelopment, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations\nand prospects.\nWe are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of\nclinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory\napproval process varies among countries and may include all of the risks associated with FDA approval described above as\nwell as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Moreover, the time required to\nobtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by\nregulatory authorities outside the United States and vice versa.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for any of our current or potential future product candidates, we will be subject\nto ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense.\nAdditionally, our current or potential future product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other\nrestrictions and market withdrawal and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements\nor experience unanticipated problems with our products.\nAny regulatory approvals that we or potential future partners obtain for ATRC-101 or any potential future product\ncandidate may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which a product may be marketed or to the\nconditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including ‘‘Phase 4’’ clinical\ntrials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of such product candidate.

We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government\nregulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are\nslow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are\nnot able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may\nnot achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nWe may attempt to secure approval from the FDA through the use of accelerated registration pathways. If unable to\nobtain approval under an accelerated pathway, we may be required to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical\ntrials which could increase the expense of obtaining, reduce the likelihood of obtaining or delay the timing of obtaining,\nnecessary marketing approvals. Even if we receive approval for accelerated registration pathways from the FDA, if our\nconfirmatory trials do not verify clinical benefit, or if we do not comply with rigorous post-marketing requirements, the\nFDA may seek to withdraw accelerated approval.\nWe may seek an accelerated approval development pathway for our product candidates, including ATRC-101.\nUnder the accelerated approval provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and the FDA’s\nimplementing regulations, the FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product designed to treat a serious or life-\nthreatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect\non a surrogate endpoint or intermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA\nconsiders a clinical benefit to be a positive therapeutic effect that is clinically meaningful in the context of a given disease.\nFor the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic\nimage, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit.\nAn intermediate clinical endpoint is a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity\nor mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. The\naccelerated approval development pathway may be used in cases in which the advantage of a new drug over available\ntherapy may not be a direct therapeutic advantage, but is a clinically important improvement from a patient and public\nhealth perspective. If granted, accelerated approval is contingent on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent\nmanner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical profile or risks and benefits\nfor accelerated approval. The FDA may require that any such confirmatory study be initiated or substantially underway\nprior to the submission of an application for accelerated approval. If such post-approval studies fail to confirm the drug’s\nclinical profile or risks and benefits, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug.\nIf we choose to pursue accelerated approval, we intend to seek feedback from the FDA or will otherwise evaluate\nour ability to seek and receive such accelerated approval. There can be no assurance that, after our evaluation of the\nfeedback from the FDA or other factors, we will decide to pursue or submit a BLA for accelerated approval or any other\nform of expedited development, review or approval. Furthermore, if we submit an application for accelerated approval,\nthere can be no assurance that such application will be accepted or that approval will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.\nThe FDA also could require us to conduct further studies or trials prior to considering our application or granting approval\nof any type. We might not be able to fulfill the FDA’s requirements in a timely manner, which would cause delays, or\napproval might not be granted because our submission is deemed incomplete by the FDA.\nEven if we receive accelerated approval from the FDA, we will be subject to rigorous post-marketing\nrequirements, including the completion of confirmatory post-market clinical trials to verify the clinical benefit of the\nproduct, and submission to the FDA of all promotional materials prior to their dissemination.

Further, in the United States, there have been and continue to be a\nnumber of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was\nenacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and\nsignificantly impacted the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA was intended to broaden access to health insurance,\nreduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency\nrequirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and\nimpose additional health policy reforms, and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental\nand private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court\ndismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual\nmandate” was repealed by Congress. Further, the IRA, among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals\npurchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut\nhole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-\npocket cost and through a newly established manufacturer discount program. The ACA may be subject to additional\njudicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform\nmeasures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.\nAdditionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which manufacturers\nset prices for their marketed products. For example, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries, Presidential\nexecutive orders, and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more\ntransparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform\ngovernment program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden\nadministration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions\naimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health\nand Human Services, or HHS, released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for\ndrug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these\nprinciples. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (1) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-source drugs\nand biologics covered under Medicare and (2) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize\nprice increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although\nthey may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but it is likely to have a\nsignificant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order\non October 14, 2022, directing HHS to report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further\nleveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. At the state level,\nlegislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and\nbiological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product\naccess and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation\nfrom other countries and bulk purchasing. These new laws and initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare\nand other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our future customers and accordingly, our\nfinancial operations."

The FDA has significant post-market authority, including the authority\nto require labeling changes based on new safety information and to require post-market studies or clinical trials to evaluate\nsafety risks related to the use of a product or to require withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA also has the\nauthority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or a REMS, after approval, which may impose further\nrequirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug or therapeutic biologic.

Patients who are prescribed\nmedications for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs\nassociated with their prescription drugs. Coverage and adequate reimbursement from government healthcare programs,\nsuch as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurers are critical to new product acceptance. Patients are unlikely to\nuse our future products, if any, unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of\nthe cost. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, once approved, will\napply to our companion diagnostics.\nCost-containment is a priority in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere. As a result, government authorities\nand other third party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for\nparticular medications. Increasingly, third party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined\ndiscounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Third-party payors also may request\nadditional clinical evidence beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, requiring a company to conduct\nexpensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of its product.\nCommercial third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their\nreimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations.\nTherefore, coverage and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products in the U.S. can differ significantly from payor to\npayor. We cannot be sure that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be available for any product that we\ncommercialize and, if reimbursement is available, that the level of reimbursement will be adequate. Coverage and\nreimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nIf coverage and reimbursement are not available or are available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully\ncommercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Further, coverage policies and third-party\nreimbursement rates may change at any time. Therefore, even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained,\nless favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nAdditionally, the regulations that govern regulatory approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drugs and\ntherapeutic biologics vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug or\ntherapeutic biologic before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing\napproval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing\ngovernmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a product\nin a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly\nfor lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that\ncountry. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates,\neven if our product candidates obtain regulatory approval.\nWe are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws with respect to our operations and\nnon-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal or civil liability and harm our business.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the U.S. domestic\nbribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and possibly other state and\nnational anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are\ninterpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, third-party intermediaries, joint venture partners\nand collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits\nto recipients in the public or private sector. We interact with officials and employees of government agencies and\ngovernment-affiliated hospitals, universities and other organizations. In addition, we may engage third-party intermediaries\nto promote our clinical research activities abroad or to obtain necessary permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals.\nWe can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third party intermediaries,"

Noncompliance with anti-corruption and anti-\nmoney laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution,\nother enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or\ninjunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational\nharm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas, investigations or other enforcement\nactions are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or\ncriminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition,\nresponding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and\nsignificant defense and compliance costs and other professional fees. In certain cases, enforcement authorities may even\ncause us to appoint an independent compliance monitor which can result in added costs and administrative burdens.\nComprehensive tax reform bills could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 20, 2017, the U.S. Congress passed the Tax Act, enacting comprehensive tax legislation that\nincludes significant changes to the taxation of business entities. These changes include, among others: a permanent\nreduction to the corporate income tax rate; a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense; a shift of\nthe U.S. taxation of multinational corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a territorial system (along with certain\nrules designed to prevent erosion of the U.S. income tax base); and a one-time tax on accumulated offshore earnings held\nin cash and illiquid assets, with the latter taxed at a lower rate. In addition, the IRA, among other things, imposes a\nminimum tax on the book income of certain large corporations and an excise tax on certain corporate stock repurchases.\nNotwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of this tax reform remains uncertain, and\nour business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities\nanalysts, each of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations.

For\nexample, these stockholders could delay or prevent a change of control of our company, even if such a change of control\nwould benefit our other stockholders, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for\ntheir Class A common stock as part of a sale of our company or our assets and might affect the prevailing market price of\nour Class A common stock. The significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our\nClass A common stock due to investors’ perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nFuture sales and issuances of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock or rights to purchase Class A\ncommon stock or Class B common stock, including pursuant to our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, could result in\nadditional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital may be needed in the future to continue our planned operations,\nincluding further development of our discovery platform, preparing IND filings, conducting clinical trials,\ncommercialization efforts, and expanded research and development activities and costs. To raise capital, we may sell\nClass A common stock or Class B common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more\ntransactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell Class A common stock or Class B\ncommon stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales.\nSuch sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights,\npreferences and privileges senior to the holders of our Class A common stock.\nPursuant to our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2019 Plan, our management is authorized to grant stock options\nand other stock-based awards, including RSUs, to our employees, directors and consultants.

Unless our board of directors elects not to increase the number of shares available for\nfuture grant each year, our stockholders may experience additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe are an ‘‘emerging growth company’’ and our election of reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging\ngrowth companies may make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an ‘‘emerging growth company’’ as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act. For\nas long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting\nrequirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being\nrequired to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404,\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and\nexemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder\napproval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to\nfive years following the completion of our initial public offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status\nearlier, including if we are deemed to be a ‘‘large accelerated filer,’’ which occurs when the market value of our Class A\ncommon stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, or if we have total annual gross\nrevenue of $1.235 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, in which cases we would no longer be an\nemerging growth company as of the following December 31, or if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt\nduring any three-year period before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company\nimmediately. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we could still qualify as a ‘‘smaller\nreporting company,’’ which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure\nrequirements including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 and reduced\ndisclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if\ninvestors will find our Class A common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions."

We have elected to avail ourselves of an exemption that\nallows us to delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private\ncompanies. As a result, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies\nthat comply with the public company effective dates, including but not limited to the new lease accounting standard. We\nmay also elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result of these elections, the\ninformation that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting\ncompanies. However, if we later decide to opt out of the extended period for adopting new accounting standards, we would\nneed to disclose such decision and it would be irrevocable.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to\ndevote substantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will incur\nsignificant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Select Global\nMarket, or Nasdaq, and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies,\nincluding establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices.\nOur management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives.\nMoreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities\nmore time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and\nmore expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to\nattract and retain qualified members of our board of directors. However, these rules and regulations are often subject to\nvarying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may\nevolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing\nuncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance\npractices.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that\nundergoes an ‘‘ownership change’’ is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating loss or tax\ncredits to offset future taxable income. Our existing net operating losses, or NOLs, or credits may be subject to substantial\nlimitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change our ability to utilize NOLs or\ncredits could be further limited by Section 382 of the Code. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, many of\nwhich are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs or credits\nmay also be impaired under state law. Accordingly, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs or credits.\nFurthermore, our ability to utilize our NOLs or credits is conditioned upon our attaining profitability and generating U.S.\nfederal and state taxable income. As described above under ‘‘—Risks Related to Business,’’ we have incurred significant\nnet losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future; thus,\nwe do not know whether or when we will generate the U.S. federal or state taxable income necessary to utilize our NOLs\nor credits.\nWe may incur significant costs from class action litigation due to expected volatility of the price of our Class A common\nstock.\nThe price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate for many reasons, including as a result of public\nannouncements regarding the progress of our development efforts for our discovery platform and our product candidates,\nthe development efforts of future partners or competitors, the addition or departure of our key personnel, variations in our\nquarterly operating results and changes in market valuations of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set \nforth elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes \nforward-looking statements that involves risks and uncertainties. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements” and “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for a discussion of forward-looking statements\nand important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the\nforward-looking statements. All information presented herein is based on our fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated,\nreferences to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to our fiscal years ended December 31 and the associated\nquarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company utilizing our differentiated platform primarily to discover and\ndevelop novel antibody-based therapeutics to treat a range of solid tumor types. While more traditional oncology drug\ndiscovery approaches attempt to generate antibodies against known targets, our approach relies on the human immune\nsystem to direct us to unique antibody-target pairs from patients experiencing a clinically meaningful, active immune\nresponse against their tumors. These unique antibody-target pairs represent a potentially novel and previously unexplored\nlandscape of oncology targets. We believe the fact that our approach has the potential to deliver novel, previously\nunexplored oncology targets provides us with a significant competitive advantage over traditional approaches, which focus\non known targets that many companies are aware of and can pursue. We have utilized our drug discovery approach to\nidentify over 2,000 distinct human antibodies that bind preferentially to tumor tissue from patients who are not the source\nof the antibody.\nOur most advanced product candidate, ATRC-101, is a monoclonal antibody with a novel mechanism of action\nand target derived from an antibody identified using our discovery platform. ATRC-101 reacts in vitro with a majority of\nhuman ovarian, non-small cell lung, colorectal and breast cancer samples from multiple patients. It has demonstrated\nrobust anti-tumor activity as a single agent in multiple preclinical models, including one model in which PD-1 checkpoint\ninhibitors typically display limited activity. In 2020, we commenced clinical development of ATRC-101 with a Phase 1b\nclinical trial evaluating ATRC-101 as a monotherapy in patients with select solid tumors which is ongoing, and in 2021 we\nexpanded clinical development by opening a new cohort to evaluate ATRC-101 in combination with pembrolizumab, a PD-\n1 checkpoint inhibitor. In 2022, we began limiting enrollment of subjects in our clinical trials to those with biopsies\npositive for the target of ATRC-101 as determined by a CAP-CLIA certified assay. To date, ATRC-101 continues to be well\ntolerated, and we have observed longer progression free survival in patients with high target expression in this study.\nEnrollment in both cohorts is ongoing, and 69 participants have been enrolled and dosed as of December 31, 2022. We\nexpect additional data from both cohorts over the course of 2023, and and we expect to make potential Phase 2\ndevelopment decisions in late 2023.\nOur efforts beyond ATRC-101 are focused on expanding our clinical pipeline by advancing additional product\ncandidates using our discovery platform. We expect the focus of our pre-clinical development efforts will be on lead-stage\noncology programs, including APN-497444, an ADC against a novel tumor glycan target, and APN-346958, a CD3\nbispecific T-cell engager against an RNA-binding protein target. We continue to aim for one additional IND per year in\noncology with our next IND targeted in late 2024. In addition, we continue to develop our platform capabilities and to\nexpand the weaponization technologies we have access to so that we can combine the novel antibodies that are generated\nby our platform with these antibody weaponization technologies to generate clinical candidates. In February 2023, we\nannounced the first joint program, mutually selected with Xencor, Inc., or Xencor, for advancement under our existing\nstrategic collaboration, combining an Atreca-discovered antibody with Xencor’s XmAb® bispecific Fc domain and a\ncytotoxic T-cell binding domain or CD3. The joint program is based on APN-346958, an Atreca-discovered antibody.\nAPN-346958 recognizes an RNA-binding protein that is normally sequestered in the nucleus but is mislocalized to the cell\nsurface in tumors. In preclinical studies, the XmAb bispecific antibody engineered against APN-346958’s target has\ndemonstrated compelling anti-tumor activity and robust immune activation as evidenced by an"

Atreca and Xencor targeted to name\na candidate from the program later in 2023, and Atreca targets an IND submission by early 2025.\nIn April 2022, we provided an update on our preclinical pipeline in oncology, and we announced our next clinical\ncandidate, ATRC-301. ATRC-301 is an antibody drug conjugate, or ADC, that selectively targets a novel, membrane-\nproximal epitope on erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor A2, or EphA2. We initiated IND-enabling studies for\nATRC-301, including a non-human primate toxicology study in September 2022. In November 2022, we announced that\nthis study revealed safety signals, including bleeding, and as a result, we discontinued the development of ATRC-301. We\ncontinue to evaluate our anti-EphA2 antibodies in multiple weaponized formats.\nBeyond oncology, in October 2021, we entered into a licensing agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical\nResearch Institute or Gates MRI to allow Gates MRI to develop and commercialize MAM01/ATRC-501 for the prevention\nof malaria in GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, eligible countries located in malaria-endemic regions of the world, to advance its\ncharitable purposes. MAM01/ATRC-501 is an engineered version of an antibody that we discovered using our platform\nthat targets the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum, the protozoan that causes the deadliest form of\nmalaria. In November 2022, we announced that an IND for MAM01/ATRC-501 is expected to be filed by Gates MRI in\nthe first half of 2023, and that Gates MRI expects to commence clinical development by the second half of 2023. We retain\ncommercial rights in the U.S., Europe and parts of Asia, and potential product development opportunities in those regions\ninclude prevention of malaria for those traveling to malaria endemic regions.\nWe commenced operations in 2010, and have since devoted substantially all our resources to research and\ndevelopment, identifying product candidates, undertaking preclinical studies, conducting clinical trials, raising capital,\nbuilding our management team and building our intellectual property portfolio. We do not have any products approved for\nmarketing or sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient\nto achieve or sustain profitability will depend on the successful development, regulatory approval and eventual\ncommercialization of one or more of our current or future product candidates.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through equity offerings of our securities. Our net losses were\n$97.2 million and $109.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022,\nwe had an accumulated deficit of $456.9 million. We anticipate that a substantial portion of our capital resources and\nefforts in the foreseeable future will be focused on discovering, completing the necessary development, obtaining\nregulatory approval for and preparing for potential commercialization of product candidates. As of December 31, 2022, we\nhad cash, cash equivalents and investments of $70.5 million. Although it is difficult to predict our funding requirements,\nwe anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2022, should enable us to fund\nour operations for at least the next 12 months, assuming our programs and collaborations advance as currently\ncontemplated.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our\nnet losses may fluctuate significantly from period to period, depending on the timing of our planned preclinical studies and\nclinical trials and expenditures on other research and development activities. We expect our expenses will increase\nsubstantially over time as we:\n◾\ncomplete clinical trials for ATRC-101 and initiate preclinical studies on any additional product candidates\nthat we may pursue in the future;\n◾\ncontinue research and development to expand our growing library of more than 2,000 antibodies and develop\npotential future product candidates from that collection;\n◾\ncontinue to invest in advancing our differentiated discovery platform, and the underlying technologies;\n◾\nseek marketing approvals for product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n◾\nmaintain, protect and expand our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and\nknow-how;\n◾\nimplement additional operational, financial and management systems; and\n◾\nattract, hire and retain additional administrative, clinical, regulatory and research personnel."

Those costs consisted predominantly of the costs associated with \nthe ongoing clinical studies as well as process development and manufacturing costs of ATRC-101 utilized in the studies.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses incurred during the respective periods:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, \n    \n2022\n    \n2021\n(in thousands)\nPersonnel related (including stock‑based compensation)\n$  17,113\n$  17,135\nConsulting, legal and other services\n \n 4,585\n \n 3,219\nFacility related\n \n 2,823\n \n 3,509\nOther\n \n 6,945\n \n 8,091\nTotal general and administrative expenses\n$  31,466\n$  31,954\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $0.5 million, or 2%, during the year ended December 31, 2022\ncompared to the same period in 2021. The decrease is attributable to a one-time $1.5 million cease-use expense recognized\nin the third quarter of 2021 as a result of vacating the South San Francisco office space, and lower facility related costs of\n$0.7 million due to the completion of San Carlos premises construction offset by a $1.4 million increase in consulting,\nlegal and other services attributable to an increase in legal activities related to license agreements.\nAsset Impairments\nIn December 2022, the Company identified certain long-lived assets no longer utilized under current or expected\nfuture operations. Accordingly, the Company recognized impairment expense of $0.4 million in 2022. The Company did\nnot record any impairment of long-lived assets in 2021.\nOther Income\nOther income is comprised of amounts earned from research and discovery services provided to partners under\nservice agreements. Other income decreased by $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the\nsame period in 2021 due to the completion of the services provided to a third party partner.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased to $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $0.2 million\nduring the year ended December 31, 2021 due primarily to a significant increase in market interest rates, partially offset by\na decrease in the investment balance.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources; Plan of Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $70.5 million. Our cash and\ncash equivalents primarily consist of bank deposits and money market funds. Our investments consist of U.S. government\ntreasury and agency securities and corporate debt securities."

      "text": "Table of Contents\n- 76 -\nDue to our significant research and development expenditures, we have generated significant operating losses\nsince inception. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of convertible preferred stock and common\nstock.\nIn July 2020, we issued and sold 7,642,125 shares of our Class A common stock, and 781,250 shares of our Class\nB common stock at an offering price of $16.00 per share. The net proceeds to us from this offering was $126.1 million after\ndeducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $8.1 million and other offering expenses of $0.6 million.\nIn August 2020, we entered into a sales agreement, or Sales Agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, or\nCowen, pursuant to which we may, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, issue and sell through\nCowen, acting as our sales agent and/or principal, shares of our Class A common stock, having an aggregate offering price\nof up to $100.0 million. As of December 31, 2022, we issued and sold 1,493,361 shares of our Class A common stock have\nbeen sold under the Sales Agreement. The net proceeds from the sales was $7.9 million after deducting underwriting fee of\n$0.3 million and issuance costs of $0.3 million. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $456.9\nmillion.\nOur management evaluates whether there are relevant conditions and events that in the aggregate raise substantial\ndoubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and to meet our obligations as they become due within one year\nfrom the date that the financial statements are issued. This evaluation initially does not take into consideration the potential\nmitigating effect of our plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued. When\nsubstantial doubt exists under this methodology, we evaluate whether the mitigating effect of our plans sufficiently\nalleviate substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of our plans, however, is\nonly considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that\nthe financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant\nconditions or events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the\ndate that the financial statements are issued. In performing this analysis, we excluded certain elements of our operating\nplan that cannot be considered probable.\nOur expectation to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows in the future and the need for \nadditional funding to support our planned operations raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going \nconcern for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.  Management intends on completing \nadditional equity financing and reducing spending in fiscal 2023 and 2024. However, due to several factors, including those \noutside management’s control, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete additional equity \nfinancings.  If we are unable to complete additional financings, management’s plans include further reducing or delaying \noperating expenses. We have concluded the likelihood that our plan to successfully reduce expenses to align with our \navailable cash is probable. Accordingly, we believe our plan will be sufficient to alleviate substantial doubt for a period of \nat least 12 months from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our\noperations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially as a\nresult of a number of factors, including the factors discussed in “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nNonetheless, in order to advance our current and potential future product candidates through development and to regulatory\napproval and commercialization, we will need to raise significant additional capital and obtain funding or other resources\nthrough such arrangements. Neither may be possible and, as a result, we may be required to delay, scale back or\ndiscontinue development of such product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating\nresults and prospects.\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the biotechnology industry,\nincluding, but not limited to, development by competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel,\nprotection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations and the ability to secure additional capital to\nfund operations. Identification and development of product candidates will require significant additional research and\ndevelopment efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to\ncommercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel and"

Even if our drug development efforts are successful, it is\nuncertain when, if ever, we will realize significant revenue from product sales.\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the\nrealization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include\nany adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification\nof liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nWe expect our net losses to increase substantially as we continue clinical development of our lead product\ncandidate, ATRC-101. We have used substantial funds to develop our discovery platform and ATRC-101 and we will\ncontinue to require significant funds to continue to develop our discovery platform and conduct further research and\ndevelopment, including preclinical studies and clinical trials of ATRC-101 and additional potential future product\ncandidates, to seek regulatory approvals for ATRC-101 and potential future product candidates and to manufacture and\nmarket products, if any, that are approved for commercial sale. In addition, we expect to continue to incur additional costs\nassociated with operating as a public company. We may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a\ncombination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing\narrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in\nacquiring additional funding at levels sufficient to fund our operations or on terms favorable to us. If we are unable to\nobtain adequate financing when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or suspend one or more of our\npreclinical studies, clinical trials, research and development programs or commercialization efforts.\nIn July 2019, we entered into a lease agreement, or the San Carlos Lease, for the lease of approximately 99,557 \nrentable square feet of office space located in San Carlos, California.  The term of the San Carlos Lease commenced in \nAugust 2020, and the premises were delivered to us for the construction of certain tenant improvements. The term will end \nin April 2033. Base rent for the San Carlos Lease is $557,519 per month, with annual increases of 3%. We are obligated to \nmaintain a security deposit of $1.1 million in the form of a letter of credit. The operating lease obligations discussed in \nNote 8, Leases, in our Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLeases represent operating lease obligations related to the San Carlos Lease.\nIn addition, we enter into contracts in the normal course of business with contract research organizations for\npreclinical and clinical studies as well as with contract development manufacturing organizations for the manufacture of\nmaterials for those studies. These agreements generally provide for termination at the request of either party with less than\none-year notice and are, therefore, cancelable contracts and not reflected in the table above.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, \n    \n2022\n    \n2021\n(in thousands)\nCash used in operating activities\n$\n \n(80,721)\n$\n \n(60,920)\nCash provided by investing activities\n   12,548\n   89,237\nCash provided by financing activities\n \n 3,903\n \n 5,446\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted\ncash\n$\n \n(64,270)\n$ 33,763\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, cash used in operating activities was $80.7 million, which consisted of a\nnet loss of $97.2 million and a net change of $8.0 million in our net operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by $24.5\nmillion in non-cash charges.

The non-cash charges consisted of depreciation and amortization of $5.5\nmillion, stock-based compensation of $16.9 million and amortization of right-of-use asset of $1.6 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in operating activities was $60.9 million, which consisted of a\nnet loss of $109.3 million, partially offset by $23.0 million in non-cash charges and a net change of $25.4 million in our net\noperating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges consisted of depreciation and amortization of $4.6 million and stock-\nbased compensation of $16.9 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $16.7 million\nincrease in deferred rent because of increased lease incentive obligations and a $5.4 million increase in accrued expenses\nattributable to the accrual of the Company’s cease use liabilities and a higher contract manufacturing accrual, a $3.0 million\ndecrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets attributable to decrease in tenant improvement receivable from the\nCompany’s leasehold improvement construction for San Carlos location and a $1.3 million increase in account payables\nmainly due to increase in payable balance for contractual manufacturers. These activities were partially offset by a $0.9\nmillion decrease in other current liabilities attributable to a decrease in contract liabilities from our completion of services\nprovided to an external partner.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by investing activities of $12.5 million was primarily\nrelated to $13.4 million in net proceeds from maturities of investments, partially offset by $0.9 million in purchases of\nproperty and equipment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by investing activities of $89.2 million was primarily\nrelated to $124.3 million in net proceeds from maturities of investments, partially offset by $35.1 million in purchases of\nproperty and equipment, primarily related to leasehold improvements for the San Carlos Lease.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by financing activities was $3.9 million, which primarily\nrelated to $3.5 million of proceeds from the Class A common stock sales related to the Sales Agreement with Cowen and\nCompany, LLC, pursuant to which the Company may, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, issue\nand sell shares of its Class A common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million, net of underwriting\ndiscounts and commissions, $0.3 million and $0.1 million of proceeds from our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or\nESPP, and employee stock option exercises, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by financing activities was $5.4 million, which primarily\nrelated to $4.4 million proceeds from the common stock sales related to the ATM program, net of underwriting discounts\nand commissions, $0.8 million and $0.3 million of proceeds from our 2019 ESPP and employee stock option exercises,\nrespectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our\nfinancial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The\npreparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as\nthe reported revenue generated, and reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on\nour historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of\nwhich form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent\nfrom other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions."

Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting\nfrom the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to\nrecover the carrying amount of the assets, we write down the assets to their estimated fair values and recognize the loss in\nthe Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nResearch and Development Expenses and Accrued Research and Development Costs\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of personnel\ncosts for our research and product development employees. Also included are non-personnel costs such as professional fees\npayable to third parties for preclinical studies, clinical trials and research services, laboratory supplies and equipment\nmaintenance and depreciation, intellectual property licenses and other consulting costs.\nWe estimate preclinical studies, clinical trials and research expenses based on the services performed, pursuant to\ncontracts with research institutions that conduct and manage preclinical studies, clinical trials and research services on our\nbehalf. We estimate these expenses based on discussions with management and external service providers as to the\nprogress or stage of completion of services and the contracted fees to be paid for such services. We record the estimated\ncosts of research and development activities based upon the estimated amount services provided but not yet invoiced, and\ninclude these costs in development expenses. We accrue for these costs based on factors such as estimates of the work\ncompleted and in accordance with agreements established with our third party service provides under the service\nagreements. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued liabilities balance in each reporting\nperiod. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accrued liabilities. We have not experienced any material differences\nbetween accrued costs and actual costs incurred. However, the status and timing of actual services performed may vary\nfrom our estimates, resulting in adjustments to expense in future periods. Changes in these estimates that result in material\nchanges to our accruals could materially affect our results of operations. Payments associated with licensing agreements to\nacquire exclusive license to develop, use, manufacture and commercialize products that have not reached technological\nfeasibility and do not have alternate future use are expensed as incurred.\nPayments made to third parties under these arrangements in advance of the performance of the related services by\nthe third parties are recorded as prepaid expenses until the services are rendered. We evaluate these payments for current or\nlong-term classification based on when we expect to receive these services.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe maintain a stock-based compensation plan as a long-term incentive for employees, consultants and members\nof our board of directors. The plan allows for the issuance of non-statutory options, or NSOs, incentive stock options,\nrestricted stock and restricted stock units to employees and NSOs to nonemployees.\nStock-based payments are measured using fair-value-based measurements and recognized as compensation\nexpense over the service period in which the awards are expected to vest. Our fair-value-based measurements of awards to\nemployees and directors as of the grant date utilize the single-option award-valuation approach, and we use the straight-line\nmethod for expense attribution. The valuation model used for calculating the estimated fair value of stock awards is the\nBlack-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the\nvariables used in the calculations, including the expected term (weighted-average period of time that the options granted\nare expected to be outstanding), the expected volatility of our common stock, the related risk-free interest rate and the\nexpected dividend. We have elected to recognize forfeitures of stock-based payment awards as they occur.\nFor stock-based awards issued to non-employees, we record expense related to stock options based on the fair\nvalue of the options calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model over the service performance period."

      "text": "Table of Contents\n- 80 -\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions which determine the\nfair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions include:\n◾\nExpected Term.  The expected term represents the period that stock-based awards are expected to be \noutstanding. The expected term for option grants is determined using the simplified method. The simplified \nmethod deems the term to be the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the stock-based \nawards, as we do not have sufficient exercise history to determine a better estimate of expected term.\n◾\nExpected Volatility.  Since we have been privately held and do not have any trading history for our common \nstock, the expected volatility was estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded \nbiotechnology companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. The \ncomparable companies were chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty.\n◾\nRisk-Free Interest Rate.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect \nat the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of option.\n◾\nExpected Dividend.  We have never paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends \non our common stock. Therefore, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS\nAct. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued\nsubsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies.\nWe elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards,\nincluding but not limited to Topic 842, the new lease accounting standard, that have different effective dates for public and\nprivate companies until the earlier of the date that we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively\nand irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements\nmay not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public\ncompany effective dates. We early adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers, or Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, and Accounting Standards Update 2018-07, Improvements to\nNonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, or Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, as the JOBS Act does\nnot preclude an emerging growth company from early adopting a new or revised accounting standard earlier than the time\nthat such standard applies to private companies. We expect to use the extended transition period for any other new or\nrevised accounting standards during the period in which we remain an emerging growth company.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) December 31, 2024, (ii) the last day of our\nfirst fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of at least $1.235 billion, (iii) the date on which we are\ndeemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our voting and non-\nvoting common equity that is held by non-affiliates is equal to or exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th and (iv)\nthe date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year\nperiod.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor additional details, please refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our Notes to\nFinancial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nItem 7A.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe disclosures in this section are not required because we qualify as a smaller reporting company under federal\nsecurities laws."

As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control\nover financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

The Company is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company utilizing its differentiated\nplatform to discover and develop novel antibody-based immunotherapeutics to treat a range of solid tumor types. The\nCompany's lead product candidate, ATRC-101, is a monoclonal antibody in clinical development with a novel mechanism\nof action and target derived from an antibody identified using its discovery platform. The Company operates in a single\nsegment. Since inception, the Company has been primarily engaged in research and development, raising capital, building\nits management team and building its intellectual property portfolio.\n2.           Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America, or U.S. GAAP, and pursuant to the accounting and disclosure rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, include the accounts of the Company.\nGoing Concern\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 205-40, Going Concern, we evaluated whether\nthere are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a\ngoing concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. This evaluation initially does not take\ninto consideration the potential mitigating effect of our plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the\nfinancial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this methodology, we evaluate whether the mitigating\neffect of its plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating\neffect of our plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented\nwithin one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when\nimplemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a\ngoing concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. In performing this analysis, we\nexcluded certain elements of our operating plan that cannot be considered probable.\nOur expectation to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows in the future and the need for \nadditional funding to support our planned operations raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going \nconcern for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.  Management intends on completing \nadditional equity financing and reducing spending in fiscal 2023 and 2024. However, due to several factors, including those \noutside management’s control, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete additional equity \nfinancings.  If we are unable to complete additional financings, management’s plans include further reducing or delaying \noperating expenses. We have concluded the likelihood that our plan to successfully reduce expenses to align with our \navailable cash is probable. Accordingly, we believe our plan will be sufficient to alleviate substantial doubt for a period of \nat least 12 months from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements.3\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the\nrealization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include\nany adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification\nof liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of"

Actual results could differ from those estimates. Key estimates in the\nfinancial statements include estimated useful lives of property and equipment, impairment of long-lived assets, accrued\nexpenses, valuation of deferred income tax assets, fair value of available-for-sale debt securities, incremental borrowing\nrate used for lease accounting and fair value of options granted under the Company's stock option plan.\nOther Income\nOther income is comprised of amounts earned from services performed under service agreements. The Company\nfollows the provisions of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic\n606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or Topic 606. The guidance provides a unified model to determine how\nincome is recognized.\nIn determining the appropriate amount of other income to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under the\nagreements, the Company performs the following steps: (i) identifies the promised goods or services in the contract;\n(ii) determines whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in\nthe context of the contract; (iii) measures the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;\n(iv) allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations based on estimated selling prices; and (v) recognizes\nother income when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.\nThe Company generally allocates the transaction price to distinct performance obligations at their stand-alone\nselling prices, determined by their estimated costs plus some margin. Performance obligations are generally delivered over\ntime and recognized based upon observable inputs as the related research services are performed, which are recorded as\nresearch and development expenses. Amounts due under service agreements are generally billed monthly as services are\ndelivered and do not generally result in contract liabilities or assets. In February 2020, the Company entered into an\nagreement with an external partner for a research project to identify the antigenic targets of select antibodies discovered by\nthe Company with potential utility in oncology. The nonrefundable upfront payment from this agreement was classified as\na contract liability and the Company fully recognized the amount as other income over the service period of 18 months.\nIn March 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with a third party for the assignment of certain non-core\nintellectual property. The initial consideration was classified as other income and recognized upon completion of the\nassignment. The agreement provides for additional consideration in the event of commercial exploitation of the intellectual\nproperty. The term of the agreement extends to the date of expiration of the last to expire of any of the assigned patents.\nIn October, 2022, the Company entered into the Grant Agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\nunder which it was awarded a grant totaling up to $1.2 million for its malaria program. The parties amended the agreement \nin December 2022 to extend the grant term. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company  recognized $20,000\nof income related to the Grant Agreement and had $1.2 million of unused funds received recorded as deferred revenue\nwithin accrued and other current liabilities.\nThe Company recorded no receivables under service and license agreements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company recorded $13,000 receivable under service agreement included in prepaid expenses and other current assets\nas December 31, 2020. The Company recorded 1.2 million contract liabilities as of December 31, 2022. The Company\nrecorded zero and $0.8 million contract liabilities included in other current liabilities, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\nCollaborations\nHistorically, the Company has entered into a number of discovery collaborations as the Company developed its\ndiscovery platform. These collaborations have generally focused on identifying novel antibodies in areas of significant\nunmet medical need."

Up to two joint programs are eligible to\nbe mutually selected for further development and commercialization, with each partner sharing 50% of costs and profits.\nEach company has the option to lead development, regulatory and commercialization activities for one of the joint\nprograms. In addition, the Xencor Agreement allows each partner the option to pursue up to two programs independently,\nwith a mid-to high-single digit percent royalty payable on net sales to the other partner.\nThe Company evaluated the Xencor Agreement under the provisions of ASC 606 and ASU 2018-18,\nCollaborative Arrangements (Topic 808) Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606. The Company\nconcluded that Xencor, Inc. is not a customer as there are no distinct units of account that are reflective of a vendor-\ncustomer relationship or exchange of consideration for the research activities. The Company’s share of any collaboration\nexpense is recognized as an research and development expense on the Company’s statements of operations.\nFor the cost-sharing related to the research program, the Company will follow the presentation and disclosure\nguidance of ASC 808, Collaboration Agreements. The Company had a payable of $12,000 and a receivable of $25,000\nunder the research cost-sharing provision recorded in accrued expenses and prepaid and other current assets, respectively,\non the accompanying balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\nIn-Licensing Arrangements – Development\nIn April 2022, the Company entered into an Option and License Agreement, or Option and License Agreement, by\nand between the Company and Zymeworks Inc, or Zymeworks. The Company received a license under certain of\nZymeworks’ proprietary drug conjugate patents and know-how to perform preclinical research and development of\nantibody drug conjugates, or ADCs. The aggregate consideration for the research license is $5.0 million. The Company\nalso received an option to obtain an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture, and commercialize certain ADCs\nfor additional license fees and royalties. Unless earlier terminated or extended, the term of the research license and the\ncommercial option is two years from the effective date.\nThe Company will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one\nlicensed product and the Company will pay to Zymeworks an option exercise fee, and lump sum payments upon the\nachievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and commercial milestones. In addition, with respect to\neach licensed product, the Company will pay tiered royalties on net sales of licensed products at single-digit royalty rates.\nThe research license fee of $5.0 million was expensed to research and development expense in April 2022 in\naccordance with the Company's research and development expense policy.\nEmployee Retention Credit\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES Act, as amended by the further legislation,\nprovides an employee retention credit, or ERC, to eligible employers, which is a refundable tax credit against certain\nemployment taxes. In calendar 2021, the ERC was equal to 70% of qualified wages paid to employees up to $10,000 of\nqualified wages per employee for each of the first, second and third calendar quarters of 2021. The Company has\ndetermined that its aggregate eligible refundable credit for 2021 is $2.9 million. In May 2022, the Company filed the\nrequisite claims for the eligible 2021 ERC.\nThe Company classified the ERC amounts as a reduction to payroll expense. During the year ended December 31,\n2022, the Company recorded $2.4 million and $0.5 million related to the ERC within research and development expense\nand general and administrative expense, respectively, on the Company’s statements of operations. As of December 31,\n2022, the Company has a $2.9 million receivable balance from the United States government related to the CARES Act, \nwhich is recorded as other receivables in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” on the Company’s"

In January 2023, the Company received the entire balance of ERC of $2.9 million from Internal Revenue\nService.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly liquid investments purchased with an original\nmaturity of three months or less.\nThe Company maintained restricted cash of $1.1 million and $1.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. These amounts as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are included in deposits and other in the accompanying\nbalance sheets and is comprised solely of letters of credit required pursuant to leases for Company facilities.\nThe Company’s reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the balance sheets\nthat sum to the total of the same amounts shown in the statements of cash flows were as follows (in thousands):\n    \nDecember 31, \n    \nDecember 31, \n2022\n    \n2021\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n30,819\n$\n94,746\nRestricted cash\n1,115\n1,458\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the  statements of cash \nflows\n$\n31,934\n$\n96,204\nInvestments\nThe Company considers securities purchased with original maturities greater than three months to be investments.\nThe Company’s policy is to protect the value of its investment portfolio and minimize principal risk by earning returns\nbased on current interest rates. The Company’s intent is to convert all investments into cash to be used for operations and\nhas classified them as available for sale. For purposes of determining realized gains and losses, the cost of debt securities\nsold is based on specific identification. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in\ninterest income.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception. The Company measures lease\nliabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s leases generally do not\nprovide an implicit discount rate, the net present value of future minimum lease payments is determined using the\nCompany’s incremental borrowing rate. Options in the lease terms to extend or terminate the lease are not reflected in the\nlease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that any such option will be exercised.\nThe Company measures right-of-use assets at the lease commencement date based on the corresponding lease\nliabilities adjusted for (i) prepayments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date, (ii) initial direct costs\nincurred and (iii) certain tenant incentives under the lease. The Company evaluates the recoverability of the right-of-use\nassets for possible impairment in accordance with the long-lived assets policy. The Company has elected not to recognize\nright-of-use assets or lease liabilities for leases with an initial lease term of twelve months or less.\nThe Company’s lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees or covenants. Lease expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. Incentives granted under the Company’s facilities lease,\nincluding rent holidays, are recognized as adjustments to lease expense on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases.\nRefer to Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements included in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nand Note 8, Leases for additional information on the Company’s adoption of Topic 842."

Cash and cash equivalents are held at three financial institutions and were\nin excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurable limit at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Any loss incurred\nor a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Company's financial condition, results of\noperations, and cash flows. Additionally, cash and cash equivalents and investments are maintained at brokerage firms for\nwhich amounts are insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation subject to legal limits. The Company does not\nrequire collateral or other security for other receivables.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line\nmethod with the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from two to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized\nover the estimated useful life of the asset, or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter. Expenditures for repairs and\nmaintenance, which do not extend the useful life of the property and equipment, are expensed as incurred.\nAccounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets consist of property and equipment. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment \nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. \nRecoverability of assets held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash \nflows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized \nis measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Fair value is \nestimated based upon internal evaluation of each asset that includes quantitative analyses of cash flows and available \nmarket data. Certain factors used for these types of nonrecurring fair value measurements are considered Level 3 inputs.  In \nDecember 2022, the Company identified certain long-lived assets no longer utilized under current or expected future \noperations. Accordingly, the Company recognized impairment expense of $0.4 million in 2022. The Company did not\nrecord any impairment of long-lived assets in 2021.\nIntellectual Property\nIntellectual property-related expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $1.1 million and\n$1.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company has determined that these expenses have not\nmet the criteria to be capitalized.\nDeferred Rent\nThe Company has entered into lease agreements for its laboratory and office facilities. These leases qualify as and\nare accounted for as operating leases. Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and,\naccordingly, the Company records the difference between cash rent payments and the recognition of rent expense as a\ndeferred rent liability."

Research and development costs consist primarily of\nsalaries and benefits, consultant fees, stock-based compensation, certain facility costs, legal costs and other costs associated\nwith preclinical and clinical development.\nA substantial portion of the Company’s ongoing research and development activities are conducted by third-party\nservice providers in connection with preclinical and clinical development activities and contract manufacturing\norganizations in connection with the production of materials for clinical trials. At the end of the reporting period, the\nCompany compares payments made to third-party service providers to the estimated progress toward completion of the\nresearch or development objectives. Such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available.\nDepending on the timing of payments to the service providers and the progress that the Company estimates has been made\nas a result of the service provided, the Company may record net prepaid or accrued expense relating to these costs.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company generally grants stock options to its employees for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price\nequal to the fair value of the underlying shares at the date of grant. The Company accounts for stock option grants using the\nfair value method. The fair value of options is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For restricted stock\nunits, fair value is based on the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock on the grant date. Stock-based\ncompensation is recognized as the underlying options vest using the straight-line attribution approach, and forfeitures are\nrecorded as they occur.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” or EGC, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act,\nor JOBS Act, and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to\nother public companies that are not EGCs. The Company may take advantage of these exemptions until it is no longer an\nEGC under Section 107 of the JOBS Act, which provides that an EGC can take advantage of the extended transition period\nafforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards. The Company has elected to use\nthe extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and as a result of this election, the\nCompany’s financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company Financial\nAccounting Standards Board, or FASB, standards’ effective dates. The Company may take advantage of these exemptions\nup until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the IPO or such earlier time that the Company is no\nlonger an EGC.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company applies the provisions set forth in FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, to account for the\nuncertainty in income taxes. In the preparation of income tax returns in federal, foreign and state jurisdictions, the\nCompany asserts certain income tax positions based on its understanding and interpretation of income tax laws. The taxing\nauthorities may challenge such positions, and the resolution of such matters could result in recognition of income tax\nexpense in the Company's financial statements. Management believes it has used reasonable judgments and conclusions in\nthe preparation of its income tax returns.\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax\nposition will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The\nCompany does not anticipate any significant changes within 12 months of this reporting date of its uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income\ntax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial\nstatement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided against the Company's\ndeferred income tax assets when realization is not reasonably assured."

Diluted net loss assumes the conversion, exercise or issuance of all potential common stock equivalents,\nunless the effect of inclusion would be anti-dilutive. For purposes of this calculation, common stock equivalents include the\nCompany's stock options and common stock warrants. No shares related to the common stock equivalents were included in\nthe diluted net loss calculation for the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021 because the inclusion of such shares would\nhave had an anti-dilutive effect. The shares to be issued upon exercise of certain outstanding stock options were also\nexcluded from the diluted net loss calculation for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 because such shares are\nanti-dilutive.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 02 and subsequent amendments to the initial guidance under ASU\n2017-13, ASU 2018-10, ASU 2018-11, and ASU 2019-01, or collectively, Topic 842, which modifies the accounting by\nlessees for all leases with a term greater than 12 months. This standard requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet\nthe assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The Company adopted the new lease\naccounting standard on January 1, 2022, using the modified retrospective transition method. The Company implemented\nprocesses, and internal controls to enable the preparation of financial information. The adoption of this standard had a\nmaterial impact on the Company’s balance sheet, with the recognition of right-of-use assets and corresponding lease\nliabilities in the amounts of $37.7 million and $67.1 million respectively, and the derecognition of approximately $10.9\nmillion of deferred rent and $19.1 million of tenant improvement incentives. The adoption of this standard did not have a\nmaterial impact on the Company’s statements of operations or cash flows. The Company provided detailed right-of-use\nasset and liability disclosures as required by the new standard in the notes to the Company’s financial statements under\nNote 8 Leases. The Company adopted the transitional provisions allowed under ASU 2018-11 and as such, the balance\nsheets and statements of operations for prior periods are not comparable in the year of adoption of ASU 2016-02.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, or Topic 326: Measurement\nof Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, and subsequent amendments to the initial guidance under ASU 2018-19, ASU\n2019-04, ASU 2019-05, ASU 2020-03, and ASU 2020-02 which amends the current approach to estimate credit losses on\ncertain financial assets, including trade and other receivables. The amendment replaces the existing incurred loss\nimpairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. For\navailable-for-sale debt securities, credit losses should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Topic 326 is\neffective for the Company as of January 1, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this accounting\nstandard as of January 1, 2023. The adoption of this standard did not have any impact to the Company’s financial\nstatements as credit losses at the transition date were not expected, based on the evaluation of the Company’s available-for-\nsale debt securities."

The Company considered all series of\nredeemable convertible preferred stock to have been participating securities as the holders were entitled to receive non-\ncumulative dividends on a pari passu basis in the event a dividend was paid on common stock. Under the two-class\nmethod, the net loss attributable to common stockholders is not allocated to the redeemable convertible preferred stock as\nthe holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock do not have a contractual obligation to share in losses.\nUnder the two-class method, basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by\ndividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less shares\nsubject to repurchase. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all\npotentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. For purposes of this calculation, redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock, stock options to purchase common stock, early exercised stock options, and warrants to\npurchase redeemable convertible preferred stock and common stock are considered common shares equivalents but have\nbeen excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as their effect is\nantidilutive. Basic and diluted net loss per share was the same for each period presented, as the inclusion of all potential\ncommon shares outstanding would have been antidilutive.\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of Class A and Class B common stock are\nidentical, except with respect to voting. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are\nallocated on a proportionate basis and the resulting net loss per share attributed to common stockholders will, therefore, be\nthe same for both Class A and Class B common stock on an individual or combined basis.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common\nstockholders (in thousands, except share and per share data):\nYear Ended December 31, \n    \n2022\n    \n2021\nNumerator:\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders for earnings per share, basic and\ndiluted\n$\n(97,157)\n$\n(109,326)\nDenominator:\nShares used to compute net loss per share, basic and diluted\n38,593,894\n37,038,195\nBasic and diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per share\n$\n(2.52)\n$\n(2.95)\nThe following outstanding potentially dilutive common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted net\nloss per share attributable to common stockholders for the periods presented because the impact of including them would\nhave been antidilutive:\nYear Ended December 31, \n    \n2022\n    \n2021\nCommon stock options\n6,373,534\n7,162,676\nUnvested restricted stock units\n330,440\n867,730\nCommon stock warrants\n \n—\n \n49,997\n6,703,974\n8,080,403"

As a result of this provision of the Tax Act, deferred tax assets related to capitalized research and\ndevelopment expenses pursuant to IRC Section 174 increased by $11.2 million.\nThe Company uses the \"more likely than not\" criterion for recognizing the income tax benefit of uncertain income\ntax positions and establishing measurement criteria for income tax benefits.

In the event the Company should need to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax\nliabilities, this amount will be recorded as an accrued liability and an increase to income tax expense. No amounts of\ninterest or penalties were recognized in the Company's financial statements for 2022 or 2021. The Company is not\ncurrently under examination by income tax authorities in federal, state or other foreign jurisdictions. The Company does\nnot anticipate any significant changes within 12 months of this reporting date of its uncertain tax positions.\nThe net increase in the valuation allowance was $15.2 million and $26.5 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $46.5 million and\n$13.1 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2030 and $276.1 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards\nwhich do not expire but are subject to the 80% taxable income limitation. Additionally, the Company had federal tax\ncredits totaling $13.1 million and $13.2 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and state tax credits totaling\n$8.9 million and $9.7 million, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The federal tax credits begin to expire in\n2030. The state tax credits may be carried forward indefinitely.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, limits the use of net operating losses and income\ntax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in stock ownership of a company. If the Company should\nhave an ownership change of more than 50% of the value of the Company's capital stock, utilization of the carryforwards\ncould be restricted.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions. The U.S. federal\nand state tax years from 2010 to 2020 remain open to examination due to the carryover of unused net operating loss\ncarryforwards and tax credits.\nIn January 2018, the FASB released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income\n(GILTI) provisions of the 2017 Tax Act. The GILTI provisions subject certain U.S. entities to current tax on GILTI earned\nby certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company has considered these new provisions as they are effective for tax years\nstarting after December 31, 2017 and determined that none will likely apply for the years ended December 31, 2022 and\n2021.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES, Act was enacted and signed\ninto law. GAAP requires recognition of the tax effects of new legislation during the reporting period that includes the\nenactment date. The CARES Act, includes changes to the tax provisions that benefits business entities, and makes certain\ntechnical corrections to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The tax relief measures for businesses include a five-year net\noperating loss carryback, suspension of annual deduction limitation of 80% of taxable income from net operating losses\ngenerated in a tax year beginning after December 31, 2017, changes in the deductibility of interest, acceleration of\nalternative minimum tax credit refunds, payroll tax relief, and a technical correction to allow accelerated deductions for\nqualified improvement property. The CARES Act also provides other non-tax benefits to assist those impacted by the\npandemic. The Company has evaluated the impact of the CARES Act and determined there was no material impact to the\nincome tax provision for the year."

However, any control system, no matter how\nwell designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance\nthat its objectives will be met. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about\nthe likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals\nunder all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the\ndegree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-\neffective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Accordingly, our management\ndoes not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or\ndetect all error and fraud.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended\nDecember 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management conducted an assessment of the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in “Internal Control -\nIntegrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or\nCOSO. Based on that assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was\neffective as of December 31, 2022.\nAttestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm due to an\nexemption provided by the JOBS Act for “emerging growth companies.”"
