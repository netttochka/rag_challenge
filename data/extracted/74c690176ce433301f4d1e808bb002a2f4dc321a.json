Our exclusive license to ARCALYST from Regeneron\nincludes worldwide rights, excluding the Middle East and North Africa, for all applications other than those in oncology\nand local administration to the eye or ear.\nWe received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approval of ARCALYST for the treatment of\nrecurrent pericarditis and reduction in risk of recurrence in adults and children 12 years and older in March 2021. Recurrent\npericarditis is a painful inflammatory cardiovascular disease with an estimated U.S. prevalent population of approximately\n40,000 patients seeking and receiving medical treatment. ARCALYST is commercially available across the United States\nthrough a network of distributors. ARCALYST is also approved in the United States for the treatment of Cryopyrin-\nAssociated Periodic Syndromes (“CAPS”) specifically Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome and Muckle-Wells\nSyndrome in adults and children 12 years and older, and the maintenance of remission in Deficiency of Interleukin-1\nReceptor Antagonist (“DIRA”) in adults and children weighing 10 kg or more. We are responsible for sales and distribution\nof ARCALYST in all approved indications in the United States, and evenly split profits on sales as well as third-party\nproceeds with Regeneron.\nIn February 2022, we granted Hangzhou Zhongmei Huadong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Huadong”) exclusive\nrights to develop and commercialize ARCALYST in the Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan.\nKPL-404 is an investigational monoclonal antibody inhibitor of CD40-CD154 interaction. In 2019, we acquired\nall of the outstanding securities of Primatope Therapeutics, Inc. (“Primatope”), the company that owned or controlled the\nintellectual property related to KPL-404. In connection with our acquisition of Primatope, we acquired an exclusive world-\nwide license to KPL-404 from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Inc. (“BIDMC”).\nThe CD40-CD154 interaction is a key T-cell co-stimulatory signal critical for B-cell maturation, immunoglobulin\nclass switching and Type 1 immune response. We believe disrupting the CD40-CD154 interaction is an attractive approach\nto address multiple autoimmune disease pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”), Sjogren’s syndrome, Graves’\ndisease and systemic lupus erythematosus.\nIn May 2021, we announced positive final data from our Phase 1 single-ascending-dose clinical trial of KPL-404\nin healthy volunteers, which evaluated safety and pharmacokinetics, as well as receptor occupancy and T-cell dependent\nantibody response. In December 2021, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of KPL-404 in RA, which is designed to evaluate\npharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy with subcutaneous administration. In January 2023, we announced that we had\ncompleted enrollment of the second and final cohort of the multiple ascending dose portion of such trial. Following\ncompletion of this portion of the trial, the proof-of-concept portion will begin. We expect data from the trial in the first half\nof 2024.\nMavrilimumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody inhibitor targeting granulocyte-macrophage colony\nstimulating factor receptor alpha (“GM-CSFRα”). In 2017, we licensed exclusive worldwide rights in all indications to\nmavrilimumab from MedImmune, Limited (“MedImmune”).\nWe are pursuing collaborative study agreements to evaluate the potential of mavrilimumab in rare cardiovascular\ndiseases where the GM-CSF mechanism has been implicated. We previously evaluated mavrilimumab in giant cell arteritis\n(“GCA”), a chronic inflammatory disease of the medium-to-large arteries, and COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress\nsyndrome (“ARDS”).\nIn February 2022, we granted Huadong exclusive rights to develop and commercialize mavrilimumab in the Asia\nPacific region, excluding Japan.\nVixarelimab is an investigational monoclonal antibody inhibitor of signaling through oncostatin M receptor beta\n(“OSMRβ”), which was previously part of our portfolio of immune-modulating assets. In September 2022, we closed an\nagreement granting Genentech, Inc. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (collectively, “Genentech”) an exclusive worldwide\nlicense to develop and commercialize vixarelimab. Pursuant to such agreement, we have agreed to complete our in-\nprogress Phase 2b dose-ranging clinical trial of vixarelimab for the treatment of prurigo nodularis, a chronic inflammatory\nskin condition."

      "text": "Table of Contents\n10\nMechanism of Action\nARCALYST is an inhibitor of IL-1α and IL-1β. IL-1α and IL-1β have been demonstrated to play a key role in\ninflammatory diseases. IL-1α and IL-1β provoke potent, proinflammatory events by engaging the IL-1α and IL-1β receptor.\nFollowing tissue insult, the release of IL-1α acts as the primary initiating signal to coordinate the mobilization of immune\ncells to the damaged area, while IL-1β is secreted mostly by macrophages and is a prototypical cytokine of the canonical\nNLRP-3 inflammasome. IL-1α and IL-1β signaling results in a dramatic increase in the production of cytokines that\norchestrate the proliferation and recruitment of phagocytes to the site of damage, resulting in inflammation. Moreover, IL-\n1α and IL-1β signaling also affects other immune system cells, such as T-cells and B-cells.\nIL-1β’s role in the inflammation process has been extensively studied, while, in comparison, much is still\nunknown about the independent function of IL-1α in disease pathology. Despite driving similar immunological outcomes,\nIL-1α and IL-1β differ substantially in their expression and regulation, and non-redundant roles for IL-1α or IL-1β have\nbeen demonstrated in multiple inflammatory diseases. There are disease states in which IL-1β inhibition alone does not\nappear to be sufficient for disease remission in the absence of IL-1α inhibition. Published studies suggest certain\nautoinflammatory diseases may, in fact, be pathologically driven primarily by IL-1α.\nWe believe that inhibiting both IL-1α and IL-1β signaling is important for treating recurrent pericarditis. In a\npublished case study, a patient with a refractory form of recurrent pericarditis, who was well controlled on anakinra, was\nswitched from anakinra to canakinumab, which inhibits only IL-1β, for tolerability reasons. The patient’s disease returned\ndespite further dose escalation of canakinumab. When the patient was switched back to anakinra, which inhibits ILα and\nILβ, the disease promptly went back into remission. These data, together with clinical data from our pivotal Phase 3\nclinical trial of ARCALYST, indicate that IL-1α and IL-1β play unique roles in recurrent pericarditis and other\nautoinflammatory diseases in which the pathology may be driven primarily by IL-1α.\nBeyond recurrent pericarditis, we believe there is significant potential for ARCALYST to address additional\nindications. For example, we believe there are other diseases of the cardiovascular system where tissue inflammation may\nbe driven by IL-1α or IL-1β. More generally, we believe there may be many diseases characterized by painful serosal\ninflammation that may be driven by IL-1α, and we intend to consider development of ARCALYST in these indications and\nin others where we believe IL-1α and/or IL-1β plays a key role in disease pathophysiology.\nBackground and Market Opportunity for Recurrent Pericarditis\nPericarditis is the most common disorder involving the pericardium, the two-layered sac that surrounds the heart.\nPericarditis is an inflammation of this sac and is typically characterized by significant chest pain, shortness of breath,\ncoughing and fatigue and is often misconstrued by patients as a heart attack. In addition, typical signs of pericarditis\ninclude pericardial friction rub, electrocardiogram changes or pericardial effusion, which is a buildup of fluid around the\nheart. Pericarditis is described as recurrent if, following an initial occurrence of pericarditis, it recurs after a symptom-free\nperiod of about four to six weeks. Pericarditis is considered chronic if symptoms of any one episode last longer than three\nmonths, typically causing significant pain and frustration. If pericarditis is left untreated, patients can develop thickening\nand scarring of the pericardium, potentially requiring invasive surgical stripping. Pericardial effusion, if large enough, can\ncompress the heart extrinsically, requiring emergent drainage.\nIn March 2021, we received FDA approval to market ARCALYST for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis and\nreduction in risk of recurrence in adults and children 12 years of age and older, and we are exploring opportunities for\npotential expansion into other countries. Claims analysis, cross validated with published estimates, support a prevalent\npopulation of patients with recurrent pericarditis seeking and receiving medical treatment to be approximately 40,000\npatients in the United States per year. Within this estimated diagnosed and treated recurrent pericarditis patient population,\nthere are certain subgroups of patients totaling approximately 14,000 in the U.S. who suffer from persistent underlying\ndisease, multiple recurrences and an inadequate response to conventional therapy who serve as our core target patient\npopulation."

A patient’s initial acute episode of\npericarditis is typically treated with over-the-counter or prescription NSAIDs or colchicine, both of which are used off-\nlabel. Prior to ARCALYST’s approval, episodes of recurrent pericarditis would usually have been treated in a similar\nmanner or by adding systemic corticosteroids which were also used off-label. Both colchicine and corticosteroids often\nhave deleterious effects when used at high doses or for long periods of time, including, for colchicine, gastrointestinal\ndistress and neutropenia and, for corticosteroids, glaucoma, fluid retention, hypertension, mood changes, memory changes,\nother psychological effects, weight gain and diabetes.\nClinical Trials\nIn June 2020, we reported final results from RHAPSODY, our global, double-blind, placebo-controlled,\nrandomized-withdrawal design, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of ARCALYST in subjects with recurrent pericarditis.\nRHAPSODY met its prespecified primary and all major secondary efficacy endpoints with statistical significance. Median\n[95% CI] time to pericarditis recurrence for ARCALYST recipients in the randomized withdrawal period could not be\nestimated due to the low number of recurrences in the ARCALYST treatment arm. The median time-to-recurrence for\nplacebo recipients was 8.6 [4.0-11.7] weeks (Hazard Ratio = 0.04, p<0.0001). ARCALYST recipients experienced a 96%\nreduction in risk of recurrent pericarditis events. 81% of ARCALYST recipients maintained clinical response at Week 16 of\nthe randomized withdrawal period, compared to 20% of placebo recipients (p=0.0002). Consistent results were observed at\nWeek 8 and Week 24 and were also highly statistically significant (p<0.0001 and p=0.0022, respectively). The proportion\nof ARCALYST recipients with absent or minimal pericarditis symptoms at Week 16 of the randomized withdrawal period\nwas 81% compared to 25% for placebo recipients (p=0.0006). Finally, consistent results were observed at Week 8 and\nWeek 24 and were also highly statistically significant (p<0.0001 and p=0.0002, respectively). We believe these data show\nthat ARCALYST demonstrates clinically meaningful outcomes associated with unmet medical need in recurrent\npericarditis.\nIn November 2022, data from the long-term extension (“LTE”) portion of the RHAPSODY trial were presented at\nthe American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2022. LTE data included in the presentation demonstrated continued\nARCALYST treatment beyond 18 months resulted in continued treatment response. The median [maximum at end of LTE]\nduration of continuous rilonacept therapy for all patients in RHAPSODY was 23 [35] months; the median [maximum at\nend of LTE] duration of continuous rilonacept therapy was 18 months [27] months for US patients (n=45) and 29 [35]\nmonths for non-US patients (n=29). The annualized incidence of pericarditis recurrences while on therapy for all patients\n(n=74) during the first 18 months of the LTE portion of the trial was 0.04 events per patient-year (compared to 4.4 events\nper patient-year prior to study entry). Patients (n = 52) were given the option at 18 months from their most recent\npericarditis recurrence to continue or suspend rilonacept treatment for observation. There were 33 patients who elected to\ncontinue ARCALYST treatment, and the only recurrence in this group was associated with a treatment interruption of 4\nweeks. Of the patients who suspended treatment (n=8), 75% (n=6) experienced pericarditis recurrences. The median\n[interquartile range (IQR)] time-to-event was 11.8 [3.7, Not-Estimable (NE)] weeks. The 98% reduction in risk of recurrent\npericarditis events in patients who continued rilonacept treatment beyond 18 months (Hazard Ratio = 0.02, p<0.0001) was\nconsistent with the results of the randomized withdrawal period.\nCommercial Strategy for ARCALYST\nSince our commercial launch of ARCALYST for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis in 2021, we have\ndeveloped a focused and targeted commercial strategy that vertically integrates multiple key functions. Our specialty\nsalesforce of approximately 50 representatives as of December 31, 2022 calls on high-volume accounts and prescribers.\nOur salesforce is complemented by our medical affairs, payor and patient services teams who work to ensure broad patient\naccess to ARCALYST, educate communities, collaborate with patient advocacy groups and drive scientific understanding\nof recurrent pericarditis. Further, we have established an efficient marketing effort intended to help spread awareness of\nARCALYST and recurrent pericarditis among prescribers and patients."

The first strategic imperative is establishing the unmet need for recurrent\npericarditis patients and working to ensure recurrent pericarditis is viewed as a serious, debilitating disease that is driven\nprimarily by IL-1. The second strategic imperative is working to ensure ARCALYST is viewed as the product of choice for\nthe treatment and reduction in risk of recurrent pericarditis in patients over 12 years of age. The third strategic imperative\nrelates to reimbursement and working to ensure broad patient access at a price that reflects ARCALYST’s value as the first\nand only FDA-approved therapy for recurrent pericarditis. The fourth and final strategic imperative is building robust\npatient support programs to optimize patient experiences with ARCALYST and Kiniksa. Overall, our efforts are focused on\nprograms and tactics to help with uptake and adoption of ARCALYST as well as ensuring a positive patient experience.\nOur Product Candidates\nKPL-404\nOverview\nKPL-404 is an investigational monoclonal antibody inhibitor of CD40-CD154 interaction. CD40-CD154\ninteraction is a key T-cell co-stimulatory signal critical for B-cell maturation, immunoglobulin class switching, and Type 1\nimmune response.\nIn May 2021, we reported positive final data from our randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-\nascending-dose Phase 1 single-ascending-dose clinical trial of KPL-404 in healthy volunteers which evaluated safety and\npharmacokinetics, as well as RO, and TDAR in these subjects. KPL-404 showed dose-dependent increases in concentration\nacross cohorts. All dose escalations occurred as per protocol with no dose-limiting safety findings. KPL-404 was well-\ntolerated, and there were no serious adverse reactions. Subjects dosed with KPL-404 10 mg/kg IV showed full RO through\nat least Day 71 and complete suppression of TDAR after keyhole limpet hemocyanin (“KLH”), challenge and re-challenge\nthrough at least Day 57. Subjects dosed subcutaneously with KPL-404 5 mg/kg showed full RO through Day 43 and\nsuppression of TDAR after KLH challenge through at least Day 29.\nWe are enrolling and dosing participants in a Phase 2 clinical trial of KPL-404 in rheumatoid arthritis, which is\ndesigned to enable its potential development in a spectrum of autoimmune diseases believed to be mediated by the CD40-\nCD154 co-stimulatory interaction. In January 2023, we announced that we had completed enrollment of the second and\nfinal cohort of the multiple ascending dose portion of such trial. Following completion of this portion of the trial, the proof-\nof-concept portion will begin. We expect data from the trial in the first half of 2024.\nMechanism of Action\nKPL-404 is designed to block CD40-CD154 interaction by binding to and inhibiting signaling through the CD40\nreceptor. CD40 is a member of the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor superfamily which is constitutively or inducibly\nexpressed on the surface of a variety of immune and non-immune cell types including B cells, macrophages, dendritic\ncells, microglia, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and keratinocytes and can also be upregulated on other cell types in the\ncontext of autoimmune disease. Interactions between B cell-expressed CD40 and its binding partner, CD40L, mainly\nexpressed on activated CD4+ T cells, play a critical role in promoting germinal center formation and the production of\nclass-switched antibodies. The role of CD40 in B cells has been extensively characterized and has been shown to be\nessential for productive primary and secondary humoral immune responses to T dependent antigens. External clinical data\nthat point to the broad potential power of the mechanism has been established in RA, systemic lupus erythematosus,\nprimary Sjogren’s syndrome and Graves’ disease. Ongoing Phase 2 trials from competitors implicate additional indications\nfor potential development, including type 1 diabetes, prevention of liver transplant rejection, hidradenitis suppurativa,\nlupus nephritis and multiple sclerosis."

We believe some competitor assets do not fully antagonize signaling as evidenced by efficacy\nfailures and the generation of anti-drug antibodies even at maximum delivered and/or attainable dose levels.\nClinical and Preclinical Trials\nPreclinical Development\nIn preclinical development, KPL-404 has been observed to have a favorable pharmacokinetic and toxicology\nprofile and has shown activity in multiple non-human primate models of organ transplant rejection, as well as in multiple\nTDAR models. The data in the graphs below show in a non-human primate TDAR model that KPL-404 had linear\npharmacokinetics with low variability which translated into complete suppression of antibody responses to a novel antigen\n(KLH) at drug levels achieving 100% receptor occupancy.\nPhase 1 Clinical Trial\nWe previously conducted a Phase 1 single-ascending-dose clinical trial of KPL-404, which was a randomized,\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, single-ascending-dose, first-in-human study that was divided into two parts: a single dose\nof KPL-404 0.03 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg IV and a single dose of KPL-404 1 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg\nsubcutaneously administered to separate cohorts of healthy volunteers. The primary objective was to assess the safety and\ntolerability of KPL-404. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetics, CD40 RO, the immune response to the novel test\nantigen KLH in clinically relevant dose cohorts, and the anti-drug antibody response.\nIn May 2021, we reported final results from this Phase 1 trial of KPL-404, which met both its primary objective\nand secondary endpoints. Results from the trial included the following:"

The Phase 2 trial is a randomized,\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to provide pharmacokinetic data and early signal of efficacy with chronic\nadministration, and optionality to evaluate KPL-404 across a range of other autoimmune diseases. The trial is expected to\nenroll participants with active RA who have an inadequate response to or are intolerant to a Janus kinase inhibitor (a\n“JAKi”) or at least one biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (a “bDMARD”). Subjects who have failed both\nbDMARD and JAKi are excluded from the study. Cohorts 1 and 2 will each sequentially randomize eight participants in a\n6:2 ratio to receive KPL-404 (2mg/kg or 5mg/kg, respectively) or placebo as a subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks for 12\nweeks. The primary efficacy endpoints for Cohorts 1 and 2 will be to evaluate pharmacokinetic data across dosing levels\nand to collect the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. In November, 2022, we disclosed that we had amended\nthe trial to (a) eliminate a 10 mg/kg biweekly subcutaneous dose arm from the multiple-ascending dose portion of the trial\n(i.e., removing the original Cohort 3 from the trial) and (b) replace the 10 mg/kg biweekly subcutaneous dose arm of the\nproof-of-concept portion of the trial with a 5 mg/kg weekly subcutaneous dose arm (the revised Cohort 3). Cohort 3 will\nrandomize up to 75 participants in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive KPL-404 5 mg/kg or placebo as a subcutaneous injection every\nweek or 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. The participants receiving KPL-404 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks will receive\nweekly administrations of alternating active investigational product and matching blinded placebo. The primary efficacy\nendpoint for Cohort 3 will be the change in baseline in DAS28-CRP at Week 12. Secondary endpoints for Cohort 3 will be\nthe incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and to evaluate pharmacokinetic data across dose levels.

Following the announcement that the Phase\n3 portion of our global, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of mavrilimumab in COVID-19-related ARDS did\nnot meet its primary efficacy endpoint in December 2021, we decided not to progress mavrilimumab in such indication at\nthat time.\nWe also previously evaluated mavrilimumab in GCA, a chronic inflammatory disease of the medium-to-large\narteries with an estimated U.S. prevalence of approximately 75,000 to 150,000 patients. In October 2020, we announced\nthat our global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the study of\nmavrilimumab in GCA achieved both the primary efficacy endpoint of time-to-first adjudicated GCA flare by Week 26 in\nall treated participants and the secondary efficacy endpoint of sustained remission at Week 26 in all treated participants\nwith statistical significance. Additionally, while the trial was not powered for individual disease cohorts, there was a\nconsistent trend of efficacy across the new onset and relapsing/refractory cohorts. In September 2020, the FDA granted\nOrphan Drug designation for mavrilimumab for the treatment of GCA. In February 2022, we announced that we do not\nplan to initiate a Phase 3 trial of mavrilimumab in GCA.\nBefore we licensed mavrilimumab in 2017, MedImmune was developing mavrilimumab for the treatment of RA.\nMedImmune had received authorization to conduct clinical trials for RA in Europe and executed an extensive Phase 1 and\nPhase 2 clinical program in which the company studied mavrilimumab in over 550 participants with RA through Phase 2b.\nMedImmune’s clinical trials in RA through Phase 2b achieved their prospectively defined endpoints of efficacy or safety.\nIn February 2022, we granted Huadong exclusive rights to develop and commercialize mavrilimumab in the Asia\nPacific region, excluding Japan.\nMechanism of Action\nLiterature data implicate GM-CSF as a key player in the immune system: enhancing trafficking of myeloid cells\nthrough activated endothelium of blood vessels and contributing to monocyte and macrophage accumulation in blood\nvessels during inflammation; promoting activation, differentiation, survival and proliferation of monocytes and\nmacrophages, as well as resident tissue macrophages in inflamed tissues; promoting the differentiation of effector T cells at\ninflamed sites and draining lymph nodes; and regulating the phenotype of antigen presenting cells in inflamed tissues by\npromoting the differentiation of infiltrating monocytes into M1 macrophages and monocyte derived dendritic cells\n(“MoDCs”). These studies have demonstrated that with GM-CSF overexpression, pathological changes almost always\nfollow.\nOur Solution\nMavrilimumab is designed to inhibit the signaling of GM-CSF, a growth factor that stimulates the production of\ncertain types of white blood cells. In an ex vivo GCA artery culture model, mavrilimumab inhibited inflammatory\nmolecules characteristic of GCA pathophysiology: Inhibition of the GM-CSFR pathway was confirmed by significant\ndecreases in PU.1 mRNA levels; inhibition of related immune pathways was demonstrated by significant decreases in\nmRNA for TNFα and CXCL10 mRNA as well as decreases in CXCL10 protein and mRNA levels. The observed\nsignificant decrease in IL-6 protein levels was consistent with the decrease in IL-6 mRNA levels observed with\nmavrilimumab treatment in RA participants in Phase 2.\nDiscovery Activities\nWe conduct internal discovery activities directed toward wholly owned molecules for the treatment of debilitating\ndisease targets where we believe there to be a strong mechanistic rationale and potential for clear differentiation from\nexisting approved agents or those in development."

Upon execution of the agreement, we made $0.5 million in upfront payments for the initial option period and\nwe made payments totaling $0.8 million for extending option period through mid-January 2019. During the option periods,\nwe conducted research and preclinical work to assess the viability of the program.\nIn January 2019, we exercised the call option and in March 2019, we acquired all of the outstanding securities of\nPrimatope (the “Primatope Acquisition”). The aggregate amount of upfront and contingent payments we paid to the former\nPrimatope shareholders to acquire Primatope was comprised of (i) $15.0 million paid at closing in March 2019, comprised\nof upfront consideration of $10.0 million and milestone payments of $5.0 million which had been achieved as of the\nclosing date, and (ii) $3.0 million paid in June 2019 for the final milestone payment, which was achieved following the\nclosing during the six months ended June 30, 2019, each paid in a combination of cash and our Class A common shares\n(inclusive of escrow and holdback share amounts) in accordance with the Primatope Agreement. We released the escrow\nand issued Class A common shares that were held back at closing in June 2020 and issued the Class A common shares that\nwere held back at the final milestone payment in September 2020.\nAs a result of the Primatope Acquisition, we acquired the rights to an exclusive license to certain intellectual\nproperty rights controlled by BIDMC to make, use, develop and commercialize KPL-404 under the BIDMC license\nagreement (the “BIDMC Agreement”). Under the BIDMC Agreement, we are solely responsible for all development,\nregulatory and commercial activities and costs. We are also responsible for costs related to filing, prosecuting and\nmaintaining the licensed patent rights. Under the BIDMC Agreement, we are obligated to pay an insignificant annual\nmaintenance fee as well as future clinical and regulatory milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $1.2 million to\nBIDMC.

Under certain circumstances, we or Regeneron\ncould initiate a technology transfer to either us or another CMO to manufacture ARCALYST. For example, Regeneron\ncould unilaterally initiate a technology transfer to us as early as March 2023.\nWe also have engaged CMOs to produce mavrilimumab drug substance and drug product and have qualified\nCMOs to produce KPL-404 drug product. We currently remain the sole producer of KPL-404 drug substance. We intend to\nuse CMOs for development and scale-up work for any future clinical trials and eventual commercialization of\nmavrilimumab and KPL-404, if approved.\nWe require our CMOs to conduct manufacturing activities in compliance with current good manufacturing\npractice or similar foreign requirements (“cGMP”). We have assembled a team of experienced employees and consultants\nto provide the necessary technical, quality and regulatory oversight of our CMOs. We currently perform most process\ndevelopment internally but are reliant on CMOs for late-stage clinical manufacturing, process qualification and validation\nand commercial supply. We anticipate that these CMOs will have the capacity to support both clinical supply and\ncommercial-scale production, but we do not have any formal agreements at this time with any of these CMOs to cover\ncommercial production. We also may elect to pursue additional CMOs for manufacturing supplies of drug substance and\nfinished drug product in the future.\nOur reliance on third-parties to manufacture certain of our products and product candidates exposes us to risks,\nand any technology transfer of our products or product candidates may be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties,\nsee “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Manufacturing and Our Reliance on Third Parties.”\nCommercial Operations\nOur commercial team combines dozens of years of pharmaceutical commercial leadership experience with a\npassion for helping patients with significant unmet need. Since March 2021, we have marketed ARCALYST, our only\ncommercial product, in the United States for recurrent pericarditis, a debilitating disease, and have established our own\nspecialty salesforce to expand our commercialization efforts nationwide. Our salesforce is complemented by our current\nmedical affairs, payor and patient services teams. We have also built an efficient digital marketing effort by targeting\nprescribers currently treating recurrent pericarditis.\nWe intend to expand our capabilities in parallel with the development path of our product candidates. For each\nproduct candidate, we intend to establish commercialization strategies as we approach potential marketing approval and,\ndue to the specialization among physicians treating the indications we are targeting, we expect to be able leverage our then-\nexisting medical affairs, payor and patient services teams, and marketing organization.\nCompetition\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense\ncompetition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources,\nincluding pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and\nprivate research institutions. Our products and any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize,\nincluding ARCALYST, KPL-404 and mavrilimumab, may compete with existing products and new products that may\nbecome available in the future.\nThe key competitive factors affecting the success of ARCALYST, KPL-404 and mavrilimumab and any other\nproduct candidates that we develop, if approved, are likely to be our product candidates, including their efficacy, safety,\nconvenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other\nthird-party payors. Our commercial opportunity for any of our product candidates could be reduced or eliminated if our\ncompetitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more\nconvenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other\nregulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to\ncompete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic\nproducts.

One is by R-Pharm International (RPH-104), which inhibits IL-\n1α/IL-1β-induced signaling and is in Phase 2 development; the other is an oral cannabidiol being developed by Cardiol\nTherapeutics in an open label Phase 2 setting.\nDual IL-1α and IL-1β Inhibition: Anakinra (KINERET), marketed by Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, is\ncurrently approved for use in RA, CAPS and DIRA. We are not aware of any active, industry sponsored development\nprograms using anakinra seeking a label for recurrent pericarditis.\nIL-1β Inhibition Alone: Canakinumab (ILARIS), marketed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, is\ncurrently approved for use in CAPS, Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS),\nHyperimmunoglobulin D Syndrome (HIDS), Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD) and Familial Mediterranean Fever\n(FMF), Still’s Disease and Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA). We are not aware of any active, industry\nsponsored development programs using canakinumab seeking a label for recurrent pericarditis. Additionally, Novartis is\nalso developing gevokizumab for use in oncologic indications. In addition, there are several molecules in development\ndesigned to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome, an intracellular sensor of a broad range of danger signals, that leads to the\nrelease of IL-1β and IL-18. Clinical stage development programs include: VTX2735 and VTX3232 (Ventyx Biosciences,\nInc.), ZYIL-1 (Zydus Lifesciences Ltd.), HT-6184 (Halia Therapeutics, Inc.), OLT1177 (Olatec Therapeutics LLC), DFV-\n890 (Novartis A.G.), Selnoflast (Roche), NT-0167 and NT-0796 (NodThera Ltd.), Somalix and Onzomelid (Roche).\nIL-1α Inhibition Alone: There are other therapies which modulate IL-1α in preclinical and clinical development\nfor diseases other than recurrent pericarditis from Johnson & Johnson and XBIOTECH USA, INC. We are not aware of\nany active, industry sponsored development programs for these programs seeking a label for recurrent pericarditis.\nKPL-404\nThere are various programs in clinical development antagonizing the CD40 / CD154 costimulatory pathway,\nhowever we believe the high concentration liquid formulation of KPL-404 enables chronic subcutaneous dosing, which\ncould be a key differentiator.\nSubcutaneous Administration: Novartis A.G. is developing CFZ-533, or iscalimab (anti-CD40) for\nsubcutaneous administration for the treatment of Sjögren's Syndrome.\nIntravenous Administration Only: Horizon Therapeutics plc (in the process of being acquired by Amgen Inc.) is\ndeveloping the Tn3 fusion protein, dazodalibep (anti-CD40L); Biogen, Inc. and UCB S.A. are developing dapirolizumab\npegol (anti-CD40L) for the treatment of moderately to severely active Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; and Eledon\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing AT-1501 (anti-CD40L) for use by patients undergoing kidney transplantation.\nPotential Subcutaneous Administration: Certain other programs present the potential for subcutaneous\nadministration. Sanofi S.A./ImmuNext Inc. are developing SAR441344 (anti-CD40L) for the treatment of Primary\nSjögren's Syndrome and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Bristol Myers-Squibb is developing BMS-986325 (anti-CD40)\nfor the treatment of Primary Sjögren's Syndrome; and H.

All of these competitive programs target the GM-CSF ligand itself versus targeting the GM-\nCSF receptor like mavrilimumab.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates,\nmanufacturing and process discoveries, and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others,\nand to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We plan to protect our proprietary position using a variety of\nmethods, which include pursuing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and\nimprovements, including compositions of matter, drug product formulations, methods of use and methods of manufacture,\nthat are important to the development and implementation of our business. For example, we or our licensors have or are\npursuing patents covering the composition of matter for each of our product candidates and we generally pursue patent\nprotection covering methods of use for each clinical program. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing\ntechnological innovation and potential in licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.\nARCALYST\nWe have a field-specific exclusive license under the Regeneron Agreement to granted patents and pending\napplications in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions relating to ARCALYST. As of December 31, 2022, the\npatent rights in-licensed under the Regeneron Agreement relating to our program include two granted patents in the United\nStates and 25 patents granted in other jurisdictions, including Canada, Australia, Brazil and selected countries in Europe\nand Asia. In addition, the patent rights in-licensed under the Regeneron Agreement relating to our program include patent\napplications that are pending in the United States, Canada, Europe and selected countries in Asia. A U.S. patent covering\nARCALYST as a composition of matter expired in 2020, and relevant composition of matter patents issued outside of the\nUnited States are expected to expire in 2023, not including any patent term extensions. Two patents covering methods of\nusing ARCALYST in the treatment of recurrent pericarditis have issued in the U.S. and have a statutory term that expires in\n2038, not including any patent term adjustment. In March 2021, the FDA granted approval for ARCALYST for the\ntreatment of recurrent pericarditis and reduction in risk of recurrence in adults and children 12 years of age and older,\nwhich granted us seven years of marketing exclusivity in the United States. See “—License agreement with Regeneron”\nabove for additional information on our rights under the Regeneron Agreement.\nKPL-404\nWe own, via our acquisition of Primatope, granted patents and pending patent applications in the United States\nand numerous other jurisdictions relating to KPL-404. We also have an exclusive license with BIDMC to granted patents\nand pending patent applications in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions relating to KPL-404. These patents\nand patent applications cover KPL-404 as a composition of matter and its use. As of December 31, 2022, the patent rights\nacquired from Primatope include four patents granted in the United States and 30 patents granted in other jurisdictions,\nincluding Australia, Brazil and selected countries in Europe and Asia. In addition, the patent rights acquired from\nPrimatope include patent applications pending in the United States, Australia, Europe, Canada, and selected countries in\nAsia.

As of December 31, 2022, the patent rights in-\nlicensed under the MedImmune Agreement relating to our program include three granted patents in the United States and\n109 patents granted in other jurisdictions, including Canada, Australia and selected countries in Europe and Asia. In\naddition, the patent rights in licensed under the MedImmune Agreement relating to our program include patent applications\nthat are pending in the United States, Australia, Europe, Canada, and selected countries in Asia and Latin America. The\ncomposition of matter patents for mavrilimumab generally have statutory expiration dates in 2027, although the term of\nsome U.S. patents may be longer due to patent term adjustment to compensate for delays during the patent prosecution\nprocess. Patent term extension could extend the expiration date of one patent in the United States and patents in certain\nother jurisdictions, each in accordance with applicable law. See “—License agreement with MedImmune” above for\nadditional information on our rights under the MedImmune Agreement.\nThere can be no assurances that patents will issue from any pending patent applications or that any existing\npatents may be extended. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property—If we are unable to adequately\nprotect our proprietary technology or obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, if the scope\nof the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, or if the terms of our patents are insufficient to protect our\nproduct candidates for an adequate amount of time, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and\nproducts similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be\nmaterially impaired.”\nIn the future, if and when our drug candidates receive approval by the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities\nin other jurisdictions (as applicable, “regulatory authorities”), provided the legal requirements are met, we expect to apply\nfor patent term extensions on issued patents covering those drugs, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each\ndrug and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will\nbenefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents.\nGovernment Regulation\nGovernment authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries and\njurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing,\nmanufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution,\npost-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug\ncan be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format\nspecific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.\nU.S. Government Regulation of Biological Products\nIn the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”)\nand the Public Health Service Act (the “PHSA”) and their implementing regulations. Biologics are also subject to other\nfederal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent\ncompliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial\ntime and financial resources.\nThe process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the\nfollowing:\n●\nCompletion of extensive preclinical studies and tests in accordance with applicable regulations, including\nGood Laboratory Practice (“GLP”), regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory\nanimals or other applicable regulations;"

The preclinical development stage generally involves laboratory\nevaluations of the chemistry, formulation and stability of the product candidate, as well as trials to evaluate toxicity in\nanimals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal\nregulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies,\ntogether with chemistry manufacturing and controls (“CMC”), information, analytical data, any available clinical data or\nliterature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the\nFDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may\nbegin. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective\n30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to CMC issues,\npreclinical issues, or one or more issues in the proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such\na case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result,\nsubmission of an IND may not necessarily result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. The FDA also may\nplace the IND on partial clinical hold, and a proposed study may only be partially executable, including due to FDA\nrestrictions.\nClinical Trials\nThe clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers\nor participants under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by, or under control of,\nthe trial sponsor, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed\nconsent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other\nthings, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and inclusion/exclusion criteria and the\nparameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the\nprotocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each"

The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject\nor his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.\nSome studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study\nsponsor, commonly known as a Data Safety Monitoring Board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study\nmay move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial\nif it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.\nDepending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on\naccess to certain data from the trial. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds,\nincluding a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or\nterminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s\nrequirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to participants. There also are requirements\ngoverning the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.\nHuman clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:\n●\nPhase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy participants with the target disease or\ncondition who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The\nprimary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect\ntolerability and safety of the drug, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.\n●\nPhase 2 clinical trials involve studies in participants with the target disease or condition to determine the\noptimal dose and dosing schedule. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and\npharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a\npreliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.\n●\nPhase 3 clinical trials generally involve a larger number of participants at multiple, geographically dispersed\nclinical trial sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproduct candidate for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of\nthe product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling and approval. These trials may\ninclude comparisons with placebo or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often\nextended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.\nPost-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing\napproval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of participants in the intended therapeutic\nindication, particularly for long-term safety follow up. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of\nPhase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA.\nConcurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop\nadditional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for\nmanufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the\nintroduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing\ncontrol for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of\nconsistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop\nmethods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally,\nappropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the\nbiological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life."

      "text": "Table of Contents\n27\nBLA Review and Approval\nAssuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical\ntrials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling,\namong other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more\nindications. The BLA must contain substantial evidence supporting the safety, purity, potency (or efficacy) of the product\ncandidate and may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials as well as positive\nfindings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product\ncandidate’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing\napproval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency (or\nefficacy) of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a\nbiologic may be marketed in the United States.\nIn most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Within 60 days following\nsubmission of the application, the FDA reviews all BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for\nsubstantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an\nBLA for filing. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application\nalso is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA\nbegins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things whether the product is\nsafe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to\nassure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the\nPrescription Drug User Fee Act (the “PDUFA”), for original BLAs, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which\nto complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the 60-day filing\ndate for an application with priority review. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the BLA is submitted\nto the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. The FDA does not always meet\nits PDUFA goal dates, and the review process may be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.\nBefore approving a BLA, the FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities\nfor the new product to determine whether the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will\nnot approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP\nrequirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may\ninspect the sponsor and one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements and the integrity of the\nclinical data submitted to the FDA.\nAdditionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel biologic candidates which present challenges in\ninterpretation of the safety or efficacy data to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other\nexperts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what\nconditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such\nrecommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could\nresult in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The FDA also may require\nsubmission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) plan if it determines that a REMS is necessary to\nensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the biological product. The REMS plan\ncould include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans or elements to assure safe use, such as\nrestricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for\na REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the\nsponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.\nUnder the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data that are\nadequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric\npopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric population for which the product is safe and\neffective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug\nAdministration Safety and Innovation Act, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a"

The initial iPSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct,\nincluding trial objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not\nincluding such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the\nrequirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach\nan agreement on the iPSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial iPSP at any time if changes to the\npediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials or other\nclinical development programs.\nAfter the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter\nauthorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete\nResponse Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its\npresent form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the\nFDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical or other data, additional clinical trial(s) or other\nsignificant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete\nResponse Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the\nletter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the re-\nsubmitted BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.\nIf a product receives regulatory approval, the approval is limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population,\nindication) described in the label. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that\ncontraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval trials, including\nPhase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance\nprograms to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use\nrestrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and\nprofitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-\nmarketing trials or surveillance programs, or new safety findings after market introduction. After approval, some types of\nchanges to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims,\nare subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.\nOrphan Drug Designation\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic product intended to treat\na rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the\nUnited States or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that\nthe cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be\nrecovered from sales of the product. Orphan Drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA\ngrants Orphan Drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by\nthe FDA. Orphan Drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and\napproval process.\nOrphan Drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards\nclinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product that has orphan designation subsequently\nreceives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to\nOrphan Drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for\nthe same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of\nclinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, by providing a\nmajor contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues.\nHowever, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product\nhas exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has\nexclusivity."

In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be lost if\nthe FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure\nsufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nExpedited Review and Approval\nThe FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, accelerated\napproval and priority review, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review\nof drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and\ndemonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new\ndrugs and biologics to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.\nTo be eligible for a Fast Track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a\nproduct is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an\nunmet medical need for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides opportunities for more frequent\ninteractions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review\nsections of the BLA for a Fast Track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor\nand the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user\nfees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.\nA product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for\nBreakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive Breakthrough\nTherapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one\nor more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more\nclinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The\ndesignation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance\nbeginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product\ncandidate, including involvement of senior managers.\nAny BLA submitted to the FDA for approval, including a BLA for a product candidate with a Fast Track\ndesignation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as\npriority review and accelerated approval. A BLA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate is designed to treat\na serious condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to\nmarketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a biologic\ndesignated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review original BLAs with\npriority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months under its standard review goals.\nIn addition, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug and biologics intended to treat\nserious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the\nproduct candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical\nendpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect\non irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the\ncondition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires that\na sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled confirmatory clinical trials to\nverify the predicted clinical benefit. A product that receives accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal\nprocedures if the sponsor fails conduct the required confirmatory trials in a timely manner or if such trials fail to verify the\npredicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of\npromotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.\nEven if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no\nlonger meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be"

Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority\nreview do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.\nPost-approval Requirements\nFollowing approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to pervasive and\ncontinuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of\nadverse experiences with the product, product sampling and distribution restrictions, complying with promotion and\nadvertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations\n(i.e., “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may\nprescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and\nother agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is\nfound to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. If there are any modifications to\nthe product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be\nrequired to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the applicant to\ndevelop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA may also place other\nconditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could\ninclude medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution\nmethods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could\nrestrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be\nwithdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.\nFDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with\ncGMPs. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of\nour products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require,\namong other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the\nobligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the\nmanufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and\ncertain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for\ncompliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the\narea of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of conditions that violate these rules,\nincluding failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product\nafter approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including voluntary\nrecall.\nOnce an approval of a drug is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory\nrequirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of\npreviously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with\nmanufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the\napproved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or\nimposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other\nthings:\n●\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the\nmarket or product recalls;\n●\nfines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials;\n●\nrefusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation\nof product approvals;\n●\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;"

Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference\nproduct and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given\npatient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be\nalternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished\nefficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch.\nUnder the BPCIA, a reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first\nlicensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on\nthe reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure”\ntypically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does\nnot include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a supplement for the reference\nproduct for a subsequent application filed by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the reference product (or licensor,\npredecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological\nproduct) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery\ndevice or strength or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety,\npurity or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a\npreviously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new\nproduct is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved,\nwarrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data\nsubmitted by the sponsor.\nForeign Government Regulation\nIn addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions\ngoverning, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, post-marketing requirements and any commercial\nsales and distribution of our product candidates.\nAs in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent\nregulatory agencies has been obtained whether or not product candidates obtain FDA approval for a pharmaceutical\nproduct, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can\nstart clinical trials or marketing of the products in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies\nbetween countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review\nperiods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that\nrequired to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in\nanother, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the\nregulatory process in others. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, may be subject to, among\nother things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating\nrestrictions and criminal prosecution."

Non-clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the principles of GLP, as set forth in EU\nDirective 2004/10/EC. In particular, non-clinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored,\nrecorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality\nsystem for the organizational process and the conditions for non-clinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements.\nClinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations\nand the International Conference on Harmonization (the “ICH”) guidelines on GCP, as well as the applicable regulatory\nrequirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If the sponsor of the clinical\ntrial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take\nout a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU member states, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation\nto any study subject injured in the clinical trial.\nThe regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical\nTrials Regulation (the “CTR”) which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became\napplicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member states without the need\nfor member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision\nprocesses for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU\nportal and database.\nWhile the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application (a “CTA”) to be submitted in each\nmember state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA\nand IRB respectively, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application to\nall member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an\nethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The CTA must include, among other\nthings, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the\nmanufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been\nharmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each\nmember state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s\ndecision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study\ndevelopment may proceed. One of the main aims of EU CTR is to increase transparency about clinical trials, which is done\nby making documents and data from the CTA publicly available through CTIS at time of decision about the clinical trial.\nThere are few exceptions to this, and release of personal data and company confidential information is controlled through\nredaction and through requesting a trial-phase dependent deferral of disclosure.\nThe CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be\ngoverned by the CTR varies. Clinical trials for which an application was submitted (i) prior to January 31, 2022 under the\nClinical Trials Directive, or (ii) between January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2023 and for which the sponsor has opted for\nthe application of the Clinical Trials Directive remain governed by said Directive until January 31, 2025. After this date, all\nclinical trials (including those which are ongoing) will become subject to the provisions of the CTR.\nMedicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Other national and EU-wide\nregulatory requirements may also apply.\nMedicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP.

To obtain a MA of a product candidate in the EU, we must submit a MA application (an “MAA”). The process for\ndoing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product. There are two types of MAs:\n●\n“Centralized MAs” are issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on\nthe opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (the “CHMP”) of the EMA, and\nare valid throughout the EU. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain types of medicines,\nsuch as (i) medicines derived from biotechnological processes, (ii) products designated as orphan\nmedicinal products, (iii) advanced-therapy medicines (such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or\ntissue-engineered products) and (iv) products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of\nspecified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases or autoimmune and\nother immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products\ncontaining a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that represent a\nsignificant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest\nof public health in the EU. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation\nof an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information\nis to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP.\n●\n“National MAs” are issued by the competent authorities of the EU member states, only cover their\nrespective territory, and are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the\nmandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for\nmarketing in an EU member state, this national MA can be recognized in another member state through\nthe Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any member state at\nthe time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the\ndecentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the\ncompetent authorities of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected\nby the applicant as the reference member state.\nUnder the above-described procedures, in order to grant the MA, the competent authorities of the EU make an\nassessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and\nefficacy.\nMAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed on the basis\nof a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance.\nUnder the centralized procedure and in exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of a\nMA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops). Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are\nexpected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs,\nsuch as the PRIME scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. In\nMarch 2016, the EMA launched an initiative, the Priority Medicines (“PRIME”) scheme, a voluntary scheme aimed at\nenhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased\ninteraction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development\nplans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME\ndesignation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is not guaranteed. Many benefits accrue to\nsponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory\ndialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and\naccelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the\nCHMP is appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s committee\nlevel. An initial meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to\nprovide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies."

The conditional MA is subject to conditions to be fulfilled for generating the missing data or ensuring\nincreased safety measures. It is valid for one year and has to be renewed annually until fulfillment of all the conditions.\nOnce the pending studies are provided, it can become a “standard” MA. However, if the conditions are not fulfilled within\nthe timeframe set by the EMA, the MA ceases to be renewed. Furthermore, MA may also be granted “under exceptional\ncircumstances” when the applicant can show that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety\nunder normal conditions of use even after the product has been authorized and subject to specific procedures being\nintroduced. This may arise in particular when the intended indications are very rare and, in the present state of scientific\nknowledge, it is not possible to provide comprehensive information, or when generating data may be contrary to generally\naccepted ethical principles. This MA is close to the conditional MA as it is reserved to medicinal products to be approved\nfor severe diseases or unmet medical needs and the applicant does not hold the complete data set legally required for the\ngrant of a MA. However, unlike the conditional MA, the applicant does not have to provide the missing data and will never\nhave to. Although the MA “under exceptional circumstances” is granted definitively, the risk-benefit balance of the\nmedicinal product is reviewed annually and the MA is withdrawn in case the risk-benefit ratio is no longer favorable.\nData and Marketing Exclusivity\nThe EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. New products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference\nproducts) generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon receiving\nMA. If granted, the data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and\nclinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU\nduring a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market\nexclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until\nten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The overall ten-year market\nexclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA\nholder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to\ntheir authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is\nno guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products\nmay not qualify for data exclusivity.\nThere is a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal\nproduct but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw\nmaterials or manufacturing processes. For such products, the results of appropriate preclinical or clinical trials must be\nprovided, and guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types\nof biological product. There are no such guidelines for complex biological products, such as gene or cell therapy medicinal\nproducts, and so it is unlikely that biosimilars of those products will currently be approved in the EU. However, guidance\nfrom the EMA states that they will be considered in the future in light of the scientific knowledge and regulatory\nexperience gained at the time.\nOrphan Medicinal Products\nThe criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU, are similar in principle to those in the\nUnited States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is\nintended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a)\nsuch condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product,\nwithout the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and\n(3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in\nthe EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The\napplication for Orphan Drug designation must be submitted before the application for MA. Orphan medicinal products are\neligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a MA, entitled to ten years\nof market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten-year orphan market exclusivity period, the\ncompetent authorities cannot accept another MAA, or grant an MA, or accept an application to extend a MA for a similar\nproduct for the same indication. The period of market exclusivity is extended by"

No\nextension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.\nOrphan Drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval\nprocess.\nThe ten-year market exclusivity in the EU may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is\nestablished that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently\nprofitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, a MA may be granted to a similar product for the\nsame indication at any time if (i) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more\neffective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or\n(iii) the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.\nPediatrics Development\nIn the EU, MAAs for new medicinal products have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric\npopulation, in compliance with a PIP agreed with the EMA's Pediatric Committee (the “PDCO”). The PIP sets out the\ntiming and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which MA is being sought.\nThe PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are\nsufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric\nclinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to\nbe ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult\npopulations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric\npatients. Once the MA is obtained in all EU member states and study results are included in the product information, even\nwhen negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary extension of the protection under a supplementary\nprotection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year\nextension of the orphan market exclusivity is granted.\nPost-approval Requirements\nSimilar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to\ncomprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of\nthe EU member states. The holder of MA for a medicinal product must also comply with pharmacovigilance legislation\nand its related regulations and guidelines, which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the\nassessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. The holder of a MA must establish and maintain a\npharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance (a “QPPV”) who is\nresponsible for the establishment and maintenance of that system and oversees the safety profiles of medicinal products\nand any emerging safety concerns. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and\nsubmission of periodic safety update reports (“PSURs”).\nAll new MAAs must include a risk management plan (“RMP”), describing the risk management system that the\ncompany will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The\nRMP must be updated any time new information on the medicinal product becomes available which has a significant\nimpact on the content of the RMP. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the\nMA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more\nfrequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.\nIn addition, the advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of\nmedicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices.\nAll advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product\ncharacteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription\nmedicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products\nare established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one\ncountry to another."

These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the\nconduct of clinical trials or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or\nvariation of the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical\ntrials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.\nThe aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) (comprised of\nthe 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway).\nBrexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom\nSince the end of the Brexit transition period on January 1, 2021, Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) has\nnot been directly subject to EU laws, however under the terms of the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol, EU laws generally\napply to Northern Ireland. The EU laws that have been transposed into United Kingdom (the “UK”) law through secondary\nlegislation remain applicable in Great Britain. However, under the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill 2022,\nwhich is currently before the UK parliament, any retained EU law not expressly preserved and “assimilated” into domestic\nlaw or extended by ministerial regulations (to no later than June 23, 2026) will automatically expire and be revoked by\nDecember 31, 2023. New legislation such as the EU CTR or in relation to orphan medicines will not be applicable to Great\nBritain. The UK government has passed a new Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021, which introduces delegated\npowers in favor of the Secretary of State or an ‘appropriate authority’ to amend or supplement existing regulations in the\narea of medicinal products and medical devices. This allows new rules to be introduced in the future by way of secondary\nlegislation, which aims to allow flexibility in addressing regulatory gaps and future changes in the fields of human\nmedicines, clinical trials and medical devices.\nAs of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the “MHRA”) is the UK’s\nstandalone medicines and medical devices regulator. Whilst Northern Ireland will continue to follow the EU regulatory\nregime, its national competent authority will remain the MHRA.\nThe MHRA has introduced changes to national licensing procedures, including procedures to prioritize access to\nnew medicines that will benefit patients, including a 150-day assessment and a rolling review procedure. All existing EU\nMAs for centrally authorized products were automatically converted or grandfathered into UK MAs, effective in GB\n(only), free of charge on January 1, 2021, unless the MA holder chooses to opt-out. In order to use the centralized\nprocedure to obtain a MA that will be valid throughout the EEA, companies must be established in the EEA. Therefore\nafter Brexit, companies established in the UK can no longer use the EU centralized procedure and instead an EEA entity\nmust hold any centralized MAs. In order to obtain a UK MA to commercialize products in the UK, an applicant must be\nestablished in the UK and must follow one of the UK national authorization procedures or one of the remaining post-Brexit\ninternational cooperation procedures. The MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the\napproval of a new (centralized procedure) MA when determining an application for a GB authorization (the so-called “EC\nDecision Reliance Procedure”); or use the MHRA’s decentralized or mutual recognition procedures which enable MAs\napproved in EU member states (or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway) to be granted in GB (the so-called “MRDC Reliance\nProcedure”).\nThere will be no pre-MA orphan designation. Instead, the MHRA will review applications for orphan designation\nin parallel to the corresponding MA application. The criteria are essentially the same, but have been tailored for the market,\ni.e., the prevalence of the condition in GB, rather than the EU, must not be more than five in 10,000. Should an orphan\ndesignation be granted, the period or market exclusivity will be set from the date of first approval of the product in GB.\nRest of the World Regulation\nFor other countries outside of the EU and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America,\nAsia, or Japan, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and"

Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with\nGCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the\nDeclaration of Helsinki.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines,\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal\nprosecution.\nOther Healthcare Laws\nIn addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products, other U.S., federal, state and foreign\nhealthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include, but are not limited\nto, federal and state anti-kickback, false claims and transparency laws with respect to drug pricing and payments and other\ntransfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare professionals. Similar laws exists in foreign jurisdictions,\nincluding the EU, as well.\nThe U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and\nwillfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to\ninduce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any\ngood, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare\nprograms. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute\nhas been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers on the one hand\nand prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and beneficiaries on the other hand. Although there are a number of\nstatutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and\nsafe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce\nprescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or\nregulatory exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or\nregulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the\nlegality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and\ncircumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an\narrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been\nviolated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it\nin order to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar\nprohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial\ninsurers, or to self-pay patients.\nThe federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among\nother things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent\nclaim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a\nfalse record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false\nstatement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes “any\nrequest or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Moreover, a claim including items or services\nresulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of\nthe federal civil False Claims Act. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as\na qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the civil False Claims Act can result\nin very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. Several biopharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare\ncompanies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers\nwith the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted\nfor causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved (e.g., off-label),\nand thus non-covered, uses. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is\ndetermined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should\nknow is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have similar\nfraud and abuse statutes or regulations that"

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\nof 1996 (“HIPAA”) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully\nexecuting, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party\npayors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal\ninvestigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or\nmaking any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare\nbenefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have\nactual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians\nand certain other healthcare providers. The ACA imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements through\nthe Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to\nphysicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician\npractitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified\nregistered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology assistants and certified nurse midwives), and teaching hospitals as well as\nownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely,\naccurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment\ninterests may result in civil monetary penalties. Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each\nsubsequent calendar year and the reported information is publicly made available on a searchable website. In addition,\ncertain states require implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary\ncompliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions\non marketing practices or require the tracking and reporting of marketing expenditures and pricing information as well as\ngifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and\nentities.\nMoreover, analogous state and foreign laws and regulations may be broader in scope than the provisions described\nabove and may apply regardless of payor. These laws and regulations may differ from one another in significant ways, thus\nfurther complicating compliance efforts. For instance, in the EU, many EU member states have adopted specific anti-gift\nstatutes that further limit commercial practices for medicinal products, in particular vis-à-vis healthcare professionals and\norganizations. Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and transfers of value\nprovided to healthcare professionals or entities and many EU member states have adopted national “Sunshine Acts” which\nimpose reporting and transparency requirements (often on an annual basis), similar to the requirements in the United\nStates, on pharmaceutical companies. Certain countries also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs,\nor require disclosure of marketing expenditures and pricing information. Because of the breadth of these laws and the\nnarrowness of their exceptions and safe harbors, it is possible that business activities can be subject to challenge under one\nor more of such laws. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the\ncurrent environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal\nand state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and\nhealthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the\nhealthcare industry.\nEnsuring that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is\ncostly and time consuming. If business operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any\nother applicable governmental regulations a pharmaceutical manufacturer may be subject to penalties, including civil,\ncriminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement of profits, individual imprisonment of executive\nofficers and employees of such companies, exclusion from governmental funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare\nand Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional"

The United States government, state legislatures and governments outside the United States\nhave shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid\nhealthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic\nproducts for branded drug and biologic products. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are\nprescribed products generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or a substantial part of the associated healthcare\ncosts. Providers and patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to\ncover a substantial portion of the cost of our products. For products administered under the supervision of a physician,\nobtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated\nwith such drugs. If approved, sales of our product candidates will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and\nadequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans,\nprivate health insurers and other organizations.\nIn the United States, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage and the related\ncoverage criteria for a biological product typically is separate from, but related to, the process for setting the price of such\nproduct or for establishing the level of reimbursement that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved.\nWith respect to biologics, third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a\nformulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication, or place products at\ncertain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels, which results in higher cost-sharing financial obligation\nimposed on patients. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates, or to impose coverage criteria\nthe limiting situations in which our product candidates are covered, could reduce physician utilization of a product.\nMoreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement\nrate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable a manufacturer to maintain price\nlevels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on its investment in product development. Additionally, coverage, coverage\ncriteria, and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to\ncover a particular medical product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product, or\nwill provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process usually requires\nmanufacturers to provide scientific, clinical and health economic support for the use of their products to each payor\nseparately, which is a time-consuming process.\nAs noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale\nmay suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. The increasing\nemphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the\npressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if\nfavorable coverage and reimbursement are attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less\nfavorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Third-party payors are increasingly\nchallenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-\nbenefit of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If third-party payors do not consider a\nproduct to offer a favorable cost-benefit compared to other available therapies, they may not cover that product after FDA\napproval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a manufacturer to sell its product at a profit.\nIn addition, in many countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully\nmarketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In the EU,\ngovernments influence the price of products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national\nhealthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Member states are free to restrict the\nrange of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement, and to control\nthe prices and reimbursement levels of pharmaceutical products for human use. Some jurisdictions operate"

Member states may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the pharmaceutical\nproduct, or alternatively adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company responsible for\nplacing the pharmaceutical product on the market, including volume-based arrangements, caps and reference pricing\nmechanisms. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical\ntrials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product to currently available therapies. Other member states allow\ncompanies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. There can be no assurance that\nany country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable\nreimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general,\nparticularly prescription products, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the\nentry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial\npressure on pricing within a country.\nGovernment Price Reporting\nMedicaid is a joint federal and state program administered by the states for low-income and disabled beneficiaries.\nUnder the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (“MDRP”), as a condition of federal funds being made available for our covered\noutpatient drugs under Medicaid and for certain drugs or biologicals under Medicare Part B, we pay a rebate to state\nMedicaid programs for each unit of our covered outpatient drugs dispensed to a Medicaid beneficiary and paid for by the\nstate Medicaid program. Medicaid rebates are based on pricing data that we report on a monthly and quarterly basis to the\nU.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the federal agency that administers the MDRP and Medicare\nprograms. For the MDRP, these data include the average manufacturer price (“AMP”) for each drug and, in the case of\ninnovator products, best price. If we become aware that our MDRP price reporting submission for a prior period was\nincorrect or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we must resubmit the revised data for up to three\nyears after those data originally were due. If we fail to provide information timely or are found to have knowingly\nsubmitted false information to the government, we may be subject to civil monetary penalties and other sanctions,\nincluding termination from the MDRP, in which case payment would not be available for our covered outpatient drugs\nunder Medicaid or, if applicable, Medicare Part B.\nFederal law requires that a manufacturer that participates in the MDRP also participate in the Public Health\nService’s 340B drug pricing program (the “340B program”) in order for federal funds to be available for the\nmanufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program is administered by the Health Resources\nand Services Administration (“HRSA”) and requires us, as a participating manufacturer, to agree to charge statutorily\ndefined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for our covered outpatient drugs when used in an outpatient\nsetting. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health\nservices grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income\npatients. A drug that is designated for a rare disease or condition by the Secretary of Health and Human Services is not\nsubject to the 340B ceiling price requirement with regard to the following types of covered entities: rural referral centers,\nsole community hospitals, critical access hospitals, and free-standing cancer hospitals. The 340B ceiling price is calculated\nusing a statutory formula, which is based on the AMP and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated\nunder the MDRP. In general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B\nceiling price calculation and discount requirement. We must report 340B ceiling prices to HRSA on a quarterly basis, and\nHRSA publishes them to 340B covered entities. HRSA has finalized regulations regarding the calculation of the 340B\nceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge\ncovered entities for 340B-eligible drugs. HRSA has also finalized an administrative dispute resolution process through\nwhich 340B covered entities may pursue claims against participating manufacturers for overcharges, and through which\nmanufacturers may pursue claims against 340B covered entities for engaging in unlawful diversion or duplicate\ndiscounting of 340B drugs.\nIn order to be eligible to have drug products paid for with federal funds under Medicaid and Medicare Part B and\npurchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we must also participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\n(“VA”) Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) pricing program. Under the VA/FSS program, we must report the Non-Federal\nAverage Manufacturer Price (“Non-FAMP”) for our covered drugs to the VA and charge certain federal agencies no more\nthan the Federal Ceiling Price, which is calculated based on Non-FAMP using a statutory formula."

We must also pay rebates on products purchased by military personnel and\ndependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program. If we fail to provide timely information or are found to have\nknowingly submitted false information, we may be subject to civil monetary penalties.\nIndividual states continue to consider and have enacted legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs,\nincluding the cost of prescription drugs and combination products. A number of states have either implemented or are\nconsidering implementation of drug price transparency legislation. Requirements under such laws include advance notice\nof planned price increases, reporting price increase amounts and factors considered in taking such increases, wholesale\nacquisition cost information disclosure to prescribers, purchasers, and state agencies, and new product notice and reporting.\nSuch legislation could limit the price or payment for certain drugs, and a number of states may impose civil monetary\npenalties or pursue other enforcement mechanisms against manufacturers who fail to comply with drug price transparency\nrequirements.\nHealthcare Reform and Potential Changes to Healthcare Laws\nThe FDAs and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be\nenacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. For example, in December 2016,\nthe 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”) was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to\nmodernize the regulation of drugs and devices and to spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is uncertain. In\naddition, in August 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act was signed into law, which reauthorized the FDAs user fee\nprograms and included additional drug and device provisions that build on the Cures Act. If we are slow or unable to adapt\nto changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain\nregulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve\nor sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nA primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and\nother third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement for particular\nmedical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and applying new\npayment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the\nminimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new\nmethodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs\nthat are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended manufacturer Medicaid rebate obligations to utilization\nby individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount\nprogram; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal\nhealthcare programs; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and\nconduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for\nMedicare and Medicaid Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare\nand Medicaid spending.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the\nACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by\nseveral states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. In addition, other legislative changes have\nbeen proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other\nthings, led to reductions of Medicare payments to providers, which will remain in effect through 2031 unless additional\nCongressional action is taken. More recently, in March 2021, President Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan\nAct of 2021, which eliminates the statutory cap on the Medicaid drug rebate, currently set at 100% of a drug’s AMP,\nbeginning January 1, 2024. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States\nsince the ACA to reduce healthcare expenditures. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among\nother things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers and will remain in effect through 2032, with\nthe exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional action is taken by\nCongress; the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to\nseveral types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment"

Most recently, on August 16, 2022 the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was\nsigned into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with\nMedicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B\nand Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage\ngap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to\nregulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated, and the\nimpact of the IRA on the pharmaceutical industry cannot yet be fully determined.\nAdditionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to\nspecialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and\nenacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug and biologic pricing,\nreduce the cost of prescription drugs and biologics under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and\nmanufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs and biologics.\nIndividual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and\nimplementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient\nreimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, marketing cost disclosure and other\ntransparency measures, and, in some cases, measures designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk\npurchasing.\nOn December 13, 2021, the EU adopted Regulation No 2021/2282 on Health Technology Assessment (the\n“HTA”). While the HTA entered into force in January 2022, it will only begin to apply from January 2025 onwards, with\npreparatory and implementation-related steps to take place in the interim. Once the HTA becomes applicable, it will have a\nphased implementation depending on the concerned products. The HTA intends to boost cooperation among EU member\nstates in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and providing the basis for cooperation at the\nEU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The HTA will permit EU member states to use common HTA tools,\nmethodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of\nthe innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby\ndevelopers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising\ntechnologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU member states will continue to be\nresponsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions\non pricing and reimbursement.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation\nor administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. We expect that additional state and federal\nhealthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that governments and third-\nparty payors will pay for healthcare products and services.\nData Privacy and Security Laws\nNumerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to,\nconfidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our\noperations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations,\nincluding data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and\nregulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information.

As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 220 full-time employees, of which\napproximately 210 were located within the United States and approximately 10 were located outside of the United States.\nWe believe that the success and growth of our business depends in large part on our continued ability to attract,\nretain and motivate qualified personnel at all levels of our company. To do that, we employ a number of measures,\nincluding competitive compensation and benefits, fostering a culture that values diversity and inclusion, maintaining an\nethical workplace and focusing on employee safety and wellness. These measures help form our human capital\nmanagement framework and are advanced through the following actions, programs and initiatives:\nCompetitive Pay and Benefits. We provide our employees with competitive fixed salaries, cash bonus\nopportunities designed to incentivize achievement of our goals and individual objectives, equity awards and opportunities\nfor equity ownership through our employee share purchase plan as well as a robust benefit package designed to promote\nwell-being across different aspects of our employees’ lives, including comprehensive health insurance, dental and vision\nplans, life and other employment related insurance, retirement planning through a 401(k) plan with partial company match,\nand paid time off.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion. We value diversity and inclusion at all levels of our company. We believe that our\nbusiness benefits from the different perspectives that a diverse workforce brings, and we pride ourselves on having an\ninclusive culture. In 2021, we launched our diversity statement as a way to formally express our commitment to diversity,\nequity and inclusion (“DEI”) goals and initiated a monthly DEI dashboard for our employees. This initiative is part of our\nbroader effort to establish a systematic approach towards DEI. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics outlines our aim\nof cultivating a diverse and inclusive work environment. We mandate that our employees train annually on non-\ndiscrimination, antiracism, and promoting a diverse and inclusive workplace. As an additional demonstration of our focus\non DEI, we signed the MassBio’s CEO Pledge for a More Equitable and Inclusive Life Sciences Industry to recognize\nracial inequity in our industry and to work towards a more equitable and inclusive life sciences industry.\nEthics in the Workplace. We aim to run a compliant and ethical business, which we believe attracts and maintains\nthe highest caliber of executives and employees. Each employee of our company is required to confirm in writing that they\nunderstand and will comply with our policies, including but not limited to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, our\ninsider trading and compliance policy, our policies against bribery and corruption and our policies regarding interactions\nwith healthcare professionals. Employees are required to participate in periodic and as-needed trainings in order to refresh\ntheir understanding of our policies and provide additional instruction for new issues as and when they arise. For the clinical\nand manufacturing activities that we perform and oversee, we adhere to operating within the accepted GCP, cGMP and\nother similar regulatory guidelines. Overall, we believe that our commitment to quality and ethics throughout our business\nmakes us a stronger, compliant and competitive organization.\nHealth and Safety. Health and safety principles are firmly rooted across our company through the integration of\nhealth and safety processes throughout our business and risk management. To foster a safe and healthy culture, we have\nimplemented a comprehensive safety program and emergency response plan, driving to understand and mitigate against\nhealth and safety incidents. As part of our employee health and safety program, we have a number of safety policies that\nemployees are required to train on, conduct periodic on-site safety drills at our offices and perform periodic internal and\nexternal safety audits.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic and measures introduced by state and federal governments in the United\nStates, we have implemented COVID-19-specific workplace safety protocols at our facilities.

We have\nincurred significant operating losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the\nforeseeable future.\nBiopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of\nrisk. Typically, it takes many years to develop one new product from the time it is discovered to when it is available for\ntreating patients and development may cease for a number of reasons. We have incurred corporate operating losses in each\nyear since our inception in 2015 and anticipate incurring losses for the foreseeable future. Our future success depends on\nthe continued commercialization of ARCALYST and the development and eventual commercialization of one or more of\nour current or future product candidates.\nTo date, we have incurred significant losses.

      "text": "Table of Contents\n51\nWe cannot be certain we will continue to effectively execute our coverage and reimbursement strategy in the\nmarkets we pursue, which could limit the future commercial potential of ARCALYST in the approved recurrent pericarditis\nindication or any of our product candidates, if approved.\nGovernmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs\nthrough a number of efforts, including by delaying the time to reimbursement, by restricting the breadth of coverage, by\nlimiting the amount of reimbursement for particular products in terms of lower pricing and by increasing the proportion of\nthe cost for which the patient is responsible. There may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly\napproved products or product indications, coverage may be limited to a subset of the patient population for which the\ntreatment is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, and reimbursement rates may\nvary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used. Coverage and reimbursement barriers\nby payors may materially impact the demand for, or the price of, ARCALYST and any product candidate for which we\nobtain marketing approval, if any. If coverage and reimbursement are not available, or available only at limited levels, or if\nsuch coverage will require patient out-of-pocket costs that are unacceptably high, our ability to successfully commercialize\nARCALYST or any of the product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval may be adversely affected.\nMoreover, any coverage or reimbursement that may be obtained may be decreased or eliminated in the future. For example,\none of the large private health insurers that currently covers ARCALYST has placed ARCALYST on its exclusion list for\nthe CAPS indication, which could create hurdles for new patients seeking coverage for their prescriptions in all indications.\nWe may also be unable to adequately satisfy a third-party payor’s value/benefit assessment on an ongoing basis. It\nis possible that third-party payors will select low-cost clinical comparators that serve as benchmarks for determining\nrelative value, including generics, biosimilars and lower costs brands with or without the same approved indication. The\nresult of such a change would be a more challenging value/benefit assessment caused by a more challenging basis for\ncomparison and the potential for a worse relative outcome. Third-party payors may determine that we have failed to\ngenerate sufficient evidence to demonstrate the relative benefits of ARCALYST or any of our product candidates, if\napproved, and refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement entirely, or many find the evidence not sufficiently\ncompelling to support the desired pricing and reimbursement. Similarly, payors may implement coverage criteria that\nfurther restricts the use of ARCALYST or any of our product candidates, if approved, beyond the approved label, which\ncould adversely affect their commercial potential, including, for example, situations where a patient must be proven to not\nadequately respond to the lower-cost comparator.\nThird-party payors are also introducing more challenging price negotiation methodologies, including in re-visiting\nestablished coverage and reimbursement parameters when new competitors, including branded drugs, generics and\nbiosimilars, enter the market. It is possible that a third-party payor may consider our products and product candidates, if\napproved, as substitutable and only be willing to cover the cost of the alternative product. Even if we show improved\nefficacy, safety or improved convenience of administration with ARCALYST or any of our product candidates, if\napproved, pricing of competitive products may limit the amount we will be able to charge. Third-party payors may deny or\nrevoke the reimbursement status of a given product or establish prices for new or existing marketed products at levels that\nare too low to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in our product candidates. In some cases, when\nnew competitor generic and biosimilar products enter the market, there are mandatory price reductions for the innovator\ncompound. In other cases, payors employ “therapeutic category” price referencing and seek to lower the reimbursement\nlevels for all treatment in the respective therapeutic category. Additionally, new competitor brand drugs can trigger\ntherapeutic category reviews in the interest of modifying coverage and/or reimbursement levels. The potential of third-\nparty payors to introduce more challenging price negotiation methodologies could have a negative impact on our ability to\ncontinue to commercialize ARCALYST or successfully commercialize any of our product candidates, if approved. Third-\nparty payors may also employ challenging price negotiation tactics in the event of a proposed price increase of our current\nand future products.

We\nmay be unable to realize commercial benefits from such price increases due to unfavorable actions that third-party payors\n(including governmental authorities and private health insurers) may take in response to price increases. Even if price\nincreases lie below contractual price protection clauses, payors may request price concessions in exchange for covering our\nproducts or may opt to change coverage or reimbursement policies with respect to such products. If we cannot successfully\nnegotiate with such payors, we may be forced to provide significant price concessions or, if we fail to arrive at a\nsatisfactory resolution, lose favorable coverage or reimbursement for patients served by such payor. In such an event, we\nmay see materially negative impacts on the patients we seek to serve and our business operations.\nAny price concessions will reduce our overall revenue generation and may impair the benefit of any price\nincreases we may take. As a small commercial stage biopharmaceutical company our future success relies on the effective\ncommercialization of one or more products. Price concessions that reduce potential product revenue would lengthen our\ntimeline to profitability and may require us to rely on potentially dilutive capital-raising efforts to fund our operations,\nwhich may impact the price of our common shares. Even comparatively small discounts, if aggregated across payors, may\ncause materially lower revenue generation in the long-term which may offset the increased revenue we hoped to realize\nthrough a price increase.\nFurther, granting price concessions to one or more payors may limit our ability to negotiate prices with other\npayors or in other territories. Payors, including governmental payors, negotiate drug prices by reference to the prices we\nhave set with other payors. Should payors become aware of price concessions that we have granted, they may request\nsimilar concessions. If enough payors request and receive price concessions, our ability to generate revenue may be\nmaterially impacted, harming our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, this may limit our ability\nto secure acceptable prices in potential new territories, which may materially limit our overall commercial growth. A\nlimitation on our ability to commercialize in new and existing territories may also reduce our access to the patient\npopulations we seek to serve, harming our ability to deliver therapeutics to patients with unmet need.\nIn the event that we cannot successfully negotiate with payors requesting price concessions in connection with a\nprice increase or otherwise, such payors may choose to not cover our current and future products at all or may instate\nonerous reimbursement policies that limit patient access. We cannot assure you that current payor coverage and\nreimbursement policies for ARCALYST will continue. As a small commercial stage company, the loss of any payor,\nespecially a large payor, or limitations on patient access to our drugs affecting a sizeable number of patients may materially\nharm our ability to generate revenue and execute on our commercial strategy. Further, as a company targeting patients with\nsignificant unmet need, the loss of access to our products may materially harm our targeted patient populations who cannot\nsource adequate alternative therapies.\nPrice increases that outpace inflation may also trigger additional rebate obligations under the Medicaid drug rebate\nprogram, Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D.\nThe incidence and prevalence for target patient populations of our products or product candidates have not been\nestablished with precision. If the market opportunities for our products and product candidates are smaller than we\nestimate, or if any approval that we obtain is based on a narrower definition of the patient population, our revenue and\nability to achieve profitability may be materially adversely affected.\nThe precise incidence and prevalence for all the conditions we aim to address with our programs are not known\nwith specificity. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with\nthese diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our products and product candidates, if approved, are\nbased largely on our extrapolation from available population studies and estimates. These estimates have been derived from\na variety of sources, including scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations, pharmacy claims analyses, large\nnational surveillance databases or market research, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new trials and therapeutic\noptions may lead to changes in the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases, or relevant"

As a result, the number of patients who may benefit from our products or product candidates, if\napproved, may turn out to be lower than expected.\nThe total addressable market for any of our products and approved product candidates in the future, if any, will\nultimately depend upon, among other things, the diagnostic criteria and applicable patient population included in the final\nlabel for the product or product candidate approved for sale for its indication, the efficacy, safety and tolerability\ndemonstrated by the product candidate in our clinical trials, acceptance by the medical community and patients, pricing,\naccess and reimbursement. The number of addressable patients in the United States and other major markets outside of the\nUnited States may turn out to be lower than expected, patients may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our\nproducts or new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, all of which would adversely\naffect our results of operations and our business. Further, even if we obtain significant market share for our product\ncandidates, because the potential target populations are small for many of our approved and targeted indications, we may\nnever achieve significant and sustained profitability.\nEvolving health policy and associated legislative changes related to coverage and reimbursement aimed at lowering\nhealthcare expenditure could impact the commercialization of our product candidates. Pharmaceutical pricing has\nbeen, and likely will continue to be, a central component of these efforts.\nThe regulations that govern regulatory approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new pharmaceutical products\nvary widely from country to country. In markets of some of the countries we may pursue outside of the United States, our\nproducts and product candidates, if approved, may be subject to extensive governmental price control or other price\nregulations. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the\npricing review period begins after marketing approval is granted. In some markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing\nremains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain\nmarketing approval for a product candidate in a particular country, but then be subject to price negotiations that delay our\ncommercial launch of the product candidate in that country, possibly for lengthy time periods, which may negatively\nimpact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product candidate in that country.\nNet prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or legislated rebates that must be paid in order to\nparticipate in government healthcare programs or paid to other third-party payors. Mandatory discounts can be legislated at\nany time in any market. Similarly, some markets currently have pricing legislation that sets the price of a pharmaceutical\nproduct in their market by referencing the price of that product in other markets, known as international reference pricing.\nInternational reference pricing has the potential to impact price cut decisions in individual countries and the countries that\nreference the pricing of certain other individual countries.\nDrug importation and cross-border trade, both sanctioned and unsanctioned, occurs when a pharmaceutical\nproduct from a market where the official price is set lower is shipped and made commercially available in a market where\nthe official price is set higher. Any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict or limit drug importation or cross-border\ntrade, including in the United States, could have a material negative impact on our ability to commercialize ARCALYST or\nany of our product candidates, if approved.\nAs a result of the foregoing, we may not be able to achieve or sustain favorable pricing for ARCALYST or any of\nour product candidates, if approved, and adequate reimbursement, which may hinder our ability to recoup our investment\nin such drugs.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of\nARCALYST and any product candidates that we may develop, if approved.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the commercialization of ARCALYST and the\ntesting of our product candidates in clinical trials and other research activities. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves\nagainst claims that our products or product candidates caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities.

Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not\nbe able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nIf we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we\nwill be exposed to significant liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial position.\nThese liabilities could prevent or interfere with our commercialization efforts.\nIf, in the future, we are unable to maintain our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, infrastructure and\norganization directly and/or through agreements with third parties to sell and market our products and product\ncandidates, if approved, their commercial potential may be impaired.\nThere are risks involved with both establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into\narrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive\nand time-consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we\nrecruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have\nprematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be\nlost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial\nsupport services, our product revenues or the profitability of these revenues to us are likely to be lower than if we were to\nmarket and sell any approved product candidates ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into\narrangements with third parties to market and sell our approved product candidates, if any, or may be unable to do so on\nterms that are favorable to us. Further, we will likely have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to\ndevote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our approved product candidates effectively. However,\ndeveloping a sales, marketing and access organization requires significant investment, is time consuming and if not\ncompleted as planned could delay the launch of our approved product candidates. Furthermore, we may not be able to\nadequately establish an effective sales, marketing, distribution and access organization in the EU or other key markets in\nwhich we may obtain approval for the commercial marketing of our product candidates outside of the United States. If we\nare unable to maintain or establish sales, as applicable, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our\nown or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our approved product candidates, if\nany, and the approved product candidates’ ability to generate any revenue may be impaired.

Such obligations, along with continued regulatory review, may result in significant additional expense.\nFurthermore, if we seek and receive approval from regulatory authorities outside of the United States for products or any of\nour product candidates in the future, we will be subject to such authorities’ requirements, which may be over and above our\nobligations in the United States.\nManufacturers and their facilities are required to comply with extensive requirements of regulatory authorities,\nincluding ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform cGMP. As such, we and our CMOs will be\nsubject to user fees and continual review and inspections to assess compliance with cGMP or similar foreign regulations\nand adherence to commitments made in any BLA, or MAA. Accordingly, we and our CMOs and others with whom we\nwork must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing,\nproduction and quality control.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which\nthe product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing\ntesting, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor safety and efficacy. For example, the holder of an\napproved BLA or similar foreign application must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain approval for certain\nchanges to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. We could also be asked to conduct post-\nmarketing clinical trials to verify the safety and efficacy of our products in general or in specific patient subsets.\nIf our marketing approval would be obtained via the accelerated approval pathway, we could be required to\nconduct a successful confirmatory clinical trial to confirm clinical benefit for our products. An unsuccessful confirmatory\ntrial or failure to complete such a trial could result in the withdrawal of marketing approval. The FDA or foreign regulatory\nauthority also may place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS or similar risk management\nmeasures, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA or foreign regulatory authority concludes a REMS or similar\nrisk management measures are needed, the sponsor of the BLA or MAA must submit a proposed REMS or the similar risk\nmanagement measures before it can obtain approval. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication\nplans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization\ntools. We also will be required to report certain adverse reactions, production problems, inadequate efficacy and other\nissues, if any, to applicable regulatory authorities on an ongoing basis. In addition, the identification of new safety issues\ncould lead to new labeling or restrictions on population or use of our products, diminishing the addressable market or sales\nor both.

The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been\ninterpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers,\npurchasers and formulary managers on the other hand;\n●\nthe U.S. federal False Claims Act and civil monetary penalties laws, which, among other things, impose\ncriminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or\nentities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment\nthat are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay\nmoney to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery\nAct of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the federal\ngovernment. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not\nsubmit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or\nfraudulent claims. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting\nfrom a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of\nthe False Claims Act;\n●\nthe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), which prohibits U.S. companies and their\nrepresentatives from paying, offering to pay, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of anything of\nvalue to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate for\nthe purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person\nworking in an official capacity abroad. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we interact with may\nmeet the FCPA’s definition of a foreign government official. The FCPA also requires public companies to\nmake and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and\nmaintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls;\n●\nHIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit\nprogram or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money\nor property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the\npayor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material\nfact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare\nbenefits, items or service. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to\nhave actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n●\nthe federal civil monetary penalties laws, which impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or\ntransfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should\nknow it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of\nservices reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies;\n●\nthe U.S. federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Sunshine Act”,\nwhich requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under\nMedicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report to the Department of Health and\nHuman Services information related to certain financial interactions with physicians (defined to include\ndoctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners"

We have entered into consulting and advisory board\nagreements with physicians and other healthcare professionals and could be adversely affected if regulatory authorities\ndetermine our financial relationships with such prescribers violate applicable laws or create a conflict of interest. For\nexample, investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and\nreceive compensation in connection with such services. Regulatory authorities may conclude that a financial relationship\nbetween us and a principal investigator or a clinical trial site has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected\ninterpretation of a study. Regulatory authorities may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable\nclinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized, which could result in a delay in approval, or\nrejection, of our marketing applications by regulatory authorities and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing\napproval of our product candidates. Furthermore, investigators for our clinical trials may become debarred by regulatory\nauthorities, which may impact the integrity of our studies and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available\nunder such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such\nlaws. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment\nof healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations.\nInteractions between biopharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals are also governed by strict laws,\nregulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and healthcare professionals’ codes of professional conduct. The\nprovision of any inducements to healthcare professionals to prescribe, recommend, endorse, order, purchase, supply, use or\nadminister a drug product is prohibited. A number of countries have established additional rules requiring pharmaceutical\ncompanies to publicly disclose their interactions with physicians and other healthcare professionals and to obtain approval\nfrom employers, professional organizations or competent authorities before entering into agreements with healthcare\nprofessionals.\nEnsuring that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations\nmay involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not\ncomply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare\nlaws and regulations. If our operations, including activities conducted by our sales team, were to be found to be in violation\nof any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to the imposition of\ncivil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation\nin Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, individual imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational\nharm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements or oversight if we become subject to a\ncorporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and\ncurtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and\nour results of operations.

Our product candidates are in various\nstages of clinical development.

We may not be\nable to demonstrate that they are safe or effective in the indications for which we are studying them, and they may not be\napproved.\nWe cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will be successful in their clinical trials or will receive\nregulatory approval even after completing a successful pivotal clinical trial. We may also determine that the potential\nproduct and commercial profile of any of our product candidates may not ultimately be commercially successful, or even if\nwe believe they have the potential to be commercially successful, we may discontinue development of one or more of our\nproduct candidates or discontinue development in a specific indication for a particular product candidate, at any time for\nany reason.

Failure to generate sufficient\nrevenue from the commercialization of our current and future products, whether as a result of failing to obtain regulatory\napprovals or unsuccessfully commercializing such products would harm our ability to continue our operations.

We may\nencounter substantial delays in our clinical trials, or we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of\napplicable regulatory authorities. We may therefore be unable to obtain required regulatory approvals and be unable to\nsuccessfully commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must\nconduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing\nis expensive, time consuming and uncertain as to outcome.\nNot all of our clinical trials have been conducted as initially planned or completed on our initial projected\nschedule, and accordingly, we cannot guarantee that any of our current or future clinical trials will be conducted as initially\nplanned or completed on our initial projected schedule, if at all, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and\nmeasures taken in response to the pandemic. Further, even if conducted on time, a clinical trial may result in unfavorable or\nstatistically insignificant results. For example, in December 2021, we announced that the primary efficacy endpoint of the\nPhase 3 clinical trial of mavrilimumab in COVID-19-related ARDS did not reach statistical significance. We subsequently\ndecided to not progress mavrilimumab in the COVID-19-related ARDS indication. Clinical trials are a lengthy process that\nrequire the expenditure of significant money and human capital. Failing to achieve desired efficacy or identifying of a\nnovel safety hazard in turn represents an inability to successfully recoup such expense via a potential commercialization of\nthe product candidate, if approved. Sufficient inability to recoup clinical trial expense via successful development could\npose material risks to our business.

We have and may in the future receive feedback or guidance from\nregulatory authorities on our clinical trial design and protocols and, even after we incorporate such feedback or guidance\nfrom these regulatory authorities, such regulatory authorities may impose other requirements for our clinical trials, could\ndisagree that we have satisfied their requirements to commence our clinical trials, disagree with our interpretation of data\nfrom the relevant preclinical studies, clinical trials or chemistry, manufacturing and controls (“CMC”) data, or disagree or\nchange their position on the acceptability of our trial designs, including the proposed dosing level or schedule, treatment\nduration, our definitions of the patient populations or the clinical endpoints selected, which may require us to complete\nadditional preclinical studies, clinical trials, CMC development, other studies or impose stricter approval conditions than\nwe currently expect.\nCommencing our planned clinical trials is also subject to approval by a central institutional review board (an\n“IRB”) and an IRB or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before a trial may be initiated, which approval could be\ndelayed, rejected or suspended. Further, the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, the Data\nSafety Monitoring Board for such trial or regulatory authorities may impose a suspension or termination of our clinical\ntrials even after approval and initiation of trial sites due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial\nin accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site\nby regulatory authorities, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects that arise in the trial or failure to demonstrate a\nbenefit from using a drug, any of which could result in the imposition of a clinical hold, as well as changes in governmental\nregulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nSuccessful completion of our clinical trials is a prerequisite to submitting a BLA or supplemental BLA (an\n“sBLA”) to the FDA and an MAA, to the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) or competent authorities of the EU\nmember states, or other applicable regulatory authorities in other countries for each product candidate and, consequently, to\nobtaining approval and initiating commercial marketing of our current and any future product candidates.

Further, conducting global clinical trials, as we do for certain of our\nproduct candidates, may require that we coordinate among the legal requirements and guidelines of regulatory authorities\nacross a number of jurisdictions, including the United States, EU and countries outside of those jurisdictions, which could\nrequire that we amend clinical trial protocols or determine not to conduct a trial in one or more jurisdictions or to run\nseparate trials in various jurisdictions due to the inability, cost or delay in harmonizing divergent requests from such\nregulatory authorities, all of which could increase costs. In addition, clinical trials that are conducted in countries outside\nthe United States and the EU may subject us to risks associated with the engagement of non-United States and non-EU\nCROs who are unknown to the FDA or the EMA, or the EU member states’ regulatory authorities and may have different\nstandards of diagnosis, screening and medical care, as well as risks associated with further delays and expenses as a result\nof increased shipment costs (including as a result of local quality release or in-country testing of a product candidate supply\nproduced in a different jurisdiction for our clinical trials) and political and economic risks relevant to such countries\noutside the United States and the EU.\nIn addition, the FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies with respect to clinical trials may change and\nadditional government regulations may be enacted. For instance, the regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU\nrecently evolved. The EU CTR, which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became\napplicable on January 31, 2022. While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate CTA to be submitted in each\nmember state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, the CTR introduces a\ncentralized process and only requires the submission of a single application to all member states concerned. The CTR\nallows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each member\nstate, leading to a single decision per member state. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well,\nincluding a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect\nto specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s decision is communicated\nto the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed. The CTR\nforesees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR\nvaries. Clinical trials for which an application was submitted (i) prior to January 31, 2022 under the Clinical Trials\nDirective, or (ii) between January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2023 and for which the sponsor has opted for the application of\nthe Clinical Trials Directive remain governed by the said Directive until January 31, 2025. After this date, all clinical trials\n(including those which are ongoing) will become subject to the provisions of the CTR. Compliance with the CTR\nrequirements by us and our third-party service providers, such as our CROs, may impact our development plans.\nThe UK regulatory framework in relation to clinical trials is derived from existing EU legislation (as implemented\ninto UK law, through secondary legislation). However, on January 17, 2022, the MHRA launched an eight-week\nconsultation on reframing the UK legislation for clinical trials. The consultation closed on March 14, 2022 and aims to\nstreamline clinical trials approvals, enable innovation, enhance clinical trials transparency, enable greater risk\nproportionality, and promote patient and public involvement in clinical trials. The UK government has not yet published a\nresponse to the consultation but the outcome will be closely watched and will determine whether the UK chooses to align\nwith the CTR or diverge from it to maintain regulatory flexibility. Under the terms of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern\nIreland, provisions of the CTR which relate to the manufacture and import of investigational medicinal products and\nauxiliary medicinal products apply in Northern Ireland. A decision by the UK government not to closely align its\nregulations with the new approach that has been adopted in the EU may have an effect on the cost of conducting clinical\ntrials in the UK as opposed to other countries.\nIf we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or\npolicies governing clinical trials, our development plans may be impacted."

The\ntiming of our clinical trials depends in part on the speed at which we can recruit a sufficient number of participants to test\nour product candidates, particularly given that many of the conditions for which we are evaluating our current product\ncandidates or may evaluate them in the future are in small disease populations. In addition, the eligibility criteria of our\nclinical trials will further limit the pool of available trial participants, as we will require participants to have specific\ncharacteristics that we can evaluate based on the primary and secondary endpoints of the study. Further, our product\ncandidates modulate the immune system and carry risks associated with immunosuppression, including the risk of serious\ninfections, potential interference with vaccines, and other potential serious health risks. Additionally, certain indications for\nour product candidates may present challenges that may prevent us or third parties from conducting well-controlled studies.\nOur clinical trials have competed and may continue to compete with other clinical trials for product candidates\nthat are in the same therapeutic areas as our product candidates. This competition may further reduce the number and types\nof participants available to us because some participants who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to\nenroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited,\nwe may conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which would\nreduce the number of participants who are available for our clinical trials at such clinical trial site.\nAccordingly, when we encounter these or other difficulties in enrollment, we have experienced and may in the\nfuture experience delays, or we may be prevented from completing our clinical trials.

In addition, if other molecules in the same or related class in development\nby third parties show the same or similar side effects as those we observed in our trials but to a greater degree or reported\nnew previously unreported side effects, it could have an impact on the entire class of molecules in development, as the\napplicable regulatory agency may suspend or terminate our clinical trials, or not authorize us to initiate further trials with\nour molecule in that class. Further, third parties may have rights to independently develop and commercialize our current\nand future products and product candidates, which may increase the likelihood of adverse safety results. For example,\nRegeneron retains worldwide rights to develop and commercialize ARCALYST for local administration to the eye and ear\nand oncology. The development of ARCALYST in one or more of these indications could increase the possibility of\ngenerating adverse safety results. Such effects, if discovered by third parties, may not be discovered until after we\ncommence the commercialization of a product. Regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of, deny\nor withdraw any approval of, any of our products or product candidates, or require onerous label changes, for any or all\ntargeted indications in such an instance.\nIn addition, the compassionate use of our products and product candidates, or evaluation of our products and\nproduct candidates by third parties via scientific collaborations or investigator initiated studies could increase the\npossibility of generating adverse safety results that impact our development of such product candidates. Such adverse\nsafety results, when reported to regulatory authorities, may negatively impact the safety profile of the drug studied as a\nclass effect and could result in the imposition of clinical holds on all clinical trials involving such product candidate\nregardless of the indication studied.\nFurther, clinical trials by their nature utilize a sample of the potential patient population. Certain rare and severe\nside effects associated with our products or product candidates may only be uncovered with a significantly larger number\nof patients exposed to the product candidates.

Further, following approval, the FDA may conduct\nadditional inspections and, based on the results of such inspections, deem the inspected manufacturing facilities to be\ndeficient, suspending our ability to manufacture our product candidates until we can secure satisfactory alternative\nmanufacturing facilities.\nIn addition to the United States, we may seek regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates in\nother jurisdictions. While the scope of regulatory approval is similar in many countries, to obtain separate regulatory\napproval in multiple countries will require us to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of each such\ncountry or jurisdiction regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, commercial sales,\npricing and distribution, and we cannot predict success in any such jurisdictions.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals, both in the United States and in other countries, is time consuming,\nexpensive, may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors,\nincluding the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in marketing approval policies\nduring the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory\nreview for each submitted BLA, or equivalent application types, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an\napplication.

      "text": "Table of Contents\n73\nOur products, current product candidates and any of our future product candidates regulated as biologics in the United\nStates may face biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated.\nIn the United States, the BPCIA created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are\nbiosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA licensed reference biological product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a\nbiosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first\napproved under a BLA by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the\nFDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of\nexclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product for the same therapeutic\nindication if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and\ndata from adequate and well controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The law\nis complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and\nmeaning are subject to uncertainty.\nFor example, although ARCALYST was approved as a biological product under a BLA for the treatment of CAPS\nin February 2008, and we believe it qualified for the 12-year period of exclusivity against any biosimilars, such 12-year\nperiod of exclusivity has lapsed. The FDA approved ARCALYST for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis and reduction\nin risk of recurrence in adults and children 12 years of age and older in March 2021. However, the 12-year exclusivity\nperiod does not attach to the approval of an sBLA, potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition, subject\nto any Orphan Drug exclusivity under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Marketing\nApproval and Regulatory Matters — We may seek Orphan Drug designation for our product candidates in the United\nStates, as well as for any of our product candidates in the EU, and we may be unsuccessful, or may be unable to maintain\nthe benefits associated with Orphan Drug designation, including the potential for market exclusivity, for any product\ncandidate for which we obtain Orphan Drug designation.” If we obtain FDA approval for any of our other biological\nproduct candidates, we expect any such product candidates to qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity under the\nBPCIA. However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to Congressional action or otherwise, or that\nthe FDA will not consider any such approved product candidates to be reference products for competing products,\npotentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated.\nEven if we obtain marketing authorization of our current or future product candidates in a major pharmaceutical\nmarket such as the United States, or the EU, we may not seek or obtain approval or commercialize our current products\nor product candidates in other markets, which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential.\nIn order to market any products in a country or territory, we must establish and comply with numerous and\nvarying regulatory requirements of such country or territory regarding safety and efficacy. Regulatory requirements can\nvary widely from country to country, and clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory\nauthorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be\nobtained in any other country. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and\nvalidation, additional administrative review periods, and additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, which would be\ncostly and time consuming and could delay or prevent the introduction of our current or future product candidates, or\nARCALYST, in those countries. Satisfying these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain\nand subject to unanticipated delays. In addition, our failure to obtain regulatory approval in any country may delay or have\nnegative effects on the process for regulatory approval in other countries.\nWe may seek Orphan Drug designation for our product candidates in the United States, as well as for any of our\nproduct candidates in the EU, and we may be unsuccessful, or may be unable to maintain the benefits associated with\nOrphan Drug designation, including the potential for market exclusivity, for any product candidate for which we obtain\nOrphan Drug designation.\nWe have received Orphan Drug designation in the United States for mavrilimumab for the treatment of GCA, and\nwe may seek Orphan Drug designation for certain of our other product candidates in the United States as well as for any of\nour product candidates in the EU.

Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug or biologic as an Orphan Drug if it is intended\nto treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in\nthe United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation\nthat the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States.\nIn the EU, the European Commission grants Orphan Drug designation after receiving the opinion of the EMA’s\nCommittee for Orphan Medicinal Products on an Orphan Drug designation application. In the EU, Orphan Drug\ndesignation is intended to promote the development of drugs that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of\nlife-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions where (i) such conditions affect no more than five in 10,000 persons\nin the EU when the application is made or (ii) the product, without the benefits derived from Orphan Dug status, would not\ngenerate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or\ntreatment exists for marketing in the EU, or if such method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those\naffected by such condition. In the EU, Orphan Drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of\nfees or fee waivers, and upon grant of an MA, to potential marketing exclusivity.\nIn addition, if a drug or biologic with an Orphan Drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing\napproval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the drug or biologic is entitled to a period of\nmarketing exclusivity, which precludes a regulatory authority from approving another marketing application for the same\ndrug and disease or condition for that time period, except in limited circumstances. If our competitors are able to obtain\nOrphan Drug exclusivity prior to us, for products that constitute the “same drug” and treat the same diseases or conditions\nas our product candidates, we may not be able to have competing products approved by the applicable regulatory authority\nfor a significant period of time. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in the EU. The EU\nexclusivity period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that a drug no longer meets the\ncriteria for Orphan Drug designation including where it is shown that the drug is sufficiently profitable not to justify\nmaintenance of market exclusivity.\nIn connection with the FDA’s approval of ARCALYST in the recurrent pericarditis indication, we received seven\nyears of Orphan Drug exclusivity for ARCALYST for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis and reduction in risk of\nrecurrence in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older. Even if we obtain Orphan Drug exclusivity for any of our\nproduct candidates, that exclusivity may not effectively protect those product candidates from competition because\ndifferent drugs can be approved for the same disease or condition. Even after an Orphan Drug is approved, the FDA can\nsubsequently approve a later application for the same drug for the same disease or condition if the FDA concludes that the\nlater drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer in a substantial portion of the target populations, more\neffective or makes a major contribution to patient care. In addition, a designated Orphan Drug may not receive Orphan\nDrug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation.\nMoreover, Orphan Drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the\nrequest for designation was materially defective or if we are unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of the product to\nmeet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Foreign regulatory authorities may also make the same\ndetermination. Orphan Drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor\ngives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nWe may seek Breakthrough Therapy designation or Fast Track designation by the FDA, for one or more of our product\ncandidates, which we may not receive.

A\nBreakthrough Therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other\ndrugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that\nthe drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant\nendpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.

Both Fast Track designation and Breakthrough Therapy designations offer sponsors the potential for rolling\nreview of a BLA, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete\napplication is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees\nto accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees\nupon submission of the first section of the BLA.\nThe FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations, and\neven if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for such designations, we cannot be certain that the FDA would\ndecide to grant them. Even if we obtain such designations for one or more of our product candidates, we may not\nexperience a faster development process, review or approval compared to non-expedited FDA review procedures. In\naddition, the FDA may withdraw Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designations if it believes that such designations are\nno longer supported. Although product candidates receiving Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designation are\ngenerally eligible for the FDA’s priority review procedures, receiving such designations does not guarantee that the BLA\nfor such product candidates will receive priority review.\nWe may seek PRIME designation by EMA or other designations, schemes or tools in the EU, including the conditional\nmarketing authorization or marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances, for one or more of our product\ncandidates, which we may not receive. Such designations may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or\napproval process and do not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing authorization.\nWe may seek EMA PRIME (Priority Medicines) designation or other designations, schemes or tools for one or\nmore of our product candidates. In the EU, innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of\nmajor public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the\nPRIME scheme, which provides incentives similar to the Breakthrough Therapy designation in the United States. PRIME\nis a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical\nneeds. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize\ntheir product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. The benefits of a PRIME\ndesignation include the appointment of a rapporteur before submission of a marketing authorization application, early\ndialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review\nearlier in the application process.\nEven if we believe one of our product candidates is eligible for PRIME, the EMA may disagree and instead\ndetermine not to make such designation. The EMA PRIME scheme or other schemes, designations, or tools, even if\nobtained or used for any of our product candidates may not lead to a faster development, regulatory review or approval\nprocess compared to therapies considered for approval under conventional procedures and do not assure ultimate approval.\nIn addition, even if one or more of our product candidates is eligible to the PRIME scheme, the EMA may later decide that\nsuch product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for review or\napproval will not be shortened.\nProduct developers that benefit from PRIME designation may be eligible for accelerated assessment (in 150 days\ninstead of 210 days), which may be granted for medicinal products of major interest from a public health perspective or\nthat target an unmet medical need, but this is not guaranteed.\nMoreover, in the EU, a “conditional” marketing authorization may be granted in cases where all the required\nsafety and efficacy data are not yet available. A conditional marketing authorization is subject to conditions to be fulfilled\nfor generating missing data or ensuring increased safety measures. A conditional marketing authorization is valid for one\nyear and has to be renewed annually until fulfillment of all relevant conditions. Once the applicable pending studies are\nprovided, a conditional marketing authorization can become a “standard” marketing authorization. However, if the\nconditions are not fulfilled within the timeframe set by the EMA, the marketing authorization will cease to be renewed.\nFurthermore, marketing authorizations may also be granted “under exceptional circumstances” when the applicant can\nshow that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use even after\nthe product has been authorized and subject to the introduction of specific procedures. This may arise when the intended\nindications are very rare and, in the present state of scientific knowledge, it is not possible to provide"

This type of\nmarketing authorization is close to a conditional marketing authorization as it is reserved to medicinal products to be\napproved for severe diseases or unmet medical needs and the applicant does not hold the complete data set legally required\nfor the grant of a marketing authorization. However, unlike a conditional marketing authorization, the applicant does not\nhave to provide the missing data and will never have to. Although a marketing authorization “under exceptional\ncircumstances” is granted definitively, the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product is reviewed annually and the\nmarketing authorization may be withdrawn where the risk-benefit ratio is no longer favorable.\nThe competent regulatory authorities in the EU have broad discretion whether to grant such an accelerated\nassessment, conditional marketing authorization or marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances, and, even if\nsuch assessment or authorization is granted, we may not experience a faster development process, review or authorization\ncompared to conventional procedures. Moreover, the removal or threat of removal of such marketing authorizations may\ncreate uncertainty or delay in the clinical development of our product candidates and threaten the commercialization\nprospects of our products and product candidates, if approved. Such an occurrence could materially impact our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to successfully obtain marketing approvals for any of our current or future product candidates.\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in a timely manner for any of our current or future product candidates could have\na material adverse impact on our business and financial performance.\nAs a company, we have only limited experience in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates. As a\nresult, in the future, obtaining marketing approval for any of our current or future product candidates may require more\ntime and expense than we anticipate. Failure to successfully complete, or delays in, any of our eventual other pivotal trials\nor related regulatory submissions would prevent us from, or delay us in, obtaining regulatory approval for our current or\nfuture product candidates. It is possible that regulatory authorities may refuse to accept for substantive review any\nregulatory submissions that we submit for our product candidates or may conclude after review of our applications for any\nof our current or future product candidates that the submissions are insufficient to obtain marketing approval for such\nproduct candidates. Regulatory authorities may also require that we conduct additional clinical, preclinical or\nmanufacturing validation trials and submit that data before they will reconsider our applications. Depending on the extent\nof these or any other required trials, approval or receipt of any marketing authorization may be delayed by several years or\nmay require us to expend more resources than we have available. It is also possible that additional trials, if performed and\ncompleted, may not be considered sufficient by regulatory authorities to approve or grant marketing authorizations. Any\ndelay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, marketing approvals would delay or prevent us from commercializing any of\nour current or future product candidates, which may impair our ability to generate additional revenue. If any of these\noutcomes occur, we may be forced to modify or cease our development efforts for one or more of our product candidates,\nwhich could significantly harm our business.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could\nhinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or modified\nproducts from being developed, approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which could negatively impact\nour business.\nThe ability of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities to review and approve new products can be affected by a\nvariety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, statutory, regulatory, and policy changes, the FDA’s or\nforeign regulatory authorities’ ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and other events\nthat may otherwise affect the FDA’s or foreign regulatory authorities’ ability to perform routine functions. Average review\ntimes at the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government\nfunding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process,\nwhich is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies, such as the EMA following its\nrelocation to Amsterdam and resulting staff changes, may also slow the time necessary for new biologics or modifications\nto approved biologics to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect\nour business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and recently hit its\ndebt limit, which has caused certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, to furlough critical FDA employees and stop\ncritical activities."

Even though the FDA has since resumed standard inspection operations of\ndomestic facilities where feasible, the FDA has continued to monitor and implement changes to its inspectional activities to\nensure the safety of its employees and those of the firms it regulates as it adapts to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, and\nany resurgence of the virus or emergence of new variants may lead to further inspectional delays. Any resurgence of the\nvirus may cause additional postponements, exacerbating the previously discussed risks.\nRegulatory authorities outside the United States were similarly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If a\nprolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns prevent regulatory authorities from conducting their\nregular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of such regulatory\nauthorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing and Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe contract with third parties for manufacturing our commercial supply of ARCALYST and clinical supply for our\nproduct candidates and for certain research and other preclinical development and expect that we will continue to do so\nin the future. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we may not have sufficient quantities of ARCALYST\nor our product candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our research\nand development or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not currently own or operate any late-stage or commercial manufacturing facilities. Although we have built\na development and manufacturing facility to produce drug substance to support certain research, preclinical and other\nclinical development for our product candidates, we rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the\nmanufacture of our late-stage product candidates and certain early-stage product candidates for the majority of our clinical\ndevelopment efforts; the commercial manufacture of our current and future products; and labeling and packaging activities\nfor our current and future products. We rely on these third parties to produce our products and product candidates at\nsufficient quality and quantity to support our and our collaboration partners’ commercialization and research and\ndevelopment efforts.\nOur reliance increases the risk that we will have insufficient quantities of ARCALYST and our product candidates\nor that ARCALYST and our product candidates are not produced at an acceptable cost or quality, or not in a timely manner\ndue to, for example, production interruptions caused by equipment failure and an inability to source adequate replacement\nparts and equipment, which could delay, prevent or impair our commercialization or research and development efforts. For\nexample, in the second half of 2021, events were identified in the ARCALYST manufacturing process that prevented\ndistribution of certain ARCALYST material as previously planned, though we were able to ultimately source sufficient\nARCALYST material to cover our needs. Further, equipment used in the ARCALYST manufacturing process may no\nlonger be supported by vendors in the event of equipment failure. Such equipment may also not be repaired, replaced or\nqualified in a timely manner. These issues may be exacerbated by increased clinical or commercial demand by us or our\ncollaboration partners, should we decide to develop ARCALYST in one or more additional indications or in additional\nterritories. If we encounter events in the future that prevent additional material from being distributed in a timely manner or\nwithin specifications and we are unable to source additional commercial supply of ARCALYST, if needed, or should future\nmanufacturing or supply chain issues arise, we may be unable to adequately meet patient demand for ARCALYST or may\nbe required to effect a recall, any of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nRegeneron and its CMOs are the sole manufacturers of ARCALYST, and we have a contract with Regeneron to\nproduce ARCALYST on an exclusive basis, subject to limited exceptions. However, Regeneron is not obligated to accept\nour forecasts or purchase orders that are not in line with accepted forecasts and Regeneron may not have sufficient\nmanufacturing capacity to meet our commercial or clinical demand for ARCALYST. Regeneron, in turn, relies upon CMOs\nor other third parties to conduct fill/finish operations for ARCALYST. In the event that a particular batch of ARCALYST\nfails to meet specifications, whatever the cause, we are nonetheless obligated to pay for such material pursuant to the terms\nof the Supply Agreement. As a result of our reliance on Regeneron and its CMOs as our sole manufacturers, we do not\nhave control over their manufacturing operations and scheduling, which may impact our"

We may also be subject to unexpected costs arising from\nany manufacturing or supply chain disruptions, which may materially impact our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nUnder certain circumstances, we or Regeneron could initiate a technology transfer to either us or another CMO to\nmanufacture ARCALYST. For example, Regeneron could unilaterally initiate a technology transfer to us as early as March\n2023. Finding new CMOs or third-party suppliers to produce ARCALYST would add additional costs and require\nsignificant time and focus from our management and technical teams. We may also not be able to identify a suitable CMO\nthat can meet our manufacturing timeline and technical requirements. Even if we were to find a CMO, such CMO would\nneed to produce ARCALYST at a different manufacturing site, potentially using a different or more costly process, or at a\ndifferent scale. We cannot provide any assurance that the technology transfer from Regeneron to us or to another CMO will\nbe successful in producing ARCALYST in sufficient quantities or of acceptable quality, if at all, or that we or another\nCMO will produce a comparable product to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities, which could delay, prevent or impair\nthe further development, if any, or commercialization of ARCALYST. Further, we may be unable to establish a new\nagreement with another CMO on acceptable terms, if at all. Any technology transfer initiated by us or Regeneron would be \npursuant to an agreed upon technology transfer plan. If a successful technology transfer is not completed during the time \nthat Regeneron is obligated to manufacture ARCALYST, or Regeneron is unable to manufacture and supply sufficient \nquantities of requested safety stock, there could be supply shortages for our patients and collaborators, resulting in lost \nrevenue.  \nWe have qualified CMOs to produce KPL-404 drug product, are in the process of transferring KPL-404 drug\nsubstance manufacturing to a new CMO and have engaged CMOs to manufacture mavrilimumab drug substance and drug\nproduct. While we have manufacturing capabilities to support early development for our product candidates, we and our\nCMOs may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of our product candidates or produce them at an acceptable quality,\nincluding as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or global supply chain issues, which could delay, prevent or impair our\ndevelopment or commercialization efforts and increase costs.\nWe have entered into certain collaboration agreements with Huadong for each of ARCALYST and mavrilimumab.\nUntil such time as Huadong is able to manufacture these products, either on its own or through a third-party CMO, we are\nthe only source of these products for Huadong. If our current suppliers of drug substance and drug product for ARCALYST\nand mavrilimumab cannot produce sufficient quantities to satisfy our needs and Huadong’s needs, then this may have an\nadverse impact on our and Huadong’s business and operations.\nOur suppliers may also be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Risk Factors — General Risk\nFactors — The COVID-19 pandemic, and measures taken in response to the pandemic, could have an adverse impact that\nis significant on our business and operations as well as the business or operations of our manufacturers, CROs and other\nthird parties with whom we conduct business or otherwise engage, including the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and\nhas impacted and could continue to impact the global economy, which may have a material adverse effect on our business,\noperations and financial position.”\nIf we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our products or product candidates or change manufacturers\nor manufacturing processes, we may be unsuccessful in producing products or product candidates comparable to those used\nin prior clinical trials. Therefore, we may need to conduct additional process development or additional clinical trials to\nbridge our prior clinical results to those resulting from the new manufacturing process, which could impact the timing and\nsubsequent success of our planned clinical trials. In addition, as we plan to produce clinical trial and commercial material\nat a CMO, the CMO may be required to adopt different manufacturing protocols or processes. For example, although\nRegeneron has produced ARCALYST for commercial use for over ten years, regulatory authorities may reevaluate\nARCALYST’s current manufacturing processes or route of administration in connection with evaluating whether to\napprove ARCALYST for any new indication or for additional territories in the future or in connection with a technology\ntransfer from Regeneron to us or another CMO.\nThe facilities used by our CMOs to manufacture ARCALYST and our current and future product candidates may\nbe inspected by regulatory authorities in connection with the submission of our marketing applications to, and review by,\nregulatory authorities or based on their work for other clinical trial sponsors.

If our CMOs cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms\nto our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of regulatory authorities, they will not be able to secure or\nmaintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. While we review the compliance history and performance\nof our CMOs and have the ability to audit their compliance and performance, we have no direct control over the ability of\nour CMOs to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel other than through quality\nmonitoring in accordance with our agreements with the CMOs. If regulatory authorities do not approve these facilities for\nthe manufacture of our product candidates or if they withdraw any such approval in the future, we may need to find\nalternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for\nor market ARCALYST or our current or future product candidates, if approved. Further, our failure, or the failure of our\nthird-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including\nclinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures\nor recalls of products or product candidates, if approved, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which\ncould significantly and adversely affect our business and supplies of our products or product candidates.\nOur product candidates may also compete with other product candidates and approved products for access to and\ncapacity within manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations\nand that might be capable of manufacturing for us. Furthermore, given the limited number of available manufacturing slots\nand the long lead times needed to reserve them, manufacturers require monetary commitments in connection with such\nreservations as well as fees for changes or cancellations in the reserved manufacturing slots. As a result, we may wait to\nreserve manufacturing slots until we can be informed by data from the clinical trials of our product candidates, which may\nbe several months from the time we request manufacturing slots. Any significant delay in the supply of clinical materials\nfor our product candidates could considerably delay conducting our clinical trials and potential regulatory approval of our\nproduct candidates. Alternatively, we may project when we may need additional clinical material for our product\ncandidates and reserve manufacturing time-slots “at-risk” prior to our product candidates having generated data from their\nthen current clinical trials.\nIn addition, given the lead times we must provide to Regeneron with respect to the commercial supply of\nARCALYST, we must place purchase orders based on projected demand, in advance of knowing the market acceptance of\nARCALYST for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis. Such projections involve risks and uncertainties. For example, we\nmay be unable to swiftly accommodate for unforeseen increases in commercial demand for ARCALYST given the lead\ntimes we must provide to Regeneron and limitations on Regeneron’s manufacturing capacity for ARCALYST. These risks\nmay result in additional costs or delays in manufacturing clinical materials for our product candidates when and if we\nactually need them and commercial materials for ARCALYST and may result in having too little or too much of our\nproduct candidates or ARCALYST in inventory to meet actual demand.\nAny performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay, as applicable, clinical\ndevelopment or marketing approval or commercialization efforts for our current and future products. If our current CMOs\ncannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace such manufacturers. Although we believe that there are several\npotential alternative manufacturers who could manufacture our product candidates, we may incur added costs and delays in\nidentifying and qualifying any such replacement. In addition, we may not be able to establish new agreements on\nacceptable terms, if at all, with such alternative manufacturers. Further, Regeneron has an exclusive right to produce\nARCALYST, subject to limited exceptions, which could impact our ability to find a replacement manufacturer for\nARCALYST in a short period of time, if needed. Additionally, establishing a replacement manufacturer for ARCALYST or\nour product candidates, if required, is unlikely to be accomplished in a timely or cost-effective manner, if at all.\nFurthermore, despite our efforts, we may be unable to procure a replacement supplier or do so on commercially reasonable\nterms, which could have a material adverse impact upon our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we or\nour CMOs are able to find a replacement supplier, such replacement supplier would need to be qualified and may require\nadditional regulatory approval, which could result in further delay."

We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and\nregulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases,\nthese hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers’ and\nsuppliers’ facilities pending their use and disposal. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an\ninterruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental\ndamage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage,\nhandling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products.

In such an event, we may be held liable for\nany resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources, and state or federal or other applicable authorities\nmay curtail our use of certain materials or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and\nregulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of\nsuch changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. We do not currently carry biological or hazardous waste\ninsurance coverage.\nManufacturing or supply issues could cause product shortages, disrupt or delay our clinical trials or regulatory\napprovals, delay or stop commercialization of our products and product candidates, and adversely affect our business.\nThe manufacture of our current and future products and product candidates is highly regulated, complex and\ndifficult, requiring a multi-step and controlled process, and even minor problems or deviations could result in ARCALYST\nor our product candidates failing to meet approved specifications, failed batches or other failures, such as defective\nproducts or manufacturing failures. We have limited experience overseeing the manufacturing processes of ARCALYST,\nKPL-404 and mavrilimumab. Due to the highly technical requirements of manufacturing our current and future products\nand product candidates and the strict quality and control specifications, we and our third-party providers may be unable to\nmanufacture or supply ARCALYST or our product candidates despite our and their efforts. Failure to produce sufficient\nquantities of our product candidates could delay their development, result in supply shortages for our patients, result in lost\nrevenue, if any, and diminish our potential profitability, as applicable, which may lead to lawsuits or could delay the\nintroduction of our product candidates to the market.\nThe manufacture of our current and future products and product candidates is at high risk of product loss due to\ncontamination, equipment malfunctions, human error or raw material variability or shortages. Deviations from established\nmanufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, failed batches and other supply disruptions and\nincreased costs. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our current and future products and product\ncandidates or manufacturing facilities, any related production lot could be lost and the relevant manufacturing facilities\nmay need to close for an extended period of time to investigate and remediate the contaminant. The involvement of our\nthird-party manufacturers, including Regeneron, may exacerbate such effects, which has required and may in the future\nrequire us to reject lots for quality control purposes. See “Risk Factors—We contract with third parties for manufacturing\nour commercial supply of ARCALYST and clinical supply for our product candidates and for certain research and other\npreclinical development and expect that we will continue to do so in the future.

For example,\nwe contract with a network of specialty pharmacies who distribute ARCALYST as well as peripheral supplies that are\nrequired to reconstitute and self-administer ARCALYST, such as sterile water for injection, syringes and needles. A delay\nor shortage in the supply or the distribution of the peripheral supplies required to administer ARCALYST may impact\npatient access to ARCALYST and could cause us to lose potential revenue, reduce our potential profitability, and damage\nour reputation.\nWe also contract with third parties to source specialized placebo for use in our clinical trials which cannot be\neasily replaced as it must be nearly indistinguishable from our product candidates to ensure proper clinical trial blinding. If\nwe encounter shortages of such placebo, our clinical trials may be substantially delayed unless and until we can source\nsuitable replacements.\nIn addition, our third-party providers may fail to comply with cGMP and other stringent regulatory requirements\nrelated to the manufacturing process.

We may\nalso have to write off inventory and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications,\nundertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Such manufacturing issues could\nincrease our cost of goods, cause us to lose potential revenue, reduce our potential profitability or damage our reputation.\nThe third parties upon whom we rely for the supply of the drug substance and drug product used in our products and\nproduct candidates are our sole source of supply, and the loss of any of these suppliers could significantly harm our\nbusiness or the business of our partners.\nThe drug substance and drug product used in ARCALYST, mavrilimumab and vixarelimab are supplied to us from\nsingle-source suppliers and we obtain the drug substance and drug product used in KPL-404 from a limited number of\nsources. Regeneron has a contractual right to be our sole source manufacturer of ARCALYST unless they have a persistent\nfailure to satisfy our supply needs or initiate a manufacturing technology transfer to us. Our ability to continue to\ncommercialize ARCALYST, to develop our product candidates, and to ultimately supply our commercial products in\nquantities sufficient to meet market demand, depends in part on our ability to obtain the drug substance and drug product\nfor ARCALYST and these product candidates in accordance with regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities for\ncommercialization and clinical testing.

Neither we nor our third-party\nmanufacturers may successfully complete any required increase to existing manufacturing capacity in a timely manner, or\nat all.\nMoreover, our ability to progress our preclinical and clinical programs or successfully commercialize our products\ncould be materially and adversely impacted if any of the third-party suppliers upon which we rely for raw materials and\npreclinical and clinical stage product candidate and commercial stage product supply were to experience a significant\nbusiness challenge, disruption or failure due to issues such as financial difficulties or bankruptcy, issues relating to other\ncustomers such as regulatory or quality compliance issues, or other financial, legal, regulatory or reputational issues.\nAdditionally, any damage to or destruction of our manufacturing facilities or equipment or those of our third-party\nmanufacturers’ or suppliers’ facilities or equipment may significantly impair our ability to manufacture our products and\nproduct candidates on a timely basis.\nIn addition to the above, we have entered into, and may, in the future, enter into collaboration and other\nagreements requiring us to provide commercial or clinical drug supply to third-party partners. This includes additional\nvixarelimab drug substance that Genentech may request from us pursuant to the terms of the Genentech License\nAgreement. A failure by our CMOs to supply sufficient quantities of drug supply may cause us to breach our contractual\nobligations, triggering potential penalties under our agreements, including termination of such agreements, if we fail to\nadequately cure such breach.\nEstablishing additional or replacement suppliers for the drug substance and drug product used in ARCALYST or\nour product candidates, if required, is unlikely to be accomplished quickly and can take several years, if at all. Furthermore,\ndespite our efforts, we may be unable to procure a replacement supplier or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which\ncould have a material adverse impact upon our business. If we or our CMOs are able to find a replacement supplier, such\nreplacement supplier would need to be qualified and may require additional regulatory approval, which could result in\nfurther delay. While we and our CMOs may seek to maintain adequate inventory of the drug substance and drug product\nused in ARCALYST or our product candidates, any interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials, or our\ninability to obtain such drug substance and drug product from alternate sources of comparable quality at acceptable prices\nin a timely manner could impede, delay, limit or prevent our development or commercialization efforts, which could harm\nour business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nCertain of the materials required in the manufacture and the formulation of our products and product candidates\nare derived from biological sources. Such materials are difficult to procure and may be subject to contamination or recall.\nAccess to and supply of sufficient quantities of raw materials which meet the technical specifications for the production\nprocess is challenging, and often limited to single-source suppliers. Finding an alternative supplier could take a significant\namount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory\napprovals. If we or our manufacturers are unable to purchase the materials necessary for the manufacture of ARCALYST\nor our product candidates on acceptable terms, in a timely manner, at sufficient quality levels, or in adequate quantities, if\nat all, our ability to produce sufficient quantities of our products for clinical or commercial requirements would be\nnegatively impacted. A material shortage, contamination, recall or restriction on the use of certain biologically derived\nsubstances or any other material used in the manufacture of our products and product candidates could adversely impact or\ndisrupt manufacturing, which would increase costs and impair our ability to generate revenue from the sale of ARCALYST\nor our product candidates, if approved."

If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, comply with regulatory\nrequirements or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our\nproduct candidates, and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and other third parties, such as CROs,\nto activate sites, conduct or otherwise support our preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates properly\nand on time. We also rely on third parties to conduct other research related to our product candidates. We expect to rely\nheavily on these parties for such site activation, execution of and otherwise supporting clinical trials for our product\ncandidates. While we have agreements governing their activities and we review the compliance history and performance of\nour CROs as well as have the ability to audit such activities, we have no direct control over their activities and have limited\ninfluence over their actual performance other than through quality monitoring in accordance with our agreements with the\nCROs. The third parties with whom we contract for execution of our preclinical studies and our clinical trials play a\nsignificant role in the conduct of these studies and trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. Except for\nrestrictions imposed by our contracts with such third parties, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of\nresources that they devote to our programs. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and\nclinical trials in accordance with applicable GLP or GCP requirements, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our\nclinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal and regulatory requirements and scientific\nstandards, and our reliance on these third parties does not and will not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. For any\nviolations of laws and regulations during the conduct of our preclinical studies or clinical trials, we could be subject to\nwarning letters or enforcement actions that may include civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nWe and our CROs are required to comply with regulations, including GCPs, for conducting, monitoring, recording\nand reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate, and that\nthe trial participants are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials and their rights are\nprotected. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be\ndeemed unreliable, and regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our\nmarketing applications. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates produced under cGMPs\nor similar foreign regulations. Our failure or the failure of our CROs to comply with these regulations may require us to\nrepeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process and could also subject us to enforcement action.\nWe also are required to register certain clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-\nsponsored database within certain timeframes. Failure to do so when required can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil\nand criminal sanctions.\nAlthough we have and intend to continue to design the clinical trials for our product candidates, CROs will\nactivate sites and conduct and oversee all of the clinical trials together with the various clinical trial sites that we engage to\nconduct the studies. As a result, many important aspects of our development programs for our product candidates,\nincluding their conduct and timing, will be outside of our direct control. Our reliance on third parties to activate sites and\nconduct future clinical trials will also result in less direct control over the management of data developed through clinical\ntrials than would be the case if we were relying entirely upon our own staff. Communicating with outside parties can also\nbe challenging, potentially leading to mistakes as well as difficulties in coordinating activities. Outside parties may:\n●\nhave staffing difficulties;\n●\nhave disruptions to their business and operations, including as a result of the impact from an epidemic or\npandemic disease outbreak, including COVID-19 (see “Risk Factors — Risks related to product development\n— The COVID-19 pandemic, and measures taken in response to the pandemic, could have an adverse impact\non our current or planned preclinical studies and clinical trials, which could be significant”) or as the result\nof war, conflict or terrorism as with the ongoing war in Ukraine (see “Risk Factors – General Risk Factors –\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine, and actions taken against Russia as a"

If the\nCROs, their subcontractors or the clinical trial sites do not perform clinical trials in a satisfactory manner, breach their\nobligations to us or fail to comply with regulatory requirements, the development, regulatory approval and\ncommercialization of our product candidates may be delayed, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval and\ncommercialize our product candidates, or our development program may be materially and irreversibly harmed. If we are\nunable to rely on clinical data collected by our CROs, their subcontractors or the clinical trial sites, we could be required to\nrepeat, extend the duration of or increase the size of any clinical trials we conduct and this could significantly delay\ncommercialization and require significantly greater expenditures.\nFurther, if our CROs, their subcontractors or the clinical trial sites fail to devote sufficient resources to the\ndevelopment of our product candidates, or if their performance is substandard, it may delay or compromise the prospects\nfor approval and commercialization of our product candidates. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires\nus to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information is\nmisappropriated.\nIf the third parties conducting our preclinical studies or our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or\nobligations, experience significant business challenges, disruptions or failures, such as due to the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic, do not meet expected deadlines, terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced, or if the quality or\naccuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our protocols or to GCPs, or for any other\nreason, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties. This could be difficult, costly or\nimpossible, and our preclinical studies or clinical trials may need to be extended, delayed, terminated or repeated. As a\nresult, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval in a timely fashion, or at all, for the applicable product candidate,\nour financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase,\nand our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nOur reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will\ndiscover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nBecause we rely on third parties to develop and manufacture our product candidates, we must, at times, share\ntrade secrets with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements\nand, if applicable, invention assignment agreements, material transfer agreements, collaborative research agreements,\nconsulting agreements or other similar agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees, independent contractors\nand consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the\nrights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, such as trade secrets. Despite the contractual\nprovisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information\nincreases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the\ntechnology of others or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based,\nin part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor’s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or\ndisclosure would impair our competitive position and may harm our business. To the extent that we share trade secrets of\nthird parties that are licensed to us, unauthorized use or disclosure could expose us to liability."

We face competition\nwith respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we\nmay seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical\ncompanies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology\ncompanies that currently market and sell drugs or biologics or are pursuing the development of therapies in the fields in\nwhich we are interested. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the\nsame as or similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. Potential competitors also include\nacademic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek\npatent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and\ncommercialization.\nWe are not aware of any FDA-approved therapies for recurrent pericarditis, but we are aware of two programs\nbeing developed in this indication. One is by R-Pharm International (RPH-104), which inhibits IL-1α/IL-1β-induced\nsignaling and is in Phase 2 development; the other is an oral cannabidiol being developed by Cardiol Therapeutics in an\nopen label Phase 2 setting. Anakinra (KINERET), marketed by Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, is currently approved for\nuse in RA, CAPS and DIRA. We are not aware of any active, industry sponsored development programs using anakinra\nseeking a label for recurrent pericarditis. Canakinumab (ILARIS), marketed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, is\ncurrently approved for use in CAPS, Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS),\nHyperimmunoglobulin D Syndrome (HIDS), Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD) and Familial Mediterranean Fever\n(FMF), Still’s Disease and Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA). We are not aware of any active, industry\nsponsored development programs using canakinumab seeking a label for recurrent pericarditis. Additionally, Novartis is\nalso developing gevokizumab for use in oncologic indications. Clinical stage development programs include: VTX2735\nand VTX3232 (Ventyx Biosciences, Inc.), ZYIL-1 (Zydus Lifesciences Ltd.), HT-6184 (Halia Therapeutics, Inc.),\nOLT1177 (Olatec Therapeutics LLC), DFV-890 (Novartis A.G.), Selnoflast (Roche), NT-0167 and NT-0796 (NodThera\nLtd.), Somalix and Onzomelid (Roche).\nIn addition, there are several molecules in development designed to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome, an\nintracellular sensor of a broad range of danger signals, that leads to the release of IL-1β and IL-18. Clinical stage\ndevelopment programs include: VTX2735 and VTX3232 (Ventyx Biosciences), ZYIL-1 (Zydus Lifesciences), HT-6184\n(Halia), OLT1177 (Olatec Therapeutics), DFV-890 (Novartis), Selnoflast (Roche), NT-0167 and NT-0796 (NodThera),\nSomalix and Onzomelid (Roche).

We are not aware of\nany active, industry sponsored development programs for these programs seeking a label for recurrent pericarditis.\nThere are various programs in clinical development antagonizing the CD40 / CD154 costimulatory pathway.\nNovartis A.G. is developing CFZ-533, or iscalimab (anti-CD40) for subcutaneous administration for the treatment of\nSjögren's Syndrome. Certain other programs are designed for intravenous administration only. Horizon Therapeutics plc (in\nthe process of being acquired by Amgen Inc.) is developing the Tn3 fusion protein, dazodalibep (anti-CD40L); Biogen,\nInc. and UCB S.A. are developing dapirolizumab pegol (anti-CD40L) for the treatment of moderately to severely active\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus; and Eledon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing AT-1501 (anti-CD40L) for use by patients\nundergoing kidney transplantation.

(gimsilumab and namilumab) and\nHumanigen, Inc. (lenzilumab). All of these competitive programs target the GM-CSF ligand itself versus targeting the GM-\nCSF receptor like mavrilimumab.\nFurther, the results of clinical trials for our product candidates may produce negative, inconclusive or\nuncompetitive results compared to those produced by any of these or other companies in the indications we are studying,\nwhich may result in us deciding, or regulatory authorities requiring us, to conduct additional clinical trials or modify or\ncease development programs for our product candidates. We may also determine that the potential product and commercial\nprofile of any of our product candidates may not ultimately be commercially successful or even if they have the potential to\nultimately be successful, we may not have sufficient recourses, which in either case could lead us to discontinue its\ndevelopment in certain indications, or we may determine not to support further development of any of our product\ncandidates at any time for any reason.\nMany of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have\nsignificantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing,\nconducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and\nacquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being\nconcentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be\nsignificant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These\ncompetitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and\nestablishing clinical trial sites and participant registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies\ncomplementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize\nproducts that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive\nthan any drugs that we may develop. Further, a competitor conducting a clinical trial in a rare disease indication for which\nwe market a product may reduce the number of patients on our commercial therapy by recruiting such patients to be trial\nparticipants. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we\nmay obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are\nable to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are\nlikely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of\nrelated products, market acceptance by prescribers and patients, the level of generic competition and the availability of\nreimbursement from government and other third-party payors.\nWe may not be successful in executing our growth strategy to identify, discover, develop, in-license or acquire additional\nproduct candidates or technologies, and our growth strategy may not deliver the anticipated results or we may refine or\notherwise alter our growth strategy.

We may do\nthis through our internal discovery program, or by acquiring the rights to product candidates and technologies through a\nvariety of transaction types, including in-licensing, strategic transactions, mergers or acquisitions. If we are unable to\nidentify, discover, develop, in-license or otherwise acquire and integrate product candidates, or their related companies, in\naccordance with this strategy, our ability to pursue this component of our growth strategy would be limited and we may\nneed to refine or otherwise alter this strategy.

Our future financial performance and our\nability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability\nto effectively manage the future development of our company and expansion of our operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology or obtain and maintain patent protection for our\ntechnology and products, if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, or if the terms of our\npatents are insufficient to protect our product candidates for an adequate amount of time, our competitors could develop\nand commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize\nour technology and products may be materially impaired.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property\nprotection in the United States and other countries for our products and product candidates, including ARCALYST, KPL-\n404 and mavrilimumab. We seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods,\nfiling patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our proprietary technology, inventions and\nimprovements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets,\nknow-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property\nposition.\nWe acquire, in-license and file patent applications directed to our products and product candidates in an effort to\nestablish intellectual property positions directed to their compositions of matter and manufacture as well as uses of these\nproducts and product candidates in the treatment of diseases. Our intellectual property includes patents and patent\napplications that we own as well as patents and patent applications that we in-license. For example, we have a field-\nspecific exclusive license under a license agreement with Regeneron to patent applications and patents relating to\nARCALYST, an exclusive license under the MedImmune Agreement to patent applications and patents relating to\nmavrilimumab, and an exclusive license under our license agreement with BIDMC to patent applications and patents\nrelated to KPL-404.\nCertain provisions in our intellectual property agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations.

Like patents, trademarks also\nmay be successfully opposed or challenged.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves\ncomplex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. The degree of patent\nprotection we require to successfully commercialize our product candidates may be unavailable or severely limited in some\ncases and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. We cannot provide\nany assurances that any of our owned or in licensed patents have, or that any of our owned or in-licensed pending patent\napplications that mature into issued patents will have, claims with a scope sufficient to protect ARCALYST, KPL-404,\nmavrilimumab, or any future products and product candidates. A U.S. patent covering ARCALYST as a composition of\nmatter expired in 2020, and relevant composition of matter patents issued outside of the United States are expected to\nexpire by 2023, not including any patent term extensions. A U.S. patent covering methods of using ARCALYST in the\ntreatment of recurrent pericarditis was issued in June 2021 and has a statutory term that expires in 2038, not including any\npatent term adjustment. The composition of matter patents for mavrilimumab generally have statutory expiration dates in\n2027, not including any extensions or adjustments. The issued composition of matter patents for KPL-404 have statutory\nexpiration dates in 2036, not including any extensions. The issued composition of matter patents licensed from BIDMC\nrelated to KPL-404 have statutory expiration dates in 2032, not including any patent term extensions or adjustments. In the\nUnited States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions and adjustments\nmay be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. The actual protection afforded by a\npatent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of\npatent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a\nparticular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. For example, the applicable regulatory exclusivity\nperiod is often triggered by the date a product candidate obtains regulatory approval, and we cannot predict with any\ncertainty whether and if so, when, the applicable product would receive regulatory approval in any given jurisdiction.\nFurthermore, the type, scope and duration of such exclusivities will vary on a country-by-country basis depending on the\njurisdiction in which a product candidate is approved and the particular regulatory exclusivity for which the product is\neligible as of the time of approval in such jurisdiction.\nPatents may be eligible for limited patent term extension in the United States under the Drug Price Competition\nand Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Similar patent extensions exist in the EU\n(supplementary protection certificate) and Japan, subject to the applicable laws in those jurisdictions. In most countries,\nincluding the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application.\nIn the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for\nadministrative delays by the USPTO, in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally\ndisclaimed over an earlier expiring patent. In certain countries, the term of a patent that covers a drug product may also be\neligible for patent term extension when regulatory approval is granted, provided the legal requirements are met. We may\nnot receive an extension if we or our licensees fail to apply within applicable deadlines or fail or are unable to apply prior\nto expiration of relevant patents. For example, no patent term extension was obtained in the United States following the\nFDA’s approval of ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS in 2008, and the deadline for applying for such extension has\npassed. Accordingly, patent term extension in the United States based on the FDA’s approval of ARCALYST for CAPS, or\nany other indication for which the FDA may grant approval in the future, is unavailable. Further, while patent term\nextension was awarded for relevant patents in certain European countries following the EMA’s approval of ARCALYST\nfor the treatment of CAPS, in 2012 the marketing authorization for CAPs was withdrawn. Patent term extensions may no\nlonger be in effect or available, subject to the applicable laws in those countries as well as other factors, such as whether a\nmarketing approval for ARCALYST is reissued and whether such reissuance is prior to the expiration of the patent’s\nnatural 20-year patent term. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. In addition, the laws of\nother countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we or our licensees are\nunable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than requested, the period during which our\npatent rights can be enforced for that product will be shortened and competitors may obtain approval to market competing\nproducts sooner, impacting our revenue."

In some cases, an in-licensed patent portfolio may have undergone a considerable loss of patent term prior to our\ninitiation of development and commercialization of the product or product candidate. For example, the patents in the\nUnited States covering ARCALYST as a composition of matter have expired, and patents covering ARCALYST as a\ncomposition of matter in Europe have a term that expires in 2023, not including any patent term extensions, and the patents\ncovering mavrilimumab as a composition of matter have a term that expires in 2027 in the United States, not including any\npatent term adjustments or patent term extensions, and in 2027 in Europe, not including any patent term extensions. We or\nour licensees may not receive any patent term extension for patents covering mavrilimumab as a composition of matter if\nsuch patent in an applicable jurisdiction expires before mavrilimumab would be eligible to receive regulatory approval in\nsuch jurisdiction. As a result, our owned and in-licensed patent portfolio may not provide adequate and continuing patent\nprotection sufficient to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to our product candidates. In\nsuch cases, regulatory exclusivity is expected to be relied upon for our or our licensees’ product candidates. The expiration\ndate of regulatory exclusivity is determined on a country-by country-basis if the applicable product is approved in such\ncountry and if any applicable regulatory exclusivity applies and is granted. The actual expiration date of any such\nregulatory exclusivity, however, is subject to significant uncertainty. For instance, the applicable regulatory exclusivity\nperiod is often triggered by the date a product candidate obtains regulatory approval, and we cannot predict with any\ncertainty whether and if so, when, the applicable product would receive regulatory approval in any given jurisdiction.\nFurthermore, the type, scope and duration of such exclusivities will vary on a country-by-country basis depending on the\njurisdictions in which a product candidate is approved and the particular regulatory exclusivity for which the product is\neligible as of the time of approval.\nOther parties may have developed or may develop technologies that may be related or competitive to our own, and\nsuch parties may have filed or may file patent applications, or may have received or may receive patents, claiming\ninventions that may overlap or conflict with those claimed in our patent applications or issued patents, with respect to\neither the same methods or formulations or the same subject matter, in either case, that we may rely upon to dominate our\npatent position in the market. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries,\nand patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing,\nor in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or our licensors were the first to make the\ninventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the\nfirst to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial\nvalue of our patent rights cannot be predicted with any certainty.\nIn addition, the patent prosecution process is expensive and time consuming, and we or our licensees may not be\nable to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Patent\nprosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the USPTO is\noften significantly narrowed by the time they issue, if at all. The claims of our issued patents or patent applications when\nissued may not cover our product candidates, proposed commercial technologies or the future products that we develop, or\neven if such patents provide coverage, the coverage obtained may not provide any competitive advantage. Further, it is\npossible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain\npatent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we do not have the right to control the preparation, filing and\nprosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we in-license from, or out-license\nto, third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prepared, prosecuted, enforced or maintained in a\nmanner consistent with the best interests of our business. In the case of our field-limited license from Regeneron, another\nlicensee may have the right to enforce patents covering the product in their field. As a result, we may need to coordinate\nprosecution, enforcement or maintenance with another party, and even then, the other party could prosecute, enforce or\nmaintain the patents in a manner adverse to our interests or otherwise put the patents at risk of invalidation.\nThe strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific\nquestions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in issued patents in the\nUnited States or in other countries. Even if we acquire patent protection that we expect should enable us to maintain a\ncompetitive advantage, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such"

The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship,\nscope, validity, enforceability or term, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices\nin the United States and abroad. For example, we may be subject to a third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO\nchallenging the priority of an invention claimed within one of our patents, which submissions may also be made prior to a\npatent’s issuance, precluding the granting of any of our pending patent applications. We or our licensees may become\ninvolved in contested proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others from whom we have obtained\nlicenses to such rights. For example, patents granted by the USPTO may be subject to third-party challenges such as\n(without limitation) derivation, re-examination, interference, post-grant review or inter partes review proceedings, and\npatents granted by the European Patent Office may be challenged by any person in an opposition proceeding within nine\nmonths from the publication of the grant. Similar proceedings are available in other jurisdictions, and in some jurisdictions\nthird parties can raise questions of validity with a patent office even before a patent has granted. Competitors may claim\nthat they invented the inventions claimed in our issued patents or patent applications prior to the date our inventions were\ninvented, or may file patent applications before we or our licensees do. In such case, we or our licensees may have to\nparticipate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO, to determine which party is entitled to a patent on the\ndisputed invention. We or our licensees may also become involved in similar opposition proceedings in the European\nPatent Office or similar offices in other jurisdictions regarding our intellectual property rights with respect to our products\nand technology.\nSuch proceedings can be expensive, time consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical and managerial\npersonnel, which could in turn harm our business, whether or not we receive a determination favorable to us or our\nlicensees. We may not be able to correctly estimate or control our future operating expenses in relation to such proceedings,\nwhich could affect operating expenses. Our operating expenses may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a\nvariety of factors, including the costs of such proceedings.\nSince patent applications are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we, our\nlicensees or our licensors were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates. Competitors may\nalso contest our patents, if issued, by showing the patent examiner that the invention was not original, was not novel or was\nobvious. In litigation, a competitor could claim that our patents, if issued, are not valid or enforceable for a number of\nreasons. If a court agrees, rights to those challenged patents may be diminished or lost.\nIn addition, we may in the future be subject to claims by our, our licensees’ or our licensors’ former employees or\nconsultants asserting an ownership right in our patents or patent applications as a result of the work they performed on our\nor their behalf, respectively. Although we generally require all of our employees and consultants and any other partners or\ncollaborators who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to assign or grant similar rights to\ntheir inventions to us, we cannot be certain that we, our licensees’ or our licensors have executed such agreements with all\nparties who may have contributed to our intellectual property, nor can we be certain that our agreements with such parties\nwill be upheld in the face of a potential challenge, or that they will not be breached, for which we may not have an\nadequate remedy.\nAn adverse determination in any such submission or proceeding may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to\noperate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our or\nour licensees’ ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, without\npayment to us, could limit the duration of the patent protection covering our technology and product candidates, or could\nreduce the period of time during which our licensees are obligated to make royalty payments to us for the sale of licensed\nproducts. Such challenges may also result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize our product candidates without\ninfringing third party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent\napplications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize\ncurrent or future product candidates.\nEven if they are unchallenged, our issued patents and our pending patent applications, if issued, may not provide\nus or our licensees with any meaningful protection or prevent competitors from designing around our patent claims to\ncircumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing\nmanner.

Further,\nif we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market our product candidates or any\nfuture product candidates under patent protection would be reduced.\nLicensing of intellectual property is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal, business and\nscientific issues. If we breach any of the agreements related to our product candidates, we could lose the ability to\ncontinue the development and commercialization of the related product. Additionally, our current licensing and\nacquisition agreements contain limitations and restrictions that could limit or adversely affect our ability to develop and\ncommercialize other products in the future.\nWe entered into agreements to acquire the rights to develop and commercialize ARCALYST and our product\ncandidates, KPL-404 and mavrilimumab. In September 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Regeneron to\nobtain an exclusive license under certain intellectual property rights controlled by Regeneron to develop and\ncommercialize ARCALYST. In December 2017, we entered into the MedImmune Agreement to obtain exclusive\nworldwide rights to research, develop, manufacture, market and sell mavrilimumab and any other products covered by the\nlicensed patent rights. In connection with our acquisition of Primatope in March 2019, we acquired an exclusive world-\nwide license with BIDMC for certain patent applications and patents related to KPL-404. Each of these agreements\nrequires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the related product candidates, make\ntimely milestone and other payments, provide certain information regarding our activities with respect to such product\ncandidates and indemnify the other party with respect to our development and commercialization activities under the terms\nof the agreements. These agreements and any future such agreements that we enter into impose a variety of obligations and\nrelated consequences.\nWe are a party to license and acquisition agreements of importance to our business and to our current product\ncandidates, and we expect to be subject to additional such agreements in the future. Disputes may arise between us and any\nof these counterparties regarding intellectual property subject to, and each parties’ obligations under, such agreements,\nincluding:\n●\nour diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development and\ncommercialization of our product candidates, and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n●\nthe scope of rights granted under the agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n●\nour obligations to make milestone, royalty or other payments under those agreements;\n●\nwhether and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor\nthat is not subject to the agreement;\n●\nour right to sublicense patents and other rights to third parties;\n●\nthe ownership of inventions, know-how and other intellectual property, including intellectual property rights\nresulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our licensors, licensees, partners or\ncollaborators;\n●\nour right to transfer or assign the license; and\n●\nthe effects of termination."

Any such dispute could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail, or our licensees cause us to fail, to meet our obligations under these agreements in a material respect,\nthe respective licensor/seller would have the right to terminate the respective agreement and upon the effective date of such\ntermination, have the right to re-obtain the related technology as well as aspects of any intellectual property controlled by\nus and developed during the period the agreement was in force that relate to the applicable technology. This means that the\nlicensor/seller to each of these agreements could effectively take control of the development and commercialization of our\nproduct candidates after an uncured, material breach of the agreement by us. This would also be the case if we voluntarily\nelected to terminate the relevant agreement, which we have the right to do under each of these agreements. While we\nwould expect to exercise our rights and remedies available to us in the event we fail, or our licensees cause us to fail, to\nmeet our obligations under these agreements in any material respect, including seeking to cure any breach by us or our\nlicensees, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the technology licensed to or acquired by us, we may not be able\nto do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost or at all. Any uncured, material breach under the license could result in\nour loss of exclusive rights and may lead to a complete termination of our product development and any commercialization\nefforts for each of our product candidates. Termination of one of these agreements for any reason, and the related\ndiscontinuation of the development or commercialization of a product candidate could impair our ability to raise additional\ncapital, generate revenue and may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nRegeneron retains worldwide rights to develop and commercialize ARCALYST for local administration to the eye\nand ear and oncology. Additionally, Regeneron retains the right to develop and commercialize ARCALYST for all\napplications in the Middle East and North Africa. The development of ARCALYST in other fields could increase the\npossibility of identifying adverse safety results that impact the commercialization of ARCALYST for the treatment of\nrecurrent pericarditis.\nCertain of our agreements may limit or delay our ability to consummate certain transactions, may impact the value\nof those transactions, or may limit our ability to pursue certain activities. For example, under the Regeneron Agreement,\nRegeneron has a right of first negotiation over the assignment or sale of our rights to any product we develop under the\nRegeneron Agreement to third parties and we must obtain Regeneron’s prior consent to assign or sublicense our rights\nunder such agreement to a third party. Under the MedImmune Agreement, we cannot sublicense the rights licensed or\nsublicensed to us without the consent of MedImmune and certain applicable third-party licensors, if required by\nagreements between MedImmune and such third-party licensors.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the\noutcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our sublicensees to develop, manufacture,\nmarket and sell our products and product candidates, if approved, and use our proprietary technologies without infringing\nthe proprietary rights and intellectual property of third parties. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are\ncharacterized by extensive and frequent litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. We cannot assure\nyou that our products, product candidates or any future product candidates, including methods of making or using these\nproduct candidates, will not infringe existing or future third-party patents. We may in the future become party to, or\nthreatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and\nproduct candidates and technology, including contested proceedings before the USPTO. Our competitors or other third\nparties may assert infringement claims against us, alleging that our products are covered by their patents.\nGiven the vast number of patents in our field of technology, we cannot be certain that we do not infringe existing\npatents or that we will not infringe patents that may be granted in the future. Many companies have filed, and continue to\nfile, patent applications related to immunomodulation. Some of these patent applications have already been allowed or\nissued, and others may issue in the future.

While we may decide to initiate proceedings to challenge the validity of these or other patents in the\nfuture, we may be unsuccessful, and courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad could uphold the validity of\nany such patent. If we were to challenge the validity of any issued U.S. patent in court, we would need to overcome a\nstatutory presumption of validity that attaches to every U.S. patent. This means that in order to prevail, we would have to\npresent clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent’s claims. In order to avoid infringing these or any\nother third-party patents, we may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses to such patents from such third-party\nintellectual property holders. However, we may be unable to secure such licenses or otherwise acquire or in-license any\ncompositions, methods of use processes or other intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary\nfor our current or future product candidates. The licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a\ncompetitive area, and several more established companies may also pursue strategies to license or acquire third-party\nintellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a\ncompetitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and greater clinical development and commercialization\ncapabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us.\nWe also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an\nappropriate return on our investment or at all. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party\nintellectual property or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to cease development of the\nrelevant program or product candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and prospects.\nSince our product candidates are being developed for use in fields that are competitive and of strong interest to\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, we will likely seek to file additional patent applications and may have\nadditional patents granted in the future, based on our future research and development efforts. Furthermore, because patent\napplications can take many years to issue and may be confidential for 18 months or more after filing, and because pending\npatent claims can be revised before issuance, there may be applications of third parties now pending which may later result\nin issued patents that may be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates. Regardless of when filed,\nwe may fail to identify relevant third-party patents or patent applications, or we may incorrectly conclude that a third-party\npatent is invalid or not infringed by our product candidates or activities. If a patent holder believes our product candidate\ninfringes its patent, the patent holder may sue us even if we have received patent protection for our technology. Moreover,\nwe may face patent infringement claims from non-practicing entities that have no relevant drug revenue and against whom\nour own patent portfolio may thus have no deterrent effect. If a patent infringement suit were threatened or brought against\nus, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product candidate that is the\nsubject of the actual or threatened suit.\nIf we are found to infringe a third-party’s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license\nfrom such third party to continue developing and marketing our product candidates and technology. Under any such\nlicense, we would most likely be required to pay various types of fees, milestones, royalties or other amounts. However, we\nmay not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain\nsuch a license, it could be granted on non-exclusive terms, thereby providing our competitors and other third parties access\nto the same technologies licensed to us. Without such a license, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease\ndeveloping and commercializing the infringing technology or product candidate, or forced to redesign it, or to cease some\naspect of our business operations. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages\nand attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed such third-party patent rights. We may be required to\nindemnify collaborators or contractors against such claims. A finding of infringement could prevent us from\ncommercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm\nour business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation can be expensive and time consuming\nand would divert management’s attention from our core business. Any of these events could harm our business\nsignificantly.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights.\nCompetitors and other third parties may infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our patents and other\nintellectual property rights, whether owned or in-licensed. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we or our current\nor future licensees may be required to file infringement claims against these infringers. A court may disagree"

Further, such third parties could counterclaim that we\ninfringe their intellectual property or that a patent we or our licensees have asserted against them is invalid or\nunenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims challenging the infringement, validity,\nenforceability or scope of asserted patents are commonplace. In addition, third parties may initiate legal proceedings\nagainst us or licensees to assert such challenges to our intellectual property rights. The outcome of any such proceeding is\ngenerally unpredictable. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory\nrequirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement, or foreign equivalents thereof. Patents may be\nunenforceable if someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or\nmade a misleading statement during prosecution. It is possible that prior art of which we or our licensors and the patent\nexaminer were unaware during prosecution exists, which could render our patents invalid. Moreover, it is also possible that\nprior art may exist that we are aware of but do not believe is relevant to our current or future patents, but that could\nnevertheless be determined to render our patents invalid or unenforceable.\nSome of our competitors may be able to devote significantly more resources to intellectual property litigation, and\nmay have significantly broader patent portfolios to assert against us if we or our licensees assert our rights against them.\nFurther, because of the substantial discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that\nsome of our confidential information could be disclosed or otherwise compromised during litigation.\nAn adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents, whether owned or in-licensed,\nat risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or\nunenforceability of our patents covering one of our product candidates, we or our licensees would lose at least part, and\nperhaps all, of the patent protection covering such product candidate. Competing products may also be sold in other\ncountries in which our patent coverage might not exist or be as strong. If we or our licensees lose a patent lawsuit outside\nof the United States, alleging our infringement of a competitor’s patents, we or our licensees could be prevented from\nmarketing our products in one or more such countries. Any of these outcomes would have a materially adverse effect on\nour business.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their\nnormal responsibilities.\nLitigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims, with or without merit, is\nunpredictable and generally expensive and time consuming and is likely to divert significant resources from our core\nbusiness, including distracting our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Furthermore,\nbecause of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk\nthat some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition,\nthere could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and\nif securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price\nof our Class A common shares. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce\nthe resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities.\nWe or our licensees may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or\nproceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively\nthan we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios.\nAccordingly, despite our efforts, we or our licensees may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or\nmisappropriating or from successfully challenging our intellectual property rights. Uncertainties resulting from the\ninitiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to\ncompete in the marketplace."

In\naddition, periodic maintenance fees on issued patents often must be paid to the USPTO and patent agencies outside of the\nUnited States over the lifetime of the patent. While an unintentional lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late\nfee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in\nabandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant\njurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but\nare not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to\nproperly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensees fail to appropriately file and prosecute patent\napplications covering the licensed products, product candidate or technologies, and maintain any patent issuing from such\npatent applications, we or our licensees may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing products that are the same as\nor similar to the licensed products, product candidates or technologies, which would have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness. In addition, if we or our licensees fail to apply for applicable patent term extensions or adjustments, we will have\na more limited time during which we can enforce our granted patents, or receive royalties from a licensee. In addition, if\nwe are responsible for patent prosecution and maintenance of patent rights in-licensed to us, any of the foregoing could\nexpose us to liability to the applicable patent owner.\nWe may not be able to effectively enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would\nbe prohibitively expensive. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly in developing\ncountries. Moreover, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by\nunforeseen changes in intellectual property laws outside of the United States. In addition, the patent laws of some such\ncountries do not afford intellectual property protection to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies\nhave encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions\noutside of the United States. Varying filing dates in international countries may also permit intervening third parties to\nallege priority to patent applications claiming certain technology. The legal systems of some countries, particularly\ndeveloping countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property rights. This could make it\ndifficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For\nexample, many countries outside of the United States have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must\ngrant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against certain parties,\nincluding government agencies or government contractors. Consequently, we or our licensees may not be able to prevent\nthird parties from practicing inventions covered by our patents, whether owned or in-licensed, in all countries outside the\nUnited States. Competitors may use our or technologies in jurisdictions where we or they have not obtained patent\nprotection, or where we or they have obtained patent protection, but such jurisdictions do not favor the enforcement of\npatents and other intellectual property rights, to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing\nproducts to territories where we have patent protection, if our or our licensees’ ability to enforce our patents to stop\ninfringing activities is inadequate. These products may compete with our products and product candidates or the products\nand product candidates that we have out-licensed, and our or our licensees’ patents or other intellectual property rights may\nnot be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights, whether owned or in-licensed, in jurisdictions outside of the United\nStates, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and resources from other aspects of\nour business. Furthermore, while we intend to pursue protection for our intellectual property rights in the major markets for\nour product candidates, we cannot ensure that we or our licensees will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all\njurisdictions in which we or they may wish to market our or our out-licensed products and product candidates.\nAccordingly, our or our licensees’ efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In\naddition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and other countries may affect the ability to\nobtain and enforce adequate intellectual property protection for our technology."

      "text": "Table of Contents\n98\nChanges to the patent law in the United States and other jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general,\nthereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property,\nparticularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve both technological and\nlegal complexity and is therefore costly, time consuming and inherently uncertain. Patent reform legislation in the United\nStates and other countries, including the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the “Leahy-Smith Act”), signed into law on\nSeptember 16, 2011, contribute to those uncertainties and costs. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant\nchanges to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that have affected the way patent applications are prosecuted, and\nhave redefined prior art and provided more efficient and cost-effective avenues for competitors to challenge the validity of\npatents. In addition, the Leahy-Smith Act has transformed the U.S. patent system into a first-to-file system in which,\nassuming that other requirements of patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the\npatent regardless of whether a third party was first to invent the claimed invention. A third party that has filed a patent\napplication in the USPTO after March 2013 but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of\nours even if we had made the invention before it was made by such third party. This requires us or our licensees to be\ncognizant of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Furthermore, our ability to obtain and maintain valid\nand enforceable patents depends on whether the differences between our technology and the prior art allow our technology\nto be patentable over the prior art. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential\nfor a period of time after filing or until issuance, we cannot be certain that we were the first to either (1) file any patent\napplication related to our product candidates or (2) invent any of the inventions claimed in our patents or patent\napplications. Even where we have a valid and enforceable patent, we or our licensees may not be able to exclude others\nfrom practicing the claimed invention where the other party can show that they used the invention in commerce before our\nfiling date or the other party benefits from a compulsory license.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the Leahy-Smith Act are changes that (i) affect the way patent\napplications are prosecuted, (ii) redefine prior art, and (iii) provide more efficient and cost-effective avenues for\ncompetitors to challenge the validity of patents. These include changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent\ninfringement suit and provide new opportunities for third parties to challenge issued patents in the USPTO. We or our\nlicensees may be subject to the risk of third-party prior art submissions on pending applications or become a party to\nopposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our\npatents. There is a lower standard of evidence necessary to invalidate a patent claim in a USPTO proceeding relative to the\nstandard in U.S. district or federal court. This could lead third parties to challenge and successfully invalidate our or our\nlicensees’ patents that would not otherwise be invalidated if challenged through the court system. Accordingly, a third party\nmay attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our or our licensees’ patent claims that would not have been\ninvalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. Thus, the Leahy-Smith Act and its\nimplementation increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our or our future licensees’ patent\napplications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent\nprotection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition,\nthere have been recent proposals for additional changes to the patent laws of the United States and other countries that, if\nadopted, could impact our or our licensees’ ability to obtain or maintain patent protection for our or our out-licensed\nproprietary technology or our or their ability to enforce our or our out-licensed proprietary technology, respectively.\nDepending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. courts, the USPTO and the relevant law-making bodies in other\ncountries, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to\nobtain new patents; enforce or shorten the term of our or our licensees’ existing patents and patents that we might obtain in\nthe future; shorten the term that has been lengthened by patent term adjustment of our or our licensees’ existing patents or\npatents that we might obtain in the future; or challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents that may be asserted\nagainst us by our competitors or other third parties. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness."

The UPC is intended to provide an alternative mechanism to disputing patent rights\nin the courts of individual European countries. The UPC will be a significant change in European patent practice. Since the\nUPC is a new court, there are no existing precedents and the rulings of the UPC will be unpredictable at the outset, thus\nincreasing the uncertainty of any litigation involving a Unitary Patent.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position may be\nharmed.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we may rely upon unpatented trade secret protection, unpatented\nknow-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. Although we seek to\nprotect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our\ncollaborators, scientific advisors, contractors, employees, independent contractors and consultants, and invention\nassignment agreements with our independent contractors, consultants, scientific advisors and employees, we may not be\nable to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical know-how or other trade secrets by the parties to these\nagreements. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or\nhave had access to our confidential information or proprietary technology and processes. Monitoring unauthorized uses and\ndisclosures is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary technologies will be\neffective. If any of the collaborators, scientific advisors, employees, contractors and consultants who are parties to these\nagreements breaches or violates the terms of any of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies for any such\nbreach or violation (e.g., in countries that do not favor the enforcement of intellectual property rights), and we could lose\nour trade secrets as a result. Moreover, if confidential information that is licensed or disclosed to us by our partners,\ncollaborators or others is inadvertently disclosed or subject to a breach or violation, we may be exposed to liability to the\nowner of that confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets,\nlike patent litigation, is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the\nUnited States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets.\nWe cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use or unauthorized reverse\nengineering of our technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. We may not\nbe able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. The steps we\nhave taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property.\nWe also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and other confidential information by\nmaintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.\nWhile we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be\nbreached. Detecting the disclosure or misappropriation of confidential information and enforcing a claim that a party\nillegally disclosed or misappropriated confidential information is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome\nis unpredictable. Further, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our confidential\ninformation may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors, in which case we would have\nno right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete\nwith us. We may in the future rely on trade secret protection, which would be subject to the risks identified above with\nrespect to confidential information.\nOur trade secrets could otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. Competitors\ncould purchase our product candidates and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from\nour development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or\ndevelop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. If any of our trade secrets\nwere to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those\nto whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If our trade secrets are not\nadequately protected so as to protect our market against competitors’ products, our competitive position could be adversely\naffected, as could our business."

At times, competitors or other third parties may adopt\ntrade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to\nmarket confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of\nother registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade\nnames. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then\nwe may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.

During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive\nrejections. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such\nrejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many jurisdictions outside of the United States, third\nparties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks.\nOpposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such\nproceedings. Moreover, any name we propose to use with our product candidates in the United States must be approved by\nthe FDA, regardless of whether we have registered it, or applied to register it, as a trademark. The FDA typically conducts\na review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. If the\nFDA objects to any of our proposed proprietary product names, we may be required to expend significant additional\nresources in an effort to identify a suitable substitute name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe\nthe existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine, and actions taken against Russia as a result of its invasion of Ukraine, has and may\ncontinue to have an adverse impact on the global economy, equity capital markets and our clinical operations.\nIn February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine to the condemnation of the international community. The conflict\nremains ongoing and has led to devastation and significant market and other disruptions, including volatility in commodity\nprices and supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, supply chain interruptions, political and social\ninstability, changes in consumer or purchaser preferences as well as increases in cyberattacks and espionage. In response to\nRussia’s invasion and perpetration of war crimes, western nations, including the United States and the EU, instated severe\neconomic sanctions against Russia, including the suspension of Russian banks from the global SWIFT system, travel bans,\npersonal sanctions against the Russian elite and boycotts of Russian goods and commodities. Private organizations\nresponded similarly, with many companies choosing to suspend their Russian operations or end them entirely.\nThe situation is rapidly evolving, and the United States, the EU, the UK and other countries may implement\nadditional sanctions, export controls or other measures against Russia, Belarus and other countries, regions, officials,"

Such sanctions and other measures, as well as the existing and\npotential further responses from Russia or other countries to such sanctions, tensions and military actions, could adversely\naffect the global economy and financial markets and could adversely affect our business, operations and financial position.\nThe U.S. commodity and capital markets have and will likely continue to be significantly volatile as a result of the conflict.\nThe war has posed and may continue to pose risks to global supply chains, further threatening the global and U.S.\neconomy. The price of our shares and the shares of other biopharmaceutical companies may fluctuate or otherwise be\nimpacted, especially if the war or governmental responses thereto result in a prolonged economic downturn. As a result of\nsuch disruptions, we may be unable to raise additional capital when needed or on acceptable terms, if at all. These risks\nmay also be compounded with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and measures taken in response to the pandemic, on\nU.S. and global capital markets. See “Risk Factors – General Risk Factors – The COVID-19 pandemic, and measures\ntaken in response to the pandemic, could have an adverse impact that is significant on our business and operations as well\nas the business or operations of our manufacturers, CROs and other third parties with whom we conduct business or\notherwise engage, including the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and has impacted and could continue to impact the\nglobal economy, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial position.”\nThe conflict in Ukraine has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our clinical development\nefforts. We conduct clinical trials at sites across the globe, including in Eastern Europe. In the aftermath of the invasion, we\nterminated planned clinical trial operations in Ukraine and Russia. While we were able to secure alternative clinical trial\nsites in other European countries, there is no guarantee that such sites will be able to provide a sufficient number of\nparticipants to satisfy our clinical need and at a reasonable cost. Further, should the conflict escalate beyond Ukraine and\nwe are forced to terminate ongoing or planned clinical trial operations, we may be unable to secure alternative clinical sites\nwhen needed or on acceptable terms, if at all. The foregoing may cause significant delays or disruptions to our clinical\ndevelopment efforts, which could have a material impact on our business, operations and financial position.\nFurthermore, due to the political uncertainty involving Russia and Ukraine, there is also an increased likelihood\nthat we or our CROs or other third parties with whom we conduct business or otherwise engage, may also be subject to\nretaliatory cyberattacks perpetrated by Russia or others at its direction in response to economic sanctions and other actions\ntaken against Russia as a result of its invasion of Ukraine. See “Risk Factors – General Risk Factors – Our information\ntechnology systems, or those of our third party CMOs, CROs or other contractors, consultants and service providers, may\nfail or suffer cyberattacks or security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our or such third-party’s\nbusiness or operations and our development programs for our product candidates or loss of other assets, including funds.”\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and measures taken in response to the pandemic, could have an adverse impact that is\nsignificant on our business and operations as well as the business or operations of our manufacturers, CROs and other\nthird parties with whom we conduct business or otherwise engage, including the FDA and other regulatory authorities,\nand has impacted and could continue to impact the global economy, which may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operations and financial position.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and measures taken in response to the pandemic, could cause significant disruption in\nour business and operations and could cause significant disruption in the business and operations of our manufacturers,\nCROs upon whom we rely to conduct our clinical trials, clinical trial sites, and other third parties with whom we conduct\nbusiness or otherwise engage, including the FDA and other regulatory authorities.\nThe federal and state governments in the United States and the governments of other countries around the globe\nimplemented various measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including significant restrictions on businesses as\nwell as travel into and within the countries in which our manufacturers produce our product candidates or where we\nconduct our clinical trials or otherwise conduct business or engage with other third parties. While many such restrictive\nmeasures have since been loosened or repealed following the widespread distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, the loosening\nof such restrictions have been and may in the future be subject to abrupt reversal in the presence of new variants of\nCOVID-19, which may lengthen or exacerbate the pandemic’s effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.

We currently require all employees entering our workplaces\nin the United States to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, subject to a reasonable accommodation process. We have\nalso established additional safety measures at our facilities, including providing personal protective equipment and\nrecommending employees stay home while feeling unwell. These safety measures do not, however, guarantee that COVID-\n19 will not spread amongst our employees through workplace contact, and the sickness of employees may have a\nsignificant adverse impact on our business. We continue to monitor the developments, restrictions and requirements in\njurisdictions where we have offices, and plan to update the protocols for our offices as applicable.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also have a significant adverse impact on our preclinical studies and clinical trials,\nwhich could significantly impede, delay, limit or prevent the clinical development of our product candidates and ultimately\nlead to the delay or denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates, which would materially adversely affect our\nbusiness and operations, including our ability to generate revenue. See “Risk Factors — Risks related to product\ndevelopment — The COVID-19 pandemic, and measures taken in response to the pandemic, could have an adverse impact\non our current or planned preclinical studies and clinical trials, which could be significant.”\nFurther, the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our ability to successfully commercialize ARCALYST and our\ncurrent and future product candidates, if approved. The re-implementation of certain measures, including business and\ntravel restrictions and social distancing to halt the spread of the pandemic, could have an impact on businesses, healthcare\nsystems, regulatory authorities and other organizations and conferences. These measures could result in limitations on\ncertain aspects of our commercialization strategy, including access to prescriber offices, and result in lower than anticipated\nfuture revenue.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, existing and any new third party CMOs or suppliers may be unable to\nproduce or supply our current or future products and product candidates or obtain certain raw or fill-finish materials,\nincluding vials and stoppers, needed to produce or supply such products and product candidates. Further, our products and\nproduct candidates require certain crucial ancillary products, including sterile water and needles, whose availability has\nbeen and may in the future be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Such parties may also experience delays, restrictions\nor limitations in the production, delivery or release of our products and product candidates, the raw or fill-finish materials\nneeded to produce them and important ancillary products, including due to disruptions at their respective facilities, staffing\nshortages, production slowdowns, stoppages or reprioritizations, including as a result of reprioritization by third parties or\nthe U.S. government for any products or potential products related to the treatment or prevention of COVID-19, or\ninterruptions in global shipping.

These disruptions could adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital when needed or on\nacceptable terms, if at all.\nThe United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions,\nfinancial markets and our business.\nSince January 1, 2021, however, the United Kingdom (the “UK”) has operated under a distinct regulatory regime\nto the EU. EU pharmaceutical laws only apply in respect of the UK to Northern Ireland (as set out in the Protocol on\nIreland/Northern Ireland). EU laws which have been transposed into UK law through secondary legislation continue to be\napplicable as “retained EU law”. However, under the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill 2022, which is\ncurrently before the UK parliament, any retained EU law not expressly preserved and “assimilated” into domestic law or\nextended by ministerial regulations (to no later than June 23, 2026) will automatically expire and be revoked by December\n31, 2023. While the UK has indicated a general intention that new laws regarding the development, manufacture and\ncommercialization of medicinal products in the UK will align closely with EU law, there are limited detailed proposals for\nfuture regulation of medicinal products. The trade and cooperation agreement (“TCA”), which put in place a framework for\na future EU-UK relationship, includes specific provisions concerning medicinal products, which include the mutual\nrecognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued (such\nmutual recognition can be rejected by either party in certain circumstances), but does not foresee wholesale mutual\nrecognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. For example, it remains unclear as to what extent the UK will adopt\nlegislation aligned with, or similar to, the EU CTR which became applicable on January 31, 2022 and which significantly\nreforms the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU. On January 17, 2022, the Medicines\nand Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the “MHRA”) launched an eight-week consultation on reframing the UK\nlegislation for clinical trials. The consultation closed on March 14, 2022 and aims to streamline clinical trials approvals,\nenable innovation, enhance clinical trials transparency, enable greater risk proportionality, and promote patient and public\ninvolvement in clinical trials. The outcome of the consultation has not been published but be closely watched and will\ndetermine whether the UK chooses to align with the regulation or diverge from it to maintain regulatory flexibility. A\ndecision by the UK not to closely align its regulations with the new approach that will be adopted in the EU may have an\neffect on the cost of conducting clinical trials in the UK as opposed to other countries.\nTherefore, there remains political and economic uncertainty regarding to what extent the regulation of medicinal\nproducts will differ between the UK and the EU in the future. Any divergences will increase the cost and complexity of\nrunning our business, including with respect to the conduct of clinical trials. Brexit also materially impacted the regulatory\nregime with respect to the approval of our product candidates. Great Britain is no longer covered by the EU’s procedures\nfor the grant of marketing authorizations (Northern Ireland is covered by the centralized authorization procedure and can\nbe covered under the decentralized or mutual recognition procedures). As of January 1, 2021, all existing centralized\nmarketing authorizations were automatically converted into UK marketing authorizations effective in Great Britain and\nissued with a United Kingdom marketing authorization number on January 1, 2021 (unless marketing authorization holders\nopted out of this scheme). A separate marketing authorization is now required to market new drugs in Great Britain. It is\ncurrently unclear whether the regulator in the UK, the MHRA, is sufficiently prepared to handle the increased volume of\nmarketing authorization applications that it is likely to receive. The UK’s withdrawal from the EU and the associated\nuncertainty has had and may continue to have a significant adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability\nof global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market\nparticipants to operate in certain financial markets. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be\nespecially subject to increased market volatility. The UK has also experienced significant political instability in 2022. Any\nof these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects.\nFurther, the UK’s withdrawal from the EU resulted in the relocation of the EMA from the UK to the Netherlands.\nThis relocation has caused, and may continue to cause, disruption in the administrative and medical scientific links\nbetween the EMA and the MHRA, including delays in granting clinical trial authorization or marketing authorization,\ndisruption of importation and export of active substance and other components of new drug formulations, and disruption of\nthe supply chain for clinical trial product and final authorized formulations.

Additionally, political instability in the EU as a result of Brexit may result in a material negative\neffect on credit markets and foreign direct investments in the EU and UK.\nThese developments, or the perception that any related developments could occur, have had and may continue to\nhave a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the financial markets, and may significantly reduce\nglobal market liquidity, restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets or restrict our\naccess to capital.

Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (the “MDRP”), as a condition of federal\nfunds being made available for our covered outpatient drugs under Medicaid and certain drugs or biologicals under\nMedicare Part B, we pay a rebate to state Medicaid programs for each unit of our covered outpatient drugs dispensed to a\nMedicaid beneficiary and paid for by the state Medicaid program. Medicaid rebates are based on pricing data that we report\non a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS, the federal agency that administers the MDRP and Medicare programs. For the\nMDRP, these data include the Average Manufacturer Price (“AMP”) for each drug and, in the case of innovator products,\nbest price. If we become aware that our MDRP price reporting submission for a prior period was incorrect or has changed\nas a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we must resubmit the corrected data for up to three years after those data\noriginally were due. If we fail to provide information timely or are found to have knowingly submitted false information to\nthe government, we may be subject to civil monetary penalties and other sanctions, including termination from the MDRP,\nin which case payment would not be available for our covered outpatient drugs under Medicaid or, if applicable, Medicare\nPart B.\nFederal law requires that any company that participates in the MDRP also participate in the 340B program in\norder for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B\nprogram is administered by HRSA and requires us, as a participating manufacturer, to agree to charge statutorily defined\ncovered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for our covered drugs used in an outpatient setting. These 340B\ncovered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the\nPublic Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. A drug that is\ndesignated for a rare disease or condition by the Secretary of Health and Human Services is not subject to the 340B ceiling\nprice requirement with regard to the following types of covered entities: rural referral centers, sole community hospitals,\ncritical access hospitals, and free-standing cancer hospitals. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula,\nwhich is based on the AMP and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the MDRP. In general,\nproducts subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price calculation and\ndiscount requirement. We must report 340B ceiling prices to HRSA on a quarterly basis, and HRSA publishes them to\n340B covered entities. HRSA has finalized regulations regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the\nimposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities for\n340B-eligible drugs. HRSA has also finalized an administrative dispute resolution process through which 340B covered\nentities may pursue claims against participating manufacturers for overcharges, and through which manufacturers may\npursue claims against 340B covered entities for engaging in unlawful diversion or duplicate discounting of 340B drugs."

Under the\nVA/FSS program, we must report the Non-FAMP for our covered drugs to the VA and charge certain federal agencies no\nmore than the Federal Ceiling Price, which is calculated based on Non-FAMP using a statutory formula. These four\nagencies are the VA, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Public Health Service (including\nthe Indian Health Service). We must also pay rebates on products purchased by military personnel and dependents through\nthe TRICARE retail pharmacy program. If we fail to provide timely information or are found to have knowingly submitted\nfalse information, we may be subject to civil monetary penalties.\nIndividual states continue to consider and have enacted legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs,\nincluding the cost of prescription drugs and combination products. A number of states have either implemented or are\nconsidering implementation of drug price transparency legislation that may prevent or limit our ability to take price\nincreases at certain rates or frequencies. Requirements under such laws include advance notice of planned price increases,\nreporting price increase amounts and factors considered in taking such increases, wholesale acquisition cost information\ndisclosure to prescribers, purchasers, and state agencies, and new product notice and reporting. Such legislation could limit\nthe price or payment for certain drugs, and states may impose civil monetary penalties or pursue other enforcement\nmechanisms against manufacturers who fail to comply with drug price transparency requirements. If we are found to have\nviolated state law requirements, we may become subject to penalties or other enforcement mechanisms, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary across products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to\ninterpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts, which can change and evolve over time. Such\npricing calculations and reporting, along with any necessary restatements and recalculations, could increase our costs for\ncomplying with the laws and regulations governing the MDRP and other governmental programs, and under the MDRP\ncould result in an overage or undercharge in Medicaid rebate liability for past quarters. Price recalculations under the\nMDRP also may affect the ceiling price at which we are required to offer products under the 340B program. Civil monetary\npenalties can be applied if we are found to have knowingly submitted any false price or product information to the\ngovernment, if we fail to submit the required price data on a timely basis, or if we are found to have charged 340B covered\nentities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price. CMS could also terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, in\nwhich case federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B, if applicable, for our covered\noutpatient drugs. Pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”), the AMP figures we report will also be used\nto compute rebates under Medicare Part D triggered by price increases that outpace inflation. We cannot assure you that\nour submissions will not be found to be incomplete or incorrect.\nEnacted and future healthcare legislation may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn the United States, EU and other jurisdictions, there have been and we expect there will continue to be a number\nof legislative and regulatory initiatives and proposed changes to the healthcare system that could affect our operations. For\nexample, in the United States, the ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and\nprivate insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, subjected\nbiologic products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, introduced a new methodology by which rebates\nowed by manufacturers under the MDRP are calculated for drugs and biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled,\nimplanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the MDRP, extended\nmanufacturer Medicaid rebate obligations to utilization by individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations,\nestablished annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and biologics, and established a\nnew Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the\nACA. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several\nstates without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. In addition, other legislative changes have been\nproposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other\nthings, led to reductions of Medicare payments to providers, which will remain in effect through 2032 unless additional\nCongressional action is taken."

Specifically, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and\nenacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug and biologic pricing,\nreduce the cost of prescription drugs and biologics under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and\nmanufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs and biologics. For\nexample, in May 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for\nPart B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in\nprice negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates\nunder Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and\nreplaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits\nthe Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through\nguidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will\nbe effectuated, and while the impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry cannot yet be fully\ndetermined, it is likely to be significant. We expect that additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted\nin the future, any of which could limit the amounts that the U.S. federal government will pay for healthcare products and\nservices, which could result in reduced demand for our products and product candidates, if approved, or additional pricing\npressures.\nIndividual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and\nimplementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient\nreimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, marketing cost disclosure and other\ntransparency measures, and, in some cases, measures designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk\npurchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm\nour business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and\nindividual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which\nsuppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand\nfor our products and product candidates, if approved, or put pressure on our product pricing.\nIn the EU, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably\ncommercialize our product candidates, if approved. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment\nmeasures, legislative developments at the EU or member state level may result in significant additional requirements or\nobstacles that may increase our operating costs. The delivery of healthcare in the EU, including the establishment and\noperation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter for national,\nrather than EU, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches\nto the delivery of health care and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. In general, however, the\nhealthcare budgetary constraints in most EU member states have resulted in restrictions on the pricing and reimbursement\nof medicines by relevant health service providers. Coupled with ever-increasing EU and national regulatory burdens on\nthose wishing to develop and market products, this could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates,\nrestrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved.\nIn markets outside of the United States and the EU, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary\nsignificantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation\nor administrative action, either in the United States, the EU or elsewhere. For example, such actions may result in changes\nto governmental policies and regulations that affect our operations and business, including our clinical trials, regulatory\napproval, pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement. If we or any third party we may engage are slow or unable to adapt to\nchanges in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or such third party are not able\nto maintain regulatory compliance, our product candidates may lose any regulatory approval that may have been obtained\nwhich may have a material impact on our business and operations."

Attacks upon information technology systems are\nincreasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated\nand organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nwe may face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who\nare working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Employees\nmay also fail to comply with our cybersecurity protocols, exposing us to vulnerabilities despite our safeguards.\nFurthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and\noften are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement\nadequate preventative measures. In addition, a breach at a CMO, CRO, contractor, consultant, service provider or other\nthird party with which we engage may increase our exposure by allowing criminals to exploit our relationship with such\npersons. Such security breaches may remain undetected for an extended period. Even if identified, we may be unable to\nadequately investigate or remediate incidents or breaches due to attackers increasingly using tools and techniques that are\ndesigned to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence.\nWe and certain of our service providers are from time to time subject to cyberattacks and security incidents. While\nwe do not believe that we have experienced any significant system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an\nevent were to occur and cause interruptions in our business and operations or those of our third party CMOs, CROs and\nother contractors, consultants and service providers as well as employees that are working outside of our facilities, the costs\nassociated with the investigation, remediation and potential notification of a breach to counter-parties and data subjects\ncould be material. A breach could result in a material disruption of our or such third-party’s business or operations and our\ndevelopment programs of our product candidates’ or loss of other assets, including funds. For example, the loss of clinical\ntrial data for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our\ncosts to recover or reproduce the data.

This evolution may affect our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer use\nand share personal information, necessitate the acceptance of more onerous obligations in our contracts, result in liability\nor impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to\nincrease in the future. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulations,\nour internal policies and procedures or our contracts governing our processing of personal information could result in\nnegative publicity, government investigations and enforcement actions, claims by third parties and damage to our\nreputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, and financial condition.\nFor example, most healthcare providers, including research institutions from which we obtain patient health\ninformation, are subject to privacy and security regulations promulgated under HIPAA, as amended. We do not believe that\nwe are currently acting as a covered entity or business associate under HIPAA and thus are not subject to its requirements\nor penalties. However, any person may be prosecuted under HIPAA’s criminal provisions either directly or under aiding-\nand-abetting or conspiracy principles. Consequently, depending on the facts and circumstances, we could face substantial\ncriminal penalties if we knowingly receive individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered healthcare\nprovider or research institution that has not satisfied HIPAA’s requirements for disclosure of individually identifiable health\ninformation. In addition, we may maintain sensitive personally identifiable information, including health information, that\nwe receive throughout the clinical trial process, in the course of our research collaborations, directly from individuals (or\ntheir healthcare providers) who enroll in our patient support program and directly from individuals who consent to be\nincluded in our marketing database. As such, we may be subject to state laws requiring notification of affected individuals\nand state regulatory authorities in the event of a breach of personal information, which is a broader class of information\nthan the health information protected by HIPAA.\nIn addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some\nof which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have\nthe same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in\nthe imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Certain states have also adopted\ncomparable privacy and security laws and regulations governing the privacy, processing and protection of personal\ninformation. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) on June 28, 2018, which\nwent into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access, correct, and delete\ntheir personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their\npersonal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for\ndata breaches that has increased the likelihood of, and the risks associated with data breach litigation. Further, the\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) generally went into effect on January 1, 2023 and significantly amends the\nCCPA. It imposes additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights\nprocesses, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive\ndata. It also creates a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in\nincreased privacy and information security enforcement. Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah have also enacted\nsimilar legislation to California increasing complexity of compliance with privacy laws. Additional compliance investment\nand potential business process changes may also be required.\nFurthermore, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and many state Attorneys General continue to enforce\nfederal and state consumer protection laws against companies for online collection, use, dissemination and security\npractices that appear to be unfair or deceptive. For example, according to the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep\nconsumers’ personal information secure can constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of\nSection 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable\nand appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its\nbusiness, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities.\nOur clinical trial programs outside the United States may implicate international data protection laws, including\nthe GDPR, and legislation of EU member states and EEA countries implementing it.

Among other requirements, the GDPR\nregulates transfers of personal data subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate\nprotection to such personal data, including the United States, and the efficacy and longevity of current transfer mechanisms\nbetween the EU and the United States remains uncertain. For example, in 2016, the EU and United States agreed to a\ntransfer framework for data transferred from the EU to the United States called the Privacy Shield, but in July 2020 the\nCourt of Justice of the EU (the “CJEU”) limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the EEA to\nthe United States by invalidating the Privacy Shield for purposes of international transfers and imposing further restrictions\non use of the standard contractual clauses (“SCCs”). In March 2022, the EU and United States announced a new regulatory\nregime intended to replace the invalidated regulations; however, this new EU-US Data Privacy Framework has not been\nimplemented beyond an executive order signed by President Biden on October 7, 2022 on Enhancing Safeguards for\nUnited States Signals Intelligence Activities. European court and regulatory decisions subsequent to the CJEU decision of\nJuly 2020 have taken a restrictive approach to international data transfers. As supervisory authorities issue further guidance\non personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the SCCs cannot be used, and/or start taking\nenforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, and/or if we are\notherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate or intend to\noperate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our\nrelevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results.\nFurther, following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU on January 31, 2020, and the expiration of the transition\nperiod, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and also the UK GDPR, which, together with\nthe amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under\nthe GDPR, e.g., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. As we continue to expand\ninto other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we\nconduct business.\nThe EU has also proposed a Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the “ePrivacy Regulation”),\nwhich, if adopted, would impose new obligations on the use of personal data in the context of electronic communications,\nparticularly with respect to online tracking technologies and direct marketing. Additionally, the EU adopted the EU\nClinical Trials Regulation, which came into effect on January 31, 2022. This regulation imposes new obligations on the use\nof data generated from clinical trials and enables European patients to have the opportunity to access information about\nclinical trials. Failure or perceived failure to comply with the GDPR, the UK GDPR, the ePrivacy Regulation, the EU\nClinical Trials Regulations, and other countries’ privacy or data security-related laws, rules or regulations could result in\nsignificant regulatory penalties and fines, affect our compliance with contracts entered into with our partners and\ncollaborators, and could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial condition.\nFurthermore, certain health privacy laws, data breach notification laws, consumer protection laws and genetic\ntesting laws may apply directly to our operations or those of our collaborators and may impose restrictions on our\ncollection, use and dissemination of individuals’ health information. Moreover, patients about whom we or our\ncollaborators obtain health information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may have statutory or\ncontractual rights that limit our ability to use and disclose the information. We may be required to expend significant\ncapital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws. Claims that we\nhave violated individuals’ privacy rights or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be\nexpensive and time consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.\nAlthough we work to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, our contractual obligations and\nother legal obligations, these requirements are evolving and may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent\nmanner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another or other legal obligations with which we must\ncomply.

The failure to recruit, or the loss of the services of our executive officers, senior management\nor other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives,\nincluding with respect to our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, infrastructure and organization to\ncommercialize products for which we have obtained marketing approval and maintain proper regulatory oversight\nfunctions, any of which would seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore,\nreplacing executive officers, senior management and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of\ntime because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to\nsuccessfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products. Changes in our senior management may be\ndisruptive to our business, and, if we are unable to manage an orderly transition of responsibilities, our business may be\nadversely affected. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or\nmotivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and\nbiotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific, sales,\nmarketing and clinical personnel from other pharmaceutical companies, universities and research institutions, as applicable.\nFailure to succeed in clinical trials may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified scientific and clinical\npersonnel. If we are not able to continue to attract and retain, on acceptable terms, the qualified personnel necessary for the\ncontinued development of our business, we may not be able to sustain our operations or growth.\nEffective succession planning is also important to our long-term success and ability to operate as a generational\ncompany. As we encounter employee turnover, including turnover of key personnel, we may be unable to timely train or\nlocate replacement personnel in a way that delays our strategic planning and clinical and commercial execution.\nOur employees, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and other third-party service providers may engage in\nmisconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and\ninsider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and other third-party\nservice providers may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include\nintentional, reckless or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violate the regulations of the\nFDA and other regulatory authorities, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate\ninformation to such authorities; healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad; or laws\nthat require the reporting of financial information or data accurately.\nIn particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws\nand regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and\nregulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, including off-label\npromotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these\nlaws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or creating fraudulent data in our\npreclinical studies or clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation.\nIt is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties. The precautions\nwe take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in\nprotecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these\nlaws or regulations. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even\nif none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting\nour rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and\nadministrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other\nfederal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and\ncurtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of\noperations."

If we are not effective in addressing ESG matters affecting our\nbusiness, or setting and meeting relevant ESG goals, our reputation and financial results may suffer. In addition, even if we\nare effective at addressing such concerns, we may experience increased costs as a result of executing upon our ESG goals\nthat may not be offset by any benefit to our reputation, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial\ncondition.\nIn addition, this emphasis on ESG matters has resulted in the adoption of new laws and regulations, including new\nreporting requirements, and may result in the adoption of additional laws and regulations in the future. New reporting\nrequirements may be particularly difficult or expensive to comply with and, if we fail to comply, we may be required to\nissue financial restatements, suffer harm to our reputation or otherwise have our business be adversely impacted. Such ESG\nmatters may also impact our suppliers or patients, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results\nof operations.\nIn addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have\ndeveloped ratings processes for evaluating companies on ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform\ntheir investment or voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings could lead to negative investor sentiment toward us and/or\nour industry, which could have a negative impact on our access to and costs of capital. To the extent ESG matters\nnegatively impact our reputation, we may be affected in a number of ways, including an inability to recruit and retain\npersonnel and a decrease in the trading price of our Class A common shares.\nClimate change, and related regulation, may result in increased costs or otherwise negatively impact our operations and\nharm our business.\nThe impacts of climate change on the global economy and our industry are rapidly evolving. Physical impacts of\nclimate change (including but not limited to floods, droughts, more frequent and/or intense storms and wildfires), could\nnegatively impact our business and operations, as well as the business and operations of our third-party CMOs and CROs\nupon whom we rely. Such events may result in damage or loss of our products and product candidates during their\nmanufacture and shipment, cause delays in clinical development due to trial site disasters or result in losses of critical data,\nany of which may adversely impact our operations. An evolving climate may also result in uncertain and potentially\nonerous regulatory requirements as agencies and governmental authorities adjust, such as new or changed emissions\nreporting and auditing requirements. Failure to comply with such requirements in a timely manner may adversely affect our\nreputation, business, or financial performance.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Shares\nThe concentration of ownership of our Class B common shares, which are held primarily by our executive officers and\ncertain other members of our senior management, and the conversion rights of the holders of our Class A1 common\nshares, which shares are held primarily by entities affiliated with certain of our directors, and Class B1 common shares,\nall of which shares are held by entities affiliated with certain of our directors, means that such persons are, and such\nentities may in the future be, able to influence certain matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, which may\nhave an adverse effect on the price of our Class A common shares and may result in our Class A common shares being\nundervalued.\nEach Class A common share is entitled to one vote per Class A common share and each Class B common share is\nentitled to ten votes per Class B common share.

As a result of the multi-class voting structure of our common shares, our\nexecutive officers and certain other members of our senior management collectively control a substantial amount of the\nvoting power of our common shares and therefore are able to control the outcome of certain matters submitted to our\nshareholders for approval. As of December 31, 2022, the holders of Class A common shares accounted for approximately\n66% of our aggregate voting power and the holders of Class B common shares accounted for approximately 34% of our\naggregate voting power. Our executive officers and certain other members of our senior management hold Class A\ncommon shares and Class B common shares representing approximately 30% of our aggregate voting power as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and may have the ability to influence the outcome of certain matters submitted to our shareholders for\napproval.\nHowever, this percentage may change depending on any conversion of our Class B common shares, Class A1\ncommon shares or Class B1 common shares. Each holder of our Class B common shares has the ability to convert any\nportion of its Class B common shares into Class B1 common shares or Class A common shares at any time with advance\nnotice to us. Each holder of our Class B1 common shares has the ability to convert any portion of its Class B1 common\nshares into Class A common shares or Class B common shares at any time with advance notice to us, and each holder of\nour Class A1 common shares has the ability to convert any portion of its Class A1 common shares into Class A common\nshares at any time with advance notice to us. Our Class A1 common shares and Class B1 common shares cannot be\nconverted if, immediately prior to or following such conversion, the holder and its affiliates beneficially own, or would\nbeneficially own, more than 4.99% of our issued and outstanding Class A common shares unless such holder provides us\nwith 61-days’ prior notice that it intends to increase, decrease or waive such threshold upon conversion. For example, as of\nDecember 31, 2022, entities affiliated with certain members of our directors could convert their Class A1 common shares\nand Class B1 common shares upon 61-days’ prior written notice into Class A common shares and Class B common shares,\nrespectively, which in the aggregate would result in such entities holding approximately 78% of our aggregate voting\npower and having the ability to control the outcome of certain matters submitted to our shareholders for approval. Due to\nthese conversion rights, holders of our Class A1 common shares and our Class B1 common shares could, at any time with\nappropriate advance notice to us, significantly increase their voting control of us, which could result in their ability to\nsignificantly influence or control matters submitted to our shareholders for approval and significantly decrease the voting\npower of our currently outstanding Class A common shares.\nThese conversion rights as well as concentrated control that limit certain shareholders’ ability to influence\ncorporate matters may have an adverse effect on the price of our Class A common shares. Holders of our Class B common\nshares collectively control our management and affairs and are able to influence or control the outcome of certain matters\nsubmitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of directors. Due to the conversion rights of the holders\nof our Class A1 and B1 common shares, entities affiliated with certain of our directors could significantly increase their\nvoting control of us. This concentration of control might adversely affect certain corporate actions that some of our\nshareholders may view as beneficial, for example, by:\n●\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us;\n●\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n●\ndiscouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nThe price of our Class A common shares is likely to continue to be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could\nresult in substantial losses for holders of our Class A common shares.\nOur share price is likely to continue to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for\nbiopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility, including as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic, inflation and government responses to inflation, and global economic conditions, that has often been unrelated\nto the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, our shareholders may not be able to sell\ntheir Class A common shares at or above the price they paid for their shares.

As a result, the rights of holders of our Class A common shares will be\ngoverned by Bermuda law and our memorandum of association and amended and restated bye-laws. The rights of\nshareholders under Bermuda law may differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other\njurisdictions.

It is doubtful whether courts in Bermuda will enforce\njudgments obtained in other jurisdictions, including the United States, against us or our directors or officers under the\nsecurities laws of those jurisdictions or entertain actions in Bermuda against us or our directors or officers under the\nsecurities laws of other jurisdictions.\nOur amended and restated bye-laws designate the Supreme Court of Bermuda as the choice of jurisdiction for disputes\nthat arise concerning the Bermuda Companies Act 1981, as amended (the “Companies Act”), or out of or in connection\nwith our amended and restated bye-laws, which could limit our shareholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for\ndisputes with us or our directors or officers.\nOur amended and restated bye-laws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative\njurisdiction, any dispute that arises concerning the Companies Act, or out of or in connection with our amended and\nrestated bye-laws, including any question regarding the existence and scope of any bye-law or whether there has been a\nbreach of the Companies Act or the amended and restated bye-laws by any of our officers or directors (whether or not such\na claim is brought in the name of a shareholder or in the name of our company) shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the\nSupreme Court of Bermuda.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our shares shall be deemed to have\nnotice of and consented to this provision. This choice of jurisdiction provision may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a\nclaim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage lawsuits\nagainst us and our directors and officers. If a court were to find either choice of jurisdiction provision in our amended and\nrestated bye-laws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving\nthe dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.\nBermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to our shareholders.\nWe are organized under the laws of Bermuda. As a result, our corporate affairs are governed by the Companies\nAct, which differs in some material respects from laws typically applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders,\nincluding the provisions relating to interested directors, amalgamations, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder\nlawsuits and indemnification of directors. Generally, the duties of directors and officers of a Bermuda company are owed to\nthe company only. Shareholders of Bermuda companies typically do not have rights to act against directors or officers of\nthe company and may only do so in limited circumstances. Shareholder class actions are not available under Bermuda law.\nThe circumstances in which shareholder derivative actions may be available under Bermuda law are substantially more\nproscribed and less clear than they would be to shareholders of U.S. corporations. The Bermuda courts, however, would\nordinarily be expected to permit a shareholder to commence an action in the name of a company to remedy a wrong to the\ncompany where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of the company or illegal, or would\nresult in the violation of the company’s memorandum of association or bye-laws. Furthermore, consideration would be\ngiven by a Bermuda court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or, for instance,\nwhere an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of the company’s shareholders than those who actually approved\nit."

Therefore, our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than\nwould shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction within the United States.\nThere are regulatory limitations on the ownership and transfer of our common shares.\nCommon shares may be offered or sold in Bermuda only in compliance with the provisions of the Companies Act\nand the Bermuda Investment Business Act 2003, as amended, which regulates the sale of securities in Bermuda. In\naddition, the Bermuda Monetary Authority must approve all issues and transfers of shares of a Bermuda exempted\ncompany. However, the Bermuda Monetary Authority has, pursuant to its statement of June 1, 2005, given its general\npermission under the Exchange Control Act 1972 and related regulations for the issue and free transfer of our common\nshares to and among persons who are non-residents of Bermuda for exchange control purposes as long as the shares are\nlisted on an appointed shares exchange, which includes Nasdaq. This general permission would cease to apply if we were\nto cease to be listed on Nasdaq.\nWe may become subject to unanticipated tax liabilities.\nAlthough we are incorporated under the laws of Bermuda, we may become subject to income, withholding or\nother taxes in certain other jurisdictions by reason of our activities and operations, including the movement of assets to and\nbetween one or more foreign subsidiaries. It is also possible that taxing authorities in any such jurisdictions could assert\nthat we are subject to greater taxation than we currently anticipate. Any such non-Bermudian tax liability could materially\nadversely affect our results of operations.\nTaxing authorities could reallocate our taxable income among our subsidiaries, which could increase our overall tax\nliability.\nWe are incorporated under the laws of Bermuda and currently have subsidiaries in the United States, the United\nKingdom, Germany, Switzerland and France. If we succeed in growing our business, we expect to conduct increased\noperations through our subsidiaries in various tax jurisdictions subject to transfer pricing arrangements between us and\nsuch subsidiaries. If two or more affiliated companies are located in different countries, the tax laws or regulations of each\ncountry generally will require that transfer prices be the same as those between unrelated companies dealing at arms’\nlength and that appropriate documentation is maintained to support the transfer prices. While we believe that we operate in\ncompliance with applicable transfer pricing laws and intend to continue to do so, our transfer pricing procedures are not\nbinding on applicable tax authorities.\nIf tax authorities in any of these countries were to successfully challenge our transfer prices as not reflecting arms’\nlength transactions, they could require us to adjust our transfer prices and thereby reallocate our income to reflect these\nrevised transfer prices, which could result in a higher tax liability to us. In addition, if the country from which the income is\nreallocated does not agree with the reallocation, both countries could tax the same income, resulting in double taxation. If\ntax authorities were to allocate income to a higher tax jurisdiction, subject our income to double taxation or assess interest\nand penalties, it would increase our consolidated tax liability, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results\nof operations and cash flows."

Such\nchanges may become more likely as a result of recent economic trends in the jurisdictions in which we operate, particularly\nif such trends continue. If such a situation were to arise, it could adversely impact our tax position and our effective tax\nrate. For example, the UK government announced significant tax cuts, only to see such proposed tax cuts swiftly reversed\nfollowing a change in Prime Minister. There remains significant uncertainty as to any other tax policies and strategies\nwhich this or any future administration may adopt.\nFailure to manage the risks associated with such changes, or misinterpretation of the laws providing such changes,\ncould result in costly audits, interest, penalties, and reputational damage, which could adversely affect our business, results\nof operations and our financial condition. Our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance\nmay be material. A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including:\n●\nthe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n●\nthe resolution of issues arising from any future tax audits with various tax authorities;\n●\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n●\nchanges to and increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including transaction costs and\nimpairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;\n●\nchanges in the taxation of share-based compensation;\n●\nchanges in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws, and changes in generally accepted accounting\nprinciples; and\n●\nchallenges to the transfer pricing policies related to our structure.\nPursuant to the Bermuda Economic Substance Act 2018 (as amended) and related Economic Substance\nRegulations (collectively, “ES Laws”), certain entities in Bermuda engaged in “relevant activities” are required to maintain\nappropriate physical presence in Bermuda and to satisfy economic substance requirements. The list of “relevant activities”\nincludes carrying on as a business in any one or more of the following categories: banking, insurance, fund management,\nfinancing and leasing, headquarters, shipping, distribution and service center, intellectual property and holding entities.\nUnder the ES Laws, any relevant entity carrying on a relevant activity must satisfy economic substance requirements\nlocally or face financial penalties, restriction or regulation of its business activities or may be struck off as a registered\nentity from the Bermuda Register of Companies. Because we are not engaged in any “relevant activities”, we believe that\nwe are not obliged to meet the economic substance requirements. We will continue to monitor our status with respect to the\nES Laws and whether further action may be required in the future by the Company to comply with the ES Laws.\nGovernmental agencies may enact significant changes to the taxation of business entities including, among others,\nan increase in the corporate income tax rate, the imposition of minimum taxes or surtaxes on certain types of income,\nsignificant changes to the taxation of income derived from international operations, and an addition of further limitations\non the deductibility of business interest. While certain draft legislation has been publicly released, the likelihood of these\nchanges being enacted or implemented is unclear. We are unable to predict whether such changes will occur. If such\nchanges are enacted or implemented, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact on our business and therefore there can\nbe no assurance our business will not be adversely affected."

We plan to perform an analysis to determine whether the\nCompany or its subsidiaries are expected to be treated as PFICs for the taxable year ending December 31, 2022, and do not\nbelieve that the Company or its subsidiaries will be treated as a PFIC for the taxable year ending December 31, 2022.\nHowever, there can be no guarantee that the Company, or its subsidiaries, will not be treated as a PFIC for any taxable\nperiod. A non-U.S. company will generally be considered as a PFIC for any taxable year if (i) at least 75% of its gross\nincome is passive (including interest income), or (ii) at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the\nquarterly values of the assets during a taxable year) is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of\npassive income. If we, or our subsidiaries, are classified as a PFIC in any year with respect to which a U.S. Holder (as\ndefined below) owns our Class A common shares, we will continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect to such U.S.\nHolder in all succeeding years during which the U.S. Holder owns the Class A common shares, regardless of whether we\ncontinue to meet the PFIC test described above, unless we cease to be a PFIC and the U.S. Holder made a “qualified\nelecting fund” election or “mark-to-market” election for (a) the first taxable year the U.S. Holder was treated as owning our\nshares while we were a PFIC or (b) for the taxable year in which we were a PFIC and the U.S. Holder made a “deemed\nsale” election or was qualified to and made a “deemed dividend” election.

Even if we were not classified as a controlled foreign corporation, certain of\nour non-U.S. subsidiaries could be treated as controlled foreign corporations because our group includes one or more U.S.\nsubsidiaries. If a U.S. Holder is treated as owning (directly, indirectly or constructively) at least 10% of the value or voting\npower of our shares, such U.S. Holder may be treated as a “United States shareholder” (as such term is defined in the\nCode) with respect to us (if we are classified as a controlled foreign corporation) and each controlled foreign corporation in\nour group (if any). A United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation may be required to annually report and\ninclude in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of “Subpart F income,” “global intangible low-taxed income,” or\nGILTI, and investments in U.S. property by such controlled foreign corporation,"

Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in\nthis Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking\nstatements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those\nfactors set forth in the risks identified in Part I-Item 1A “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report and our other filings\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), our actual results could differ materially from the results,\nperformance or achievements expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, acquiring, developing and commercializing\ntherapeutic medicines for patients suffering from debilitating diseases with significant unmet medical need. Our portfolio\nof immune-modulating assets, ARCALYST® (rilonacept), KPL-404 and mavrilimumab, are based on strong biologic\nrationale or validated mechanisms, target a spectrum of underserved cardiovascular and autoimmune conditions, and offer\nthe potential for differentiation.\nARCALYST is an interleukin-1α and interleukin-1β cytokine trap. In 2017, we licensed ARCALYST from\nRegeneron, who discovered and initially developed the drug. Our exclusive license to ARCALYST from Regeneron\nincludes worldwide rights, excluding the Middle East and North Africa, for all applications other than those in oncology\nand local administration to the eye or ear. We received FDA approval of ARCALYST for the treatment of recurrent\npericarditis and reduction in risk of recurrence in adults and children 12 years and older in March 2021. Recurrent\npericarditis is a painful inflammatory cardiovascular disease with an estimated U.S. prevalent population of approximately\n40,000 patients seeking and receiving medical treatment. ARCALYST is commercially available across the United States\nthrough a network of distributors. ARCALYST is also approved in the United States for the treatment of CAPS,\nspecifically Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome and Muckle-Wells Syndrome in adults and children 12 years and\nolder, and the maintenance of remission in DIRA in adults and children weighing 10 kg or more. We are responsible for\nsales and distribution of ARCALYST in all approved indications in the United States, and evenly split profits on sales as\nwell as third-party proceeds with Regeneron. In February 2022, we granted Huadong exclusive rights to develop and\ncommercialize ARCALYST in the Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan.\nKPL-404 is an investigational monoclonal antibody inhibitor of CD40-CD154 interaction. In 2019, we acquired\nall of the outstanding securities of Primatope, the company that owned or controlled the intellectual property related to\nKPL-404. In connection with our acquisition of Primatope, we acquired an exclusive world-wide license to KPL-404 from\nBIDMC. The CD40-CD154 interaction is a key T-cell co-stimulatory signal critical for B-cell maturation, immunoglobulin\nclass switching and Type 1 immune response. We believe disrupting the CD40-CD154 interaction is an attractive approach\nto address multiple autoimmune disease pathologies such as RA, Sjogren’s syndrome, Graves’ disease and systemic lupus\nerythematosus. In May 2021, we announced positive final data from our Phase 1 single-ascending-dose clinical trial of\nKPL-404 in healthy volunteers, which evaluated safety and pharmacokinetics, as well as receptor occupancy and T-cell\ndependent antibody response. In December 2021, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of KPL-404 in RA, which is designed\nto evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy with subcutaneous administration. In January 2023, we announced that\nwe had completed enrollment of the second and final cohort of the multiple ascending dose portion of such trial. Following\ncompletion of this portion of the trial, the proof-of-concept portion will begin. We expect data from the trial in the first half\nof 2024.\nMavrilimumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody inhibitor targeting GM-CSFRα. In 2017, we licensed\nexclusive worldwide rights in all indications to mavrilimumab from MedImmune. We are pursuing collaborative study\nagreements to evaluate the potential of mavrilimumab in rare cardiovascular diseases where the GM-CSF mechanism has\nbeen implicated. We previously evaluated mavrilimumab in GCA, a chronic inflammatory disease of the medium-to-large\narteries, and COVID-19-related ARDS. In February 2022, we granted Huadong exclusive rights to develop and\ncommercialize mavrilimumab in the Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan."

In September 2022, we closed an agreement granting\nGenentech an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize vixarelimab. Pursuant to such agreement, we \nhave agreed to complete our in-progress Phase 2b dose-ranging clinical trial of vixarelimab for the treatment of prurigo \nnodularis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition.  \nOur ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve sustained corporate profitability will depend heavily\non the continued commercialization of ARCALYST and the development and eventual commercialization of one or more\nof our current or future product candidates, if approved. While our ARCALYST collaboration with Regeneron has\nachieved profitability, such profits remain small compared to our total net losses and there is no guarantee that our\nARCALYST collaboration with Regeneron will remain profitable in the future. In addition, payments and royalties arising\nfrom out-licensing, collaboration or other similar agreements, though potentially substantial, are often isolated events and\ncannot be relied upon to generate significant and sustained revenue. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we\nrecognized net income of $183.4 million, primarily as a result of out-licensing activities and the release of our deferred tax\nasset valuation allowance, as compared to net losses of $157.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $492.0 million. We expect to incur operating losses for the\nforeseeable future as we advance our product candidates through preclinical and clinical development and, ultimately, seek\nregulatory approval. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to product manufacturing,\nincluding potential technology transfer costs as early as March 2023, marketing, sales and distribution of ARCALYST. We\nmay also incur expenses in connection with the in-licensing or acquisition of additional product candidates.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $190.6 million. We\nbelieve that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will enable us to fund our operating expenses\nand capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of the audited consolidated\nfinancial statements included in this Annual Report. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be\nwrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect.

ARCALYST is sold\nthrough a third party logistics provider that distributes primarily through a network of authorized specialty pharmacies and\nspecialty distributors (collectively, “customers”), which deliver the medication to patients by mail.\nNet revenue from product sales is recognized at the transaction price when the specialty pharmacy or specialty\ndistributors obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon shipment of the product from the\nthird party logistics provider.\nOur net revenues represent total revenues adjusted for discounts and allowances, including estimated cash\ndiscounts, chargebacks, rebates, returns, copay assistance, and specialty pharmacy and distributor fees. These adjustments\nrepresent variable consideration under ASC 606 and are estimated using the expected value method and are recorded when\nrevenue is recognized on the sale of the product. These adjustments are established by management as its best estimate\nbased on available information and will be adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such allowances.\nAdjustments for variable consideration are determined based on the contractual terms with customers, historical trends,\ncommunications with customers and the levels of inventory remaining in the distribution channel, as well as expectations\nabout the market for the product and anticipated introduction of competitive products.\nLicense and collaboration revenue\nLicense and collaboration revenue includes amounts recognized related to upfront payments, royalty revenue, and\nmilestone payments."

For more information, see\n“Business –License and Acquisition Agreements—Out-Licensing Agreements—Genentech License Agreement”.\nUnder the Genentech License Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $80.0 million for the license. In the\nfirst quarter of 2023, following our last delivery of certain drug supplies to Genentech, Genentech became obligated to\nmake an additional cash payment of $20.0 million. We will be eligible to receive up to approximately $600.0 million in\ncontingent payments, including specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones as well as royalties in the\nlow double digits to mid-teens on annual net sales, in each case before fulfilling our upstream financial obligations. We\nrecognized a portion of the $80.0 million upfront payment and the $20.0 million near-term payment related to the delivery\nof certain materials in the year ended December 31, 2022 for the exclusive vixarelimab license, drug supply delivered and\nthe completed portion of the in-progress Phase 2b prurigo nodularis clinical trial. We will recognize the remaining revenue\nassociated with the transaction price over the remaining duration of the in-progress Phase 2b prurigo nodularis clinical trial\nand remaining deliveries of certain drug supply.\nOperating Expenses\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold includes production and distribution costs of ARCALYST, and amortization of the regulatory\nmilestone, and other miscellaneous product costs associated with ARCALYST.

Such amounts are recognized as an expense as the\ngoods are delivered or the related services are performed, or until it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered\nor the services rendered.\nOur direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis for our product\ncandidates and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to outside consultants, CROs, CMOs and research\nlaboratories in connection with our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development\nactivities. Our direct research and development expenses by program also include fees incurred under license, acquisition\nand other similar agreements. We do not allocate employee costs or facility expenses, including depreciation or other\nindirect costs, to specific programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not\nseparately classified. We use internal resources primarily to conduct our research and discovery activities as well as for\nmanaging our preclinical and clinical development, process development and manufacturing activities."

Product candidates in later stages of clinical\ndevelopment generally have higher costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased\nsize and duration of later-stage clinical trials. As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will be\nsubstantial over the next several years as we conduct our ongoing and/or planned clinical trials for our product candidates\nas well as conduct other preclinical and clinical development, and make regulatory filings for our product candidates. We\nalso expect to incur additional expenses related to milestone and royalty payments payable to third parties with whom we\nhave entered into license, acquisition and other similar agreements to acquire the rights to our product candidates.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be\nnecessary to complete the clinical development of our current or future product candidates or when, if ever, we will realize\nsignificant revenue from product sales or be profitable. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties,\nincluding those described in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, travel and share based\ncompensation expense for personnel in selling, marketing, medical, executive, business development, finance, human\nresources, legal and support personnel functions. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include external\ncommercialization, marketing, and professional fees for legal, patent, and accounting services.\nWe have been commercializing ARCALYST since April 2021 and expect that our selling, general and\nadministrative expenses will continue to increase in the future as we continue to perform commercialization and sales\nactivities.\nOther Income\nOther income consists of interest income recognized from investments in money market funds and U.S. Treasury\nnotes and other miscellaneous income offset by expenses related to investments.\nIncome Taxes\nAs an exempted company incorporated under the laws of Bermuda, we are principally subject to taxation in\nBermuda. Under the current laws of Bermuda, there is no corporate income tax levied on an exempted company’s income,\nresulting in an effective zero percent tax rate. As a result, we have not recorded any income tax benefits from our losses\nincurred in Bermuda during each reporting period, and no net operating loss carryforwards are currently available to us for\nthose losses, while our assets remain in Bermuda. Our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries, Kiniksa US, and Primatope are\nsubject to federal and state income taxes in the United States. Our wholly owned subsidiary Kiniksa UK, and its wholly\nowned subsidiaries, Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals (Germany) GmbH, Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals (France) SARL, and Kiniksa\nPharmaceuticals GmbH are subject to taxation in their respective countries. Our income tax benefit relates mainly to the\nrelease of the valuation allowance on our UK deferred tax assets partially offset by provision for income taxes relating to\nU.S. and UK taxable income."

The increase in cost of goods sold relates primarily to the increase in sales and an increase in the average cost\nper unit. The increase in the average cost per unit is largely attributable to selling through repurposed clinical supply that\nwas previously expensed through R&D and carried at zero-cost during 2021.\nCollaboration Expenses\nOur collaboration with Regeneron continued to be profitable for the year ended December 31, 2022 after first\nachieving profitability in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Our UK deferred tax asset consists primarily of the\ntax basis of the intangible assets that were transferred to our wholly-owned UK subsidiary in 2021 and 2022. As a result of\nreleasing the valuation allowance on our UK deferred tax assets in 2022, we expect that our reported income tax expense\n(current plus deferred) for future periods will be higher than that recorded in prior periods.

We expect to incur expenses as we:\n●\nconduct our current and planned clinical trials for our current and future product candidates;\n●\nincrease clinical and commercial manufacturing capabilities or make arrangements with additional third party\nmanufacturers to successfully manufacture our products and product candidates;\n●\ndevelop and timely deliver clinical grade and commercial grade product formulations that can be used in our\nclinical trials and for commercial sale;\n●\nseek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n●\nmaintain, establish, and/or expand a sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution infrastructure to\ncommercialize ARCALYST or any of our current or future product candidates for which we may obtain\nmarketing approval and intend to commercialize on our own;\n●\nlaunch commercial sales of any of our current or future product candidates, if and when approved, whether\nalone or in collaboration with others;\n●\nmake milestone or other payments under any current or future license, acquisition, collaboration or other\nstrategic transaction agreements;"

The future viability of the\nCompany is dependent on its ability to fund its operations through sales of ARCALYST and/or raise additional capital,\nsuch as through debt or equity offerings, as needed. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be\nwrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We anticipate that we may require\nadditional capital if we choose to pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other product candidates and technologies or their\nrelated businesses. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing\nand distribution of ARCALYST. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our current or future product\ncandidates, pursue additional indications for our products or any of our current or future product candidates, we expect to\nincur significant expenses related to product development and manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, depending\non where we choose to commercialize.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of\nbiologic products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding\nrequirements may be impacted by a number of factors, including those described in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this\nAnnual Report.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial and sustained product revenue, we expect to finance our\ncash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, or other sources, including,\nlicensing, collaboration, marketing, distribution or other strategic transactions or arrangements with third parties. To the\nextent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our shareholders’ ownership\ninterest may be materially diluted, and the terms of such securities could include liquidation or other preferences that\nadversely affect our shareholders’ rights as a common shareholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if\navailable, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specified actions, such as\nincurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. In addition, debt financing would result in\nfixed payment obligations.\nIf we raise funds through licensing, collaboration, marketing, distribution or other strategic transactions or\narrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, product candidates or future\nrevenue streams, or otherwise agree to terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to obtain funding, we could\nbe forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs for product candidates,\nproduct portfolio expansion or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business prospects, or we may\nbe unable to continue operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and the\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience,\nknown trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of\nwhich form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent\nfrom other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from\nthese estimates under different assumptions or conditions."

Once a contract is determined to be within the\nscope of ASC 606, we determine the performance obligations that are distinct. We recognize as revenues the amount of the\ntransaction price that is allocated to each respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or\nas it is satisfied. Generally, our performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time, typically upon\nreceipt of the product by the customer.\nASC 606 requires entities to record a contract asset when a performance obligation has been satisfied or partially\nsatisfied, but the amount of consideration has not yet been received because the receipt of the consideration is conditioned\non something other than the passage of time. ASC 606 also requires an entity to present a revenue contract as a contract\nliability in instances when a customer pays consideration, or an entity has a right to an amount of consideration that is\nunconditional (e.g. receivable), before the entity transfers a good or service to the customer.\nProduct Revenue, Net\nNet revenue from product sales is recognized at the transaction price when the specialty pharmacy or specialty\ndistributors obtains control of our products, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon shipment of the product from\nthe third party logistics provider.\nOur net revenues represent total revenues adjusted for discounts and allowances, including estimated cash\ndiscounts, chargebacks, rebates, returns, copay assistance, and specialty pharmacy and distributor fees. These adjustments\nrepresent variable consideration under ASC 606 and are estimated using the expected value method and are recorded when\nrevenue is recognized on the sale of the product. These adjustments are established by us as our best estimate based on\navailable information and will be adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such allowances.\nAdjustments for variable consideration are determined based on the contractual terms with customers, historical trends,\ncommunications with customers and the levels of inventory remaining in the distribution channel, as well as expectations\nabout the market for the product and anticipated introduction of competitive products.\nAs of December 31, 2022, a 10% change in our product revenue allowance and reserve would not result in a\nmaterial change in our net revenue.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued\nresearch and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating\nwith our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service\nperformed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of\nactual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined\nschedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our\naccrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances\nknown to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of these estimates with the service providers and make\nadjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:"

The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary\nfrom contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our\nvendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. Payments under some of\nthese contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of participants and the completion of clinical trial\nmilestones. Non-refundable prepayments determined to be used within one year for goods or services that will be used or\nrendered for future research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. Non-refundable prepayments or\nminimum balance requirements associated to clinical trials determined to not be used within one year are classified as other\nlong-term assets. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level\nof effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from\nthe estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates\nto be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed\nrelative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too\nhigh or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of\naccrued research and development expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have accrued $8.4 million of estimated research and development expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax\nassets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated\nfinancial statements or in our tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between\nthe financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the\ndifferences are expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the (provision) benefit for\nincome taxes. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the\nextent we believe, based upon the weighting of both positive and negative evidence available, that it is more likely than not\nthat all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to\nincome tax expense. Potential for recovery of deferred tax assets is evaluated by estimating the future taxable profits\nexpected, cumulative recent earnings and considering prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Significant judgment is\nrequired in assessing both positive and negative evidence available and, to the extent that a reversal of any portion of our\nvaluation allowance against our deferred tax assets is deemed appropriate, a tax benefit will be recognized against our\nincome tax provision in the period of such reversal.\nWe believe our estimates for the valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets recognized in our\nfinancial statements are appropriate based upon our assessment of the factors mentioned above. We released a valuation\nallowance of $185.5 million during the year-ended December 31, 2022.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nA description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position\nand results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this\nAnnual Report."

As of December 31, 2022, our cash, cash\nequivalents and short-term investments consisted of money market funds and U.S. Treasury notes. Our primary exposure to\nmarket risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, which\nincreased substantially over the course of 2022. Further, events like the COVID-19 pandemic and global political turmoil,\nincluding the ongoing war in Ukraine, have adversely impacted the U.S. and global economy and financial markets, and\nmay have a long-term effect on market interest rates.

In our opinion, the \nconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period \nended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  \nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those\nstandards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated\nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have,\nnor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are\nrequired to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an\nopinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such\nopinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our\naudits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable\nbasis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters \n \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit\nmatters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they\nrelate."

      "text": "Table of Contents\nF-3\nRealizability of UK Deferred Tax Assets \n \nAs described in Notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of\n$185.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 due to the release of the valuation allowance on the UK deferred tax\nassets. These UK deferred tax assets were recorded as a result of the difference between the consolidated financial\nstatement and tax basis of intangible assets transferred by the Company to Kiniksa UK, using enacted tax rates in effect for\nthe year in which the differences are expected to reverse. As disclosed by management, significant judgment is required in\nassessing both positive and negative evidence available in determining whether it is more likely than not that the UK\ndeferred tax assets will be realized in the future. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, management\nconsidered the weighting of the positive and negative evidence, which included, among other things, cumulative UK\nincome in recent years, estimates of sales related to the Company’s commercial product ARCALYST, and future\nprofitability by jurisdiction.  \n \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the realizability of UK deferred\ntax assets is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining whether it was more\nlikely than not that the Company’s UK deferred tax assets would be realized in the future and (ii) a high degree of auditor\njudgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence available to support the\nweighting of the positive and negative evidence used in management’s determination. \n \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others (i) testing\nmanagement’s process for determining whether it was more likely than not that the Company’s UK deferred tax assets\nwould be realized in the future; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology used by management in weighting\nof available positive and negative evidence; (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s estimates of sales related\nto ARCALYST and future profitability by considering (a) the current and past performance of the business; (b) consistency\nwith external market and industry data; and (c) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other\nareas of the audit; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of certain of the data used in management’s assessment of\nwhether it was more likely than not that the Company’s UK deferred tax assets would be realized in the future; and (v)\ntesting the completeness and accuracy of the income tax benefit recognized due to the release of the valuation allowance on\nthe UK deferred tax assets. \n \nAccrued Research and Development Costs \n  \nAs described in Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has entered into various research and\ndevelopment-related contracts with companies both inside and outside of the United States. When billing terms under these\ncontracts do not coincide with the timing of when the work is performed, management is required to make estimates of\noutstanding obligations to those third parties as of the end of the reporting period. Within accrued expenses, total accrued\nresearch and development expenses amounted to $8.4 million as of December 31, 2022, which include accruals for these\nestimated research and development obligations. Accrual estimates are based on a number of factors, including\nmanagement’s assessment of progress towards completion of the research and development activities, invoicing to date\nunder the contracts, communication from the research institution or other companies of any actual costs incurred during the\nperiod that have not yet been invoiced, and the costs included in the contracts. Significant judgments and estimates are\nmade in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period."

(the “Company”) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering,\nacquiring, developing and commercializing therapeutic medicines for patients suffering from debilitating diseases with\nsignificant unmet medical need. The Company’s portfolio of immune-modulating assets is based on strong biologic\nrationale or validated mechanisms, target a spectrum of underserved cardiovascular and autoimmune conditions and offer\nthe potential for differentiation.\nThe Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to small commercial stage companies in the\nbiopharmaceutical industry and global health, societal, economic and market conditions, including the Company’s\ndependence on third parties, including contract research organizations and contract manufacturing organizations, the\nCompany’s limited experience obtaining regulatory approvals, the potential failure of the Company to successfully\ncomplete research and development of its current or future product candidates, the potential inability of the Company to\nadequately protect its technology, potential competition, the uncertainty that any current or future product candidates will\nobtain necessary government regulatory approval, that ARCALYST will continue to be commercially viable, whether any\nof the Company’s current or future product candidates, if approved, will be commercially viable, adverse impact from the\ncoronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic and global and political turmoil, including the ongoing war in Ukraine.\nSuch risks and uncertainties may be subject to substantial and uncertain changes, which may cause significant disruption to\nthe Company’s business and operations, preclinical studies and clinical trials, the business and operations of the third\nparties with whom the Company conducts business and the national and global economies, all of which may have material\nimpacts on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly\nowned subsidiaries, Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals Corp. (“Kiniksa US”), Primatope Therapeutics, Inc. (“Primatope”) and\nKiniksa Pharmaceuticals (UK), Ltd. (“Kiniksa UK”) as well as the subsidiaries of Kiniksa UK, Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals\n(Germany) GmbH (“Kiniksa Germany”), Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals (France) SARL (“Kiniksa France”), and Kiniksa\nPharmaceuticals GmbH (“Kiniksa Switzerland”), after elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and\ntransactions.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses\nduring the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in these consolidated financial statements\ninclude, but are not limited to, the recognition of revenue, the accrual for research and development expenses, the valuation\nof our deferred tax assets and the valuation of share-based awards. Estimates are periodically reviewed in light of changes\nin circumstances, facts and experience. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known.\nActual results could differ from those estimates.\nReporting and Functional Currency\nThe financial results of the Company's global activities are reported in U.S. dollars (“USD”) and its foreign\nsubsidiaries other than Kiniksa UK generally utilize their respective local currency to be their functional currency."

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are re-measured into the functional\ncurrency at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate gains and losses arising from re-\nmeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in income or losses in the period\nin which they occur.\nFor the Company’s foreign subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities\ndenominated in local currencies are translated into USD at end-of-period exchange rates and the resulting translation\nadjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity.\nFollow-on Offerings and Private Placements\nOn May 18, 2020, the Company completed a follow-on offering of 2,760,000 Class A common shares, inclusive\nof the exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option at a public offering price of $18.25 and a concurrent private\nplacement of 1,600,000 Class A1 common shares at an offering price of $18.25 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of\n$79,570. The aggregate net proceeds to the Company from the follow-on offering and concurrent private placement,\ninclusive of the over-allotment option exercise, was $74,495 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions,\nplacement agent fees and other offering costs.\nOn July 24, 2020, the Company completed a follow-on offering of 5,952,381 Class A common shares, at a public\noffering price of $21.00 and a concurrent private placement of 1,428,572 Class A1 common shares at an offering price of\n$21.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $155,000. The aggregate net proceeds to the Company from the follow-on\noffering and concurrent private placement was $146,037 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions,\nplacement agent fees and other offering costs.\nLiquidity\nThe Company has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise\nsubstantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the\nconsolidated financial statements are issued. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of\n$492,034. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded net income of $183,363 and provided $5,807\nof cash from operating activities. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term\ninvestments of $190,608.\nBased on its current operating plan, the Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term \ninvestments will be sufficient to fund its operations and capital expenditure requirements for at least twelve months from \nthe issuance date of these consolidated financial statements. The future viability of the Company beyond that point is \ndependent on its ability to fund its operations through sales of ARCALYST and/or raise additional capital, as needed. If the \nCompany is unable to grow sales of ARCALYST in future periods, the Company would need to seek additional financing \nthrough public or private securities offerings, debt financings, or other sources, which may include licensing, collaborations \nor other strategic transactions or arrangements. Although the Company has been successful in raising capital in the past, \nthere is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such additional financing on terms acceptable to the Company, if \nat all. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of \nits commercialization efforts, research and development programs for product candidates or product portfolio expansion, \nwhich could adversely affect its business prospects, or the Company may be unable to continue operations."

As of December\n31, 2022 and 2021 cash and cash equivalents consisted principally of U.S. Treasury notes, amounts held in money market\naccounts and cash on deposit at commercial banks.\nShort-Term Investments\nThe Company generally invests its excess cash in money market funds and short-term investments in U.S.\nTreasury notes. Such investments which are included in short-term investments on the Company's consolidated balance\nsheets are considered available-for-sale (“AFS”) debt securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and\nlosses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity, net of related tax effects.\nRealized gains and losses, if any, on short-term investments are included in interest income.\nIf the AFS debt security’s fair value declines below its amortized cost the Company considers all available\nevidence to evaluate the extent to which the decline is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. If the\ndecline is due to noncredit-related factors then no credit loss is recorded and the unrealized loss is recognized in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity, net of the related tax effects. If the decline is\nconsidered to be a credit-related impairment, it is recognized as an allowance on the consolidated balance sheet with a\ncorresponding charge to the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The credit allowance is\nlimited to the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost basis. No credit-related allowances or impairments\nhave been recognized on the Company’s investments in available-for-sale debt securities. \nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of\ncash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, substantially all of the Company’s\ncash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held at two financial institutions. The Company generally\nmaintains balances in various operating accounts at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit\nquality, in amounts that may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to its\ncash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the\nnormal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships.\nThe Company is also subject to credit risk from the accounts receivable related to product revenue. The majority\nof trade accounts receivable are recorded net of allowances for cash discounts associated with prompt payments from\ncustomers. All trade accounts receivable arise from product revenue in the United States due from the Company’s third\nparty logistics provider. There were no material write-offs charged against the allowance for the year ended December 31,\n2022.\nRestricted Cash\nIn conjunction with the Company’s lease agreement entered into in March 2018, the Company maintained a letter\nof credit for the benefit of the landlord. The lease expired in August 2021 and the restricted cash was released to operating\ncash in September 2021. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was no balance in restricted cash. As of December 31,\n2020, the underlying cash balance of $210 securing this letter of credit, was classified as current, in its consolidated\nbalance sheet."

Fair value is defined as the\nexchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most\nadvantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement\ndate. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the\nfollowing three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered\nunobservable:\n●\nLevel 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n●\nLevel 2—Observable inputs (other than Level 1 quoted prices), such as quoted prices in active markets for\nsimilar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\n●\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity that are significant to\ndetermining the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow\nmethodologies and similar techniques.\nThe Company’s cash equivalents and short-term investments, consisting of money market accounts and U.S.\nTreasury notes, are carried at fair value, determined based on Level 1 and 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy described\nabove (see Note 3). The carrying values of the Company’s prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts receivable,\naccounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets and\nliabilities.\nLeases\nAt the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a “lease” as\ndefined by ASC 842. A lease is an arrangement, or part of an arrangement, that conveys the right to control the use of\nidentified property, plant, or equipment (an identified asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The\nCompany determines if the arrangement conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time. It\nassesses throughout the period of use whether the Company has both of the following (1) the right to obtain substantially\nall of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset and (2) the right to direct the use of the identified asset. This\ndetermination is reassessed if the terms of the arrangement are changed. Leases are classified as operating or finance leases\nbased on the terms of the lease agreement and certain characteristics of the identified asset. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets\nand lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement date based on the present value of the minimum future lease\npayments.\nMost leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as ROU assets with\ncorresponding lease liabilities and, if applicable, long-term lease liabilities. The Company has elected not to recognize\nleases with a term of one year or less on its balance sheet, the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a\nstraight-line basis over the lease term. Operating leases, ROU assets and their corresponding lease liabilities are recorded\nbased on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. However, certain adjustments to the\nROU assets may be required for items such as incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease arrangements is\ntypically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate\nincurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar\neconomic environment."

The lease component\nresults in an operating ROU asset being recorded on the balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis as lease\nexpense.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets\nusing the straight-line method. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or\notherwise disposed of, the cost of these assets and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the\nconsolidated balance sheet and any resulting gains or losses are included in the consolidated statement of operations and\ncomprehensive income (loss) in the period of disposal. The expected useful lives of the respective assets are as follows:\nEstimated Useful Life\nComputer hardware and software\n3 - 5 years\nLaboratory equipment\n5 years\nFurniture, fixtures and vehicles\n5 - 7 years\nLeasehold improvements\nShorter of estimated\nuseful life or lease term\nInventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value with cost based on the first-in first-out\nmethod. Inventory that can be used in either the production of clinical or commercial products is expensed as research and\ndevelopment costs when identified and labeled for use in clinical trials as the products are required to be re-labeled for\nalternative uses. Prior to the regulatory approval of its drug candidates, the Company incurs expenses for the manufacture\nof product candidate supplies to support clinical development that could potentially be available to support the commercial\nlaunch of those therapeutics. Until the date at which regulatory approval has been received or is otherwise considered\nprobable, the Company records all such costs as research and development expenses. The Company performs an\nassessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventories during each reporting period and writes down any excess and\nobsolete inventory to its net realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. Such impairment\ncharges, should they occur, are recorded as a component of cost of sales in the Company’s consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive income (loss). The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires the\nuse of estimates by management. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional\nwritedown of inventory may be required.\nThe vials that will ultimately be distributed free of charge under our patient assistance program are recognized as\nselling expense when they are labeled as free goods."

Once a contract is\ndetermined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company determines the performance obligations that are distinct. The\nCompany recognizes as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to each respective performance\nobligation when the performance obligation is satisfied. Generally, the Company’s performance obligations are transferred\nto customers at a point in time, typically upon delivery of the product to the customer.\nASC 606 requires entities to record a contract asset when a performance obligation has been satisfied or partially\nsatisfied, but the amount of consideration has not yet been received because the receipt of the consideration is conditioned\non something other than the passage of time. ASC 606 also requires an entity to present a revenue contract as a contract\nliability in instances when a customer pays consideration, or an entity has a right to an amount of consideration that is\nunconditional (e.g. receivable), before the entity transfers a good or service to the customer.\nProduct Revenue, Net\nFollowing the FDA approval of ARCALYST on March 18, 2021, the Company began generating product revenue\nfrom sales of ARCALYST in April 2021. ARCALYST is sold through a third party logistics provider that distributes\nprimarily through a network of authorized specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors (“customer”), which deliver the\nmedication to patients by mail. The Company’s payment terms are between 30 to 35 days.\nNet revenue from product sales is recognized at the transaction price when the specialty pharmacy or specialty\ndistributors obtains control of the Company’s products, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon shipment of the\nproduct from the third party logistics provider.\nThe Company’s net revenues represent total revenues adjusted for discounts and allowances, including\nestimated cash discounts, chargebacks, rebates, returns, copay assistance, and specialty pharmacy and distributor fees.\nThese adjustments represent variable consideration under ASC 606 and are estimated using the expected value method and\nare recorded when revenue is recognized on the sale of the product. These adjustments are established by management as\nits best estimate based on available information and will be adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact\nsuch allowances. Adjustments for variable consideration are determined based on the contractual terms with customers,\nhistorical trends, communications with customers and the levels of inventory remaining in the distribution channel, as well\nas expectations about the market for the product and anticipated introduction of competitive products.\nDiscounts and Allowances\nRevenue from product sales is recorded at the transaction price, which includes estimates for discounts and\nallowances and includes cash discounts, chargebacks, rebates, returns, copay assistance, and specialty pharmacy and\ndistributor fees. These reserves are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to the Customer\nand right of offset exists) or a current liability (if the right of offset does not exist, the amount is payable to a third party, or\nis related to a future return). These allowances are established by management as its best estimate based on historical\nexperience and data points available and are adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves.\nAllowances for customer credits, chargebacks, rebates, data fees for services, returns, and discounts are"

Rebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements\nor statutory requirements which may vary by product, payor and individual payor plans. For qualified programs that can\npurchase products through wholesalers or other distributors at a lower contractual price, the wholesalers or distributors\ncharge back to the Company the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price.\nRebates and chargebacks are estimated primarily based on product sales, and expected payor mix and discount\nrates, which require significant estimates and judgment. Additionally, in developing the estimates the Company considers:\nhistorical and estimated payor mix; statutory discount requirements and contractual terms; historical claims experience and\nprocessing time lags; estimated patient population; known market events or trends; market research; channel inventory data\nobtained from customers; and other pertinent internal or external information. The Company assesses and updates the\nestimates every quarter to reflect actual claims and other current information.\nGovernment and other chargebacks are recognized as reduction of revenue upon the sale to the Customers. These\nitems are payable to customers and other rebates that are payable to other third party payors and healthcare providers are\nclassified as accrued expense liabilities.\nCash Discounts\nThe Company estimates cash discounts based on contractual terms and expectations regarding future customer\npayment patterns.\nSpecialty Pharmacy & Distributor Fees\nUnder the inventory management agreements with specialty pharmacies and distributors, the Company pays a fee\nprimarily for compliance with certain contractually determined covenants such as the maintenance of agreed upon\ninventory levels. These specialty pharmacy and distributor fees are based on a contractually determined fixed percentage of\nsales.\nThe Company has contracted with certain specialty pharmacies to obtain transactional data related to the products\nin order to develop a better understanding of the selling channel as well as patient activity and utilization by the Medicaid\nprogram and other government agencies and managed care organizations. The Company pays a variable fee to the specialty\npharmacies to provide the data. The Company also pay the specialty pharmacies a fee in exchange for providing\ndistribution and inventory management services, including the provision of inventory management data to the Company.\nThe Company estimates the fee for service accruals and allowances based on sales to each specialty pharmacy and the\napplicable contracted rate.\nSales Returns\nAllowances are made for estimated sales returns by the customers and are recorded in the period the related\nrevenue is recognized.

The Company’s estimates of sales returns are based primarily on analysis of industry information\nreporting the return rates for similar products and contractual agreement terms. The Company also takes into consideration\nknown or expected changes in the marketplace specific to ARCALYST.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling activities are considered to be fulfillment activities and not considered to be a separate\nperformance obligation.\nOther Incentives\nOther incentives include a co-pay assistance program for eligible patients with commercial insurance in the U.S.\nThe co-pay assistance programs assist certain commercially insured patients by reducing each participating patient’s\nfinancial responsibility for the purchase price, up to a specified dollar amount of assistance.\nCollaboration Revenue  \nThe Company analyzes its collaboration arrangements to assess whether such arrangements involve joint\noperating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks\nand rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities and therefore within the scope of ASC Topic 808,\nCollaborative Arrangements (“Topic 808”). This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on\nchanges in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of Topic\n808 that contain multiple elements, the Company first determines which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be\nwithin the scope of Topic 808 and which elements of the collaboration are more reflective of a vendor-customer\nrelationship and therefore within the scope of Topic 606.\nFor elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 606, we identify the\nperformance obligations and allocate the total consideration we expect to receive on a relative standalone selling price\nbasis to each performance obligation. Variable consideration such as performance-based milestones will be included in the\ntotal consideration if we expect to receive such consideration and if it is probable that the inclusion of the variable\nconsideration will not result in a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized under the\narrangement. Our estimate of the total consideration we expect to receive under each collaboration arrangement is updated\nfor each reporting period, and any adjustments to revenue are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis. We exclude sales-\nbased royalty and milestone payments from the total consideration we expect to receive until the underlying sales occur\nbecause the license to our intellectual property is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties or milestones\nrelate as it is the primary driver of value in our collaboration arrangements.\nKey assumptions to determine the standalone selling price may include forecasted revenues, development\ntimelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. We\nrecognize revenue associated with each performance obligation as the control over the promised goods or services transfer\nto our collaboration partner which occurs either at a point in time or over time. If control transfers over time, revenue is\nrecognized by using a method of measuring progress that best depicts the transfer of goods or services. We evaluate the\nmeasure of progress and related inputs each reporting period and any resulting adjustments to revenue are recorded on a\ncumulative catch-up basis.\nConsideration received that does not meet the requirements to satisfy ASC 808 or ASC 606 revenue recognition\ncriteria is recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, classified as either short-term\n(less than 12 months) or long-term (more than 12 months) deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such\nrevenue will be recognized."

The intangible asset\nwill be amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the underlying intellectual property of 20 years. Amortization\nexpense will be recorded as cost of goods sold in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive\nincome (loss).\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets, including intangible assets and property and\nequipment, whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not\nbe fully recoverable. When such events occur, the Company determines whether there has been an impairment in value by\ncomparing the asset’s carrying value with its fair value, as measured by the anticipated undiscounted net cash flows of the\nasset. If an impairment in value exists, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. The Company has not\nrecognized any impairment losses through December 31, 2022 and there have been no events that triggered an impairment\nanalysis.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of costs\nincurred to discover, research and develop drug candidates, including personnel expenses, share-based compensation\nexpense, allocated facility-related and depreciation expenses, third-party license fees and external costs of outside vendors\nengaged to conduct preclinical and clinical development activities and clinical trials as well as to manufacture clinical trial\nmaterials. Non-refundable prepayments determined to be used within one year for goods or services that will be used or\nrendered for future research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. Non-refundable prepayments or\nminimum balance requirements associated to clinical trials determined to not be used within one year are classified as other\nlong-term assets. Such amounts are recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are\nperformed, or until it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered, or the services rendered. Milestone and other\npayments made to third parties with respect to in-process research and development, in accordance with the Company’s\nlicense, acquisition and other similar agreements are expensed when determined to be probable and estimable.\nResearch Contract Costs\nThe Company has entered into various research and development-related contracts with companies both inside\nand outside of the United States. The related costs are recorded as research and development expenses as incurred. The\nCompany records accruals for estimated ongoing research and development costs. When billing terms under these contracts\ndo not coincide with the timing of when the work is performed, the Company is required to make estimates of outstanding\nobligations to those third parties as of the end of the reporting period. Any accrual estimates are based on a number of\nfactors, including the Company’s knowledge of the progress towards completion of the research and development\nactivities, invoicing to date under the contracts, communication from the research institution or other companies of any\nactual costs incurred during the period that have not yet been invoiced, and the costs included in the contracts. Significant\njudgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results\ncould differ materially from the Company's estimates."

These costs are classified as selling, general and administrative\nexpenses.\n \nSegment Information\nThe Company manages its operations as a single operating segment for the purposes of assessing performance and\nmaking operating decisions. The Company’s singular focus is on developing and delivering therapeutic medicines for\npatients suffering from debilitating diseases with significant unmet medical need.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures all share-based awards granted to employees and directors based on their fair value on the\ndate of grant. The Company issues share-based awards with both service-based vesting conditions and performance-based\nvesting conditions. The Company recognizes compensation expense for awards with service conditions on a straight-line\nbasis over the requisite service period. For awards with performance conditions, the Company recognizes compensation\nexpense when the achievement of the performance milestone is probable and estimable through the vest date.\nFor share-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees, compensation expense is recognized over the\nvesting period of the awards, which is generally the period during which services are rendered by such consultants and\nnon-employees until completed.\nThe Company classifies share-based compensation expense in its consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive income (loss) in the same manner in which the award recipient's payroll costs are classified or in which the\naward recipient's service payments are classified.\nThe fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model,\nwhich requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the expected share price volatility, the expected\nterm of the award, the risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends (see Note 11). Prior to May 2018, the Company was a\nprivate company and, accordingly, lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information for its shares.\nTherefore, it estimates its expected share price volatility based on the historical volatility of the Company and historical\nvolatility of publicly traded peer companies and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical\ndata regarding the volatility of its own traded share price. The expected term of the Company’s options has been\ndetermined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards that qualify as “plain-vanilla” options. The expected term of\noptions granted to non-employees is equal to the contractual term of the option award. The risk-free interest rate is\ndetermined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods\napproximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has\nnever paid cash dividends on common shares and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe fair value of each restricted share unit award is based on the closing price of the Company’s Class A common\nshares on the date of grant. Restricted share unit awards with an associated performance condition are evaluated on a\nregular basis for probability of achievement to determine the timing of recording share-based compensation expense in the\nCompany’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss)."

For the years ended December 31, 2022,\n2021 and 2020 the Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) was comprised of unrealized gain (loss) on short-term\ninvestments and currency translation adjustments, net of tax.\nNet Income (Loss) per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders is computed by dividing the net income\n(loss) attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.\nDiluted net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders is computed by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to\ncommon shareholders to reallocate undistributed earnings based on the potential impact of dilutive securities. Diluted net\nincome (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders is computed based on the treasury method by dividing the\ndiluted net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares\noutstanding for the period, including potential dilutive common shares. For purpose of this calculation, outstanding share\noptions and unvested restricted share units are considered potential dilutive common shares.\nIn periods in which the Company reports a net loss attributable to common shareholders, diluted net loss per share\nattributable to common shareholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common shareholders, since\ndilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company reported a net\nloss attributable to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the\nconsolidated financial statements or in the Company’s tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based\non the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for\nthe year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the\n(provision) benefit for income taxes. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered\nfrom future taxable income and, to the extent it believes, based upon the weighting of the positive and negative available\nevidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation\nallowance is established through a charge to income tax expense. Potential for recovery of deferred tax assets is evaluated\nby estimating the future taxable profits expected, cumulative recent earnings and considering prudent and feasible tax\nplanning strategies.\nThe Company is an exempted company incorporated under the laws of Bermuda. Under the current laws of\nBermuda, income tax is not charged or levied on an exempted company’s income. As a result, the Company has not\nrecorded any income tax benefits from losses incurred in Bermuda during each reporting period, and no net operating loss\ncarryforwards will be available to the Company for those losses. The Company’s wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries, Kiniksa\nUS and Primatope, are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States. The Company’s wholly owned\nsubsidiary Kiniksa UK, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Kiniksa Germany, Kiniksa France, and Kiniksa Switzerland, are\nsubject to taxation in their respective countries. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries, primarily Kiniksa US, operate\nunder cost-plus arrangements.\nThe Company’s U.S. provision for income taxes relates to current tax expense associated with the taxable income\nin the United States of its wholly owned subsidiary, Kiniksa US. The current income tax expense is a result of the taxable\nincome earned by Kiniksa US under its cost-plus arrangement offset in part by tax benefits from the U.S."

The Company’s UK benefit for income taxes relates to the deferred tax benefit\nassociated with the release of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets partially offset by the current tax expense\nassociated with the taxable income in the United Kingdom of its wholly owned subsidiary, Kiniksa UK.\nThe Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements by\napplying a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be\nevaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax\nposition is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of\nbenefit to recognize in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the\nlargest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provision for income\ntaxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate as well\nas the related net interest and penalties.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting standards that have been issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standards-\nsetting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s\nfinancial statements upon adoption.  \n3.           Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nThe following tables present information about the Company’s financial instruments measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis and indicate the level of the fair value hierarchy used to determine such fair values:\nFair Value Measurements\nas of December 31, 2022 Using:\n    \nLevel 1\n    \nLevel 2\n    \nLevel 3\n    \nTotal\nAssets:\n \n   \n   \n   \n  \nCash equivalents — money market funds\n$\n20,929\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n20,929\nCash equivalents — U.S. Treasury notes\n—\n15,009\n—\n15,009\nShort-term investments — U.S. Treasury notes\n—\n67,893\n—\n67,893\nTotal\n$\n20,929\n$\n82,902\n$\n—\n$\n103,831\nFair Value Measurements\nas of December 31, 2021 Using:\n    \nLevel 1\n    \nLevel 2\n    \nLevel 3\n    \nTotal\nAssets:\n \n   \n   \n   \n  \nCash equivalents — money market funds\n$\n94,324\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n94,324\nShort-term investments — U.S. Treasury notes\n—\n59,731\n—\n59,731\nTotal\n$\n94,324\n$\n59,731\n$\n—\n$\n154,055\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 there were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and\nLevel 3.

The 2018 Plan provides for the grant of incentive share options,\nnonqualified share options, share appreciation rights, restricted shares, dividend equivalents, restricted share units and other\nshare- or cash- based awards. Upon the effectiveness of the 2018 Plan, the Company ceased granting awards under its 2015\nEquity Incentive Plan (as amended, the “2015 Plan” together with the 2018 Plan, the “Plans”).\nA total of 4,466,500 Class A common shares were initially reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan. The number\nof Class A common shares that may be issued under the 2018 Plan will automatically increase on each January 1,\nbeginning in 2019 and continuing for each fiscal year until, and including, the fiscal year ending December 31, 2028, equal\nto the lesser of (1) 4% of the Class A common shares outstanding (on an as-converted basis) on the final day of the\nimmediately preceding calendar year and (2) a smaller number of Class A common shares determined by the Company’s\nboard of directors.

On the effective date of the 2018 Plan, the Company\nceased granting awards under the 2015 Plan. At that time, the 4,691,213 Class A common shares subject to outstanding\nawards under the 2015 Plan remained reserved for issuance under the plan pursuant to such awards and the 92,170 Class A\ncommon shares that had been available for future grant under the 2015 Plan were no longer authorized and reserved for\nissuance or available for future grant under the 2015 Plan.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were 1,956,543 Class A common shares subject to outstanding awards under the\n2015 Plan and reserved for issuance thereunder pursuant to such awards. The 2015 Plan continues to govern the terms and\nconditions of the outstanding awards granted under it. Class A common shares subject to awards granted under the 2015\nPlan that expire, lapse unexercised or are terminated, exchanged for cash, surrendered, repurchased, canceled without\nhaving been fully exercised, or forfeited become available for issuance under the 2018 Plan.\nThe exercise price for share options granted under the 2015 Plan was determined by the Company’s board of\ndirectors. All incentive share options granted to any person possessing 10% or less of the total combined voting power of\nall classes of shares could not have an exercise price of less than 100% of the fair market value of the Class A common\nshares on the grant date. All incentive share options granted to any person possessing more than 10% of the total combined\nvoting power of all classes of shares could not have an exercise price of less than 110% of the fair market value of the\nClass A common shares on the grant date.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (collectively, “Genentech”), pursuant to which the Company granted\nGenentech exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize vixarelimab and related antibodies\n(each, a “Genentech Licensed Product”). The Genentech License Agreement became effective in September 2022 (the\n“Genentech Effective Date”) following termination of the statutory waiting period under the Hart-Scott Rodino Act.\nUnder the Genentech License Agreement, the Company received an upfront payment of $80,000 for the license.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, following the Company’s last delivery of certain drug supplies to Genentech, Genentech\nbecame obligated to make an additional cash payment of $20,000. In addition, the Company will be eligible to receive up\nto approximately $600,000 in contingent payments, including specified development, regulatory and sales-based\nmilestones, before fulfilling the Company’s upstream financial obligations. The Company will also be eligible to receive\ntiered percentage royalties on a Genentech Licensed Product-by-Genentech Licensed Product basis ranging from low-\ndouble digits to mid-teens on annual net sales of each Genentech Licensed Product, subject to certain customary\nreductions, with an aggregate minimum floor, before fulfilling the Company’s upstream financial obligations. Royalties\nwill be payable on a Genentech Licensed Product-by-Genentech Licensed Product and country-by-country basis until the\nlatest to occur of the expiration of certain patents that cover a Genentech Licensed Product, the expiration of regulatory\nexclusivity for such Genentech Licensed Product, or the tenth anniversary of first commercial sale of such Genentech\nLicensed Product in such country.\nPursuant and subject to the terms of the Genentech License Agreement, Genentech has the exclusive worldwide\nright to conduct development and commercialization activities for Genentech Licensed Products at its sole cost.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Company is responsible, at its sole cost, for continuing to conduct and finalize its Phase\n2b clinical trial assessing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of vixarelimab in reducing pruritis in prurigo nodularis. Both\nthe Company and Genentech participate in a joint transition committee, which coordinates and oversees the technology and\ninventory transition activities relating to the development of the Genentech Licensed Products and the Company’s conduct\nand finalization of its Phase 2b clinical trial.\nGenentech has the right, for a specified period of time, to purchase an additional batch of vixarelimab drug\nsubstance under the Genentech License Agreement at cost plus a markup. Under the Genentech License Agreement,\nGenentech has the right to assume manufacturing responsibilities for Genentech Licensed Products.\nAbsent early termination, the Genentech License Agreement will continue until there are no more royalty or other\npayment obligations owed to the Company. Genentech has the right to terminate the Genentech License Agreement at its\ndiscretion with prior written notice and either party may terminate the Genentech License Agreement in the event of an\nuncured material breach of the other party or in the case of insolvency of the other party.

The exclusive license for vixarelimab\nis considered functional intellectual property and distinct from other promises under the Genentech License Agreement as\nGenentech can benefit from the license on its own or together with other readily available resources and the license is\nseparately identifiable from the other promises. The initial drug supply and drug product resupply are considered distinct\nfrom the exclusive license for vixarelimab as Genentech can benefit from such supply together with the license transferred\nby the Company at the inception of the Genentech License Agreement. The completion of the Phase 2b clinical trial is\nconsidered distinct from the exclusive license for vixarelimab as Genentech can benefit from the data generated by such\ntrial together with such license. Therefore, each represents a separate performance obligation within a contract with a\ncustomer at contract inception.\nThe Company determined the transaction price at the inception of the Genentech License Agreement which\nconsists of the $80,000 upfront payment. The Company determined that the $20,000 variable consideration related to the\ndelivery of the initial drug supply and drug product resupply was no longer constrained during the fourth quarter of 2022,\nas the Company determined that it could assert it was not probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative\nrevenue recognized would occur. The Company met the milestone obligation subsequent to year-end and invoiced\nGenentech for the related $20,000 payment for the delivery of certain drug material. The Company determined that all\nother variable considerations related to the future development and regulatory milestones, are deemed fully constrained and\ntherefore excluded from the transaction price due to the high degree of uncertainty and risk associated with these potential\npayments, as the Company also determined that it could not assert that it was not probable that a significant reversal in the\namount of cumulative revenue recognized would occur. The Company also determined that royalties and sales milestones\nrelate solely to the license of intellectual property. Revenue related to these royalties and sales milestones will only be\nrecognized when the associated sales occur, and relevant thresholds are met, under the sales or usage-based royalty\nexception of Topic 606.\nAs noted above, the Company identified four performance obligations in the Genentech License Agreement: (i)\nthe delivery of the exclusive license for vixarelimab; (ii) an initial drug supply delivery; (iii) a drug product resupply\ndelivery; and (iv) completion of the Phase 2b clinical trial for vixarelimab. The selling price of each performance\nobligation in the Genentech License Agreement was determined based on the Company’s standalone selling price (“SSP”)\nwith the objective of determining the price at which it would sell such an item if it were to be sold regularly on a\nstandalone basis.

(“Huadong”), pursuant to which the Company granted Huadong exclusive\nrights to develop and commercialize rilonacept and develop, manufacture and commercialize mavrilimumab (each, a\n“Huadong Licensed Product” and together, the “Huadong Licensed Products”) in the following countries: People’s\nRepublic of China, Hong Kong SAR, Macao SAR, Taiwan Region, South Korea, Indonesia, Singapore, The Philippines,\nThailand, Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, India, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal,\nNew Zealand, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam (collectively, the “Huadong Territory”). The Company otherwise retained its current\nrights to the Huadong Licensed Products outside the Huadong Territory.\nUnder the Huadong Collaboration Agreements, the Company received a total upfront cash payment of $22,000,\nwhich includes $12,000 for the Huadong Territory license of rilonacept and $10,000 for the Huadong Territory license of\nmavrilimumab. The Company will be eligible to receive up to approximately $70,000 in payments for rilonacept, and up to\napproximately $576,000 in payments for mavrilimumab, including specified development, regulatory and sales-based\nmilestones. Huadong will also be obligated to pay the Company tiered percentage royalties on a Huadong Licensed\nProduct-by-Huadong Licensed Product basis ranging from the low-teens to low-twenties on annual net sales of each\nHuadong Licensed Product in the Huadong Territory, subject to certain reductions tied to rilonacept manufacturing costs\nand certain other customary reductions, with an aggregate minimum floor. Royalties will be payable on a Huadong\nLicensed Product-by-Huadong Licensed Product and country-by-country or region-by-region basis until the later of (i) 12\nyears after the first commercial sale of the applicable Huadong Licensed Product in such country or region in the Huadong\nTerritory, (ii) the date of expiration of the last valid patent claim of the Company’s patent rights or any joint collaboration\npatent rights that covers the applicable Huadong Licensed Product in such country or region in the Huadong Territory, and\n(iii) the expiration of the last regulatory exclusivity for the applicable Huadong Licensed Product in such country or region\nin the Huadong Territory.\nPursuant and subject to the terms of the Huadong Collaboration Agreements, Huadong has the exclusive right to\nconduct Huadong Territory-specific development activities for the Huadong Licensed Products in the Huadong Territory,\nthe first right to support global development of the Huadong Licensed Products by serving as the sponsor of the global\nclinical trials conducted in the Huadong Territory and the exclusive right to commercialize the Huadong Licensed Products\nin the Huadong Territory. Huadong will be responsible for all costs of development activities and commercialization in the\nHuadong Territory. Both the Company and Huadong participate in a joint steering committee, which coordinates and\noversees the exploitation of the Huadong Licensed Products in the Huadong Territory.\nThe Company will supply certain materials to support development and commercialization activities for both\nmavrilimumab and rilonacept. Under the Huadong Collaboration Agreement for mavrilimumab, Huadong has the right to\nassume manufacturing responsibilities for materials in the Huadong Territory. Under the Huadong Collaboration\nAgreement for rilonacept, Huadong does not have rights to perform manufacturing activities in the Huadong Territory.\nAbsent early termination, each Huadong Collaboration Agreement will continue on a country-by-country or\nregion-by-region basis until there are no more royalty payments owed to the Company in such country or region for the\napplicable Huadong Licensed Product. Huadong has the right to terminate each Huadong Collaboration Agreement at its\ndiscretion upon 12 months’ notice and either party may terminate the applicable Huadong Collaboration Agreement in the\nevent of an uncured material breach of the other party or in the case of insolvency of the other party.

If Huadong and\nits affiliates do not conduct any material development or commercialization activities with respect to a Huadong Licensed\nProduct in the People’s Republic of China for a continuous period of longer than six months, then, subject to certain\nexceptions, the Company may terminate the Huadong Collaboration Agreement applicable to such Huadong Licensed\nProduct with 60 days’ prior written notice. In addition, Huadong’s rights under each Huadong Collaboration Agreement in\ncertain regions within the Huadong Territory may be subject to termination upon failure by Huadong to perform certain\nclinical, development or commercialization activities, as applicable, with respect to the applicable Huadong Licensed\nProduct in such regions.\nThe Company concluded that Huadong is a customer in these Huadong Collaboration Agreements, and as such,\neach Huadong Collaboration Agreement falls within the scope of the revenue recognition guidance in ASC 606.\nThe Company concluded that the Huadong Collaboration Agreements should not be combined and treated as a\nsingle arrangement for accounting purposes as the Huadong Collaboration Agreements were negotiated separately with\nseparate and distinct commercial objectives, the amount of consideration in one Huadong Collaboration Agreement is not\ndependent on the price or performance of the other Huadong Collaboration Agreement, and the goods and services\npromised in the Huadong Collaboration Agreements are not a single performance obligation.\nAccounting for Mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement\nAs of the Effective Date, the Company identified the following material promises in the mavrilimumab Huadong\nCollaboration Agreement: delivery of (i) exclusive license for mavrilimumab in the Huadong Territory and (ii) clinical\nmanufacturing supply of certain materials for mavrilimumab products in the Huadong Territory.\nThe Company also evaluated whether certain options outlined within the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration\nAgreement represented material rights that would give rise to a performance obligation and concluded that none of the\noptions convey a material right to Huadong and therefore are not considered separate performance obligations within the\nmavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement.\nThe Company assessed the above promises and determined that the exclusive license for mavrilimumab in the\nHuadong Territory is reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore represents a performance obligation. The\nexclusive license for mavrilimumab in the Huadong Territory is considered functional intellectual property and distinct\nfrom other promises under the Huadong Collaboration Agreement as Huadong can benefit from the license on its own or\ntogether with other readily available resources and the license is separately identifiable from the other promises. The\nclinical manufacturing supply of certain materials for mavrilimumab products in the Huadong Territory is considered\ndistinct from the exclusive license for mavrilimumab as Huadong can benefit from the manufacturing services together\nwith the license transferred by the Company at the inception of the Huadong Collaboration Agreement. Therefore, each\nrepresents a separate performance obligation within a contract with a customer at contract inception.\nThe Company determined the transaction price at the inception of the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration\nAgreement which includes $10,000, consisting of the upfront payment. The Company also includes an estimate of variable\nconsideration associated with the clinical manufacturing supply of certain materials when those materials are shipped. The\nCompany determined that any variable consideration related to development and regulatory milestones is deemed fully\nconstrained and therefore excluded from the transaction price due to the high degree of uncertainty and risk associated with\nthese potential payments, as the Company determined that it could not assert that it was probable that a significant reversal\nin the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The Company also determined that royalties and sales\nmilestones relate solely to the licenses of intellectual property. Revenue related to these royalties and sales milestones will\nonly be recognized when the associated sales occur, and relevant thresholds are met, under the sales or usage-based royalty\nexception of Topic 606."

The selling price of each\nperformance obligation in the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement was determined based on the Company’s\nstandalone selling price (“SSP”) with the objective of determining the price at which it would sell such an item if it were to\nbe sold regularly on a standalone basis. The Company allocated the variable consideration related to the manufacturing\nobligations to the future clinical supply of mavrilimumab products in the Huadong Territory and the remaining fixed and\nvariable consideration to the license obligation. The Company recognizes revenue for the license performance obligations\nat a point in time, that is upon transfer of the license to Huadong. As control of the license was transferred on the Effective\nDate and Huadong could begin to use and benefit from the license, the Company recognized $10,000 of collaboration\nrevenue during the year ended December 31, 2022 under the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement. The\nCompany will recognize revenue for the clinical manufacturing supply obligations at a point in time, that is upon each\ndelivery of the supply to Huadong.\nAccounting for Rilonacept Huadong Collaboration Agreement\nAs of the Effective Date, the Company identified the following material promises in the rilonacept Huadong\nCollaboration Agreement that were evaluated: delivery of (i) exclusive license for rilonacept in the Huadong Territory; (ii)\nclinical manufacturing supply of certain materials for rilonacept products in the Huadong Territory; and (iii) commercial\nmanufacturing supply of certain material for rilonacept products in the Huadong Territory.\nThe Company also evaluated whether certain options outlined within the rilonacept Huadong Collaboration\nAgreement represented material rights that would give rise to a performance obligation and concluded that none of the\noptions convey a material right to Huadong and therefore are not considered separate performance obligations within the\nrilonacept Huadong Collaboration Agreement.\nThe Company assessed the above promises and determined that there is one combined performance obligation for the\nexclusive license for rilonacept and clinical and commercial manufacturing obligations for rilonacept products in the\nHuadong Territory. Huadong cannot exploit the value of the exclusive license for rilonacept products in the Huadong\nTerritory without receipt of supply as the exclusive license for rilonacept products in the Huadong Territory does not\nconvey to Huadong the right to manufacture and therefore the Company has combined the exclusive license for rilonacept\nproducts in the Huadong Territory and the manufacturing obligations into one performance obligation.\nThe Company determined the transaction price at the inception of the rilonacept Huadong Collaboration Agreement\nwhich includes $12,000, consisting of the upfront payment. The Company also includes an estimate of variable\nconsideration associated with the clinical manufacturing supply of certain materials when those materials are shipped. The\nCompany determined that any variable consideration related to development and regulatory milestones, sales milestones\nand royalties are deemed fully constrained and therefore excluded from the transaction price due to the high degree of\nuncertainty and risk associated with these potential payments, as the Company determined that it could not assert that it\nwas probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Royalties and sales\nmilestones will be recognized as the Company delivers the commercial manufactured product to Huadong. Any changes in\nestimates may result in a cumulative catch-up based on the number of units of manufactured product delivered.\nAs noted above, the Company identified a single combined performance obligation in the rilonacept Huadong\nCollaboration Agreement consisting of the exclusive license for rilonacept and clinical and commercial manufacturing\nobligations for rilonacept products in the Huadong Territory. The Company recognizes revenue for the combined\nperformance obligation consisting of the exclusive license for rilonacept and clinical and commercial manufacturing\nobligations for rilonacept products in the Huadong Territory at a point in time, upon which control of materials are\ntransferred to Huadong for each delivery of the associated materials.

(“Biogen”) to acquire all of Biogen’s right, title and interest in and to certain assets used in or relating to\nvixarelimab and other antibodies covered by certain patent rights, including patents and other intellectual property rights,\nclinical data, know-how, and clinical drug supply. In addition, Biogen granted to the Company a non-exclusive,\nsublicensable, worldwide license to certain background patent rights related to the vixarelimab program. The Company is\nobligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize such acquired products.\nIn exchange for these rights, the Company made an upfront payment to Biogen of $11,500 and a technology\ntransfer payment of $500. The Company accounted for the acquisition of technology as an asset acquisition because it did\nnot meet the definition of a business. The Company recorded the upfront payment and technology transfer payment as\nresearch and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) because\nthe acquired technology represented in-process research and development and had no alternative future use.\nUnder the Biogen Agreement, the Company is obligated to make milestone payments to Biogen of up to $179,000\nupon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones in multiple indications in various territories, of which\n$165,000 remains as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company could be obligated to make up to an aggregate of\nup to $150,000 of payments upon the achievement of specified annual net sales milestones and to pay tiered royalties on\nescalating tiers of annual net sales of licensed products starting in the high single-digit percentages and ending below the\nteens.\nThe Company also agreed to pay certain obligations under third-party contracts retained by Biogen that relate to\nthe vixarelimab program.

Both parties may terminate by mutual written consent or in the event of material breach of the\nagreement by the other party that remains uncured for 90 days (or 30 days for payment-related breaches).\nIn July 2017, the Company and Biogen entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Biogen Agreement, which clarified\nthe scope of the antibodies subject to the Biogen Agreement.\nIn August 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Biogen Agreement (the “Second Biogen\nAmendment”). Pursuant to the terms of the Second Biogen Amendment, commencing on the effective date of the\nGenentech License Agreement, certain defined terms in the Biogen Agreement were amended, including “Net Sales”,\n“Indication”, “Product”, “Combination Product” and “Valid Claim”. In addition, the tiered royalty rates to be paid by the\nCompany to Biogen increased by an amount equal to less than one percent.\nUpon the termination or expiration of the Genentech License Agreement, the amendments to the terms of the\nBiogen Agreement, as set forth in the Second Biogen Amendment, will terminate and all terms of the Biogen Agreement\nwill revert to the version of such terms in effect as of immediately prior to the effective date of the Genentech License\nAgreement.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded research and development expenses\nof $56 and $53 respectively, related to the annual maintenance fee in connection with the retained contracts. During the\nyear ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded research and development expense of $106 primarily related to a\nmilestone occurring in the first quarter of 2020 and the annual maintenance fee in connection with the retained contracts.\nPrimatope Stock Purchase Option Agreement\nIn September 2017, the Company entered into a stock purchase option agreement (the “Primatope Agreement”)\nwith Primatope Therapeutics, Inc. (“Primatope”), pursuant to which the Company was granted a license to certain\nintellectual property rights owned or controlled by Primatope to research, develop, and manufacture the preclinical\nantibody, KPL-404.\nThe agreement provided the Company with an exclusive call option to purchase all of the outstanding securities of\nPrimatope. Upon execution of the agreement, the Company made $500 in upfront payments for the initial option period\nthrough April 2018 (the “Initial Option Period”). The Primatope Agreement allowed for up to three extensions of the Initial\nOption Period through January 2019 (including the initial option period, the “Option Period”) for total extension payments\nof up to $800. Through December 31, 2018, the Company made payments totaling $800 to extend the Option Period to\nJanuary 15, 2019. During the Option Period, the Company could conduct research and preclinical work to assess the\nviability of the asset.\nThe Company determined that the call option represented a variable interest in Primatope and that Primatope is a\nVIE. However, as the Company had no ability to control the board of directors or direct the ongoing activities of Primatope\nduring the Option Period, the Company did not have power over the activities that most significantly impact Primatope’s\neconomic performance and was not the primary beneficiary of Primatope. As a result, the Company did not consolidate the\nassets, liabilities, and results of operations of Primatope prior to 2019.\nIn January 2019, the Company exercised the call option and in March 2019, the Company acquired all of the\noutstanding securities of Primatope (the “Primatope Acquisition”).

The Company has also agreed to pay tiered royalties on escalating tiers of\nannual net sales of licensed products starting in the low double-digit percentages and ending at twenty percent. Royalty\nrates are subject to reductions upon certain events.\nThe Company is solely responsible for all development, manufacturing, and commercial activities and costs of the\nlicensed products, including clinical studies or other tests necessary to support the use of a licensed product. The Company\nis also responsible for costs related to the filing, prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights.\nThe MedImmune Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the royalty term in the last country for the last\nindication, as defined in the agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s insolvency or\nbankruptcy or for material breach of the agreement by the other party that remains uncured for 90 days. MedImmune has\nthe right to terminate the agreement if the Company challenges any of the licensed patent rights. The Company may\nterminate the agreement at any time upon 90 days’ prior written notice.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not record research and\ndevelopment expense in connection with milestone payments due under the MedImmune Agreement.\n14.         Income Taxes\nAs a company incorporated in Bermuda, the Company is principally subject to taxation in Bermuda. Under the\ncurrent laws of Bermuda, tax on a company’s income is assessed at a zero percent tax rate. As a result, the Company has\nnot recorded any income tax benefits from its losses incurred in Bermuda during each reporting period, and no net\noperating loss carryforwards will be available to the Company for those losses.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") was enacted to\nprovide economic relief to those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act made various tax law changes,\nincluding, among other things: (i) modifications to the federal net operating loss rules, including permitting federal net\noperating losses incurred in 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be carried back to the five preceding taxable years in order to generate\na refund of previously paid income taxes and eliminating the 80% of taxable income limitations in years 2018-2020; (ii)\nenhanced recoverability of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards; and (iii) delayed payment of employer payroll\ntaxes. On December 27, 2020 updates to the CARES Act were enacted which provided the temporary allowance of a full\ndeduction for business meals paid or incurred between December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2023.\nBeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) eliminated the option to deduct research and\ndevelopment expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to amortize them over five or fifteen years (depending on where\nresearch is conducted) pursuant to IRC Section 174. The most significant impact of this provision is an increase to our\nFDII benefit and an increase to our cash tax liability for 2022, the tax year in which the provision took effect."

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the\ngeneration of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the Company assessed the valuation allowance on its UK deferred tax assets and\nconsidered positive evidence, including, among other things, cumulative UK income in recent years, estimates of sales\nrelated to the Company’s commercial product ARCALYST, and future profitability by jurisdiction. After assessing both the\npositive evidence and negative evidence, the Company determined it was more likely than not that its UK deferred tax\nassets would be realized in the future and released the associated valuation allowance during the year ended December 31,\n2022. This resulted in a benefit of $185,495. As of December 31, 2022, the Company maintained a full valuation allowance\nagainst its U.S. deferred tax assets. While the Company still maintains a full valuation allowance on its US deferred tax\nassets as of December 31, 2022, based on current US forecasted income, it is reasonably possible that the Company will\nrelease its valuation allowance on its US deferred tax assets within one year. There are no material deferred tax assets in the\njurisdictions outside Kiniksa US and Kiniksa UK.\nUtilization of the state research and development tax credits may be subject to substantial annual limitation under\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 due to ownership changes that could occur in the future. These\nownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. In\ngeneral, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain\nshareholders or public groups in the shares of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period.\nChanges in the valuation allowance for deferred taxes were as follows:\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n    \n2022\n    \n2021\n    \n2020\nValuation allowance at beginning of year\n$ (127,944)\n$\n(9,307)\n$\n(330)\nIncreases recorded through the balance sheet\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\nDecreases (increases) recorded to income tax provision\n108,360\n(118,637)\n(8,977)\nValuation allowance at end of year\n$\n(19,584)\n$ (127,944)\n$ (9,307)\nThe valuation allowance decreased by $108,360 in 2022 primarily as a result of the release of the valuation\nallowance for the UK deferred tax assets which primarily consisted of the tax basis in intellectual property transferred from\nBermuda and net operating losses.\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the\ntax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax\nbenefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a\ngreater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is $1,794\nand $545 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
