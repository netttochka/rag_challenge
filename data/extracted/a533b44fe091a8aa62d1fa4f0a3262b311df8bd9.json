This gene can be detected with a simple genetic test. \nWe are developing Gencaro to treat atrial fibrillation, or AF, in patients with chronic heart failure, or HF. AF is the most common \nform of cardiac arrhythmia, a disruption of the heart’s normal rhythm or rate. HF is a chronic condition in which the heart is unable to \npump enough blood to meet the body’s needs. AF and HF commonly occur together. In HF patients, the development of AF leads to \nworsening symptoms, and increased risk of hospitalization and death. Current treatment options for AF in HF patients are limited, and \ncan be invasive, costly and dangerous.\nOur development plan for Gencaro focuses on the treatment of AF in patients with higher ejection fraction HF, those who have an \nejection fraction, or EF, of 40% and higher who also have the genotype we believe is optimal for Gencaro efficacy. This population of \nHF encompasses more than half of all HF patients in the United States and Europe. There are currently few approved or effective drug \ntherapies to treat AF or HF in this patient population.   \nOur development plan for Gencaro is based on our recently published analysis of the Phase 2b clinical trial of Gencaro for the \nprevention of AF in HF patients, known as GENETIC-AF. This analysis showed novel results for Gencaro in patients in the clinical \ntrial with EF’s of 40% and higher. We currently have an agreement with the FDA, known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, \nfor the requirements of a Gencaro Phase 3 clinical trial, PRECISION-AF, that would support approval of Gencaro if successful. The \nPhase 3 pivotal clinical trial of Gencaro conducted under an SPA will include secondary endpoints that are intended to capture some \nof this new information, such as a reduction in the need to deploy rhythm control interventions including electrical cardioversion, \ncatheter ablation and use of anti-arrhythmic drugs and avoidance of drug-related complications such as bradycardia. Based on these \nanalyses, we were issued a United States patent in February 2021 for the use of Gencaro in this patient population. We believe this \npatent will substantially extend the patent protection for our planned development of Gencaro into 2039. We are seeking similar patent \nprotection in other countries. \nWe believe that patients with HF and AF represent a major unmet medical need, and this need is most pronounced in patients with EF \nvalues of 40% and above. This EF range constitutes more than half of all chronic HF in the United States and Europe, as well as in \nJapan and China, and there are currently few approved, effective or guideline-recommended therapies for these patients to treat either \ntheir AF or HF. AF is a very common complication in these patients, with estimates of AF incidence ranging from 40% to 60%. Beta-\nblockers approved for HF are commonly used off-label to control heart rate in these patients, but they are not considered effective in \npreventing AF and none are approved for treating heart failure in pther contraindicated or have label warnings for use due to an \nincreased risk of mortality or prolongation of QT internal (irregular heart rhythm that can be seen on an electrocardiogram). \nInterventional procedures for AF, such as catheter ablation and electrical cardioversion, are invasive, expensive, and often temporary; \nthese interventions also typically require the continued use of beta blockers and other anti-arrhythmic drugs post-intervention.  \nWe believe that Gencaro, if approved, may be a safe and more effective therapy for the treatment of higher ejection fraction HF \npatients with AF. We believe there are several potentially important attributes that would differentiate Gencaro from existing \ntherapies, including:\n•\nMore effective rhythm control compared to the current standard of care;\n•\nReduction in the need for catheter ablation, electrical cardioversion, or toxic anti-arrhythmic drugs;\n•\nMaintenance of rhythm control after a successful AF catheter ablation;\n•\nEffective rate control with lower risk of treatment-limiting, adverse event producing bradycardia;\n•\nReduction in symptoms and improvement in quality of life;\n•\nReduced health care burden;\n•\nFoundational beta-blocker benefits for HF and unique evidence of efficacy in HF patients with AF;\n•\nOne of the only drug therapies approved and shown effective for AF in HF patients with EF ≥ 40%, and the only one in its \ndrug class.\nWe have an international patent portfolio for Gencaro in the United States, the EU, and other major markets, as well as new chemical \nentity status, including a new patent that we believe will give us a strong intellectual property position to at least approximately 2039 \nin the United States; we have filed applications similar to this new patent in international territories. We have developed a laboratory \nplatform for the diagnostic test that would be used to prescribe Gencaro; this platform was approved by FDA for use in the Phase 2B \nclinical trial. We retain all rights to this test platform; we expect to use it in future clinical trials, and we believe it could be one of \nmultiple diagnostic platforms used for commercialization. \nrNAPc2 (AB201) for treatment of COVID-19\nRecombinant Nematode Anticoagulant Protein c2, or rNAPc2 (AB201), is a protein therapeutic in clinical development as a potential \ntreatment for patients with COVID-19. Based on its unique mechanism of action, development history and the clinical evidence from \nthe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we believe rNAPc2 has potential to be a beneficial therapy for patients with this serious viral disease.

In the clinical trial, both doses of rNAPc2 demonstrated a treatment \nbenefit for patients based on the coagulation biomarker D-dimer, however, neither dose achieved statistical significance for the \nprimary efficacy endpoint of change in D-dimer level from Baseline to Day 8 compared to standard of care heparin. \nOn the secondary endpoints measuring thrombotic events and time-to-recovery, there was a numerical imbalance in favor of rNAPc2 \nthat was non-significant. rNAPc2 was well-tolerated at both doses. There were no serious treatment-related adverse events and no \ndose dependent increase in adverse events was observed. There was no difference between rNAPc2 and standard-of-care heparin in \nmajor or non-major clinically relevant bleeding. We currently do not plan additional clinical development of rNAPc2 unless we are \nable to find a commercial or government partner to pay for development and commercialization or expansion into clinical trials for \nother disease indications.\nTo support the continued development of Gencaro and rNAPc2, we will need additional financing to fully fund any clinical trials, and \nour general and administrative costs through the clinical trials’ projected completion and potential commercialization. Considering the \nsubstantial time and costs associated with the development of Gencaro and rNAPc2 and the risk that we may be unable to raise a \nsignificant amount of capital on acceptable terms, we are also pursuing co-development and commercialization partnering \nopportunities with large pharmaceutical and/or specialty pharmaceutical companies and may pursue a strategic combination or other \nstrategic transactions. If we are unable to obtain sufficient financing or are unable to complete a strategic transaction, we may \ndiscontinue our development activities on Gencaro or rNAPc2 or discontinue our operations.  \nWe believe our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 will be sufficient to fund our operations through the middle of \nfiscal year 2024. Our review of our strategic options may impact this projection. Conducting a Phase 3 PRECISION-AF trial would \nlikely require additional financing. However, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower \nthan currently anticipated. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our \navailable financial resources sooner than we currently anticipate; therefore, we may have to raise additional capital for other clinical \ntrials. Initiating any Phase 3 clinical trial of Gencaro will require additional financing.\nOur Strategy \nOur mission is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company developing precision targeted cardiovascular therapies to enhance \ntherapeutic response, improve patient outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs. To achieve this goal, we are pursuing the following \nstrategies: \n•\nEvaluate strategic options. In April 2022, the Board of Directors established a Special Committee and, in May 2022, \nretained Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. to evaluate strategic options, including transactions involving a merger, sale of \nall or part of our assets, or other alternatives with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. We believe there are multiple \npotential opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders. We do not have a defined timeline for the strategic review \nprocess and the review may not result in any specific action or transaction.\n•\nAdvance the development of Gencaro for the treatment of AF in HF patients. We are planning a Phase 3 clinical trial for \nGencaro as a therapy for AF in HF patients, focusing on patients with EF ≥ 40%, a patient population for whom few \napproved or effective drug therapies currently exist.\n•\n Partner the development of rNAPc2. We plan to pursue strategic development and partnering opportunities with \ncommercial or government partners for rNAPc2 development and commercialization or expansion into clinical trials for \nother disease indications.\n•\nBuild a cardiovascular pipeline. Our management and employees, including our chief executive officer, are experienced \nin cardiovascular research, molecular genetics and clinical development of cardiovascular therapies. We are seeking to \nleverage this expertise to identify, acquire and develop other cardiovascular products or candidates, particularly those with \npotential for targeted development based on genetic or other biomarkers.\nThe above strategies are dependent upon our ability to obtain additional funding through the sale of public or private equity or debt \nsecurities, the completion of a strategic transaction, or a combination thereof. If we are unable to secure additional funding or \ncomplete a strategic transaction, we may not be able to continue development of Gencaro or rNAPc2, or to continue operations.\nAtrial Fibrillation in Heart Failure\nMarket Background and Opportunity \nHeart failure is a chronic condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs. HF has numerous \nserious consequences, including severe impacts on quality of life, increased hospitalizations, loss of economic productivity, and \npremature death. HF is a leading cause of death in the developed world, and despite the availability of multiple effective drug classes, \nmortality due to HF is increasing. According to the 2020 American Heart Association, or AHA, Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics, \nthere were an estimated 6.2 million Americans aged 20 years or more with HF in 2016, projected to increase to between 8.3 million"

      "text": "4\nand 10.7 million by 2030. One of the fundamental classifications of heart failure is based on the percentage of blood in the left \nventricle of the heart that is ejected with each heartbeat, known as ejection fraction or EF. The spectrum of HF includes HF in which \nEF is 50% or more and is considered preserved ejection fraction, known as HFpEF; HF in which the EF is less than 40%, considered \nreduced ejection fraction, or HFrEF; and HF in which the EF is at least 40%, but less than 50%, sometimes referred to as mid-range \nejection fraction, known as HFmrEF. Together, HFmrEF and HFpEF, that is HF with EF ≥ 40%, comprise more than half of all \nchronic HF in the United States and Europe. In 2012, the economic cost of HF in the United States was estimated to be nearly $31 \nbillion, of which two-thirds, or over $20 billion, was attributable to direct medical costs. \nAtrial fibrillation, the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is a serious disorder in which the normally regular and coordinated \ncontraction pattern of the heart’s two small upper chambers, or the atria, becomes irregular, rapid and uncoordinated. AF can have \nsignificant quality of life impacts and potentially serious medical consequences, including increasing the risk of stroke and other \ncardiovascular problems. In individuals with HF, AF contributes to the disease processes that lead to the progression of HF and \nworsening of clinical outcomes. AF is considered an epidemic cardiovascular disease and a major public health burden, similar to HF. \nThe estimated number of individuals with AF globally in 2015 was 33.3 million. According to AHA Heart Disease and Stroke \nStatistics Reports from 2017-2020, the prevalence of AF in the United States was estimated to be 5.2 million people in 2015. In the \nEuropean Union, the prevalence of AF was estimated to be 8.8 million (age 55 and over) in 2010. It is estimated that AF costs the U.S. \neconomy about $6.0 billion annually.\nAF and HF share many of the same risk factors and commonly occur together. It has been estimated that 30-60% of HF patients will \nalso develop AF, with this incidence increasing in HF patients with higher EF; we estimate that 40-60% of HF patients with EF ≥ 40% \nwill also be diagnosed with AF. \nMedical Need and Current Therapy\nThe goals of current medical therapy for AF are to provide anticoagulation to reduce the risk of stroke, and also either maintain sinus \nrhythm (known as rhythm control), or reduce the high heart rate caused by AF (known as rate control), in both cases to minimize \npatient symptoms and reduce the risk of further complications and disease progression. Unfortunately, the current treatment options \nfor treating AF in patients with HF have significant limitations. \nBeta-blockers are considered standard of care for the treatment of HF patients, including in patients with co-morbid AF. They are also \nviewed as foundational therapy to treat AF in HF patients for their ability to provide rate control. Their safety in this patient \npopulation is well established. \nHowever, current beta blockers approved for HF patients are only modestly effective at providing rhythm control, and none are FDA \napproved for this indication. Importantly, none of these drugs have been shown to be effective for treating HF in patients with EF ≥ \n40%, so they are currently used off-label in this setting. When used for rate control, these drugs can cause bradycardia, a condition in \nwhich the heart rate drops below a safe threshold, which often leads to dose reductions and potential loss of the drug’s treatment \neffect. Furthermore, recent evidence indicates that the mortality and other clinical benefits of these beta blockers in heart failure \npatients are uncertain when sustained or permanent AF is present. \nAnti-arrhythmic drugs are a drug class that is often prescribed to provide rhythm control. These drugs are frequently used in patients \nwith both HF and AF when a rate control strategy using a beta blocker fails to control the patient’s symptoms. However, these agents \nhave significant safety issues, For example, in the United States, anti-arrhythmic drug therapy for AF used in addition to beta-blockers \nis generally confined to the drugs amiodarone and dofetilide, which have multiple safety and toxicity concerns. Because of these \nconcerns, physicians treating HF patients seek to limit the use of these anti-arrhythmic drugs.\nNon-pharmacologic interventions such as catheter ablation and electrical cardioversion (ECV), are also used to treat AF in patients \nwith HF. Catheter ablation is now guideline-recommended in this patient population and its use is increasing. However, it is not a \nreplacement for drug therapy; it is invasive, expensive and generally impermanent. Drug therapy, including beta blockers, is generally \ncontinued in patients post-ablation, both for rhythm control and for HF benefit. ECV is expensive and less permanent than ablation, \nbut like ablation, post-ECV patients will generally remain on drug therapy to treat their AF and HF, including beta-blockers.\nIn light of the serious medical consequences presented by AF in the presence of HF as well as, the limitations of current therapies, we \nbelieve there is an unmet need for a drug therapy that can provide greater rhythm control compared to the current standard of care; can \nreduce the need for toxic anti-arrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation, and electrical cardioversion; can provide effective rate control with \na lower risk of treatment-limiting bradycardia; and can provide foundational beta-blocker benefits for HF. This need is particularly \nsignificant for HF patients with EF ≥ 40%, for whom there are few approved or Class I guideline-recommended drug therapies.\nGencaro Clinical Development\nThe GENETIC-AF Phase 2B Clinical Trial\nGENETIC-AF enrolled 267 patients from the United States, Canada and Europe. The primary analysis compared the evidence of \nsafety and efficacy of Gencaro versus an active comparator, TOPROL-XL. The primary endpoint of the trial was time to first event of"

Laboratory Corporation of America, or LabCorp, developed the genetic test, obtained an \nInvestigational Device Exemption, or IDE, from the FDA and provided the companion diagnostic test and services to support our \nGENETIC-AF clinical trial. \nFor the primary endpoint of time to AF recurrence, Gencaro demonstrated a similar treatment benefit in the overall population (p = \n0.961) compared to the active comparator, TOPROL-XL. However, based on further analysis of the trial, we believe we have \nidentified a population that shows greater response to Gencaro compared to TOPROL-XL across multiple important clinical \nassessments, including the primary endpoint of time to AF recurrence, maintenance of normal sinus rhythm, cumulative AF burden, \nand AF-related clinical interventions and complications. We plan to study this population in our Phase 3 clinical trial.\nThese further analyses of the GENETIC-AF population (shown in the table below) demonstrated that Gencaro, as compared to \nmetoprolol, reduced AF burden, improved maintenance of sinus rhythm and lowered the need for additional rhythm control \ninterventions.\nEndpoint\nEntire GENETIC-AF Cohort\n Time to 1st AF/AFL/ACM\n(Primary Endpoint)\n1.01 \n(neutral)\n(0.71, 1.42)\np = 0.961\nN = 267\nCumulative 24-week AF Burden\n(substudy)\n0.64\n(↓36%)\n(0.46, 0.86)\np = 0.002\nN = 67\nAF Burden at Week 24\n0.45\n(↓55%)\n(0.39, 0.50)\np < 0.001\nN = 67\nECGs in Normal Sinus Rhythm\n1.39\n(↑39%)\n(1.22, 1.58)\np < 0.001\nN = 257\nAF Interventions\n(ECVs, Ablations, & Class 3 AA Drugs)\n0.68\n(↓32%)\n(0.50, 0.91)\np = 0.011\nN = 257\nBradycardia prevalence\n(Buc. vs. met., VR< 60 bpm)\n0.39\n(↓61%)\n(0.31, 0.49)\nP < 0.001\nN = 256\nDose reductions\n (pts. w/bradycardia vs. non-b.)\n4.25\n(↑4X)\n(2.06, \n9.60)\nP < 0.001\nN = 257\nTime to first AF/AFL/ACM treatment effect = hazard ratio (95% CI).

AFB at Week 24 = \nInstantaneous estimates of average daily AF burden at week 24 with comparison between groups expressed as the ratio of the estimates and \ntested for significance using a Wald test. Normal Sinus Rhythm = total # ECGs in sinus rhythm with ventricular rate ≥ 60 and ≤ 100 bpm during \nefficacy follow-up period. AF Interventions = ECV, ablation, or guideline-recommended antiarrhythmic use during efficacy follow-up period. \nTreatment effect for normal sinus rhythm, AF interventions and bradycardia = prevalence rate ratio (i.e., PRRBUC/PRRMET) modeled to test \nsignificance using Poisson regression. \nTreatment with Gencaro was associated with a 36% reduction in cumulative AF burden over 24 weeks of follow-up compared to \nmetoprolol, leading to a 55% reduction in AF burden at the end of 24 weeks. Consistent with the results in the device substudy, there \nwas a 39% increase in the prevalence of ECGs demonstrating normal sinus rhythm in the overall study population. Treatment with \nGencaro also led to a 32% lower utilization of adjunctive rhythm control therapies, including electrical cardioversion, catheter ablation \nand antiarrhythmic drug therapy. There was also a 61% reduction in bradycardia with Gencaro versus metoprolol. The consequence of \nbradycardia is a reduction in beta-blocker dose, which 4.2-fold higher in patients exhibiting bradycardia than without bradycardia. \nThe BEST Phase 3 Heart Failure Trial\nThe effect of Gencaro on heart failure endpoints in an advanced HFrEF population was evaluated in the 2,708 patient, placebo \ncontrolled Phase 3 BEST clinical trial co-sponsored by the NHLBI and Department of Veterans Affairs. In addition to the parent \npopulation, BEST included a 1,040 patient DNA substudy that evaluated the effects of adrenergic receptor, or AR, polymorphisms on \nGencaro effectiveness. The BEST trial was terminated early because, after positive mortality results from two HF trials involving \nother beta-blockers had been reported, a substantial number of BEST trial investigators concluded that it was unethical to continue to \ngive placebo to BEST trial participants. Our reanalysis of the BEST results in accordance with the FDA approved, pre-specified \nstatistical analysis plans (which had not been performed by the sponsors of BEST) demonstrated a 13% risk reduction on the primary \nendpoint of ACM in the BEST trial with a p-value of 0.053. The risk reduction on HF clinical efficacy endpoints such as mortality and \nhospitalization ranged from 34% to 48% in this beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype. The DNA substudy revealed that Gencaro \nexhibited greater efficacy in patients homozygous for the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype (ADRB1 Arg389Arg), encoding \nfor receptors that exhibit higher function and greater affinity for norepinephrine compared to the patients who did not have the beta-1 \n389 arginine homozygous genotype (i.e., beta-1 389 Gly carriers).

Beta-1 389 Gly carriers had no statistically significant reduction in any endpoint.\nPharmacology and Pharmacogenetics of Gencaro\nGencaro (bucindolol hydrochloride) is a nonselective (blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors) beta- receptor blocking \nagent with mild vasodilator properties. This combination of properties initially placed Gencaro in the \"3rd Generation\" category of \nbeta-blockers that is based on the strategy of their development. When its pharmacogenetic properties were elucidated and its \ndevelopment became pharmacogenetically based, we subsequently considered Gencaro a fourth-generation beta-blocker. The \ndominant beta-receptor on human heart cells is the beta-1, with smaller number of beta-2 receptors present. Importantly, beta-2 \nreceptors are also present on adrenergic nerve terminals in the heart, where they regulate the release of the neurotransmitter \nnorepinephrine, or NE. The blocking of these receptors prevents them from binding with other molecules, primarily NE, which \nactivates these receptors to release more NE. We believe Gencaro has two unique anti-adrenergic properties not possessed by other \nbeta-blockers currently approved for the treatment of HF: (1) it is moderately sympatholytic, i.e., by blocking beta-2 receptors on \nadrenergic nerves it lowers adrenergic drive to a level that can be detected on measurements of central or systemic venous NE levels, \nand, (2) through “inverse agonism,” as it binds to a polymorphic \"389 arginine\" form of heart cell beta-1 receptor in isolated human \nheart preparations it promotes the inactivation of the active-state of this receptor. These properties, as described below, were observed \nto interact with receptor polymorphisms in such a way that we believe targeting a specific genotype of the beta-1 receptor gene \n(known as ADRB1) could improve the therapeutic response of patients. We believe Gencaro’s efficacy is enhanced in patients with \nthe beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype (ADRB1 Arg389Arg), which has been shown to be present in approximately 50% of the \nNorth American and European general populations. To date no other beta-blocker has been shown to possess pharmacological \nsympatholysis, or beta-1 AR inverse agonism in human heart preparations. We believe that Gencaro's sympatholytic and beta-1 AR \ninverse agonist properties contribute to its enhanced lowering of HF and arrhythmia event rates in patients who have an ADRB1 \nArg389Arg genotype.\nGencaro Clinical and Regulatory Strategy\nWe intend to advance Phase 3 clinical development of Gencaro as a therapy for HF patients with AF, focusing on HF with EF ≥ 40%. \nThe regulatory strategy for Gencaro is to obtain an initial approval to treat AF in a HF population with EF ≥ 40% and ≤ 55% and the \nbeta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype; the population demonstrating the greatest efficacy in the Phase 2B GENETIC-AF clinical \ntrial. Indication expansion for Gencaro will focus on genotype-positive HF patients with EF >55%, which we believe would \nsubstantially expand the addressable patient population, if successful. We have obtained an SPA agreement with the FDA to conduct a \nsingle, 400-patient Phase 3 clinical trial that, if successful at a statistical threshold of p ≤ 0.01, may be sufficient to support an NDA \nfor the marketing approval of Gencaro.\nThe clinical trial design is similar to GENETIC-AF, including the active comparator, TOPROL-XL, and the primary endpoint of time \nto AF or atrial flutter, or AF/AFL, recurrence or mortality during a 6-month follow-up period. The planned clinical trial will use a \nstandard significance criterion of p ≤ 0.05 for the primary endpoint; however, if the primary endpoint is significant with a p-value ≤ \n0.01, then this single Phase 3 clinical trial may be sufficient for regulatory approval per the SPA agreement. The NDA submission for \nGencaro is eligible for expedited review in the United States under the Fast Track development program designation that was granted \nto Gencaro in 2015. Based on the use of this same endpoint in GENETIC-AF it is anticipated that ≥90% of the primary events will be \ndue to recurrent AF/AFL. Secondary objectives will examine other important endpoints, such as AF burden and AF treatment-related \ninterventions. The planned clinical trial will use a standard significance criterion of p ≤ 0.05 for the primary endpoint; however, if the \nprimary endpoint is significant with a p-value ≤ 0.01, then this single Phase 3 clinical trial may be sufficient for regulatory approval \nper the SPA agreement. \nThe Gencaro Test \nIf approved, we believe that Gencaro will be the first cardiovascular drug to be integrated with a companion diagnostic. This would be \na test for the patient genotype approved for the drug, and could be performed by a variety of laboratory processes or platforms. \nIn collaboration with LabCorp, we developed one such genetic test, obtained an IDE from the FDA and used this test in our \nGENETIC-AF clinical trial. We retain all rights to this particular test platform, and we believe it could be used for commercialization. \nFuture clinical trials of Gencaro, including PRECISION-AF, are expected to use a similar diagnostic test to identify the patient’s \nreceptor genotype. We believe the Gencaro Test could be developed and commercialized through one or more diagnostic providers, by \nthe company potentially marketing Gencaro, or a combination of approaches. We also believe that point of care genetic tests, which \ncould be performed during the patient’s visit to the physician, will be part of the commercialization strategy for Gencaro."

      "text": "7\nDevelopment Pipeline \nOur lead product candidate is Gencaro™ (bucindolol hydrochloride) for the treatment of atrial fibrillation in patients with chronic \nheart failure.\nGencaro, is a potential treatment for HF patients with AF. Gencaro (bucindolol hydrochloride) is a pharmacogenetic-targeted beta-\nadrenergic receptor antagonist with mild vasodilator properties that is considered a fourth-generation beta-blocker based on its novel \npharmacogenetic profile. We believe the treatment of AF in HF patients with EF ≥ 40% is an unmet medical need with a near term \nand straightforward regulatory pathway. \nOur plan is to obtain an initial approval for Gencaro to treat AF in a genotype specific HF population; HF patients with EF between \n40% and 55% in patients with the genotype we studied in the Phase 2B GENETIC-AF clinical trial. We believe that, if approved, \nthere are additional indication expansion opportunities for Gencaro in other AF populations, including expanding the patient \npopulation to selected HF patients with EF >55%. We continue to evaluate the feasibility and potential timing for initiating \nPRECISION-AF relative to the COVID-19 pandemic. We may seek additional capital or a strategic partnership for the Phase 3 \nclinical trial and potential commercialization of Gencaro.  \nWe plan to pursue strategic development and partnering opportunities with commercial or government partners for rNAPc2 \ndevelopment and commercialization or expansion into clinical trials for other disease indications.\nWe also have exclusive pharmacogenetic and other patent rights to drug targets and candidates that have potential indications in \ncardiovascular disease, oncology and other therapeutic areas. We may seek partners to assist us in the development of these candidates \nor who may license them. We may also seek funds to advance the development of the compounds on our own.  \nFinancial Resources \nTo support the continued development of Gencaro and rNAPc2, we will need additional financing to fully fund any clinical trials, and \nour general and administrative costs through the clinical trials’ projected completion and potential commercialization. Considering the \nsubstantial time and costs associated with the development of Gencaro and rNAPc2 and the risk that we may be unable to raise a \nsignificant amount of capital on acceptable terms, we are also pursuing co-development and commercialization partnering \nopportunities with large pharmaceutical and/or specialty pharmaceutical companies and may pursue a strategic combination or other \nstrategic transactions. If we are unable to obtain sufficient financing or are unable to complete a strategic transaction, we may \ndiscontinue our development activities on Gencaro or rNAPc2 or discontinue our operations.\nWe believe our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 will be sufficient to fund our operations through the middle of \nfiscal year 2024. Our review of our strategic options may impact this projection. Conducting a Phase 3 PRECISION-AF trial would \nlikely require additional financing. However, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower \nthan currently anticipated. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our \navailable financial resources sooner than we currently anticipate; therefore, we may have to raise additional capital for other clinical \ntrials. Initiating any Phase 3 clinical trial of Gencaro will require additional financing.\nIn July 2020, we entered into a sales agreement with a placement agent to sell, from time to time, our common stock having an \naggregate offering price of up to $54.0 million, in an “at the market offering.” As of February 2021, we had sold an aggregate of \n9,928,272 shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of such sales agreement for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately \n$54.0 million. Net proceeds received in this offering were approximately $52.2 million, after deducting expenses for executing the “at \nthe market offering” and commissions paid to the placement agent.\nIn April 2021, we amended the new sales agreement and the amount available for the offering under our prospectus to our registration \nstatement on Form S-3 (No. 333-254585). As of February 22, 2023, the amount available for the offering under the prospectus \nsupplement is subject to the limitation of not selling a total value amount of shares exceeding more than one-third of our public float \nin any 12-month period, which as of February 22, 2023 would have been approximately $8.8 million. \nResearch and Development Expenses \nOur research and development expenses were $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $13.8 million for \n2021, a decrease of approximately $9.1 million. R&D expense in 2023 is expected to be lower than 2022.\nLicensing and Royalty Obligations \nGencaro\nOur patent portfolios relating to Gencaro, including a patent issued in 2021, are either owned by us or are subject to licenses that \nimpose no royalty obligations or milestone payments relating to the further development, approval and commercialization of Gencaro.\nWe are also a party to licenses for patents relating to Gencaro that are now expired. We believe that there are no future milestone or \nroyalty obligations that will be payable under these licenses."

      "text": "8\nCompetition\nGencaro\nCurrent HF treatments include three beta-blockers approved for HF in the Unites States. However, their efficacy in providing control \nof the arrhythmia caused by AF, or rhythm control, is only mild. It is also now acknowledged that evidence is lacking that the \napproved beta-blockers provide outcome benefits for patients who develop permanent AF. Furthermore, these drugs have not \ndemonstrated efficacy for HF patients with EF ≥ 40%, which is the focus of the Gencaro development program. Current AF treatments \ninclude pharmaceutical, procedural or device intervention. There are several antiarrhythmic drugs approved by the FDA for the \ntreatment and/or prevention of recurrent AF. However, these drugs have safety and/or administration concerns and all but one have \ncontraindications or label warnings regarding their prescription in patients with HF. \nDrugs that are currently approved or used for the treatment or prevention of AF in HF either have not demonstrated efficacy in these \npatients, or have notable risks due to adverse side effects or lack sufficient efficacy. Therefore, in HF, and specifically in HF patients \nwith EF ≥ 40%, we believe there is a substantial unmet medical need for AF therapies that are more effective and have fewer side \neffects than those currently available. We believe that Gencaro’s treatment of AF in HF patients could provide a more effective and \nsafer pharmacotherapy than treatments currently used in these patients. \nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. We face significant competition from pharmaceutical companies and \nbiotechnology companies that are researching and selling products designed to treat cardiovascular conditions. Most of these \ncompanies have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing, and commercial resources than we have. \nIf approved, some of the drugs which Gencaro would potentially compete with are generic in the United States and are used, though \nnot approved or shown to be effective, for the treatment of AF or in HF patients with EF ≥ 40%. Gencaro could be priced at a \npremium compared to some of these therapies. In addition, Gencaro, if approved, would be prescribed in conjunction with a diagnostic \ntest, adding additional procedures to the process of prescribing Gencaro, which could make it more difficult for us to compete against \nexisting or future therapies. \nManufacturing and Product Supply \nGencaro is a small molecule drug with an established manufacturing history. Multiple manufacturers of both the active pharmaceutical \ningredients, or API, and drug product have successfully produced Gencaro for use in clinical trials over the course of its clinical \ndevelopment. We outsource all manufacturing and analytical testing of the Gencaro API and drug product. We have selected third \nparty contract manufacturing organizations on the basis of their technical and regulatory expertise. Our approach with our contract \nmanufacturing partners has been to replicate the manufacturing processes that were used to support the prior pivotal clinical trial with \nGencaro, and to minimize any changes from these baseline processes, thereby reducing technical and regulatory risk. For API \nproduction, we contracted with Groupe Novasep which completed the drug substance registration batches successfully. The resulting \ndrug substance was used to manufacture the drug product used in the clinical trial material for the Phase 2B clinical trial and is \nexpected to be used in the proposed Phase 3 clinical trial. \nFor drug product production, we have contracted with Patheon, Inc. to manufacture the Gencaro tablets. Gencaro is produced in a \ntablet form, utilizing standard solid oral dosage processing techniques. Six separate dosage strengths have been manufactured, with the \nmaximum recommended dose of 100mg twice daily. Registration batches were successfully completed by Patheon, Inc. and tablets \nfrom these runs were placed in cGMP storage to supply clinical trials. In addition, we contracted with a separate service provider for \npackaging and distribution of our clinical trial materials. \nGovernment Regulation\nGovernmental authorities in the United States at the federal, state, and local levels and foreign countries extensively regulate, among \nother things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, marketing, distribution, sampling, and \nimport and export of pharmaceutical and medical device products. In the United States, the FDA regulates these activities at the \nfederal level pursuant to the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In \nCanada, Health Canada regulates these activities. In Europe, the Competent Authorities and Ethics Committees of the respective \ncountries regulate these activities. In South America, the Health Authorities and Ethics Committees of their respective countries \nregulate these activities. We anticipate that all of our product candidates will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies \nprior to commercialization. The process of obtaining approval and the subsequent process of maintaining compliance with appropriate \nfederal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. In addition, \nthese statutes, rules, regulations and policies may change and our products may be subject to new legislation or regulations. Both \nbefore and after approval or clearance, failure to comply with the requirements of the FDA and other state and federal statutes can lead \nto significant penalties or could disrupt our ability to manufacture and sell these products. In addition, the FDA could refuse to provide \ncertificates needed to export our products if the agency determines that we are not in compliance."

      "text": "9\nPremarket Approval of Drugs \nFDA approval is required for marketing of any new drug, dosage form, indication, or strength. The steps required before new human \ntherapeutic drug products are marketed in the United States and foreign countries include rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and \nother approval requirements by regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries. There is no \nguarantee that products will be approved in a specific timeframe or at all. \nPreclinical Phase. Preclinical studies are generally conducted in the laboratory to identify potential drug candidates and to evaluate \ntheir potential efficacy and safety. These studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well \nas studies to evaluate short and long-term toxicity in animals. Preclinical studies are governed by numerous regulations, including but \nnot limited to FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices. \nClinical Phase. Before human clinical trials can commence, an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, submitted to FDA \nmust become effective. For an IND to become effective, the applicant must submit, among other things, information on design of the \nproposed investigation, reports necessary to assess the safety of the drug for use in clinical investigation, and information on the \nchemistry and manufacturing of the drug, controls available for the drug, and primary data tabulations from animal or human studies. \nThe clinical phase of development involves the performance of human studies, including adequate and well-controlled human clinical \ntrials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication. Typically, clinical evaluation involves \nthree sequential phases, which may overlap. During Phase 1, clinical trials are conducted with a relatively small number of subjects or \npatients to determine the early safety profile of a product candidate, as well as dose tolerance, absorption, and the pattern of drug \ndistribution and drug metabolism. Phase 2 trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted by a specific target disease to \ndetermine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosage tolerance and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. In \nPhase 3, larger-scale, multi- center trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a specific target disease over a longer term to \nconfirm Phase 2 results and provide reliable and conclusive data supporting efficacy and safety of a drug as required by regulatory \nagencies for drug approval. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation. FDA may delay or suspend clinical trials \nthrough clinical holds. \nNDA Submission. In the United States, the results of preclinical and clinical testing along with chemistry, manufacturing and controls \ninformation, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA. Under the current Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, after \nsubmission of an NDA and payment, or waiver, of the required fee, the FDA’s goal is to review most standard NDAs within 10 \nmonths from the time that a sponsor’s application is accepted as filed by the FDA, which can occur within a 60-day window following \nthe initial submission of the application. At the end of the 10 months, the FDA’s goal is to issue a “complete response,” or approve the \nNDA. While FDA’s goal is to issue a complete response within 10 months, the process may take longer than 10 months, particularly if \nmultiple review cycles are required. Gencaro has been granted Fast Track Designation which allows for a rolling review of a \nmarketing application. A rolling review allows FDA to consider reviewing portions of an NDA before the sponsor submits the \ncomplete application.\nIn responding to an NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval or deny the application if the FDA determines that the application \ndoes not satisfy the statutory and regulatory approval criteria. A denial may include a request for additional information, including \nadditional clinical data and/or an additional Phase 3 clinical trial. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and FDA may \ninterpret data differently than we interpret data. Under the Food and Drug Modernization Act of 1997, the FDA is authorized to \napprove a drug based on a single adequate and well-controlled study if such study and other confirmatory data are sufficient to \nestablish the drug’s effectiveness. However, it has long been the FDA’s general position that the standard of proof of a drug’s \neffectiveness generally requires at least two well-controlled and adequate Phase 3 clinical studies demonstrating statistically \nsignificant results as compared to a placebo or active control (with p-values of less than 0.05) with respect to the primary endpoint or \nendpoints of the trial. \nIn addition, in accordance with current FDA law and regulations, the FDA may refer a drug to an advisory committee for review prior \nto approval. Most new compounds are referred to an FDA advisory committee, which could add additional time to the review process. \nThere is no guarantee that the advisory committee will recommend approval of a drug candidate. In some cases, FDA may require \ncompletion, within a specified time period, of additional clinical studies after approval, referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies, to \nmonitor the effect of a new product and may prevent or limit future marketing of the product based on the results of these post-\nmarketing programs. Furthermore, prior to granting approval, the FDA generally conducts an inspection of the facilities, including \noutsourced facilities that will be involved in the manufacture, production, packaging, testing and control of the drug substance and \nfinished drug product for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements."

      "text": "10\nIf the FDA approves the NDA, the sponsor is authorized to begin commercialization of the drug in accordance with the approval. \nEven if the FDA approves the NDA, the FDA may decide later to suspend or withdraw product approval if compliance with regulatory \nstandards is not maintained or if safety problems are recognized after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA requires \nsurveillance programs to monitor approved products that have been commercialized, and the agency has the power to require \nadditional clinical studies, to require changes in labeling or to prevent further marketing of a product based on the results of these \npost-marketing programs. The FDA also has authority to request implementation of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or \nREMS, that could restrict distribution of Gencaro or require us to provide additional risk information to prescribers. Whether or not \nFDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product candidate by comparable foreign regulatory authorities is necessary prior to \nthe commencement of marketing of a product candidate in those countries. The approval procedures vary among countries and can \ninvolve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required for FDA approval. \nPost-approval Compliance. If regulatory approval for a drug or medical device is obtained, the product and the facilities \nmanufacturing the product are subject to periodic inspection and continued regulation by regulatory authorities, including compliance \nwith cGMP, as well as labeling, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, including the reporting of adverse \nevents. In addition, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and \nregulations for labeling, promotion to health care professionals, direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-\nsponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the \napproved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Companies are responsible for compliance with \nsuch requirements and would be responsible to ensure that all contract manufacturing organizations who perform work for them also \ncomply with such requirements. Similarly, if a drug manufacturer hires contract sales representatives or consultants to promote its \nproducts, such organizations or individuals must comply with all of the same requirements applicable to the drug manufacturer. The \nFDA regularly inspects companies to determine compliance with cGMPs and other post-market requirements. Failure to comply with \nstatutory requirements and the FDA’s regulations can result in a variety of administrative or enforcement actions, including but not \nlimited to an FDA Form 483 (which is issued by the FDA at the conclusions of an inspection when an investigator has observed any \nconditions that may constitute violations), a public warning letter, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, \nproduct detentions, refusal to provide export certificates, seizure of products and criminal prosecution. \nDrug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration \nAct of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, Congress created an abbreviated FDA review process for generic versions of \npioneer (brand name) drug products. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for patent term restoration and the award, in certain \ncircumstances, of non-patent marketing exclusivities. \nGeneric Drug Approval. The Hatch-Waxman Act established an abbreviated FDA review process for drugs that are shown to be \nequivalent to approved pioneer drugs. Approval for a generic drug is obtained by filing an abbreviated NDA, or ANDA. Generic drug \napplications are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, an \nANDA applicant must establish that its product is bioequivalent to an approved drug and that it is the same as the approved drug with \nrespect to active ingredient(s), route of administration, dosage form, strength and recommended conditions of use (labeling). The FDA \nwill approve the generic as suitable for an ANDA if it finds that the generic does not raise questions of safety and effectiveness as \ncompared to the pioneer drug. A drug is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the pioneer \ndrug or if it is intended for a different use. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of an approved \ndrug listed in FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or the Orange Book, must certify to the \nFDA that (i) no patent information on the drug has been listed in the Orange Book; (ii) that each patent listed in the Orange Book for \nthat approved drug has expired; (iii) FDA should approve the product on the date on which a listed patent expires; or (iv) that such \npatent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the generic drug. If the ANDA applicant \nmakes a certification pursuant to (iv) above, or a Paragraph IV certification, and the NDA holder files an infringement suit against the \nANDA applicant within 45 days of receiving the Paragraph IV notification, the NDA owner is entitled to an automatic 30-month stay \nof FDA’s ability to approve the ANDA. This 30-month stay will end early upon any decision by a court that the patent is invalid, \nunenforceable or not infringed by the generic drug. \nPatent Term Extension. While the term of a U.S. patent is generally 20 years from the earliest priority date of a patent application \n(excluding a provisional patent application), a U.S. patent that covers subject matter requiring regulatory approval to market is eligible \nfor an extension of that patent term. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides for the restoration of a portion of the patent term lost during \nproduct development and FDA review of an application. Patent Term Extension, or PTE, extends the term of an issued patent for \ngenerally (i) the length of the FDA approval process, i.e., the complete period of NDA review, and (ii) half of the time spent in clinical \ntrials, i.e., the IND period. However, the maximum period of restoration cannot exceed five years, or restore the total remaining term \nof the patent to greater than 14 years from the date of FDA approval of the product. \nUnder 35 U.S.C. § 156(a), a patent covering a method of using a product is eligible for PTE if the following conditions are met: \n1)\nthe patent has not yet expired; \n2)\nthe patent was not previously extended;"

We obtained a patent in Europe on methods for using Gencaro that is similar to \none of our US Patents and this EU patent is in force in certain countries in Europe, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, \nItaly and Spain. We believe that this patent may be eligible for an SPC, if Gencaro is approved for marketing in any European country \nin which the patent is in force, which could provide up to five years of additional patent life. We believe that our patents in other \njurisdictions may also be eligible for similar term extensions.\nNon-Patent Marketing Exclusivities. Separate and apart from patent protection, the Hatch-Waxman Act entitles approved drugs to \nvarious periods of non-patent statutory protection, known as marketing exclusivity. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides five years of \n“new chemical entity” marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a product that contains an active \nmoiety not found in any other approved product. This exclusivity means that another manufacturer cannot submit an ANDA or \n505(b)(2) NDA until the marketing exclusivity period ends. This exclusivity protects the entire new chemical entity franchise, \nincluding all products containing the active ingredient for any use and in any strength or dosage form, but will not prevent the \nsubmission or approval of stand-alone NDAs where the applicants have conducted their own clinical studies to demonstrate safety and \neffectiveness. There is an exception, however, for a competitor that seeks to challenge a patent with a Paragraph IV certification. Four \nyears into the five-year exclusivity period, a manufacturer who alleges that one or more of the patents listed with the NDA is invalid, \nunenforceable or not infringed may submit an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA for a generic or modified version of the product. \nThe Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of “new use” marketing exclusivity for the approval of NDAs, and supplements, \nwhere those applications contain the results of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) essential to the FDA’s \napproval of the applications. Such applications may be submitted for new indications, dosage forms, strengths, or new conditions of \nuse of approved products. So long as the studies are essential to the FDA’s approval or were conducted by or for the applicant, this \nthree-year exclusivity prohibits the final approval of ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for products with the specific changes associated \nwith those studies. It does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for other products containing the same \nactive ingredient, without those changes. \nSimilar non-patent market exclusivity is provided for in the EU and other international jurisdictions. We believe that, if approved in \nthe EU, Gencaro may be eligible for ten years of market exclusivity in the EU, measured from the date of approval there.\nFDA Premarket Review of Medical Devices \nUnless an exemption applies, each medical device that a company wishes to market in the United States requires either approval of a \npremarket approval application, or PMA, or clearance of a premarket notification, commonly known as a “510(k)” from the FDA. The \nFDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either class I or II, which \nmay require the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. Clearance of \na 510(k) usually requires between three months and one year from the time of submission of the 510(k), although the process may take \nlonger. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance procedure is less rigorous than the PMA approval procedure, but is available only to companies \nwho can establish that their device is substantially equivalent to a legally-marketed “predicate” device that was (i) on the market prior \nto the enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, (ii) reclassified from Class III to Class II, or (iii) has been cleared \nthrough the 510(k) procedure. 510(k)s must typically be supported by performance data, including preclinical data, bench testing, and \nin some cases, clinical data. Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the \ngreatest risks, or for which there is no predicate, are placed in class III, and require a PMA. \nPMA Pathway. Generally, a PMA must be supported by extensive data and valid scientific evidence, including, but not limited to, \ntechnical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction a reasonable assurance of the \nsafety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After a PMA is sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application \nand begin an in-depth review of the submitted information and will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing \nfacility or facilities to ensure compliance with FDA’s Quality System Regulations, or QSR. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to \nreview the “accepted application”, although, generally, review of the application can take between one and three years, and it may take \nsignificantly longer. The PMA application process can be expensive, and there is a substantial “user fee” that must be paid to FDA in \nconnection with the submission of a PMA application. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application or the manufacturing facility is \nnot favorable, the FDA may deny approval of the PMA application or issue a “not approvable” letter. The FDA may also require \nadditional clinical trials, which can delay the PMA approval process by several years. In addition, if FDA discovers that an applicant \nhas submitted false or misleading information, FDA may refuse to review submissions until certain requirements are met pursuant to \nits Application Integrity Policy, or AIP. If the FDA approves the PMA, it may place restrictions on the device. After the PMA is"

PMA supplements often must be approved by the FDA before the modification to \nthe device, the labeling, or the manufacturing process may be implemented. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive such clearances \nor approvals, the loss of previously received clearances or approvals, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory \nrequirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClinical Trials. Clinical trials are generally required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. \nThese trials generally require an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application approved in advance by the FDA for a \nspecified number of patients, unless the proposed study is deemed a non-significant risk study, which is eligible for an exemption from \nthe IDE requirements. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results. \nClinical trials may begin if the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the \nclinical trial sites. Submission of an IDE application does not give assurance that the FDA will issue the IDE. If the IDE application is \napproved, there can be no assurance the FDA will determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness \nof the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to and approved by the FDA before \na sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan in such a way that may affect its scientific soundness, study \nindication or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. The trial must also comply with the FDA’s regulations, including the \nrequirement that informed consent be obtained from each subject. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not \nadequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance to market the \nproduct in the United States.\nIn Vitro Diagnostic Companion Diagnostic Devices. FDA has described IVD companion diagnostic devices as in vitro diagnostic \ndevices that provide information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product. The use of an \nIVD companion diagnostic device with a particular therapeutic product is stipulated in the instructions for use in the labeling of both \nthe diagnostic device and the corresponding therapeutic product, as well as in the labeling of any generic equivalents of the therapeutic \nproduct. An IVD companion diagnostic device could be used to (i) identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular \ntherapeutic product; (ii) identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious adverse reactions as a result of treatment with a \nparticular therapeutic product; or (iii) monitor response to treatment for the purpose of adjusting treatment (e.g., schedule, dose, \ndiscontinuation) to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Although FDA’s regulation of IVD companion diagnostic devices is \nevolving and implemented on a case-by-case basis, FDA’s stated policy for a novel therapeutic product is that an IVD companion \ndiagnostic device should be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously to support the therapeutic product’s safe and \neffective use. The clinical performance and clinical significance of the IVD companion diagnostic device is to be established using \ndata from the clinical development program of the corresponding therapeutic product. FDA recognizes, however, that there may be \ncases where contemporaneous development may not be possible. With respect to the Gencaro Test, there is no assurance that we will \nbe able to develop and obtain approval or clearance contemporaneously with Gencaro. Failure to develop the Gencaro Test or obtain \nclearance or approval could delay approval of Gencaro, if FDA regards the Gencaro Test as an IVD companion diagnostic test that is \nessential to the safe and effective use of Gencaro. \nContinuing Regulation. After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply to the manufacturer, or holder \nof a PMA approval. Unless subject to an exemption, medical devices distributed in the United States must be manufactured in \ncompliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulations, or QSRs, and current good manufacturing practices. These regulations \ngovern the manufacturing process, including design, manufacture, testing, release, packaging, distribution, documentation and \npurchasing, as well as complaint handling, corrective and preventative actions and internal auditing. In complying with the QSRs, \nmanufacturers must expend significant time, money and effort. Companies are also subject to other post-market and general \nrequirements, including but not limited to product listing and establishment registration, post-market surveillance requirements, \nlimitations on promotion, and requirements for recordkeeping and reporting of certain adverse events, malfunctions, corrections and \nremovals. As discussed above, FDA regularly inspects companies to assess compliance with the QSRs and other post-market \nrequirements. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, and \npotential civil and criminal penalties. As part of such arrangement, we will seek to have the diagnostic company take responsibility for \ncompliance with the FDA’s device approval and on-going regulatory requirements. \nInternational Marketing Approvals. International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary \nsubstantially from country to country and are subject to change. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be \nlonger or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ. \nOther Regulatory Requirements. We are also subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating \nto safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of \nhazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection \nwith our work. The extent and character of governmental regulation that might result from future legislation or administrative action \ncannot be accurately predicted."

On January 22, 2018, legislation was enacted \nsuspending the medical device tax in 2018 and 2019. In December 2019, a permanent repeal of the medical device tax was enacted. \nThe Gencaro Test is likely to be subject to this tax if this tax is reinstated in the future.\nIntellectual Property \nThe future success of our business will partly depend on our ability to maintain market exclusivity for our product candidates, if \napproved, in the United States and important international markets, and for other products or product candidates that we may acquire \nor develop. We will rely on statutory protection, patent protection, trade secrets, know-how, and in-licensing of technology rights to \nmaintain protection for our products. \nGencaro\nWe believe that Gencaro, if approved, will have market exclusivity in the United States and in major international markets. We \nrecently obtained a patent in the United States for the use of Gencaro for the patient population we plan to study in the Phase 3 pivotal \ntrial. We have filed similar patent applications in international jurisdictions. If Gencaro is approved by the FDA or international \nregulatory agencies based on this planned clinical development, we believe that the commercialization of Gencaro will have patent \nprotection extending into 2039.\nWe have an existing patent portfolio of United States and international patents covering the use of Gencaro for various cardiovascular \nindications in the genetic population we plan to study in Phase 3, that we believe will provide additional patent protection.\nIn addition to patent protection, Gencaro will qualify as a new chemical entity and if approved will have data protection in the United \nStates and other jurisdictions in which it is approved.\nWe also have other patent rights in additional drug candidates having possible indications in cardiovascular disease, oncology, and \nother therapeutic areas; these are in both early and later stages of development. We may seek collaborators to assist us in the \ndevelopment of these candidates or we may seek to raise funds to advance the development of the compounds on our own.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nInformation relating to our executive officers is included in Item 10 of Part III of this Annual Report and such information is \nincorporated herein by reference.\nHuman Capital Management \nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 6 employees, 5 of which are full-time. None of our employees are represented by any collective \nbargaining unit. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees. \nInformation relating to compensation of our executive officers is included in Items 10 and 11 of Part III of this Annual Report and \nsuch information is incorporated herein by reference. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both \nshort-term and long-term performance. We are committed to providing comprehensive benefit options and offering benefits that will \nallow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. Some examples are employees are eligible for health \ninsurance, prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, health savings accounts, \nflexible spending accounts, paid and unpaid leaves, a retirement plan and life and disability/accident coverage. We also offer a variety \nof voluntary benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs, including hospital indemnity insurance, accident \ninsurance and critical illness insurance. \nWe continually monitor employee turnover rates as our success depends upon retaining our highly trained personnel. We believe the \ncombination of competitive compensation and career growth and development opportunities have helped increase employee tenure \nand reduce voluntary turnover. The average tenure of our employees is approximately eleven years and approximately one-half of our \nemployees have been employed by us for more than ten years.\nCorporate Information \nOn January 27, 2009, we completed a business combination, or the Merger, between Nuvelo, Inc., or Nuvelo, a corporation originally \nincorporated in 1992, and its subsidiary, ARCA biopharma, Inc. Immediately following the Merger, we changed our name from \nNuvelo, Inc. to ARCA biopharma, Inc. Our principal offices are located in Westminster, Colorado."

We do not currently have the \ncapital resources or management expertise to commercialize Gencaro, rNAPc2 or any of our other product candidates and, as a result, \nwill need to complete a strategic transaction, or, alternatively, raise substantial additional funds to enable commercialization of \nGencaro, rNAPc2 or any of our other product candidates, if approved. Failure to successfully provide for the commercialization of \nGencaro, rNAPc2 or any other product candidate, if approved, would damage our business. \nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our future clinical trial of Gencaro, any potential enrollment milestones or \npotential regulatory approvals could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nWe may encounter difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials, due to circumstances which are outside our \ncontrol, including other clinical trials that may limit the availability of study participants. As a result, we may need to delay or \nterminate our trial, which would have a negative impact on our business. Delays in enrolling patients in the clinical trial would also \nadversely affect our ability to meet projected enrollment milestones or timelines for completing the study and obtaining regulatory \napproval. \nOur clinical trials from our product candidates may not yield results that will enable us to further develop our products as a \ntherapy and obtain regulatory approvals necessary to be used as a drug.\nWe will receive regulatory approval for our product candidates only if we can demonstrate, in carefully designed and conducted \nclinical trials, that the product candidate is safe and effective. We do not know whether any future clinical trials for Gencaro, rNAPc2 \nor any other product candidate will demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals or will result \nin marketable products.\nThe results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results from later studies. We may suffer \nsignificant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier studies. Based on results at any stage of \nclinical trials, we may decide to repeat or redesign a trial or discontinue development of one or more of our product candidates.

If we are delayed in obtaining \nfunding or are unable to complete a strategic transaction, we may discontinue our development activities on Gencaro, rNAPc2 and our \nother product candidates or discontinue our operations.

Our review of our strategic options may impact this projection. Conducting a Phase 3 PRECISION-AF trial or \nrNAPc2 clinical trial would likely require additional financing. On July 22, 2020, we entered into a new sales agreement with a \nplacement agent to sell, from time to time, our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $54.0 million, in an “at the \nmarket offering.” As of December 30, 2022, we sold an aggregate of 9,928,272 shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of \nsuch sales agreement for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $54.0 million. Net proceeds received in this offering were \napproximately $52.2 million, after deducting expenses for executing the “at the market offering” and commissions paid to the \nplacement agent. In April 2021, we amended the new sales agreement and have $50.0 million available for the offering under our \nprospectus to our registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-254585). As of February 22, 2023, the amount available for the \noffering under the prospectus supplement is subject to the limitation of not selling a total value amount of shares exceeding more than \none-third of our public float in any 12-month period, which as of February 22,2023 would have been approximately $8.8 million. \nSales of our common stock dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders and may cause the price per share of our common stock \nto decrease. Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower than we currently anticipate. We \nhave based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner \nthan we currently anticipate.\nAdditionally, in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. This outbreak is \ncausing major disruptions to businesses and markets worldwide as the virus spreads. The economic uncertainty surrounding the \nCOVID-19 pandemic may dramatically reduce our ability to secure equity or debt financing necessary to support our operations. We \nare unable to currently estimate the financial effect of the pandemic.

If we raise \nadditional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, the obligations related to such indebtedness would be senior to rights of \nholders of our capital stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. We also cannot predict what consideration \nmight be available, if any, to us or our stockholders, in connection with any strategic transaction. Should strategic alternatives or \nadditional capital not be available to us, or not be available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to realize value from our assets and \ndischarge our liabilities in the normal course of business which may, among other alternatives, cause us to further delay, substantially \nreduce or discontinue operational activities to conserve our cash resources. \nWe have received an SPA agreement from the FDA relating to our planned Phase 3 program for Gencaro. This SPA agreement \ndoes not guarantee approval of Gencaro or any other particular outcome from regulatory review. \nIn 2019, we received an SPA agreement from the FDA for our planned Phase 3 clinical trial of Gencaro. The FDA’s SPA process is \ndesigned to facilitate the FDA’s review and approval of drugs by allowing the FDA to evaluate the proposed design and size of certain \nclinical trials that are intended to form the primary basis for determining a drug product’s efficacy. Upon specific request by a clinical \ntrial sponsor, the FDA will evaluate the protocol and respond to a sponsor’s questions regarding, among other things, primary efficacy \nendpoints, trial conduct and data analysis, within 45 days of receipt of the request. The FDA ultimately assesses whether the protocol \ndesign and planned analysis of the trial are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to the \neffectiveness of the indication studied. All agreements and disagreements between the FDA and the sponsor regarding a SPA must be \nclearly documented in a SPA letter or the minutes of a meeting between the sponsor and the FDA.\nHowever, an SPA agreement does not guarantee approval of a product candidate, even if the trial is conducted in accordance with the \nprotocol. Moreover, the FDA may revoke or alter our SPA agreement in certain circumstances. In particular, a SPA agreement is not \nbinding on the FDA if public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the SPA agreement, other new scientific \nconcerns regarding product safety or efficacy arise, we fail to comply with the agreed upon trial protocols, or the relevant data, \nassumptions or information provided by us in our request for the SPA change or are found to be false or omit relevant facts. In \naddition, even after an SPA agreement is finalized, the SPA agreement may be modified, and such modification will be deemed \nbinding on the FDA review division, except under the circumstances described above, if the FDA and the sponsor agree in writing to \nmodify the protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study. The FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in \ninterpreting the terms of the SPA agreement and the data and results from any study that is the subject of the SPA agreement.\nEven though we obtained an agreement on our SPA, we cannot assure you that our planned Phase 3 clinical trial will succeed, will be \ndeemed binding by the FDA under our SPA agreement, or will result in any FDA approval for Gencaro. We may also alter the design \nof the trial to focus on endpoints that are not covered by the SPA. Moreover, if the FDA revokes or alters its agreement under our \nSPA, or interprets the data collected from the clinical trial differently than we do, the FDA may not deem the data sufficient to support \nan application for regulatory approval, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of \noperations."

To maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq \nCapital Market we are required to meet certain listing requirements, including, among others, (i) a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 \nper share, (ii) a market value of publicly held shares (excluding shares held by our executive officers, directors and 10% or more \nstockholders) of at least $1 million and (iii) either: (x) stockholders’ equity of at least $2.5 million; or (y) a total market value of listed \nsecurities of at least $35 million. \nWe have received three potential delisting notices from Nasdaq since 2012. In each of 2012, 2015 and 2018, we received notification \nfrom Nasdaq of potential delisting of our shares from the Nasdaq Capital Market because the closing bid price of our common stock \nhad not met the minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share during the preceding 30 business days. We subsequently regained \ncompliance with Nasdaq’s minimum closing bid price requirements related to the 2012, 2015 and 2018 notices, by effecting a 1-for-6 \nreverse split of our common stock in March 2013, a 1-for-7 reverse split of our common stock in September 2015 and a 1-for-18 \nreverse split of our common stock in April 2019. Despite effecting a 1-for-18 reverse split of our common stock in April 2019, there \ncan be no assurance that the market price per share of our common stock will remain in excess of the $1.00 minimum bid price for a \nsustained period of time. The continuing effect of our reverse stock split on the market price of our common stock cannot be predicted \nwith any certainty, and the history of similar stock split combinations for companies in like circumstances is varied. It is possible that \nthe per share price of our common stock after the reverse stock split will not rise in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares \nof common stock outstanding resulting from the reverse stock split, effectively reducing our market capitalization, and there can be no \nassurance that the market price per post-reverse split share will either exceed or remain in excess of the $1.00 minimum bid price for a \nsustained period of time. The market price of our common stock may vary based on other factors that are unrelated to the number of \nshares outstanding, including our future performance.\nThe delisting of our common stock from a national exchange could impair the liquidity and market price of the common stock. It \ncould also materially, adversely affect our access to the capital markets, and any limitation on market liquidity or reduction in the \nprice of the common stock as a result of that delisting could adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at \nall. \nIn future periods, if we do not meet the minimum stockholders’ equity, minimum closing bid price requirements, or any other listing \nrequirements, we would be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market. \nAs of February 22, 2023, the closing price of our common stock was $2.12 per share, and the total market value of our listed securities \nwas approximately $30.5 million. As of December 31, 2022, we had stockholders’ equity of $41.7 million. \nOur audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 were prepared assuming that we will continue as a \ngoing concern. Our management has concluded that due to our need for additional capital, and the uncertainties surrounding our \nability to raise such funding, there may be uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern in future years.\nOur audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 were prepared assuming that we will continue as a going \nconcern. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that we will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be able \nto realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business and do not include any \nadjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of \nliabilities that may result from our inability to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2019, our management and our \nindependent registered public accounting firm concluded that, due to our need for additional capital and the uncertainties surrounding \nour ability to raise such funding, substantial doubt existed as to our ability to continue as a going concern for a period from one year \nafter our annual financial statements had been issued. We believe our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 will be \nsufficient to fund our operations through the middle of fiscal year 2024. Our review of our strategic options may impact this \nprojection. Conducting the Phase 3 PRECISION-AF trial or Phase 3 rNAPc2 clinical trial would likely require additional financing. \nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to make any other sale of our common stock in any future offering to cover our future \ncapital needs, or at all. Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower than we currently \nanticipate. If we are delayed in completing or are unable to complete additional funding and/or a strategic transaction, we may \ndiscontinue our development activities or operations, but there are no assurances that these reductions would be sufficient to allow us \nto continue to operate as a going concern. Therefore, even if we resolve this uncertainty, our independent registered public accountants \nand/or management could conclude that uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern could exist at a future date."

We may be forced to reduce our operating expenses and raise additional funds to meet our \nworking capital needs, principally through the additional sales of our securities or debt financings. However, we cannot guarantee that \nwe will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms \nsatisfactory to us. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital or complete a strategic transaction, we may be unable to \ncontinue to fund our operations, develop Gencaro, rNAPc2 or our other product candidates, or realize value from our assets and \ndischarge our liabilities in the normal course of business. If we cannot raise sufficient funds, we may have to liquidate our assets, and \nmight realize significantly less than the values at which they are carried on our financial statements, and stockholders may lose all or \npart of their investment in our securities. \nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic, in \nregions where we or third parties on which we rely may have clinical trial sites or other business operations. We anticipate having \nclinical trial sites in countries that have been directly affected by COVID-19 and depend on third party manufacturing operations \nfor various stages of our supply chain. \nOur business could be adversely affected by health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in regions where we may \nhave concentrations of future clinical trial sites or other business operations.\nIf the recent COVID-19 outbreak continues to spread, we may need to further limit operations or implement limitations, including \nwork-from-home policies. There is a risk that other countries or regions may be less effective at containing COVID-19, or it may be \nmore difficult to contain if the outbreak reaches a larger population or broader geography, in which case the risks described herein \ncould be elevated significantly.\nIn addition, third party manufacturing of our drug product candidates and suppliers of the materials used in the production of our drug \nproduct candidates may be impacted by significant delays or restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak which may disrupt \nour supply chain or limit our ability to manufacture drug product candidates for our clinical trials. \nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak or a similar future health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do \nnot yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global \neconomy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the \nCOVID-19 situation closely.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in any future clinical trials, our future trials could be delayed or otherwise adversely \naffected. \nIf we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients in any future clinical trial, we may need to delay or terminate our trial, \nwhich would have a negative impact on our business. Delays in enrolling patients in any future clinical trials would also adversely \naffect our ability to generate any product, milestone and royalty revenues under collaboration agreements, if any, and could impose \nsignificant additional costs on us or on any future collaborators.\nDevelopment beyond our control, such as the development of vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 virus or the development of other \ntherapies for COVID-19 disease, may impact our ability to enroll patients in any future rNAPc2 (AB201) clinical trials. Enrollment \nfor the rNAPc2 (AB201) Phase 2b clinical trial was slower than expected.\nThe GENETIC-AF clinical trial required that we identify and enroll a large number of patients with the condition under investigation \nand the trial enrolled only those patients having a specific genotype, and certain patients who have or are willing to have a Medtronic \ndevice implanted for monitoring and recording AFB data. As a result, enrollment for GENETIC-AF was slower than expected, with \nour first patient enrolled in June 2014 and enrollment completed in August 2017. Because of the rigorous enrollment criteria, our \nclinical trial timelines were delayed from our original projections. We anticipate that any future Phase 3 clinical trial of Gencaro, \nincluding PRECISION-AF, may have similar enrollment criteria, and we cannot guarantee that we will not have similar enrollment \nissues in any future clinical trials.\nWe may also encounter difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients in any future clinical trial, due to circumstances which are \noutside our control, including as a result of deteriorating market conditions due to investor concerns regarding inflation and continued \nhostilities between Russia and Ukraine. See “Our business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including \nthe ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic, in regions where we or third parties on which we rely have clinical trial sites or other \nbusiness operations. We anticipate having clinical trial sites in countries that have been directly affected by COVID-19 and depend on \nthird party manufacturing operations for various stages of our supply chain” for a discussion of the risks that the COVID-19 pandemic \nposes to, among other things, our anticipated clinical trials."

We previously contracted with a CRO to conduct components of our \nGENETIC-AF clinical trial and anticipate contracting with a CRO to conduct components of any future clinical trial for Gencaro and \ncomponents of the clinical study of rNAPc2 or any future clinical trials for our other product candidates. As a result, we will have less \ncontrol over many details and steps of any clinical trial, the timing and completion of any clinical trial, the required reporting of \nadverse events and the management of data developed through any clinical trial than would be the case if we were relying entirely \nupon our own staff. Communicating with outside parties can also be challenging, potentially leading to mistakes as well as difficulties \nin coordinating activities. Outside parties, such as CROs, may have staffing difficulties, may undergo changes in priorities or may \nbecome financially distressed, adversely affecting their willingness or ability to conduct our clinical trial. We may experience \nunexpected cost increases that are beyond our control. Problems with the timeliness or quality of the work of a CRO may lead us to \nseek to terminate the relationship and use an alternative service provider. However, making any change may be costly and may delay \nongoing trials, if any, and contractual restrictions may make such a change difficult or impossible. Additionally, it may be impossible \nto find a replacement organization that can conduct clinical trials in an acceptable manner and at an acceptable cost.  \nEven though we anticipate relying on CROs in the future, we will likely have to devote substantial resources and rely on the expertise \nof our employees to manage the work being done by the CROs. Due to our limited experience in managing clinical trials, we cannot \nguarantee our employees will do so effectively. \nWe expect to depend on existing and future collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product \ncandidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to complete the development of these product candidates. \nWe collaborated with one or more clinical trial networks in our development program for rNAPc2. As a result, we lacked direct \ncontrol over certain aspects of the development program and the amount and timing of resources that these collaborators devote to the \nproject.  \nWe had a collaboration agreement with Medtronic that supported our GENETIC-AF clinical trial. If our arrangement with Medtronic, \nas amended, is continued as part of our future development of Gencaro, we will have limited control over the amount and timing of \nresources that they dedicate to the development of Gencaro. This is also likely to be true in any future collaboration with third parties \nand we may seek additional third party collaborators for the development of Gencaro, rNAPc2 or any other product candidates. Our \nability to benefit from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators’ abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to \nthem in these arrangements. \nCollaborations involving our product candidates pose the following risks to us: \n•\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these \ncollaborations; \n•\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue \nor renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborator’s strategic \nfocus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities; \n•\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or \nabandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for \nclinical testing; \n•\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with \nour product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed \nor can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours; \n•\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information \nin such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to \npotential litigation; \n•\ndisputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or \ncommercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management \nattention and resources; \n•\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further \ndevelopment or commercialization of the applicable product candidates;"

Collaborations are complex and any potential discussions may \nnot result in a definitive agreement for many reasons. For example, whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will \ndepend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator’s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the \nproposed collaboration, and the proposed collaborator’s evaluation of a number of factors, such as the design or results of our clinical \ntrials, the potential market for our product candidates, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering our product \ncandidates to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to ownership or the coverage of \nour intellectual property, and industry and market conditions generally. If we were to determine that additional collaborations for our \nGencaro development is necessary and were unable to enter into such collaborations on acceptable terms, we might elect to delay or \nscale back the development or commercialization of Gencaro in order to preserve our financial resources or to allow us adequate time \nto develop the required physical resources and systems and expertise ourselves. \nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of our product candidates in the most efficient manner, \nor at all. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies \nthat have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. If a present or future collaborator of ours were to be involved \nin a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be \ndelayed, diminished or terminated. \nAny future clinical trial for Gencaro will require the use of a third-party diagnostic services provider to administer a genetic test \nneeded to identify the patient receptor genotypes of clinical trial participants, and as a result, we will be unable to directly control \nthe timing, conduct and expense of the genetic test. \nWe anticipate that any future clinical trial of Gencaro, if any, will require a companion diagnostic test that identifies the patient’s \nreceptor genotype. The trial would only enroll those patients with the receptor that has the potential for enhanced efficacy, the beta-1 \n389 Arg receptor as detected by a beta-1 389 Arg/Arg genotype. Accordingly, we anticipate that any future clinical trial for Gencaro \nwill require the use of a third-party diagnostic service to perform the genetic testing. There has been limited experience in our industry \nin prospective development of companion diagnostics required to perform the required molecular profiling. We entered into an \nagreement with LabCorp to provide the diagnostic services of the genetic test needed to support our GENETIC-AF clinical trial. To \nprovide those services, LabCorp obtained from the FDA an investigational device exemption, or IDE, for the companion diagnostic \ntest being used in our GENETIC-AF clinical trial. We would expect a similar agreement and approval would be necessary for any \ncompanion diagnostic used in any future clinical trials for Gencaro.\nThe FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States regulate companion diagnostics. Companion diagnostics require \nseparate or coordinated regulatory approval prior to commercialization. Changes to regulatory advice could delay our development \nprograms or delay or prevent eventual marketing approval for our product candidates that may otherwise be approvable. In July 2011, \nthe FDA issued draft guidance that stated that if safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, the FDA \ngenerally will not approve the therapeutic unless the FDA approves or clears this “in vitro companion diagnostic device” at the same \ntime that the FDA approves the therapeutic. The approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic would occur through the FDA’s \nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health. In 2014, the FDA issued guidance on in vitro companion diagnostic devices. The \nguidance allows for flexibility by the FDA in the case of therapeutic products to treat serious conditions for which no alternative \ntreatment exists and the benefits of using the companion diagnostic outweigh the risk, but it is unclear how this discretion may be \napplied by the agency with respect to the companion diagnostic test related to any Gencaro clinical trials. The FDA’s evolving \nposition on the topic of companion diagnostics could affect our clinical development programs that utilize companion diagnostics. In \nparticular, the FDA may limit our ability to use retrospective data, otherwise disagree with our approaches to trial design, biomarker \nqualification, clinical and analytical validity, and clinical utility, or make us repeat aspects of a trial or initiate new trials."

      "text": "24\nGiven our limited experience in developing diagnostics, we expect to rely primarily on third parties for the design and manufacture of \nthe companion diagnostics for our product candidates. If we, or any third parties that we engage to assist us, are unable to successfully \ndevelop companion diagnostics for our product candidates that require such diagnostics, or experience delays in doing so, the \ndevelopment of our product candidates may be adversely affected, our product candidates may not receive marketing approval and we \nmay not realize the full commercial potential of any products that receive marketing approval. As a result, our business could be \nmaterially harmed. \nWe will need to establish a collaborative arrangement with a third-party diagnostics services provider to obtain marketing \nclearance or approval of the companion genetic test for Gencaro. There is no guarantee that the FDA will grant timely clearance \nor approval of the genetic test, if at all, and failure to obtain such timely clearance or approval would adversely affect our ability to \nmarket Gencaro. \nThe drug label we intend to seek for Gencaro would identify the patient receptor genotype for which the drug is approved. \nAccordingly, we believe developing a genetic test that is simple to administer and widely available will be critical to the successful \ncommercialization of Gencaro. The genetic test will be subject to regulation by the FDA and by comparable agencies in various \nforeign countries. The process of complying with the requirements of the FDA and comparable agencies is costly, time consuming and \nburdensome. \nDespite the time and expense expended, regulatory clearance or approval is never guaranteed. If regulatory clearance or approval is \ndelayed, or if one or more third-party diagnostic services providers are unable to obtain FDA approval of the genetic test at all or in \nparallel with the approval of Gencaro, or are unable to commercialize the test successfully and in a manner that effectively supports \nthe commercial efforts for Gencaro, or if the information concerning the differential response to Gencaro resulting from certain \ngenetic variation is not included in the approval label for Gencaro, the commercial launch of Gencaro may be significantly and \nadversely affected. \nRegulatory approval is required for the genetic test to be used in our Gencaro clinical trials and to support the commercialization \nof the test, if approved. Delays or failures in obtaining such regulatory approval, including any required validation analyses may \nprevent a third-party diagnostics provider from commercializing such genetic test and will adversely affect our business, operating \nresults and prospects. \nBefore a genetic test can be used commercially, including in conjunction with Gencaro, if it is approved for marketing, the third-party \ndiagnostics provider must obtain FDA Premarket Approval, or PMA, for such test. The FDA may require additional validation of the \ngenetic test we used in GENETIC-AF prior to any approval of Gencaro or the genetic test or prior to the use of such test in any future \nclinical trials for Gencaro. We anticipate the genetic test will be required as a condition to prescribing Gencaro. There is no guarantee \nthe FDA will approve the anticipated PMA submission for the genetic test. Even if the genetic test is eventually approved, performing \nadditional validation work necessary to support the PMA, if required, for current or future genetic test products, including one \nassociated with Gencaro, would require additional time and expense and the outcome would be uncertain. Moreover, such delays or \nincreased costs or failures could adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects for commercializing the genetic test.\nIf a third-party diagnostics provider responsible for the genetic test associated with Gencaro or certain of its third-party suppliers \nfails to comply with ongoing FDA or other foreign regulatory authority requirements, or if there are unanticipated problems with \nthe genetic test, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from use in a trial or from the market. \nAny diagnostic for which a third-party diagnostics provider obtains clearance or approval, and the manufacturing processes, reporting \nrequirements, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continued regulatory review, \noversight and periodic inspections by the FDA and other domestic and foreign regulatory bodies. With respect to the genetic test, to \nthe extent applicable, any third-party diagnostics provider and certain of its suppliers will be required to comply with the FDA’s \nQuality System Regulation, or QSR, and International Standards Organization, or ISO, requirements which cover the methods and \ndocumentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product \nfor which clearance or approval is obtained. Regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, enforce the QSR and other regulations through \nperiodic inspections. The failure by a third-party diagnostics provider, or certain of its third-party manufacturers or suppliers, as the \ncase may be, to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or the failure to \ntimely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, could result in, among other things, \nenforcement actions. If any of these actions were to occur, it could harm our reputation and cause product sales and profitability of \nGencaro, if approved, to suffer and may prevent us from generating revenue or utilizing the genetic test further in any clinical trial. \nEven if regulatory clearance or approval is granted, such clearance or approval may be subject to limitations on the intended uses for \nwhich the product may be marketed and reduce our potential to successfully commercialize the product and generate revenue from the \nproduct."

      "text": "25\nFuture sales of Gencaro may suffer if its marketplace acceptance is negatively affected by the genetic test. \nThe genetic test is an important component of the commercial strategy for Gencaro in addition to being required for our clinical trials. \nWe believe that the genetic test helps predict patient response to Gencaro, and that this aspect of the drug is important to its ability to \ncompete effectively with current therapies. The genetic test adds an additional step in the prescribing process, an additional cost for \nthe patient and payors, the risk that the test results may not be rapidly available and the possibility that it may not be available at all to \nhospitals and medical centers. Although we anticipate that Gencaro, if approved in a timely manner, would be the first genetically-\ntargeted cardiovascular drug, Gencaro will be one of a number of successful drugs in the beta-blocker class currently on the market. \nPrescribers may be more familiar with these other beta-blockers, and may be resistant to prescribing Gencaro as an AF therapy in \npatients with HF. For instance, the top-line results of our Phase 2B GENETIC-AF clinical trial indicated that Gencaro demonstrated a \nsimilar treatment benefit compared to the active comparator, metoprolol succinate (TOPROL-XL). If our future clinical trials in \nGencaro do not show that Gencaro has a clear therapeutic benefit as compared to other drugs in the beta-blocker class currently on the \nmarket, then prescribers may be unlikely to prescribe Gencaro to patients, even if approved. Any one of these factors could affect \nprescriber behavior, which in turn may substantially impede market acceptance of the genetic test, which could cause significant harm \nto Gencaro’s ability to compete, and in turn harm our business. \nUnless we are able to generate sufficient product revenue, we will continue to incur losses from operations and will not achieve or \nmaintain profitability. We are years away from commercializing a product and generating product revenue. \nOur historical losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders’ equity and working capital, among \nother things. We are years away from commercializing a product and generating any product revenue. As a result, we expect to \ncontinue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. Even if we ultimately receive regulatory approval for Gencaro, \nrNAPc2 or our other product candidates, sales of such products may not generate sufficient revenue for it to achieve or maintain \nprofitability. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing therapeutic drugs, we may experience larger \nthan expected future losses and may never reach profitability. \nOur product candidates are subject to extensive regulation, which can be costly and time-consuming, and unsuccessful or delayed \nregulatory approvals could increase our future development costs or impair our future revenue. \nThe preclinical and clinical development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, and subsequent \nadvertising, promotion, sale, marketing, and distribution, if approved, of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by \nthe FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and elsewhere. These regulations also vary in important, meaningful \nways from country to country. We are not permitted to market a potential drug in the United States until we receive approval of an \nNDA from the FDA for such drug. We have not received an NDA approval from the FDA for Gencaro, rNAPc2 or any of our other \nproduct candidates. There can be no guarantees with respect to our product candidates that clinical studies will adequately support an \nNDA, that the products will receive necessary regulatory approvals, or that they will prove to be commercially successful. \nTo receive regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any product candidates, we must demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans \nto the satisfaction of regulatory authorities through preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials of the product \ncandidates. This process is expensive and can take many years, and failure can occur at any stage of the testing. Our failure to \nadequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates will prevent regulatory approval and commercialization of \nsuch products. \nIn 2008, we submitted and the FDA accepted our NDA filing for Gencaro for the treatment of chronic HF. In 2009, the FDA issued a \nComplete Response Letter, or CRL, in which the FDA stated that it could not approve the Gencaro NDA in its current form and \nspecified actions required for approval of the NDA, including conducting an additional Phase 3 clinical trial of Gencaro in patients \nwith HF. We completed a Phase 2B clinical study of Gencaro in HF patients to assess its efficacy in reducing or preventing AF. We \nenrolled 267 HF patients with AF in the Phase 2B clinical trial. We reported top-line Phase 2B data in February 2018. In the third \nquarter of 2018, we submitted a SPA to the FDA for a Phase 3 clinical trial. In 2019, the FDA approved our SPA request for a Phase 3 \nclinical trial of Gencaro. Even though the FDA approved our SPA, this product candidate will require years of additional clinical \ndevelopment. Even if we conduct additional studies in accordance with our SPA agreement or further FDA guidance and submit or \nfile a new or amended NDA, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval."

Our \ninability to successfully initiate and effectively complete clinical trials for any product candidate on schedule, or at all, will severely \nharm our business. Significant delays in clinical development could materially increase product development costs or allow our \ncompetitors to bring products to market before we do, impairing our ability to effectively commercialize any future product candidate. \nWe do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, will need to be redesigned or will be completed on schedule, if at \nall. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including: \n•\n delays or failures in obtaining regulatory authorization to commence a trial because of safety concerns of regulators \nrelating to our product candidates or similar product candidates of our competitors or failure to follow regulatory \nguidelines; \n•\ndelays or failures in obtaining clinical materials and manufacturing sufficient quantities of the product candidates for use \nin trials; \n•\nfailure of clinical materials to meet pre-established specifications at product release or during ongoing stability studies; \n•\ndelays or failures in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective study sites; \n•\ndelays or failures in obtaining approval of our clinical trial protocol from an institutional review board to conduct a \nclinical trial at a prospective study site; \n•\ndelays in recruiting patients to participate in a clinical trial, which may be due to the size of the patient population, \neligibility criteria, protocol design, perceived risks and benefits of the drug, availability of other approved and standard of \ncare therapies or, availability of clinical trial sites; \n•\nother clinical trials seeking to enroll subjects with similar profile; \n•\nfailure of our clinical trials and clinical investigators to be in compliance with GCP; \n•\nunforeseen safety issues, including negative results from ongoing preclinical studies; \n•\ninability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment; \n•\ndifficulty recruiting and monitoring multiple study sites;\n•\nfailure of our third-party contract research organizations, clinical site organizations and other clinical trial managers, to \nsatisfy their contractual duties, comply with regulations or meet expected deadlines; and \n•\nan insufficient number of patients who have, or are willing to have, a Medtronic device implanted for monitoring and \nrecording AF burden data.\nIn addition, any approvals we may obtain may not cover all of the clinical indications for which we seek approval or permit us to \nmake claims of superiority over currently marketed competitive products. Also, an approval might contain significant limitations in \nthe form of narrow indications, warnings, precautions or contraindications with respect to conditions of use. If the FDA determines \nthat a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks, we may \nbe required to include as part of the NDA a proposed REMS that may include a package insert directed to patients, a plan for \ncommunication with healthcare providers, restrictions on a drug’s distribution, or a Medication Guide, to provide better information to \nconsumers about the drug’s risks and benefits. Finally, an approval could be conditioned on our commitment to conduct further \nclinical trials, which we may not have the resources to conduct or which may negatively impact our financial situation. \nThe manufacture and analytical testing of Gencaro and rNAPc2 is performed by third party suppliers, who must also meet cGMP \nrequirements and pass a pre-approval inspection of their facilities before we can obtain marketing approval."

      "text": "27\nAll of our product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development. The results from preclinical animal testing \nand early human clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in later human clinical trials. Further, although a new product \nmay show promising results in preclinical or early human clinical trials, it may subsequently prove unfeasible or impossible to \ngenerate sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals. The data obtained from preclinical and clinical \nstudies are susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval, and the FDA and other \nregulatory authorities in the United States and elsewhere exercise substantial discretion in the drug approval process. The numbers, \nsize and design of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA or other regulatory approval will vary depending \non the product candidate, the disease or condition for which the product candidate is intended to be used and the regulations and \nguidance documents applicable to any particular product candidate. The FDA or other regulators can delay, limit or deny approval of \nany product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to: \n•\nside effects; \n•\nsafety and efficacy; \n•\ndefects in the design of clinical trials; \n•\nthe fact that the FDA or other regulatory officials may not approve our or our third party manufacturer’s processes or \nfacilities; or \n•\nthe fact that new regulations may be enacted by the FDA or other regulators may change their approval policies or adopt \nnew regulations requiring new or different evidence of safety and efficacy for the intended use of a product candidate. \nIn light of widely publicized events concerning the safety of certain drug products, regulatory authorities, members of Congress, the \nGovernment Accountability Office, medical professionals and the general public have raised concerns about potential drug safety \nissues. These events have resulted in the withdrawal of certain drug products, revisions to certain drug labeling that further limit use of \nthe drug products and establishment of risk management programs that may, for instance, restrict distribution of drug products. The \nincreased attention to drug safety issues may result in a more cautious approach by the FDA to clinical trials and approval. Data from \nclinical trials may receive greater scrutiny with respect to safety and the product’s risk/benefit profile, which may make the FDA or \nother regulatory authorities more likely to terminate clinical trials before completion, or require longer or additional clinical trials that \nmay result in substantial additional expense, and a delay or failure in obtaining approval or approval for a more limited indication than \noriginally sought. Aside from issues concerning the quality and sufficiency of submitted preclinical and clinical data, the FDA may be \nconstrained by limited resources from reviewing and determining the approvability of the Gencaro NDA in a timely manner. \nIn pursuing clinical development of Gencaro for an AF indication, we will be required to amend the Gencaro HF NDA or prepare a \nnew NDA. The FDA could approve Gencaro, but without including some or all of the prescribing information that we have requested. \nFor instance, the FDA could approve Gencaro for AF in a more limited patient population or include additional warnings in the drug’s \nlabel. This, in turn, could substantially and detrimentally impact our ability to successfully commercialize Gencaro and effectively \nprotect our intellectual property rights in Gencaro.\nIf our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we would be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and restrictions, \nwhich may result in significant expenses and limit our ability to develop and commercialize other potential products. \nIf a product candidate of ours is approved by the FDA or by another regulatory authority, we would be held to extensive regulatory \nrequirements over product manufacturing, testing, distribution, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting and other reporting to \nregulatory authorities, storage, advertising, marketing, promotion, distribution, and record keeping. Regulatory approvals may also be \nsubject to significant limitations on the indicated uses or marketing of the product candidates. Potentially costly follow-up or post-\nmarketing clinical studies may be required as a condition of approval to further substantiate safety or efficacy, or to investigate \nspecific issues of interest to the regulatory authority. Previously unknown problems with the product candidate, including adverse \nevents of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in additional regulatory controls or restrictions on the marketing or use of the \nproduct or the need for post marketing studies, and could include suspension or withdrawal of the products from the market. \nFurthermore, our third-party manufacturers and the manufacturing facilities that they use to make our product candidates are regulated \nby the FDA. Quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. Drug manufacturers \nand their subcontractors are required to register their facilities and products manufactured annually with the FDA and certain state \nagencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, state and/or other foreign authorities. Any subsequent \ndiscovery of problems with a product, or a manufacturing or laboratory facility used by us or our collaborators, may result in \nrestrictions on the product, or on the manufacturing or laboratory facility, including a withdrawal of the drug from the market or \nsuspension of manufacturing. Any changes to an approved product, including the way it is manufactured or promoted, often require \nFDA approval before the product, as modified, can be marketed. We and our third-party manufacturers will also be subject to ongoing \nFDA requirements for submission of safety and other post-market information."

Violations of these laws and regulations, including promotion of our products for unapproved uses or \nfailing to disclose risk information, are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions and may result in the issuance of enforcement letters \nor other enforcement action by the FDA, U.S. Department of Justice, state agencies, or foreign regulatory authorities that could \njeopardize our ability to market the product. \nIn addition to the FDA, state or foreign regulations, the marketing of our drug products by us or our collaborators will be regulated by \nfederal, state or foreign laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” such as the federal anti-kickback law prohibiting bribes, \nkickbacks or other remuneration for the order or recommendation of items or services reimbursed by federal health care programs. \nMany states have similar laws applicable to items or services reimbursed by commercial insurers. Violations of these laws are \npunishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and \nstate health care programs, including the Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Affairs healthcare programs. Because of the far-reaching \nnature of these laws, we may be required to discontinue one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws. Healthcare \nfraud and abuse regulations are complex, and even minor irregularities can potentially give rise to claims that a statute or prohibition \nhas been violated. Any violations of these laws, or any action against us for violations of these laws, even if we successfully defend \nagainst it, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nWe could also become subject to false claims litigation under federal statutes, which can lead to civil money penalties, restitution, \ncriminal fines and imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care \nprograms. These false claims statutes include the False Claims Act, which allows any person to bring a suit on behalf of the federal \ngovernment alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims, or causing to present such false or fraudulent claims, under federal \nprograms or contracts claims or other violations of the statute and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines \nor settlement. These suits against pharmaceutical companies have increased significantly in volume and breadth in recent years. Some \nof these suits have been brought on the basis of certain sales practices promoting drug products for unapproved uses. This new growth \nin litigation has increased the risk that a pharmaceutical company will have to defend a false claim action, pay fines or restitution, or \nbe excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs and other federal and state healthcare programs as a result of an \ninvestigation arising out of such action. We may become subject to such litigation and, if we are not successful in defending against \nsuch actions, those actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could \nalso become subject to false claims litigation and consumer protection claims under state statutes, which also could lead to civil \nmonetary penalties, restitution, criminal fines and imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in state health care programs. Of \nnote, over the past few years there has been an increased focus on the sales and marketing practices of the pharmaceutical industry at \nboth the federal and state level. Additionally, the law or regulatory policies governing pharmaceuticals may change. New statutory \nrequirements may be enacted or additional regulations may be adopted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product \ncandidates or limit our ability to commercialize our products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse \ngovernment regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or elsewhere. \nIf we, our collaborators or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements, our \nbusiness could be seriously harmed because a regulatory agency may: \n•\nissue untitled or warning letters; \n•\nsuspend or withdraw our regulatory approval for approved products; \n•\nseize or detain products or recommend a product recall of a drug or medical device, or issue a mandatory recall of a \nmedical device; \n•\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us; \n•\nsuspend our ongoing clinical trials; \n•\nrestrict our operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements, or restrict the sale, marketing and/or distribution \nof our products; \n•\nseek an injunction; \n•\npursue criminal prosecutions; \n•\nclose the facilities of our contract manufacturers; or \n•\nimpose civil or criminal penalties."

If we are required to establish a direct sales force in the United States and are unable to do so, our business may be \nharmed. \nCommercialization of Gencaro, rNAPc2 or any other product candidate, if approved, particularly the establishment of a sales \norganization, will require substantial additional capital resources. We currently intend to pursue a strategic partnership alternative for \nthe commercialization of Gencaro or rNAPc2, if it is approved, and we have suspended our efforts to build internal sales, marketing \nand distribution capabilities. If we elect to rely on third parties to sell Gencaro, rNAPc2 and any other products, then we may receive \nless revenue than if we sold such products directly. In addition, we may have little or no control over the sales efforts of those third \nparties. If we are unable to complete a strategic transaction, we would be unable to commercialize Gencaro, rNAPc2 or any other \nproduct candidate without substantial additional capital. Even if such capital were secured, we would be required to build internal \nsales, marketing and distribution capabilities to market Gencaro or rNAPc2 in the United States. None of our current employees have \nexperience in establishing and managing a sales force. \nIn the event we are unable to sell Gencaro, rNAPc2 and other selected product candidates, either directly or through third parties via a \nstrategic transaction, the commercialization of Gencaro or rNAPc2, if approved, may be delayed indefinitely.\nWe are dependent on our key personnel. \nThe success of our business is highly dependent on the principal members of our board of directors and executive management, \nincluding our President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael R. Bristow. The loss of the services of any such individual might \nseriously harm our product development, partnering and financing efforts. Recruiting and training personnel with the requisite skills is \nchallenging and we compete for talent with companies that are larger and have more financial resources. \nWe have no manufacturing capacity which puts us at risk of lengthy and costly delays of bringing our products to market.\nWe do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of our product candidates, including their \ndrug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API. We have no experience in drug formulation or manufacturing, and we \nlack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. We do not \nintend to develop facilities for the manufacture of product candidates for clinical trials or commercial purposes in the foreseeable \nfuture. We have contracted with several third-party manufacturing organizations for production and analytical testing of our product \ncandidates. These contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the \ntime required to successfully produce, store and distribute our products. In addition, these manufacturers may have staffing \ndifficulties, may experience delays due to key material or component availability, may not be able to manufacture our products on a \ntimely basis or may become financially distressed. In the event of errors in forecasting production quantities required to meet demand, \nnatural disaster, equipment malfunctions or failures, technology malfunctions, strikes, lock-outs or work stoppages, regional power \noutages, product tampering, war or terrorist activities, actions of regulatory authorities, business failure, strike or other difficulty, we \nmay be unable to find an alternative third-party manufacturer in a timely manner and the production of our product candidates would \nbe interrupted, resulting in delays and additional costs, which could impact our ability to commercialize and sell our product \ncandidates. We or our contract manufacturers may also fail to achieve and maintain required manufacturing standards, which could \nresult in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, an order by governmental authorities to halt production, delays or \nfailures in product testing or delivery, stability testing failures, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously hurt our business. \nContract manufacturers also often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as \nshortages of qualified personnel. In addition, our contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing inspections and regulation by the \nFDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and corresponding foreign and state agencies and they may fail to meet these agencies’ \nacceptable standards of compliance. If our contract manufacturers fail to comply with applicable governmental regulations, such as \nquality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation, we may not be able to continue production of \nthe API or finished product. If the safety of any API or product supplied is compromised due to failure to adhere to applicable laws or \nfor other reasons, this may jeopardize our regulatory approval for Gencaro, rNAPc2 and other product candidates, and we may be held \nliable for any injuries sustained as a result. Upon the occurrence of one of the aforementioned events, the ability to switch \nmanufacturers may be difficult for a number of reasons, including: \n•\nthe number of potential manufacturers is limited and we may not be able to negotiate agreements with alternative \nmanufacturers on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; \n•\nlong lead times are often needed to manufacture drugs; \n•\nthe manufacturing process is complex and may require a significant learning curve; and \n•\nthe FDA must approve any replacement prior to manufacturing, which requires new testing and compliance inspections."

To date we have not generated any \nproduct revenue and have historically funded our operations through investment capital. Our future growth depends on our ability to \nemerge from the clinical development stage and successfully commercialize or provide for the commercialization of Gencaro, rNAPc2 \nand our other product candidates which in turn, will depend, among other things, on our ability to: \n•\nconduct additional clinical trials and develop and obtain regulatory approval for Gencaro, rNAPc2 or other product \ncandidates; \n•\nsuccessfully partner a companion genetic test with the commercial launch of Gencaro or rNAPc2; \n•\nenter into a strategic transaction enabling the continued development and commercialization of Gencaro or rNAPc2, or \nalternatively, raise significant additional capital to enable these activities; \n•\npursue additional indications for Gencaro or rNAPc2 and develop other product candidates, including other cardiovascular \ntherapies; and \n•\nobtain commercial quantities of Gencaro, rNAPc2 or other product candidates at acceptable cost levels. \nAny one of these factors or other factors discussed in this report could affect our ability to successfully commercialize Gencaro and \nother product candidates, which could impact our ability to earn sufficient revenues to transition from a clinical development stage \ncompany and continue our business.\nIf approved by the FDA, Gencaro or rNAPc2 will be entering a competitive marketplace and may not succeed. \nGencaro is a new type of beta-blocker and vasodilator being developed for AF. While we anticipate that this drug, if approved, would \nbe the first genetically-targeted cardiovascular drug, and potentially the only beta-blocker approved for AF, Gencaro will be one of a \nnumber of accepted treatments for AF. In addition, our proposed prescribing information for Gencaro is expected to include a \nrequirement for genetic testing of the patient to ascertain if they have the genotype that we believe responds best to Gencaro. This \nadditional step will add incremental cost and procedures to prescribing Gencaro, which could make it more difficult to compete \nagainst existing therapies. \nWe do not yet know what the commercial opportunity will be, if any, for rNAPc2 if it is approved for treating COVID-19 disease. We \ndo not know how and to whom rNAPc2 would be marketed and what the commercial arrangements would be for its sales and \nreimbursement. While we anticipate that rNAPc2, if approved, could potentially be used in combination with antiviral drugs and other \ntherapies, there are other vaccines and therapies under development. \nOur commercial opportunity may be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more \neffective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than Gencaro. If products with any of these properties are \ndeveloped, or any of the existing products are better marketed, then prescriptions of Gencaro by physicians and patient use of Gencaro \ncould be significantly reduced or rendered obsolete and noncompetitive. Further, public announcements regarding the development of \nany such competing drugs could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the value of our assets. \nFuture sales of our products may suffer if they are not accepted in the marketplace by physicians, patients and the medical \ncommunity. \nGencaro, rNAPc2 or our other product candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical \ncommunity. The degree of market acceptance of Gencaro, rNAPc2 or our other product candidates will depend on a number of \nfactors, such as its effectiveness and tolerability, as compared with competitive drugs. For instance, if rNAPc2 is approved, by that \ntime there may be superior alternatives in terms of vaccines and/or therapeutics that may significantly impact the relative medical \nbenefits offered by rNAPc2. If our future clinical trials for rNAPc2 do not show that rNAPc2 has a clear therapeutic benefit as \ncompared to other therapies or vaccines that are approved in the interim, then there may be a limited or no commercial market for \nrNAPc2. Also, prevalence and severity of side-effects could negatively affect market acceptance of rNAPc2. Failure to achieve market \nacceptance of  Gencaro or rNAPc2 would significantly harm our business. \nIf we are unable to obtain acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for Gencaro, rNAPc2, or any other \nproduct candidates that we may seek to commercialize, then our revenues and prospects for profitability will suffer."

      "text": "31\nOur or any strategic partner’s ability to commercialize Gencaro, rNAPc2, or any other product candidates that we may seek to \ncommercialize, is highly dependent on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these product candidates will be available \nfrom: \n•\ngovernmental payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid; \n•\nprivate health insurers, including managed-care organizations; and \n•\nother third-party payors. \nMany patients will not be capable of paying for our potential products themselves and will rely on third-party payors to pay for their \nmedical needs. A primary current trend in the U.S. health care industry is toward cost containment. Large private payors, managed-\ncare organizations, group purchasing organizations and similar organizations are exerting increasing influence on decisions regarding \nthe use of, and reimbursement levels for, particular treatments. Such third-party payors, including Medicare, are challenging the prices \ncharged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly approved health care products. \nCost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products, which could result in product revenues lower than \nanticipated. If the prices for our product candidates decrease, or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide adequate \ncoverage and reimbursement levels, then our revenue and prospects for profitability will suffer.\nHealth care reform measures could materially and adversely affect our business. \nThe business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are affected by the efforts of governmental and \nthird-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care. The U.S. Congress has enacted legislation to reform the health care \nsystem. While we anticipate that this legislation may, over time, increase the number of patients who have insurance coverage for \npharmaceutical products, it also imposes cost containment measures that may adversely affect the amount of reimbursement for \npharmaceutical products. These measures include increasing the minimum rebates for products covered by Medicaid programs and \nextending such rebates to drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations as well as \nexpansion of the 340(B) Public Health Services drug discount program. In addition, such legislation contains a number of provisions \ndesigned to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansion, including new fees or taxes on certain health-related \nindustries, including medical device manufacturers. Each medical device manufacturer has to pay an excise tax (or sales tax) in an \namount equal to 2.3% of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices. Such excise taxes may impact any potential \nsales of the genetic test if it is approved for marketing. On January 22, 2018, legislation was enacted suspending the medical device \ntax in 2018 and 2019. In December 2019, a permanent repeal of the medical device tax was enacted. The Gencaro Test is likely to be \nsubject to this tax if this tax is reinstated in the future. In foreign jurisdictions there have been, and we expect that there will continue \nto be, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the health care system. For example, in some countries other \nthan the United States, pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control and we expect to see continued efforts to reduce \nhealthcare costs in international markets. \nSome states are also considering legislation that would control the prices of drugs, and state Medicaid programs are increasingly \nrequesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for \nwhich supplemental rebates are not being paid. Managed care organizations continue to seek price discounts and, in some cases, to \nimpose restrictions on the coverage of particular drugs. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expenses may lead to increased use of \nmanaged care organizations by Medicaid programs. This may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions \nfor a larger segment of the population and a corresponding constraint on prices and reimbursement for drugs. It is likely that federal \nand state legislatures and health agencies will continue to focus on additional health care reform in the future although we are unable \nto predict what additional legislation or regulation, if any, relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and \nreimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business. We or any \nstrategic partner’s ability to commercialize Gencaro, rNAPc2, or any other product candidates that we may seek to commercialize, is \nhighly dependent on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these product candidates will be available from government \npayors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, including managed care organizations, and other third-party payors, \nand any change in reimbursement levels could materially and adversely affect our business. Further, the pendency or approval of \nfuture proposals or reforms could result in a decrease in our stock price or limit our ability to raise capital or to obtain strategic \npartnerships or licenses."

Other early-stage companies may also prove \nto be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. In addition, these \nthird parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites \nand patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring therapies and therapy licenses complementary to our programs or \nadvantageous to our business. We expect that our ability to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to: \n•\nsuccessfully and rapidly complete clinical trials for any product candidates and obtain all requisite regulatory approvals in \na cost-effective manner; \n•\nbuild an adequate sales and marketing infrastructure, raise additional funding, or enter into strategic transactions enabling \nthe commercialization of our products; \n•\ndevelop competitive formulations of our product candidates; \n•\nattract and retain key personnel; and \n•\nidentify and obtain other product candidates on commercially reasonable terms. \nIf we fail to identify and license or acquire other products or product candidates, then we may be unable to expand our business, \nand the acquisition or licensing of other products or product candidates may put a strain on our operations and will likely require \nus to seek additional financing. \nOne of our strategies is to license or acquire clinical-stage products or product candidates and further develop them for \ncommercialization. The market for licensing and acquiring products and product candidates is intensely competitive and many of our \ncompetitors may have greater resources than we do. If we undertake any additional acquisitions, whether of product candidates or \nother biopharmaceutical companies, the process of integrating an acquired product candidate or complementary company into our \nbusiness may put a strain on our operations, divert personnel, financial resources and management’s attention. In 2020, our research \nand development activities were dedicated to initiating the clinical trial of rNAPc2. If we are not able to substantially expand our \nresearch and development efforts, or identify, or license or acquire other products or product candidates or complete future \nacquisitions, then we will likely be unable expand our pipeline of product candidates. In addition, any future acquisition would give \nrise to additional operating costs and will likely require us to seek additional financing. Future acquisitions could result in additional \nissuances of equity securities that would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders. Future acquisitions could also result in the \nincurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or the amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets, any of which could \nadversely affect our operating results.\nWe would be subject to applicable regulatory approval requirements of the foreign countries in which we market our products, \nwhich are costly and may prevent or delay us from marketing our products in those countries. \nIn addition to regulatory requirements in the United States, we would be subject to the regulatory approval requirements in each \nforeign country where we market our products. In addition, we might be required to identify one or more collaborators in these foreign \ncountries to develop, seek approval for and manufacture our products and any companion genetic test for Gencaro. If we decide to \npursue regulatory approvals and commercialization of our product candidates internationally, we may not be able to obtain the \nrequired foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, and any failure to do so may cause us to incur additional costs or \nprevent us from marketing our products in foreign countries, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial \ncondition and results of operations. \nIf our internal control over financial reporting is not considered effective, our business and stock price could be adversely affected. \nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting \nas of the end of each fiscal year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial \nreporting in our annual report on Form 10-K for that fiscal year. Our management, including our principal executive officer and \nprincipal financial officer, does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. We \ncontinue to operate with a small staff for financial reporting. Though the process and design of our internal controls over financial \nreporting have not been altered, the small number of staff involved in financial reporting may limit our ability to properly segregate \ninternal control procedures which could result in deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls in the future. A control \nsystem, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s \nobjectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits \nof controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of \ncontrols can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud involving a company have been, or will be, \ndetected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we \ncannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

We cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in \nour internal control over financial reporting in the future. A material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting would \nrequire management to consider our internal control over financial reporting as ineffective. If our internal control over financial \nreporting is not considered effective, we may experience a loss of public confidence, which could have an adverse effect on our \nbusiness and on the market price of our common stock. \nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our \nbusiness, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could affect the \ntax treatment of our domestic and foreign earnings. Any new taxes could adversely affect our domestic and international business \noperations, and our business and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be \ninterpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and \nJobs Act, significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. Future guidance from the Internal \nRevenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Cuts \nand Jobs Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will \nconform to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or any newly enacted federal tax legislation. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of \nnet deferred tax assets relating to our operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses under the Tax Cuts \nand Jobs Act or future reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in \nsignificant one-time charges, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations. \nAs of December 31, 2022, we had net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of approximately $203.3 million, and approximately $2.4 \nmillion of research and development credits that may be used to offset future taxable income. Our net operating loss carryforwards \ngenerated prior to 2018 will expire beginning in 2025 if not utilized. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, U.S. federal NOLs incurred in \ntax years ending after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of federal NOLs generated in tax \nyears beginning after December 31, 2017, may be limited. In general, under Section 382 of the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \n“ownership change” (as defined under Section 382 of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations) is subject to limitations on its \nability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. We have not determined whether we have experienced an \nownership change in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock \nownership, some of which may be outside of our control. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on \nthe use of NOLs or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to reduce future income tax \nliabilities, including for state tax purposes. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs reflected on \nour balance sheet, even if we attain profitability, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us and could \nadversely affect our operating results and financial condition. \nSecurity breaches, cyber-attacks, or other disruptions or incidents could expose us to liability and affect our business and reputation. \nWe are increasingly dependent on our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. We, our collaborators and \nour service providers collect, store, and transmit sensitive information including intellectual property, proprietary business \ninformation, clinical trial data and personal information in connection with our business operations. The secure maintenance of this \ninformation is critical to our operations and business strategy. Some of this information could be an attractive target of criminal attack \nby third parties with a wide range of motives and expertise, including organized criminal groups, “hacktivists,” patient groups, \ndisgruntled current or former employees, nation-state and nation-state supported actors, and others. Cyber-attacks are of ever-\nincreasing levels of sophistication, and despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be \nvulnerable to such attacks or may be breached, including due to employee error or malfeasance. \nWe have implemented information security measures to protect our systems, proprietary information and sensitive data against the risk \nof inappropriate and unauthorized external use and disclosure and other types of compromise. However, despite these measures, and \ndue to the ever changing information cyber-threat landscape, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be adequate to detect, \nprevent or mitigate security breaches and other incidents and we may be subject to data breaches through cyber-attacks, malicious \ncode (such as viruses and worms), phishing attacks, social engineering schemes, and insider theft or misuse. Any such breach could \ncompromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, modified, destroyed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. \nIf our systems become compromised, we may not promptly discover the intrusion. \nAny security breach of other incident, whether real or perceived, could cause us to suffer reputational damage. Such incidents could \nresult in costs to respond to, investigate and remedy such incidents, notification obligations to affected individuals, government \nagencies, credit reporting agencies and other third parties, legal claims or proceedings, and liability under our contracts with other \nparties and federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Any one of these events could cause \nour business to be materially harmed and our results of operations would be adversely impacted."

In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach \nnotification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 \nof the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could \napply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (including \nresearch institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, or HIPAA. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be \nsubject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a \nHIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.\nIn addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California \nresidents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive \ndetailed information about how their personal information is used by requiring covered companies to provide new disclosures to \nCalifornia consumers (as that term is broadly defined) and provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal \ninformation. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected \nto increase data breach litigation. Although there are limited exemptions for clinical trial data and the CCPA’s implementation \nstandards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, the CCPA may increase our compliance \ncosts and potential liability. Many similar privacy laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states.\nForeign data protection laws, including, without limitation, the European Union Directive 95/46/EC, or the Directive, and the \nEuropean Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, that became effective in May 2018, and member state data \nprotection legislation, may also apply to health-related and other personal information obtained outside of the United States. These \nlaws impose strict obligations on the ability to process health-related and other personal information of data subjects in the European \nUnion and the United Kingdom, including in relation to use, collection, analysis, and transfer (including cross-border transfer) of such \npersonal information. These laws include several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data \nrelates, limitations on data processing, establishing a legal basis for processing, notification of data processing obligations or security \nincidents to appropriate data protection authorities or data subjects, the security and confidentiality of the personal data and various \nrights that data subjects may exercise.  \nThe Directive and the GDPR prohibit, without an appropriate legal basis, the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the \nEuropean Economic Area, or EEA, such as the United States, which are not considered by the European Commission to provide an \nadequate level of data protection. Switzerland has adopted similar restrictions. Although there are legal mechanisms to allow for the \ntransfer of personal data from the EEA and Switzerland to the United States, uncertainty about compliance with European Union data \nprotection laws remains. For example, ongoing legal challenges in Europe to the mechanisms allowing companies to transfer personal \ndata from the EEA to the United States could result in further limitations on the ability to transfer personal data across borders, \nparticularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new or maintain existing agreements that support cross-border data \ntransfers, such as the European Union-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. Additionally, other countries have passed or \nare considering passing laws requiring local data residency.\nUnder the GDPR, regulators may impose substantial fines and penalties for non-compliance. Companies that violate the GDPR can \nface fines of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of their worldwide annual turnover (revenue). The GDPR increases our \nresponsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional \nmechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR and other EU and international data protection rules.\nCompliance with U.S. and foreign privacy and security laws, rules and regulations could require us to take on more onerous \nobligations in our contracts, require us to engage in costly compliance exercises, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or \nin some cases, impact our or our partners’ or suppliers’ ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. Each of these constantly evolving \nlaws can be subject to varying interpretations. Failure to comply with U.S. and foreign data protection laws and regulations could \nresult in government investigations and enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), fines, private litigation, \nand/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Moreover, patients about whom we or our \npartners obtain information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may contractually limit our ability to use and \ndisclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy rights, failed to comply with data protection laws, or \nbreached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could \nresult in adverse publicity that could harm our business."

If we cannot \nsuccessfully defend against product liability claims, then we will incur substantial liabilities. \nRegardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in: \n•\ndecreased demand for our products and product candidates; \n•\ninjury to our reputation; \n•\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants; \n•\ncosts of related litigation; \n•\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients and others; \n•\nloss of revenues; and \n•\nthe inability to commercialize our products and product candidates. \nWe have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage. Such coverage, however, may not be adequate or may not continue to \nbe available to us in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost, or at all. We may not be able to obtain commercially reasonable \nproduct liability insurance for any product candidate.\nDefending against claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous chemicals, radioactive or biological \nmaterials could be time consuming and expensive. \nOur research and development of product candidates may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals, \nradioactive and biological materials. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury \nfrom the materials. Various laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials. \nWe may be sued or be required to pay fines for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of \nthese materials. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental \nregulations may impair our research, development and production efforts. \nThe loss of any rights to market key products would significantly impair our operating results. \nOur patent portfolios relating to Gencaro, including a patent that issued in 2021, are either owned by us or are subject to licenses that \nimpose no royalty obligations or milestone payments relating to the further development, approval and commercialization of Gencaro. \nTermination of our license agreements could result in the loss of our further rights to develop and commercialize Gencaro for any \nindication. The termination of any such license, or of any other agreement which enables us to market a key product or product \ncandidate, could significantly and adversely affect our business.\nCertain intellectual property licensed by us is the subject of additional licensing arrangements to which the party that has licensed \nrights to us is subject. If such parties were to breach the terms of such licenses or such licenses were otherwise to terminate, our and \nour partners’ rights to use such technology and develop and commercialize their products such as the genetic test may terminate and \nour business would be materially harmed. \nThird parties may own or control patents or patent applications that we may be required to license to commercialize our product \ncandidates or that could result in litigation that would be costly and time consuming. \nOur or any strategic partner’s ability to commercialize Gencaro, rNAPc2 and other product candidates depends upon our ability to \ndevelop, manufacture, market and sell these drugs without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. A number of \npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and research institutions have or may be granted patents that cover \ntechnologies similar to the technologies owned by or licensed to us. We may choose to seek, or be required to seek, licenses under \nthird party patents, which would likely require the payment of license fees or royalties or both. We may also be unaware of existing \npatents that may be infringed by Gencaro or rNAPc2, the genetic testing we intend to use in connection with Gencaro or our other \nproduct candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be other currently pending applications that \nmay later result in issued patents that are infringed by Gencaro, rNAPc2 or our other product candidates.

      "text": "36\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and \nbiopharmaceutical industries generally. If a third party claims that we are infringing on its technology, then our business and results of \noperations could be harmed by a number of factors, including: \n•\ninfringement and other intellectual property claims, even if without merit, are expensive and time-consuming to litigate \nand can divert management’s attention from our core business; \n•\nmonetary damage awards for past infringement can be substantial; \n•\na court may prohibit us from selling or licensing product candidates unless the patent holder chooses to license the patent \nto us; and \n•\nif a license is available from a patent holder, we may have to pay substantial royalties. \nWe may also be forced to bring an infringement action if we believe that a competitor is infringing our protected intellectual property. \nAny such litigation will be costly, time-consuming and divert management’s attention, and the outcome of any such litigation may not \nbe favorable to us.\nOur intellectual property rights may not preclude competitors from developing competing products and our business may suffer. \nOur competitive success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our inventions, technologies \nand discoveries, including intellectual property that we license. The patent positions of biotechnology companies involve complex \nlegal and factual questions, and we cannot be certain that our patents and licenses will successfully preclude others from using our \ntechnology. Consequently, we cannot be certain that any of our patents will provide significant market protection or will not be \ncircumvented or challenged and found to be unenforceable or invalid. In some cases, patent applications in the United States and \ncertain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy until patents issue, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent \nliterature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent \napplications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to \ndetermine priority of invention, in opposition proceedings in a foreign patent office, or in a post-grant challenge proceeding such as an \nex parte reexamination or inter partes review at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, any of which could result in substantial cost to \nus, even if the eventual outcome is favorable. There can be no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would hold any claims \nin any issued patent to be valid. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to \nbe licensed from third parties or require us to cease using such technology. \nWe own the clinical development program of rNAPc2, including Phase 2b clinical trials. If rNAPc2 is successfully developed, we \nbelieve it will have intellectual property protection, including 12 years of market exclusivity as an innovative biologic product under \nFDA law in the United States, 10 years data protection exclusivity in the EU, and potentially patent protection in addition to this. \nHowever, another competitor could develop a compound with similar biological properties to rNAPc2 that may not be barred by our \nexclusivity. We have also filed a provisional patent application for rNAPc2 and its use for COVID-19 disease, but there is no \nassurance that this provisional application will ultimately result in an issued patent.\nRegardless of merit, the listing of patents in the FDA Orange Book for Gencaro may be challenged as being improperly listed. We \nmay have to defend against such claims and possible associated antitrust issues. We could also incur substantial costs in seeking to \nenforce our proprietary rights against infringement. \nWhile the composition of matter patents on the compound that comprises Gencaro have expired, we hold the intellectual property \nconcerning the interaction of Gencaro with the polymorphisms of the beta-1 and alpha-2C receptors. We have obtained patents that \nclaim methods involving Gencaro after a patient’s receptor genotype has been determined. We anticipate that any NDA for Gencaro \nwill request a label including a claim that efficacy varies based on receptor genotype and a recommendation in the prescribing \ninformation that prospective patients be tested for their receptor genotype. We believe that under applicable law, a generic bucindolol \nlabel would likely be required to include this recommendation as it pertains directly to the safe or efficacious use of the drug. Such a \nlabel may be considered as inducing infringement, carrying the same liability as direct infringement. If the label with the genotype \ninformation for Gencaro is not approved, or if generic labels are not required to copy the approved label, competitors could have an \neasier path to introduce competing products and our business may suffer. The approved label may not contain language covered by the \npatents, or we may be unsuccessful in enforcing them. \nWe may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, as our patents are limited by \njurisdiction and many countries do not offer the same level of legal protection for intellectual property as the United States. \nWe require our employees, consultants, business partners and members of our scientific advisory board to execute confidentiality \nagreements upon the commencement of employment, consulting or business relationships with us. These agreements provide that all \nconfidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed \nto third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions resulting from \nwork performed for us, utilizing the property or relating to our business and conceived or completed by the individual during \nemployment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by applicable law."

Third parties could also fail to take necessary steps to protect our licensed intellectual property, which could \nseriously harm our intellectual property position. \nIf we are not able to protect our proprietary technology, trade secrets and know-how, then our competitors may develop competing \nproducts. Any issued patent may not be sufficient to prevent others from competing with us. Further, we have trade secrets relating to \nrNAPc2 and Gencaro, and such trade secrets may become known or independently discovered. Our issued patents and those that may \nissue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, opposed, invalidated or circumvented, which could allow competitors to \nmarket similar products or limit the patent protection term of our product candidates. All of these factors may affect our competitive \nposition. \nIf the manufacture, use or sale of our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, we could face costly litigation, \nwhich could cause us to pay substantial damages or licensing fees and limit our ability to sell some or all of our products. \nExtensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights has been common in the biopharmaceutical industry. \nLitigation may be necessary to assert infringement claims, enforce patent rights, protect trade secrets or know-how and determine the \nenforceability, scope and validity of certain proprietary rights. Litigation may even be necessary to defend disputes of inventorship or \nownership of proprietary rights. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property lawsuits, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office \ninterference proceedings, and related legal and administrative proceedings (e.g., a reexamination, inter partes review, or post-grant \nreview) in the United States and internationally involve complex legal and factual questions. As a result, such proceedings are costly \nand time-consuming to pursue, and their outcome is uncertain. \nRegardless of merit or outcome, our involvement in any litigation, interference or other administrative proceedings could cause us to \nincur substantial expense and could significantly divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. Any public \nannouncements related to litigation or interference proceedings initiated or threatened against us could cause our stock price to \ndecline. Adverse outcomes in patent litigation may potentially subject us to antitrust litigation which, regardless of the outcome, \nwould adversely affect our business. An adverse determination may subject us to the loss of our proprietary position or to significant \nliabilities, or require us to seek licenses that may include substantial cost and ongoing royalties. Licenses may not be available from \nthird parties, or may not be obtainable on satisfactory terms. An adverse determination or a failure to obtain necessary licenses may \nrestrict or prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products, if any. These outcomes could materially harm our business, \nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock and Stock Price Volatility \nOur stock price has been and is expected to be volatile. \nOur common stock has in the past been and in the future could be subject to significant fluctuations. Market prices for securities of \nearly-stage pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the \nfactors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include: \n•\nthe regulatory status of Gencaro, rNAPc2 and the genetic test, and whether and when they are approved for sale, if at all, \nand the labeling or other conditions of use imposed by the FDA; \n•\nour ability to secure additional funding or complete a strategic transaction or to complete development of and \ncommercialize Gencaro or rNAPc2; \n•\nprogress of any future clinical trials for Gencaro, rNAPc2 or our other product candidate, including enrollment and any \ndata that may become available;\n•\nthe results of our future clinical trials and any future NDAs of our current and future product candidates; \n•\nthe entry into, or termination of, key agreements, including key strategic alliance agreements; \n•\nthe results and timing of regulatory reviews relating to our product candidates; \n•\nfailure of any of our product candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success; \n•\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect our research and development expenditures; \n•\nthe results of clinical trials conducted by others on drugs that would compete with our product candidates; \n•\nissues in manufacturing or testing our product candidates or any approved products; \n•\nthe initiation of or material developments in or the conclusion of litigation to enforce or defend any of our intellectual \nproperty rights; \n•\nthe loss of key employees;"

These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading \nprice of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, stockholders have \noften instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs \nand diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of our common stock may depress the market price of our common stock. \nSales in the public market of substantial amounts of our common stock could depress prevailing market prices of our common stock. \nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately 14.4 million shares of common stock were outstanding, and all of these shares are freely \ntransferable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, except for \nshares held by our directors, officers and other affiliates and unregistered shares held by non-affiliates. The sale of these additional \nshares, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress the market price of our common stock. \nAs of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 796,000 shares of our common stock which may be issued upon the exercise of \noutstanding stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units, and we anticipate that we will continue to issue stock option and \nrestricted stock unit awards to our employees and consultants in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and thereafter. If and when \nthese options are exercised and these restricted stock units are vested, such shares will be available for sale in the open market without \nfurther registration under the Securities Act. The existence of these outstanding options and restricted stock units may negatively \naffect our ability to complete future equity financings at acceptable prices and on acceptable terms. The exercise of those options and \nvesting of the restricted stock units, and the prompt resale of shares of our common stock received, may also result in downward \npressure on the price of our common stock. \nIn the absence of a significant strategic transaction, we will need to raise significant additional capital to finance the research, \ndevelopment and commercialization of Gencaro, rNAPc2 and our other product candidate. If future securities offerings occur, they \nwould dilute our current stockholders’ equity interests and could reduce the market price of our common stock. \nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends, and accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their \ninvestment. \nWe anticipate that we will retain our earnings, if any, for future growth and therefore do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the \nfuture. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to stockholders. Investors seeking cash \ndividends should not invest in our common stock.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders.\nResponding to actions by activist shareholders could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of \nmanagement and our employees. For example, in connection with the negotiation and entry into a cooperation agreement in June 2022 \nwith Cable Car Capital LLC, The Funicular Fund, LP, Funicular Funds, LP and Jacob Ma-Weaver, collectively, Cable Car, one of our \nstockholders, we appointed two new directors in 2022. Activist shareholders may advocate for certain governance and strategic \nchanges at our company. In the event of stockholder activism, particularly with respect to matters which our board of directors, in \nexercising their fiduciary duties, disagree with or have determined not to pursue, our business could be adversely affected because \nresponding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention \nof management, and perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and \nmay make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners, and customers. \nAdditionally, if faced with a consent solicitation or proxy contest, we may not be able to respond successfully to the contest or dispute, \nwhich would be disruptive to our business. If individuals are elected to our board of directors with a differing agenda, our ability to \neffectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders may be adversely affected. In \naddition, our share price could experience periods of increased volatility as a result of shareholder activism."

      "text": "39\nWe have implemented anti-takeover provisions that could discourage, prevent or delay a takeover, even if the acquisition would be \nbeneficial to our stockholders. \nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a \nthird party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions: \n•\n establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board may be elected at one time; \n•\nauthorize the issuance of up to approximately 5 million additional shares of preferred stock that could be issued by our \nboard of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and hinder a takeover attempt; \n•\nlimit who may call a special meeting of stockholders; \n•\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our \nstockholders; and \n•\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that \ncan be acted upon at a stockholder meeting. \nSpecifically, our certificate of incorporation provides that all stockholder action must be effected at a duly called meeting and not by a \nwritten consent. The bylaws provide, however, that our stockholders may call a special meeting of stockholders only upon a request of \nstockholders owning at least 50% of our outstanding common stock. These provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws \ncould discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control. We designed these provisions to \nreduce our vulnerability to unsolicited acquisition proposals and to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights. These \nprovisions, however, could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares. As a consequence, \nthey also may inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our shares that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts.

While we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each \nforward-looking statement contained in this Annual Report, we caution you that these statements are based on a combination of facts \nand factors currently known by us and our projections of the future, about which we cannot be certain. We undertake no obligation to \npublicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, \nhowever, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on \nForm 8-K, and our website. \nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company applying a precision medicine approach to the development and \ncommercialization of targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases. Precision medicine refers to the tailoring of medical treatment to \nthe individual characteristics of patients, using genomic, non-genomic biomarker and other information that extends beyond routine \ndiagnostic categorization. We believe that when implemented correctly precision medicine can enhance therapeutic response, improve \npatient outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs. \nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors established a Special Committee and, in May 2022, retained Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. to \nevaluate strategic options, including transactions involving a merger, sale of all or part of our assets, or other alternatives with the goal \nof maximizing stockholder value. We believe there are multiple potential opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders. We do \nnot have a defined timeline for the strategic review process and the review may not result in any specific action or transaction.\nOur lead product candidate is Gencaro™ (bucindolol hydrochloride) for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, or AF, in patients with \nchronic heart failure, or HF. Gencaro is being developed for patients who have a genotype that identifies a drug target associated with \nheightened efficacy. \nGencaro™ (bucindolol hydrochloride) for Atrial Fibrillation \nGencaro™ (bucindolol hydrochloride) is a pharmacogenetically-targeted beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist with mild vasodilator \nproperties that we are developing for the treatment of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure. We believe the pharmacology of \nGencaro is unique and its efficacy can be enhanced by prescribing it to patients with a common genotypic variant that is present in \napproximately 50% of the North American and European general populations. This gene can be detected with a simple genetic test. \nWe are developing Gencaro to treat atrial fibrillation, or AF, in patients with chronic heart failure, or HF. AF is the most common \nform of cardiac arrhythmia, a disruption of the heart’s normal rhythm or rate. HF is a chronic condition in which the heart is unable to \npump enough blood to meet the body’s needs. AF and HF commonly occur together. In HF patients, the development of AF leads to \nworsening symptoms, and increased risk of hospitalization and death. Current treatment options for AF in HF patients are limited, and \ncan be invasive, costly and dangerous.\nOur development plan for Gencaro focuses on the treatment of AF in patients with higher ejection fraction HF, those who have an \nejection fraction, or EF, of 40% and higher who also have the genotype we believe is optimal for Gencaro efficacy. This population of \nHF encompasses more than half of all HF patients in the United States and Europe. There are currently few approved or effective drug \ntherapies to treat AF or HF in this patient population.   \nOur development plan for Gencaro is based on our recently published analysis of the Phase 2b clinical trial of Gencaro for the \nprevention of AF in HF patients, known as GENETIC-AF. This analysis showed novel results for Gencaro in patients in the clinical \ntrial with EF’s of 40% and higher. We currently have an agreement with the FDA, known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, \nfor the requirements of a Gencaro Phase 3 clinical trial that would support approval of Gencaro if successful. The Phase 3 pivotal \nclinical trial of Gencaro conducted under an SPA will include secondary endpoints that are intended to capture some of this new \ninformation, such as a reduction in the need to deploy rhythm control interventions including electrical cardioversion, catheter ablation \nand use of anti-arrhythmic drugs and avoidance of drug-related complications such as bradycardia. Based on these analyses, we were \nissued a United States patent in February 2021 for the use of Gencaro in this patient population. We believe this patent will \nsubstantially extend the patent protection for our planned development of Gencaro into 2039. We are seeking similar patent protection \nin other countries."

      "text": "43\nWe believe that patients with HF and AF represent a major unmet medical need, and this need is most pronounced in patients with EF \nvalues of 40% and above. This EF range constitutes more than half of all chronic HF in the United States and Europe, as well as in \nJapan and China, and there are currently few approved, effective or guideline-recommended therapies for these patients to treat either \ntheir AF or HF. AF is a very common complication in these patients, with estimates of AF incidence ranging from 40% to 60%. Beta-\nblockers approved for HF are commonly used off-label to control heart rate in these patients, but they are not considered effective in \npreventing AF and none are approved for patients with EF ≥ 40%. Other anti-arrhythmic drugs approved for the treatment of AF have \nadverse side effects and in HF patients are either contraindicated or have label warnings for use due to an increased risk of mortality. \nInterventional procedures for AF, such as catheter ablation and electrical cardioversion, are invasive, expensive, and often temporary; \nthese interventions also typically require the continued use of beta blockers and other anti-arrhythmic drugs post-intervention.  \nWe believe that Gencaro, if approved, may be a safe and more effective therapy for the treatment of higher ejection fraction HF \npatients with AF. We believe there are several potentially important attributes that would differentiate Gencaro from existing \ntherapies, including:\n•\nMore effective rhythm control compared to the current standard of care;\n•\nReduction in the need for catheter ablation, electrical cardioversion, or toxic anti-arrhythmic drugs;\n•\nMaintenance of rhythm control after a successful AF catheter ablation;\n•\nEffective rate control with lower risk of treatment-limiting, adverse event producing bradycardia;\n•\nReduction in symptoms and improvement in quality of life;\n•\nReduced health care burden;\n•\nFoundational beta-blocker benefits for HF and unique evidence of efficacy in HF patients with AF;\n•\nOne of the only drug therapies approved and shown effective for AF in HF patients with EF ≥ 40%, and the only one in its \ndrug class.\nWe have an international patent portfolio for Gencaro in the United States, the EU, and other major markets, as well as new chemical \nentity status, including a new patent that we believe will give us a strong intellectual property position to at least approximately 2039 \nin the United States; we have filed applications similar to this new patent in international territories. We have developed a laboratory \nplatform for the diagnostic test that would be used to prescribe Gencaro; this platform was approved by FDA for use in the Phase 2B \nclinical trial. We retain all rights to this test platform; we expect to use it in future clinical trials, and we believe it could be one of \nmultiple diagnostic platforms used for commercialization. \nrNAPc2 (AB201) for treatment of COVID-19\nRecombinant Nematode Anticoagulant Protein c2, or rNAPc2 (AB201), is a protein therapeutic in clinical development as a potential \ntreatment for patients with COVID-19. Based on its unique mechanism of action, development history and the clinical evidence from \nthe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we believe rNAPc2 has potential to be a beneficial therapy for patients with this serious viral disease. We \ninitiated a Phase 2b clinical trial of rNAPc2 as a potential treatment for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the fourth quarter of \n2020 and completed patient enrollment in the fourth quarter 2021. In the clinical trial, both doses of rNAPc2 demonstrated a treatment \nbenefit for patients, however, neither dose achieved statistical significance for the primary efficacy endpoint of change in D-dimer \nlevel from Baseline to Day 8 compared to standard of care heparin.  \nOn the secondary endpoints measuring thrombotic events and time-to-recovery, there was a numerical imbalance in favor of rNAPc2 \nthat was non-significant. rNAPc2 was well-tolerated at both doses. There were no serious treatment-related adverse events and no \ndose dependent increase in adverse events was observed. There was no difference between rNAPc2 and standard-of-care heparin in \nmajor or non-major clinically relevant bleeding.\nTo support the continued development of Gencaro and rNAPc2, we will need additional financing to fully fund any clinical trials, and \nour general and administrative costs through the clinical trials’ projected completion and potential commercialization. Considering the \nsubstantial time and costs associated with the development of Gencaro and rNAPc2 and the risk that we may be unable to raise a \nsignificant amount of capital on acceptable terms, we are also pursuing co-development and commercialization partnering \nopportunities with large pharmaceutical and/or specialty pharmaceutical companies and may pursue a strategic combination or other \nstrategic transactions. If we are unable to obtain sufficient financing or are unable to complete a strategic transaction, we may \ndiscontinue our development activities on Gencaro or rNAPc2 or discontinue our operations."

However, if the pandemic continues to be a severe worldwide crisis, it could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nResults of Operations \nResearch and Development Expenses \nResearch and development, or R&D, expense is comprised primarily of personnel costs, clinical development, manufacturing process \ndevelopment, and regulatory activities and costs. \nOur research and development expenses were $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $13.8 million for \n2021. The $9.1 million decrease in research and development expenses in 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily related to the \ncompletion of enrollment in our rNAPc2 (AB201) international Phase 2b clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2021.  \nClinical expense decreased approximately $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

In July \n2022, we implemented a strategic reduction of our workforce by approximately 67%, or 12 employees. Personnel reductions were \nprimarily focused in research and development and general and administrative functions. The restructuring was a result of our decision \nto manage our operating costs and expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded total restructuring charges of \napproximately $755,000, of which $470,000 and $285,000 were recognized in research and development and general and \nadministrative expenses, respectively, in connection with the restructuring, all in the form of one-time termination benefits.\nR&D expense in 2023 is expected to be lower than 2022, as we completed our rNAPc2 (AB201) international Phase 2b clinical trial in \nthe fourth quarter of 2021.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses \nGeneral and administrative, or G&A, expenses primarily consist of personnel costs, consulting and professional fees, insurance, \nfacilities and depreciation expenses, and various other administrative costs."

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the \nCompany as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in \nconformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these \nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight \nBoard (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal \nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit \nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. \nThe Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part \nof our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of \nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no \nsuch opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to \nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence \nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used \nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe \nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  \nCritical Audit Matter\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required \nto be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements \nand (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ KPMG LLP \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2006.\nBoulder, Colorado \nFebruary 24, 2023"

      "text": "54\nARCA BIOPHARMA, INC. \n \nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n(1) The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \nDescription of Business \nARCA biopharma, Inc. (the Company or ARCA), a Delaware corporation, is headquartered in Westminster, Colorado. The Company \nis a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company applying a precision medicine approach to the development and commercialization of \ngenetically targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases. The Company’s lead product candidate is Gencaro™ (bucindolol \nhydrochloride) for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with chronic heart failure (HF). \nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors established a Special Committee and, in May 2022, retained Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. to \nevaluate strategic options, including transactions involving a merger, sale of all or part of the Company’s assets, or other alternatives \nwith the goal of maximizing stockholder value. The Company does not have a defined timeline for the strategic review process and the \nreview may not result in any specific action or transaction.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nThe Company devotes substantially all of its efforts towards obtaining regulatory approval and raising capital necessary to fund its \noperations and it is subject to a number of risks associated with clinical research and development, including dependence on key \nindividuals, the development of and regulatory approval of commercially viable products, the need to raise adequate additional \nfinancing necessary to fund the development and commercialization of its products, and competition from larger companies. The \nCompany has not generated revenue to date and has incurred substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations since its \ninception. The Company has historically funded its operations through issuances of common and preferred stock. \nThe Company believes that its current cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 will be sufficient to fund its operations \nthrough the middle of fiscal year 2024. The Company's review of its strategic options may impact this projection. Changing \ncircumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower than currently anticipated. The Company has based these \nestimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and the Company could exhaust its available financial resources sooner than the \nCompany currently anticipates. Therefore, the Company will have to raise additional capital for clinical trials of Gencaro. The \nCompany may not be able to raise sufficient capital on acceptable terms, or at all, to continue development of Gencaro or rNAPc2 or \nto otherwise continue operations and may not be able to execute any strategic transaction.\nThe Company’s liquidity, and its ability to raise additional capital or complete any strategic transaction, depends on a number of \nfactors, including, but not limited to, the following: \n•\nthe costs and timing for the potential additional clinical trials in order to gain possible regulatory approval for Gencaro, \nrNAPc2, or any other product candidate;\n•\nthe market price of the Company’s stock and the availability and cost of additional equity capital from existing and \npotential new investors; \n•\nthe Company’s ability to retain the listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market; \n•\ngeneral economic and industry conditions affecting the availability and cost of capital, including as a result of deteriorating \nmarket conditions due to investor concerns regarding inflation and continued hostilities between Russia and Ukraine; \n•\nthe Company’s ability to control costs associated with its operations; \n•\nthe costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and \n•\nthe terms and conditions of the Company’s existing collaborative and licensing agreements. \nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely result in substantial additional dilution to the Company’s \nstockholders. If the Company raises additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, the obligations related to such \nindebtedness would be senior to rights of holders of the Company’s capital stock and could contain covenants that would restrict the \nCompany’s operations. The Company also cannot predict what consideration might be available, if any, to the Company or its \nstockholders, in connection with any strategic transaction. Should strategic alternatives or additional capital not be available to the \nCompany, or not be available on acceptable terms, the Company may be unable to realize value from its assets and discharge its \nliabilities in the normal course of business which may, among other alternatives, cause the Company to further delay, substantially \nreduce or discontinue operational activities to conserve its cash resources."

      "text": "55\nBasis of Presentation \nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. \nGAAP) and include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows \nfor the periods presented. Management has performed an evaluation of the Company’s activities through the date of filing of this \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.  \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \nThe Company reviewed all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they were either not applicable or not \nexpected to have a significant impact to the financial statements.\nAccounting Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America \nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of \ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting \nperiod. The Company bases estimates on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The \nCompany believes significant judgment was involved in estimating the outsourcing expenses, and in estimating other accrued \nliabilities and income taxes. Management is continually evaluating and updating these estimates, and it is possible that these estimates \nwill change in the future or that actual results may differ from these estimates. \nCash Equivalents \nCash equivalents generally consist of money market funds and debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the time of \npurchase. The Company invests its excess cash in securities with strong ratings and has established guidelines relative to \ndiversification and maturity with the objective of maintaining safety of principal and liquidity. \nConcentrations of Credit Risk \nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and \ncash equivalents. The Company has no off-balance-sheet concentrations of credit risk, such as foreign exchange contracts, option \ncontracts, or foreign currency hedging arrangements. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances in the form of bank \ndemand deposits and money market fund accounts with financial institutions that management believes are creditworthy. Such \nbalances may at times exceed the insured amount. \nProperty and Equipment \nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Cost includes expenditures for equipment, \nleasehold improvements, replacements, and renewals. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are \nsold, retired, or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or \nloss is reflected in operations. The cost of property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated \nuseful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the lease or the estimated useful \nlife of the assets."

      "text": "56\nComprehensive Loss\nComprehensive loss is defined as the change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and/or circumstances from \nnon-owner sources. If the Company had comprehensive gains (losses), they would be reflected in the statement of operations and \ncomprehensive loss and as a separate component in the statement of stockholders’ equity. There were no elements of comprehensive \nloss during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in right-of-use (ROU) asset – \noperating and lease obligations are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities and operating lease liability on the Company’s \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 balance sheets.\nROU lease assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease obligations represent the \nCompany’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating ROU lease assets are recognized at the \ncommencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s lease does not provide an \nimplicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in \ndetermining the present value of lease payments. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease \nwhen it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the lease term.\nAccrued Outsourcing Expenses \nAs part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to estimate accrued outsourcing expenses. This \nprocess involves identifying services that third parties have performed on the Company’s behalf and estimating the level of service \nperformed and the associated cost incurred for these services as of the balance sheet date. Examples of estimated accrued outsourcing \nexpenses include contract service fees, such as fees payable to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of materials \nrelated to the Company’s drug product, and service fees and pass through costs from clinical research organizations. The Company \ndevelops estimates of liabilities using its judgment based upon the facts and circumstances known at the time. \nSegments \nThe Company operates in one segment. Management uses one measure of profitability and does not segment its business for internal \nreporting. \nResearch and Development \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. These consist primarily of salaries, contract services, and supplies. \nCosts related to clinical trial and drug manufacturing activities are based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses \nincurred by contract research organizations (CROs), clinical study sites, drug manufacturers, collaboration partners, laboratories, \nconsultants, or otherwise. Related contracts vary significantly in length, and could be for a fixed amount, a variable amount based on \nactual costs incurred, capped at a certain limit, or for a combination of these elements. Activity levels are monitored through \ncommunications with the vendors, including detailed invoices and task completion review, analysis of expenses against budgeted \namounts, and pre-approval of any changes in scope of the services to be performed. Certain significant vendors may also provide an \nestimate of costs incurred but not invoiced on a periodic basis. Expenses related to the CROs and clinical studies, as well as contract \ndrug manufacturers, are primarily based on progress made against specified milestones or targets in each period. \nIn accordance with certain research and development agreements, the Company is obligated to make certain upfront payments upon \nexecution of the agreement. The Company records these upfront payments as prepaid research and development expenses, which are \nincluded in Other current assets or Other assets in the accompanying Balance Sheets. Such payments are recorded to research and \ndevelopment expense as services are performed. The Company evaluates on a quarterly basis whether events and circumstances have \noccurred that may indicate impairment of remaining prepaid research and development expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation \nThe Company’s stock-based compensation cost recognized is based on the estimated grant date fair value. The Company recognizes \ncompensation costs for its stock-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award, as adjusted \nfor expected forfeitures."

      "text": "57\nIncome Taxes \nThe current benefit for income taxes represents actual or estimated amounts payable or refundable on tax returns filed or to be filed \neach year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences \nbetween the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and \ntax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that \nincludes the enactment date. The overall change in deferred tax assets and liabilities for the period measures the deferred tax expense \nor benefit for the period. The measurement of deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance based on judgmental \nassessment of available evidence if deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. \n(2) Net Loss Per Share \nThe Company calculates basic loss per share by dividing net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the \nperiod. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during \nthe period increased to include, if dilutive, the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential \ncommon shares had been issued. The Company’s potentially dilutive shares include stock options, restricted stock units and warrants \nfor common stock. \nBecause the Company reported a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, all potentially dilutive shares of common \nstock have been excluded from the computation of the dilutive net loss per share for all periods presented. Such potentially dilutive \nshares of common stock consist of the following:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\nPotentially dilutive securities, excluded:\nOutstanding stock options .............................................\n704,960\n904,123\nUnvested restricted stock units......................................\n91,000\n—\nWarrants to purchase common stock.............................\n—\n133,401\n795,960\n1,037,524\n(3) Fair Value Disclosures \nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between \nmarket participants at the measurement date (exit price). Inputs used to measure fair value are classified into the following hierarchy: \n•\nLevel 1—Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company’s Level 1 assets \nconsist of money market investments. The Company does not have any Level 1 liabilities. \n•\nLevel 2—Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; unadjusted quoted prices for identical \nor similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the \nasset or liability. The Company’s Level 2 assets consist of corporate bonds and commercial paper securities. The Company \ndoes not have any Level 2 liabilities. \n•\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The Company does not have any Level 3 assets or liabilities. \nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $42.4 million and $53.3 million, respectively, of cash equivalents consisting of \nmoney market funds with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company has the ability to liquidate these investments without \nrestriction. The Company determines fair value for these money market funds with Level 1 inputs through quoted market prices. There \nwere no transfers between any fair value hierarchy levels in 2022 or 2021. \nFair Value of Other Financial Instruments \nThe carrying amount of other financial instruments, including accounts payable, approximated fair value due to their short maturities. \nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any debt outstanding."

Funding of any unrestricted research grants is contingent upon the Company’s financial \ncondition, and can be deferred or terminated at the Company’s discretion. Total expense under these arrangements for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 was $432,000 and $439,000, respectively, of which $216,000 was unpaid and included in accrued \nexpenses and other liabilities as of December 31, 2022.   \n(6) Commitments and Contingencies \nThe Company has or is subject to the following commitments and contingencies: \nEmployment Agreements and Reduction of Workforce\nThe Company maintains employment agreements with several key executive employees. The agreements may be terminated at any \ntime by the Company with or without cause upon written notice to the employee, and entitle the employee to wages in lieu of notice \nfor periods not exceeding one calendar year from date of termination without cause or by the employee for good reason. Certain of \nthese agreements also provide for payments to be made under certain conditions related to a change in control of the Company. \nIn December 2022, the Company's Board of Directors approved retention bonuses for certain employees, subject to continued \nemployment with the Company through the earlier of a change in control of the Company or certain clinical development decisions \ntotaling $265,000, none of which was accrued as of December 31, 2022, since there had not been a change in control or clinical \ndevelopment decision.\nIn 2022, the Company implemented a strategic reduction of the workforce by approximately 67%, or 12 employees. Personnel \nreductions were primarily focused in research and development and general and administrative functions. The restructuring was a \nresult of the Company’s decision to manage operating costs and expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company \nrecorded total restructuring charges of approximately $755,000, of which $470,000 and $285,000 were recognized in research and \ndevelopment and general and administrative expenses, respectively, in connection with the restructuring, all in the form of one-time \ntermination benefits. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $57,000 of the total restructuring charges remains unpaid and was \nincluded in accrued compensation and employee benefits."

In \naddition, under the amended Sales Agreement, JonesTrading may sell the Shares by any other method permitted by law, including in \nnegotiated transactions. The Company may instruct JonesTrading not to sell Shares if the sales cannot be effected at or above the price \ndesignated by the Company from time to time. \nThe Company is not obligated to make any sales of the Shares under the Sales Agreement. The offering of Shares pursuant to the \nSales Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (a) the sale of all of the Shares subject to the Sales Agreement or (b) the \ntermination of the Sales Agreement by JonesTrading or the Company, as permitted therein. \nThe Company paid JonesTrading a commission rate equal to 3.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds from each sale of Shares and \nagreed to provide JonesTrading with customary indemnification and contribution rights. The Company will also reimburse \nJonesTrading for certain specified expenses in connection with entering into the Sales Agreement. \nNo sales were made in 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had sold an aggregate of 4,861,993 shares of its \nCommon Stock pursuant to the terms of the Sales Agreement for net proceeds of approximately $23.3 million, after deducting \nexpenses for executing the “at the market offering” and commissions paid to the placement agent.\nIn April 2021, the Company amended the 2020 Sales Agreement and the amount available for the offering under its prospectus to the \nCompany’s registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-254585). The amount available for the offering under the prospectus \nsupplement is subject to the limitation of not selling a total value amount of shares exceeding more than one-third of the Company’s \npublic float in any 12-month period.\n(8) Share-based Compensation \nStock Plans \nThe Company’s equity incentive plan, the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the Equity Plan), was approved by stockholders on December \n10, 2020. The maximum number of shares issuable under this plan is 1,167,425 shares.    \nThe Equity Plan provides for the granting of stock options (including indexed options), restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, \nrestricted stock purchase rights, restricted stock bonuses, performance shares, performance units and deferred stock units. Under the \nEquity Plan, awards may be granted to employees, directors and consultants of ARCA, except for incentive stock options, which may \nbe granted only to employees. As of December 31, 2022, options to purchase 684,400 shares with a weighted average exercise price of \n$3.47 per share were outstanding under the Equity Plan, and 371,487 shares were reserved for future awards. \nIn general, the Equity Plan authorizes the grant of stock options that vest at rates set by the Board of Directors or the Compensation \nCommittee thereof. Generally, stock options granted by ARCA under the equity incentive plans become exercisable ratably for a \nperiod of three to four years from the date of grant and have a maximum term of ten years. The exercise prices of stock options under \nthe equity incentive plan generally meet the following criteria: the exercise price of incentive stock options must be at least 100% of \nthe fair market value on the grant date and exercise price of options granted to 10% (or greater) stockholders must be at least 110% of \nthe fair market value on the grant date.   \nIn conjunction with the adoption of the Equity Plan, the Company discontinued grants under the 2013 Plan, effective December 10, \n2020. In conjunction with the adoption of the 2013 Plan, the Company discontinued grants under its previous plan the Amended and \nRestated ARCA biopharma, Inc. 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan), effective September 17, 2013. As of December 31, 2022, \noptions to purchase 20,538 shares with a weighted average exercise price of $77.12 per share were outstanding under the 2013 plan. \nThe 2004 Plan expired in 2014; however, options outstanding under the 2004 plan will continue to vest according to the original terms \nof each grant. As of December 31, 2022, options to purchase 22 shares with a weighted average exercise price of $172.79 per share \nwere outstanding under the 2004 plan."

As of December 31, 2022, the \nCompany has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $203.3 million, and approximately $2.4 million of research and \ndevelopment credits that may be used to offset future taxable income. The Company’s net operating loss carryforwards through \nDecember 31, 2017 will expire beginning 2025 through 2037. The net operating loss carryforwards beginning in 2018, have no \nexpiration. Utilization of net operating losses and tax credits, including those acquired as a result of the Merger, will be subject to an \nannual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by Internal Revenue Code Section 382. The Company believes that an \nownership change limitation as defined under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code occurred as a result of its various \nhistorical financing transactions. Future utilization of the federal net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards accumulated from \nJune 2005 to the change in ownership date will be subject to annual limitations to offset future taxable income. The annual limitation \nmay result in the expiration of the net operating losses and credits before utilization. As such, a portion of the Company’s net \noperating loss carryforwards may be limited."

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future \ntaxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled \nreversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Due \nprimarily to the Company’s history of operating losses, management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that the \nCompany will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, and accordingly has provided a valuation allowance against the \nentire net deferred tax assets and liabilities of approximately $54.4 million at December 31, 2022, reflecting an increase of \napproximately $2.3 million from December 31, 2021. The deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of net operating loss \ncarryforwards and research and experimentation credit carryforwards. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not performed an \nInternal Revenue Code Section 382 limitation study. Depending on the outcome of such a study, the gross amount of net operating \nlosses recognizable in future tax periods could be limited.

Controls and Procedures \nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial \nOfficer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in \nExchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial \nOfficer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual \nreport. \nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules \n13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to \nmanagement and our board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, \nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of \nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial \nOfficer, we have assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making our \nassessment of internal control over financial reporting, we used the criteria issued in the report Internal Control-Integrated Framework \n(2013) by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). We have concluded that our internal \ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022 based on these criteria. \nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal \ncontrol over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting \nfirm pursuant to the exemption from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for non-accelerated filers provided by the Dodd-Frank \nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. \nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, \nor are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls \nOur management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure \ncontrols and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no \nmatter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system \nare met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all \ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. \nItem 9B.

Jeffrey Dekker, Chief Financial Officer, the Company’s principal financial officer hired in May 2021.\nHistorically, the Compensation Committee has made most of the significant adjustments to annual compensation, determined \nbonus and equity awards and established new performance objectives at one or more meetings held during the first quarter of the year. \nHowever, the Compensation Committee also considers matters related to individual compensation, such as compensation for new \nexecutive hires, as well as high-level strategic issues, such as the efficacy of the Company’s compensation strategy, potential \nmodifications to that strategy and new trends, plans or approaches to compensation, at various meetings throughout the year. \nGenerally, the Compensation Committee’s process comprises two related elements: the determination of compensation levels and the \nestablishment of performance objectives for the current year.\nThe Compensation Committee reviews and approves the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and the other \nexecutive officers of the Company, including annual base salaries, annual and long-term incentive or bonus awards, employment \nagreements, and severance and change in control agreements/provisions, in each case as, when and if appropriate, and any special or \nsupplemental benefits. For executives other than the Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee solicits and considers \nevaluations and recommendations submitted to the Compensation Committee by the Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation \nCommittee evaluates the performance of the Chief Executive Officer in light of Company and individual goals and objectives, and \nmakes appropriate recommendations for improving performance. In performing the evaluation, the Chair of the Compensation \nCommittee may solicit comments from the other non-employee members of the Board of Directors and lead the Board of Directors in \nan overall review of the Chief Executive Officer’s performance in an executive session of non-employee members of the Board of \nDirectors. If the compensation for the Chief Executive Officer or any other executive officer is governed by an employment \nagreement, the Compensation Committee approves such employment agreement and any amendments thereto.\nFor all executives as part of its deliberations, the Compensation Committee may review and consider, as appropriate, \nmaterials such as financial reports and projections, operational data, tax and accounting information, tally sheets that set forth the total \ncompensation that may become payable to executives in various hypothetical scenarios, executive and director stock ownership \ninformation, company stock performance data, analyses of historical executive compensation levels and current Company-wide \ncompensation levels.\nThe Compensation Committee also considers the results of any “say-on-pay” vote of the Company’s stockholders with regard \nto the compensation of the Company’s executive officers when making compensation decisions. At the 2022 annual meeting of \nstockholders, the Company’s stockholders approved, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company’s named executive \nofficers as described in the proxy statement for such annual meeting, with over 91% of stockholder votes cast in favor of our \n“say-on-pay” resolution. The Compensation Committee believes that this advisory vote supports that the Company’s current \ncompensation practices are aligned with the best interests of stockholders and anticipates taking into account the results of the \nadvisory vote, and any future advisory votes, when making compensation decisions in the future.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, or the Nominating and Corporate \nGovernance Committee, is responsible for identifying, reviewing and evaluating candidates to serve as directors of the Company \n(consistent with criteria approved by the Board of Directors), reviewing and evaluating incumbent directors, recommending to the \nBoard of Directors candidates for election to the Board of Directors, making recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding \ncompensation for service on the Board of Directors and the committees thereof, making recommendations to the Board of Directors \nregarding the membership of the committees of the Board of Directors, assessing the performance of the Board of Directors and \ndeveloping a set of corporate governance principles for the Company. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is \ncomposed of three directors: Dr. Hove, Mr. Mitchell and Dr. Woosley (chair). All members of the Nominating and Corporate \nGovernance Committee in 2022 were independent (as independence is currently defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq listing \nstandards). The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met once during the 2022 fiscal year. The Nominating and \nCorporate Governance Committee has adopted a written charter that is available to stockholders on the Company’s website at \nwww.arcabio.com.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee periodically reviews the compensation of non-employee Directors \nfor service on the Board of Directors and committees thereof. In 2015, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee began a \nreview of its Director compensation levels considering general market conditions in the life science industry, and in comparison to \nother clinical stage biopharmaceutical companies, and in early 2016, the Committee recommended, and the Board of Directors \napproved, revised compensation for non-employee Directors, discussed in “Director Compensation” below. Since adoption of this \npolicy, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has reviewed Director compensation on an annual basis.\nIn 2020, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (together with the Compensation Committee) engaged a \nconsultant to evaluate the current compensation of the Company’s non-employee directors and make recommendations to the \nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The changes made as a result of this evaluation are discussed in “Director \nCompensation” below."

      "text": "72\nThe Board of Directors has adopted a process for identifying and evaluating director nominees, including stockholder \nnominees. Before recommending an individual to the Board of Directors for membership on the Board of Directors, the Nominating \nand Corporate Governance Committee canvasses its members and the Company’s management team for potential candidates for the \nBoard of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also uses its network of contacts to identify potential \ncandidates and, if it deems appropriate, may also engage a professional search firm. The Nominating and Corporate Governance \nCommittee will consider stockholders’ recommendations for nominees to serve as director if notice is timely received by the Secretary \nof the Company. Candidates nominated by stockholders will be evaluated in the same manner as other candidates. The Nominating \nand Corporate Governance Committee keeps the Board of Directors apprised of its discussions with potential nominees, and the \nnames of potential nominees received from its current directors, management, and stockholders, if the stockholder notice of \nnomination is timely made.\nAlthough the Board of Directors has not adopted a fixed set of minimum qualifications for candidates for membership on the \nBoard of Directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee generally considers several factors in its evaluation of a \npotential member, such as the candidate’s education, professional background and field of expertise including industry or academic \nexperience in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields, experience in corporate governance and management, the reasonable \navailability of the potential member to devote time to the affairs of the Company, as well as any other criteria deemed relevant by the \nBoard of Directors or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. However, the Nominating and Corporate Governance \nCommittee retains the right to modify these qualifications from time to time. Candidates for director nominees are reviewed in the \ncontext of the current composition of the Board of Directors, the operating requirements of the Company and the long-term interests \nof stockholders. In conducting this assessment, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee typically considers diversity, \nage, skills and such other factors as it deems appropriate given the current needs of the Board of Directors and the Company, to \nmaintain a balance of knowledge, experience and capability. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes it is \nessential that Board of Directors members come from a variety of backgrounds and experiences.\nIn the case of incumbent directors whose terms of office are set to expire, the Nominating and Corporate Governance \nCommittee reviews these directors’ overall contributions to the Company and the Board of Directors during their terms, including \nlevel of attendance, level of participation, quality of performance and contribution to the Board of Directors’ responsibilities and \nactions, and any relationships and transactions that might impair the directors’ independence. In the case of new director candidates, \nthe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also determines whether the nominee is independent for Nasdaq and SEC \npurposes, which determination is based upon applicable Nasdaq listing standards, applicable SEC rules and regulations and the advice \nof counsel, if necessary. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee conducts any appropriate and necessary inquiries into \nthe backgrounds and qualifications of possible candidates after considering the function and needs of the Board of Directors. The \nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee meets to discuss and consider the candidates’ qualifications and then determines \nwhether to recommend a nominee to the Board of Directors by majority vote.\nStockholders who wish to recommend individuals for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance \nCommittee to become nominees for election to the Board of Directors may do so by delivering a written recommendation to the \nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee addressed to the Corporate Secretary, between 60 and 90 days before the one year \nanniversary date of ARCA’s last annual meeting of stockholders. Recommendations must include the full name of the proposed \nnominee, a description of the proposed nominee’s business experience for at least the previous five years, complete biographical \ninformation, a description of the proposed nominee’s qualifications as a director, and a representation that the recommending \nstockholder is a beneficial or record owner of ARCA’s stock. Any such submission must be accompanied by the written consent of the \nproposed nominee to be named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected. To date, the Nominating and Corporate Governance \nCommittee has not rejected a timely director nominee from a stockholder.\nIn 2022, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee did not pay any fees to assist in the process of identifying or \nevaluating director candidates.\nStockholder Communications with the Board of Directors\nStockholders who wish to communicate with the Board of Directors may do so by e-mail by using the following email \naddress: directors@arcabio.com; or by mail by following the directions as set forth on ARCA’s website at www.arcabio.com, under \nthe section titled “Corporate Governance” and the subsection titled “Governance Documents”.

The philosophy employed was to create incentives for the executive officers to achieve key corporate goals. \nThe Compensation Committee retained discretion to change the bonus structure and the bonus payment amounts as it considered \nappropriate. \n2021 Goals\nThe Company’s 2021 goals were based on (1) executing our development plan for rNAPc2 (AB201), our clinical product \ncandidate for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 (2) further defining our development plan for Gencaro, our clinical product \ncandidate for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, and (3) finance and corporate compliance goals.\nThe Board of Directors did not approve any payouts under the 2021 Bonus Plan since the primary endpoints for rNAPc2 \nPhase 2b clinical trial were not met. \n2020 Cash Bonus Plan\nOn January 29, 2021, the Compensation Committee approved cash bonuses for certain employees. The cash bonuses were \npaid in 2021 for performance in 2020, including attainment of the Company’s 2020 Goals under its 2020 Cash Bonus Plan (the “2020 \nGoals”), as determined by the Compensation Committee. The 2020 bonuses were based on the Board of Directors’ determination with \nrespect to the Company’s achievement of the 2020 Goals.\nThe 2020 Goals were based on (1) obtaining additional financing (2) rNAPc2 (AB201) IND approval, and (3) enrollment of \nrNAPc2 (AB201) clinical trial. \nOther Elements of Executive Compensation Program \nThe remaining elements of the Company’s executive compensation program, like its broader employee compensation \nprograms, are intended to make the Company’s overall compensation program competitive with those of its peer companies, keeping \nin mind the constraints imposed by the Company’s reliance on capital markets as a primary source of cash. The remaining elements of \nthe Company’s executive compensation program, (401(k) Plan, Medical, Dental, and Vision Plans, Life and Disability Insurance) are \navailable to all Company employees."

The Amended 2013 Plan only has \noptions outstanding as of December 31, 2022, no warrants or rights are outstanding under this plan; therefore, all values in the above \ntable relate solely to the outstanding options. \nCompensation Risks \nWe believe our approach to goal setting, setting of targets with payouts at multiple levels of performance, and evaluation of \nperformance results assist in mitigating excessive risk-taking that could harm the value or reward poor judgment by our executives. \nWe believe several features of our programs reflect sound risk management practices. We believe we have allocated compensation \namong base salary and short and long-term compensation target opportunities in such a way as to not encourage excessive risk-taking. \nThe multi-year vesting of equity awards properly accounts for the time horizon of risk. Furthermore, the Compensation Committee \nassesses and monitors whether any of our compensation policies and programs has the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking on \nan annual basis.\nSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the ownership of the Company’s Common Stock as of February \n15, 2023, by: (i) each director, (ii) each of our named executive officers, (iii) all executive officers and directors of the Company as a \ngroup and (iv) all those known by the Company to be beneficial owners of more than five percent of its Common Stock. Unless \notherwise noted below, the address of each beneficial owner listed on the table is c/o ARCA biopharma, Inc., 10170 Church Ranch \nWay, Suite 100, Westminster, Colorado, 80021.  \nWe have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Except as indicated by the footnotes \nbelow, we believe, based on the information furnished to us, that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting \nand investment power with respect to all shares of Common Stock that they beneficially own, subject to applicable community \nproperty laws. The table is based upon information supplied by officers, directors and principal stockholders and Schedules 13G or \n13D, Form 4s or other ownership reports filed with the SEC. \nIn computing the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that \nperson, we deemed outstanding shares of Common Stock subject to options or warrants held by that person that are currently \nexercisable or exercisable within 60 days of February 15, 2023.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence \nIndependence of the Board of Directors\nAs required under the Nasdaq listing standards, a majority of the members of a listed company’s board of directors must \nqualify as “independent,” as affirmatively determined by the board of directors. Our Board of Directors consults with the Company’s \ncounsel to ensure that the Board of Directors’ determinations are consistent with relevant securities and other laws and regulations \nregarding the definition of “independent,” including those set forth in pertinent listing standards of the Nasdaq, as in effect from time \nto time. \nConsistent with these considerations, after review of all relevant identified transactions or relationships between each \ndirector, or any of his or her family members, and the Company, its senior management and its independent registered public \naccounting firm, the Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that the following five directors are independent directors within \nthe meaning of the applicable Nasdaq listing standards: Mr. Conway, Dr. Grais, Mr. Mitchell, Dr. Hove and Dr. Woosley. In making \nthis determination, the Board of Directors found that none of the directors had a material or other disqualifying relationship with the \nCompany. Dr. Bristow, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer is not an independent director by virtue of his \nemployment relationship with the Company. \nCertain Transactions With or Involving Related Persons\nThe following is a summary of transactions since January 1, 2021, or any currently proposed transaction, in which we were \nor are a participant and the amount involved exceeds the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at fiscal \nyear end for 2022 and 2021, and in which any of our executive officers, directors or holders of more than 5% of our capital stock, or \nany member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest, other than \ncompensation arrangements disclosed in “Item 11.
