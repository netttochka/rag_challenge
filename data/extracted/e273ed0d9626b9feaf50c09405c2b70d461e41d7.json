As the person responsible for leading these efforts, I \nwould like first to discuss what needs to be valued and what needs to be done for Toshiba to truly be Toshiba.\nThroughout its history, Toshiba has created many things that did not exist previously through its own inge­\nnuity, and has provided such creation to the society. What has made this innovation possible is by bringing \ntogether a broad array of specialists and harnessing highly diverse R&D capabilities in the name of values that \ngo beyond the mere pursuit of profit. In order to exist as a company that constantly generates the next new \nthing as expected by the society, we intend to build new businesses rooted in our Basic Commitment while \nmaintaining a foundation for innovation. In this way, we will fulfill society’s expectations.\nToward a sustainable future, we intend to maximize the power of data with a view to the further evolution \nof the digital economy. This will be based on the business assets we have built up in the infrastructure sector. \nThrough products and services already being provided to customers, including automatic ticket gates, ETC \nsystems, elevators, and POS systems, we have the ability to acquire large amounts of data, and we intend to \nconnect this data and convert it into value. With regard to carbon neutrality initiatives, issues cannot be solved \nwithout data for making CO2 emissions and environmental impact transparent. While expanding our data busi­\nness to enhance the value of infrastructure, we will work to achieve carbon neutrality and a circular economy.\nWhat needs to be done for Toshiba to be Toshiba\n05\nToshiba Integrated Report 2022"

      "text": "Under the Toshiba Next Plan launched in FY2018, earnings improved and Toshiba became a company capable \nof generating profit consistently. It was an outcome of our success in materializing the low hanging fruits that \ncan be achieved in the short term, including structural reforms and cross-functional team (CFT) activities in \nprocurement, sales, and other areas. To continue improving earnings going forward, the key will be to convert \nto an asset-light business model while promoting value chain transformation, including product and design \nmodularization, and also IT systems in which IT and digital are fully utilized for the realization of business pro­\ncess reforms.\nIn addition, while making data services business a pillar of earnings, we will raise its operating income \nmargin to 26% toward FY2030 and use this business to generate 20% (120.0 billion yen) of the operating in­\ncome out of 600.0 billion yen that we are projecting for the company overall.\nTo achieve this goal, there are two issues Toshiba needs to resolve: “internal rigidity” and “external rigidity.” \nWe will carry out three strategies—digital evolution (DE) to enhance services and recurring businesses, digital \ntransformation (DX) to build platforms based on DE, and quantum transformation (QX) to create a quantum \nworld where various platforms are connected across industries—in order to accommodate to changing society \nalong with the further evolution of the digital economy. Promoting these strategies will not be possible without \nbreaking through the two rigidities.\nInternal rigidity is when internal organizations become siloed and do not effectively share information nor \nthe results of improvement activities. In today’s digital, service-oriented era, what was once the right business \nunit at the time of its inception is no longer relevant, and what actually needs to be done to serve customers \nbecame different. Separating software from hardware is the key to overcome this dilemma. Currently, the prod­\nuct is developed in a vertically divided organization in silos, and the software is incorporated into the hardware \nand provided as a part of a system. Separating software from hardware will allow to make updates and func­\ntional upgrades at the software level alone. Doing so will then enable us to add variety of applications, which \nwill generate new services that allow customers to use functions that they only need in the amount that they \nwant, which will enhance recurring business and enable us to fully realize DE. Furthermore, by creating soft­\nware platforms and connecting them to other companies’ hardware and applications, we will achieve DX that \nfurther expand our data services business. Beyond that, under QX, optimal solutions are identified from com­\nplex interplay of various platforms created under DX through quantum technology.\nOn the other hand, external rigidity is the challenge that Toshiba faces because Toshiba tries to do every­\nthing by itself, and unable to leverage R&D diversity and convert achievements into business value. Going for­\nward, through collaboration with external parties, we will ensure that values of high potential technologies \nwith a large market to be realized as quickly as possible. \nBreaking down two types of rigidity to transform our business model\n06\nToshiba Integrated Report 2022"

      "text": "Message from CEO\nWe have enormous customer access points through providing products and services in the area of infrastruc­\nture, and this makes it possible for us to acquire data from both consumers and industry. This will be Toshiba’s \nmajor market advantage in expanding data services business through DX.\nFor example, in businesses that start with people flow data, new services will be created by leveraging us­\nage data on lighting, elevators, escalators, cash registers, trains, roads, and more. In businesses based on ener­\ngy and CO2 data, we will harness our extremely unique position that we have from being involved at every stage \nof energy business, from generation to distribution, storage, and use. This will enable us to provide more ad­\nvanced energy balancing function and to visualize CO2 emission in supply chains utilizing data on renewable \nenergy output predictions and electricity demand forecasts.\nIn data services business, privacy and security risks related to data handling must be considered, and con­\nfident systems must be established. Based on the general assumption that the right of data that comes from \npeople should belong to its person, and should never be used against their will, we have solicited the opinions \nof specialists in the law and ethics and engaged in repeated discussions over the past several years with a view \nto providing people-friendly services with high added value. We have developed systems to provide robust \ndata security and proactive privacy protections that put people first, not companies, and we are promoting \nhighly progressive initiatives ahead of other companies.\nAt the same time, to lay a foundation for future business development through QX, we are accelerating R&D \nand actual commercialization of quantum technologies. In particular, with respect to our commercial demon­\nstration of quantum cryptography technology, we are in the top position globally and going forward plan to \nlaunch services around the world simultaneously. After that, we will promote diverse development and pro­\nposals through collaboration between industry, academia and government to create industry through quan­\ntum technology. There are no other companies with QX as a core component of their strategies. This is a major \nendeavor that will bring about development not only for Japan but for humanity as a whole.\nToshiba’s market superiority in data services business\nToshiba is holding discussions with potential investors and sponsors as potential partners and reviewing stra­\ntegic alternatives that include privatization. This process is being led by the management team but is also be­\ning overseen by the Special Committee, which is made up entirely of independent outside directors in order to \neliminate arbitrariness, and on this basis we will work to ensure transparency to the full extent possible to keep \nfrom negatively affecting competition among the potential partners.\nAs the Representative Executive Officer, President and CEO, I am involved in these discussions and also \nparticipate as an observer on the Special Committee. In addition, it is the Board of Directors that will make the \nfinal determination based on the matters reviewed by the management team and Special Committee, and as \na director I will have one vote. To maximize corporate value, we will fully consider all options, and I will faithful­\nly carry out my mission.\nConsidering strategic alternatives for maximizing corporate value\n07\nToshiba Integrated Report 2022"

      "text": "I am Akihiro Watanabe, and I have been a member of the Board of Directors since June 2022, serving as Chairperson of the \nBoard.\nIn assuming the position of Chairperson, I have received words of encouragement from many people in Japan and over­\nseas, and I realized that Toshiba is truly a company that is loved by many people.\nI used to manage an M&A advisory company listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which merged with a \nU.S. company and went private in November 2021. I understand that my experience in privatizing the company I founded and \nmy 30-year career as an M&A advisor are highly valued, and this persuaded me to accept the position of Chairperson of Toshi­\nba's Board of Directors.\nMy knowledge of Toshiba was limited, as I had very limited contact with the company earlier in my career. As an accountant, \nmy impression of the company was that it was a troubled company which had suffered many scandals in recent years. Howev­\ner, my perception changed dramatically when I began to study the company upon accepting the Chairperson position. That is \nwhen I was touched by Toshiba's corporate philosophy, \"Committed to People, Committed to the Future.\" I was so impressed \nthat I got goosebumps. I don't know any other company that has such a wonderful corporate philosophy, and I was really proud \nthat there was a Japanese company that had such an inspirational philosophy long before the words ESG and SDGs were \nthought up.\nI feel that Toshiba's underlying strength is its employees, including those I have met at research laboratories and factories. \nThey are all truly good and excellent people, and that they work enthusiastically for the benefit of customers and society. From \nmy own experience, I strongly believe that the power to overcome many crises lies in the power of people. The company I \nfounded was a venture that started out with scarce human, material, or financial resources. The only way for a venture compa­\nny to survive is to maximize the capabilities of its people, and that is the job of the management. In fact, it was thanks to the \nefforts of our employees that we were able to overcome numerous crises that followed its formation, including the Lehman \nShock, the Great East Japan Earthquake, Brexit, and the COVID-19 pandemic. People have told me that I took a big risk by be­\ncoming Chairperson, however, I believe that Toshiba has a bright future because of its excellent corporate philosophy and tal­\nented employees.\nNow that it has been a few months since I took the job, I have come to realize that Toshiba is truly a “good” company, but \nnot a “strong” one. It has to address various challenges in order to become a stronger Toshiba. For example, Toshiba has an \ninvaluable ecosystem in Japan in which each business monetizes the innovations of the Central Research Laboratory and uses \nthe funds to create the next innovation. When you get down to the nitty-gritty of Toshiba's ecosystem, the current diverse busi­\nness entities are giant venture funds that produce cash to generate ESG innovations. However, the scale of Toshiba has changed \ndue to divestments made in the past. We are now at a point where we need to explore a new way to sustain this ecosystem. \nThat is exactly the reason why the entire Board is seeking a strategic alternative which includes privatization as one option. \nThis is also a process that is designed to address the various challenges Toshiba currently faces to find the most suitable path \nforward in the best interests of all stakeholders, including shareholders. We are considering all possible alternatives, free from \nthe influence of any particular stakeholder. The option we select must be feasible, and a strategy that allows Toshiba to grow \nover the medium to long term while preserving the best of Toshiba, and leads to the generation of cash flows.\nIn discussing corporate value, we must not forget the non-financial values of corporate philosophy and the significance of \nToshiba's existence in society. It is most important that Toshiba pay close attention to intangible assets that are not recorded on \nthe balance sheet, such as R&D, patents and human resources, and to maximize their long-term value. I believe that manage­\nment must show each employee the mountain we have to climb and to lead and encourage each employee to have an image \nof their own personal growth and to work with excitement and dreams.\nMessage from the Chairperson of the Board \nof Directors\n09\nToshiba Integrated Report 2022"

All 12 board members are among the best in the \nworld. They reflect not only diversity in nationality, gender and generation, but also have diverse experience, ranging from cor­\nporate management, corporate restructuring, extensive knowledge of fraud-related matters, to deep insight into capital mar­\nkets. I am certain that the reappointed Board members, who have already had to make challenging decisions, and the new \nBoard members will operate with a sense of unity and mutual respect. The shareholders have shown confidence in us, and we \nhave a responsibility to act in the best interests of all stakeholders. To ensure a healthy and constructive debate among our­\nselves at this diverse Board, we aim to establish best boardroom practices, and strive to steadily improve its operation.\nThe job of the Chairperson and outside directors is to support and oversee the CEO and other managers as they work hard \nto create value for shareholders and stakeholders. The Board and management are completely aligned on the need to maxi­\nmize Toshiba’s corporate value, and see the need for radical transformation in achieving this goal. In addition to this, we are at \na point in our company's history where we must address the very important topic of considering strategic alternatives.\nIt is no easy task to pursue the best interests of all stakeholders, including shareholders, while at the same time engaging in \nsustainable management that contributes to the \ndevelopment of society through business. How­\never, Toshiba has an excellent corporate philoso­\nphy, talented employees, and world-class direc­\ntors. Above all, we have stakeholders who love \nToshiba. At a time when we must tackle global \nchallenges such as carbon neutrality, we must \nnot forget that Toshiba has stakeholders beyond \nthe existing definition of stakeholders, namely, \nthe stakeholders of tomorrow's Earth.\nAs Chairperson of the Board of Directors, I \nam committed to serving the best interests of \nToshiba and all its stakeholders, as expressed in \nour corporate philosophy, “Committed to Peo­\nple, Committed to the Future.”  I promise to do \nmy utmost to support the management as it \nseeks to maximize Toshiba’s corporate value.\nOctober, 2022\nAkihiro Watanabe\nOutside Director\nChairperson of the Board of Directors\n10\nToshiba Integrated Report 2022"

      "text": "Toward the realization of a carbon neutral society, in Japan, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced “Green Growth Strat­\negy Through Achieving Carbon Neutrality in 2050”*1 which declared the policy of increasing a percentage of renewable energy in the do­\nmestic power generation amount to 50-60% by 2050. Especially, to promote transportation electrification, the tandem solar cell which can \nsupply power necessary for operation is expected to be more needed by mobility systems such as automobiles and trains which offer only \nlimited installation space for a solar cell.\nTandem solar cells can raise an overall conversion efficiency by layering two solar cells as a bottom cell and a top cell to generate \npower together. While the development of a highly efficient and low-cost top cell which can be layered over an existing silicon solar cell \nwas going ahead, Toshiba developed a low-cost transparent Cu2O solar cell*2 as a top cell for the first time in the world in 2019. This time, \nToshiba successfully realized the world’s highest conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.5% by curbing impurities in the power generation layer \nand increasing the power generation area from 3x3mm² to 10x3mm².*3 In addition, it was confirmed that the Cu2O-Si tandem solar cell with \na Cu2O solar cell layered over silicon (Si) solar cell has potential of exceeding the world’s highest PCE of 26.7%*4 in silicon solar cells. In case \nof an electric vehicle (EV) equipped with the Cu2O-Si tandem solar cell, a one-time charge is estimated to enable the solar cell to power the \nEV for 37km for a day.*5\nGoing forward, Toshiba will push ahead with the development in order to achieve the PCE of 10%, a target value of the top Cu2O cells \nfor high efficiency tandem solar cells (PCE=30%), entrusted by New Energy and Industry Technology Development Organization (NEDO). \nApart from the entrusted project from NEDO, Toshiba will cooperate with Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions Corporation to aim to com­\nplete manufacturing technology for several inch-Cu2O-Si tandem solar cells around the same size as today’s mainstream silicon solar cells \nby FY2025.\nSchematic diagram of Cu2O-Si tandem solar cell\nShort wavelengths\nLight\nLong wavelengths\nCu2O cell \n(top cell)\nSilicon cell \n(bottom cell)\nToshiba’s newly developed Cu2O solar \ncell delivers a high 9.5% PCE\nSchematic of Toshiba’s Cu2O-Si tandem solar cell\nToshiba Group Technology Strategy\nAs R&D cases to realize a carbon neutral society and services based on industrial and people-flow data, we introduce initiatives for a trans­\nparent Cu2O solar cell and face recognition AI technology.

As “Kaometa®,” a face recognition AI for broadcast­\ners and other media, Toshiba Digital Solutions Corporation began to provide services in April 2020. The face recognition AI supports oper­\nations such as quick and accurate production of TV programs, by precisely recognizing a face of a person in an image in real time to iden­\ntify the person.\nToshiba’s face recognition technology could very accurately recognize an individual in “VISABORDER category,” “1:1 Verification,” a \nverification test using images taken at time of entry and departure, and was ranked ninth in the world, and first in Japanese companies. \nAlso, in “BORDER Photos category,” a verification test using images taken at time of crossing a border, it ranked eighth in the world, and first \nin Japanese companies. Furthermore, in “MUGSHOT Photos ΔT ≥12 YRS category,” a verification test using face images which degraded \nover 12 years or more, it ranked ninth in the world, and first in Japanese companies.*4\nToshiba Group has offered non-contact identity verification services using the face recognition technology in various aspects.

As one of the technologies for \nenhancing HDD recording density, the Toshiba Group is moving forward with the development of an approach \ncalled Microwave Assisted Magnetic Recording (MAMR). \nThe MAS-MAMR technology employed in this demonstration uses microwaves to irradiate localized areas \nof the recording media to enhance recording performance, and reflects the recent success of joint efforts by \nthe Toshiba Group, HDD medium manufacturer Showa Denko K. K., and HDD head manufacturer TDK Corpo­\nration to improve the effectiveness of MAS-MAMR.\nUsing this technology, the Toshiba Group aims to achieve early commercialization of nearline HDDs with \ncapacities exceeding 30 TB. Going forward, the Toshiba Group will address the enormous increase in storage \nneeds by continuing to develop MAMR technology to increase the capacity of current nearline HDDs, while \nworking in parallel on next-generation recording technology.\nNuFlare Technology, Inc. has begun shipments of multi-beam mask writers, which constitute the next gener­\nation of electron beam mask writers. Going forward, it will expand shipments to Asia and North America, \naiming to achieve a global market share of 50% in FY2023.\nElectron beam mask writers are devices for manufacturing the photomasks that form the master plates \nused to transfer semiconductor circuit patterns. Photomasks are etched with minute circuit patterns. Such \ncircuit patterns are exposed and transferred to the wafers, which are the semiconductor material, to form cir­\ncuits on the wafer.\nAs the data-driven society evolves, there is growing demand for semi­\nconductors, which are needed to realize the digitalization of information, \nparticularly advanced semiconductors with increasingly miniaturized fea­\ntures. The progress of miniaturization has resulted in dramatic increases in \nthe volume of data contained in photomask circuit patterns, and there has \nbeen an issue with the time taken for writing using the traditional sin­\ngle-beam mask writer that writes such circuit patterns to the photomask \nby using one beam. By combining the writing component technology it \nhas developed for its single-beam mask writer with additional proprietary \ntechnology, NuFlare Technology, Inc.’s multi-beam mask writer is able to \ncontrol 260,000 beams for high-speed, high-precision writing to achieve \nsuperior production efficiency and reliability.\nFueled by the trend of information digitalization, the growing demand \nfor advanced semiconductors with increasingly miniaturized features is \nexpanding the market, and we can expect this new demand for electron \nbeam mask writers to increase going forward. By leveraging the customer \nrelationships and technological capabilities that it has cultivated over \nmany years to provide cutting-edge electron beam mask writers, NuFlare \nTechnology, Inc. will continue to contribute to the development of the \nsemiconductor industry, mankind and human society.\nMulti-beam Mask Writer (MBM™-2000)\nWorld’s First Demonstration of Significant Improvements in HDD Recording \nPerformance Using Microwave Assisted Switching - Microwave Assisted \nMagnetic Recording (MAS-MAMR)\nCommencement of Multi-beam Mask Writer Shipments\n*2 \nMAS-MAMR: Microwave Assist­\ned Switching - Microwave As­\nsisted Magnetic Recording.\n42\nToshiba Integrated Report 2022"

In order to protect individual, corporate, \nand state information, the Toshiba Group has been researching and developing Quantum Key Distribution \n(QKD) technology for more than 20 years, and has acquired more patents in this area than any other organiza­\ntion globally.\nQKD is used to distribute the encryption keys that are used to protect important confidential data. In QKD, \nencryption keys are transmitted over optical fibers in the form of photons (light particles). A feature of quan­\ntum mechanics is that photons undergo an unavoidable change in state when they come into contact with \nsomething, and using this property enables the indisputable detection of encryption key eavesdropping by \nthird parties. At the instant the encryption key eavesdropping is detected the key is automatically voided and \na new one is created, so in theory it is impossible to eavesdrop an encryption key. The introduction of QKD \nwould enable data communication platforms to be protected from the threat of cyber attacks, and ensure the \nsecurity of data communications.\nThe Toshiba Group is establishing partnerships in related industries and conducting repeated demonstra­\ntions and testing, aiming for an early rollout of QKD in industries in the U.S., U.K., Singapore, and South Korea, \nas well as in Japan. In August 2021, the Group announced a collaboration \nwith Singapore’s SpeQtral Pte. Ltd., and in October 2021 it announced that \nit would work with the U.K.’s British Telecommunications plc to build, \ndemonstrate and test world’s first quantum-secured commercial metro \nnetwork. In February 2022, the Toshiba Group, JPMorgan Chase & Co., and \nCiena conducted testing on the U.S.’s first finance application execution \nplatform, and succeeded in demonstrating the viability of QKD.\nFurthermore, in March 2022, the Toshiba Group began a joint QKD \ndemonstration project with KT Corporation of South Korea. Through these \ncollaborations, the Toshiba Group is accelerating the global rollout of QKD.\nGlobal Rollout of the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)\n43\nToshiba Integrated Report 2022"

High energy density is a measure of high endurance and in applications such as electric \nvehicles, for example, this means a longer range. On the other hand, input/output performance (which is a \nmeasure of instantaneous power) deteriorates, making it difficult to use in situations that require sharp in­\nflows or outflows of energy, such as rapid charging.\nThe 20Ah-HP succeeds in maintaining an energy density at the level of the 20Ah cell, one of the aforemen­\ntioned high-capacity cells, while reducing internal resistance by 40%, achieving approximately 1.7 times the \ninput performance and 1.6 times the output performance compared to the 20Ah cell. The reduction in internal \nresistance results in the suppression of heat buildup when large currents are applied, enabling cooling sys­\ntems to be simplified and made less costly. Another advantage of SCiB™ products is that the usable capacity \nrange is larger than that of other rechargeable batteries, and the reduced over­\nvoltage of the 20Ah-HP cell is a factor in increasing the range of capacities that \ncan be used. Moreover, because the input/output performance has been im­\nproved while maintaining the size of previous “highcapacity cells,” it can be used \nwithout design changes in applications where existing “highcapacity cells” are \nbeing used.\nBy combining high input/output performance with high energy density, the \n20Ah-HP cell expands the range of applications open to SCiB™ products, and is \nexpected to be used not only in vehicles but also in a wide variety of industries, \nincluding manufacturing and distribution systems, harbor facilities, construction, \nmaritime and traffic equipment, and storage systems. Going forward, Toshiba \nwill continue to actively develop the SCiB™ rechargeable lithium-ion battery \nbusiness for a range of different applications, including vehicles, industrial equip­\nment and storage battery systems, as it contributes to achieving a carbon-neutral \nsociety.\nLaunch of 20Ah-HP Rechargeable Lithium-ion Battery Cell That Delivers Both \nHigh Energy and High Power\n45\nToshiba Integrated Report 2022"

      "text": "Strategies\nBusinesses\nData Section\nSustainability\nBusiness Results\nUnder the Sustainability Strategy Committee chaired by the President and CEO, we conduct scenario analysis for each business domain to \ngrasp climate change-related risks and opportunities.\nIn scenario analysis, we set up the following two scenarios:\n   1.5°C and well-below 2°C scenario: \nFor mainly transition risks and opportunities, we use the B2DS, SDS, and NZE2050 scenarios created by the International Energy Agency \n(IEA), assuming a world where the temperature increases by 1.5°C and well-below 2°C. This scenario predicts increase in costs due to car­\nbon tax, energy saving related regulations, the introduction of renewable energy, etc., as well as increase in business opportunities due to \ngrowing demand for energy technologies to realize decarbonization and energy-saving products and services.\n   4°C scenario: \nFor mainly physical risks and opportunities, we use the RCP8.5 scenario by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), assum­\ning a world where the temperature increases by 4°C. Although this scenario does not predict a greater impact of regulations and technol­\nogy than the 1.5°C and well-below 2°C scenario, the impact of physical damage such as greater risk of natural disasters like typhoons and \nflooding caused by unusual weather may increase.\n   Scope: \nOur scenario analysis is conducted in the following five business domains taking into consideration the scale of the business and the sig­\nnificance of the impact of climate change. Since each domain has a range of businesses and the content and degree of impact of risks and \nopportunities vary according to the business, we conduct a detailed analysis for each business division to identify risks and opportunities \nthat are specific to each business. Not stopping at the initiatives of our own company, the analysis covers the entire value chain including \nthe upstream (suppliers) and downstream (customers, users).\n- Energy Systems & Solutions Business \n- Infrastructure Systems & Solutions Business \n- Electronic Devices & Storage Solutions Business \n- Digital Solutions Business \n- Battery Business\n   Time frames : \nThree time frames are set (short-, mid-, and long-terms). We assumed the present to 3 years as the short-term in light of the period of \nToshiba Group’s Seventh Environmental Action Plan (final year: FY2023), 4 to 10 years as the mid-term in light of the setting periods of \nToshiba Group’s management policy (FY2025 and FY2030), and 11 to 30 years as the long-term in light of Toshiba Group’s Environmental \nFuture Vision 2050.\n   Analysis steps: \nWe conduct scenario analysis in line with the steps, “Risk importance assessment,” “Definition of scenario groups,” “Business impact as­\nsessment,” and “Definition of countermeasures” based on the TCFD recommendations. \nIn the most recent scenario analysis, we used a common format in the business domains listed in the above scope. First, each business \ndivision identifies transition and physical risks and opportunities that climate change would pose to their respective business in line with \nthe two scenarios, “1.5°C and well-below 2°C” and “4°C,” based on the risk and opportunity categories presented in the TCFD recommen­\ndations, in light of the relevant business circumstances. Then, each business division assesses the importance of each risk and opportuni­\nty in accordance with the company-wide assessment standards. We set (1) three levels of impact (assessed by impact on sales or expense \namounts) and (2) three levels of likelihood (assessed by probability and frequency) as the assessment standards. By multiplying the two \nassessment results, we categorize the final importance into one of three levels: low, medium, and high. Note that in this report we have \nmainly disclosed risks and opportunities with medium and higher importance based on the assessment results. \nIn addition, these analysis results were reviewed by related corporate staff divisions (Strategic Planning Division, IR Division, Sustain­\nability Division, Environment Division) to reflect the viewpoint of each area of expertise. Moreover, of the risks and opportunities that have \nbeen identified and assessed, those with particularly high importance or those that are unique to each business will be calculated for the \namount of financial impact by setting parameters, and we will give priority to formulating countermeasures for such items.\nStrategy\nSetting scenarios\nAnalysis method\n60\nToshiba Integrated Report 2022"

With respect to matters such as compensation for Company \nDirectors and Executive Officers for the current fiscal year, the \nCompensation Committee has determined that the Company’s \nmethod for determining compensation and the amount of com­\npensation already determined are aligned with this policy.\nThe content of the policy concerning decision-making with \nregard to compensation, etc. for individual Company officers is as \nfollows. Since the main responsibility of Directors is to supervise \nthe execution of the overall Group’s business, and increase the \ncorporate value, the basic policy is to determine compensation \nfor Directors by chiefly focusing on securing highly competent \npersonnel, ensuring effective functioning of the supervisory func­\ntion, and improving corporate value from a medium to long term \nperspective.\nSince the main responsibility of Executive Officers is to in­\ncrease corporate value in their capacity as executives responsible \nfor companies or divisions within the Group, the Company has a \nbasic policy to determine compensation for Executive Officers at \nan adequate level to secure highly competent personnel and en­\nsure the effectiveness of their compensation package as an incen­\ntive to improve business performance, based on a balance be­\ntween fixed compensation and performance-linked compensation.\nCompensation standards are determined at suitable levels as a \nglobal company, with the aim of securing highly competent man­\nagement personnel suitable for managing Toshiba which is enter­\ning a period of change. The compensation standards of other \nlisted companies and payroll and benefits are considered when \ndetermining the Company’s compensation standards of manage­\nment.\n \t \u0007Directors are paid the Base salary (fixed amount) and the Com­\nmittee Allowance (fixed amount) in accordance with the scope of \ntheir responsibilities. If multiple committees concurrently serve, \nthe applicable Committee Allowances will be added up and \npaid. Directors who concurrently hold offices as an Executive Of­\nficer are paid only the compensation for Executive Officers spec­\nified in      below and not paid compensation for Directors.\n \t \u0007Compensation for Executive Officers consists of Base salary \n(fixed amount), determined according to rank, and perfor­\nmance-linked compensation.\n \t \u0007Performance-linked compensation is determined in accordance \nwith the performance and medium to long term management \nindicators of the Company overall and the divisions under the \ncharge of the Executive Officers during the fiscal year, with cash \nand stock of the Company paid at a rate set according to rank. \n \t \u0007The Base Salary and the Performance-linked compensation are \npaid by cash and shares of the Company at a prescribed rate.\n \t \u0007With regard to compensation paid by stock that is paid in the \nform of the Company’s stock, mechanisms such as restricted \nstocks with transfer restrictions until retirement will be used to \nsecure effectiveness as an incentive for medium- to long-term \nimprovement of business performance.\n   Compensation Policy\n\t\nCompensation for Directors\n1\n\t\nCompensation for Executive Officers\n2\n\t\nCompensation standards\n3\n \t \u0007The Base Salary and the Committee Allowance are paid by cash \nand shares of the Company at a prescribed rate. \n \t \u0007When traveling to attend a Meeting of the Board of Directors, \nExecutive Session of the Board, or a Committee held in a \nnon-resident country, the Attendance Allowance is paid accord­\ning to the actual travel record. \n \t \u0007With regard to compensation paid by stock that is paid in the \nform of the Company’s stock, mechanisms such as restricted \nstocks with transfer restrictions until retirement will be used.\nCompensation pertaining to the above is set as follows: \nToshiba Group has set up three lines of internal control system, with the relevant business divisions as the front line, the administrative \ndivisions as the second, and the audit divisions as the third. The system is designed to effectively manage risks by assigning to each line a \nclearly defined role and set of duties, which it carries out appropriately, at the same time exercising a checks-and-balances function. In \norder to respond to changes in the business environment and to the diverse and ever-changing risks that arise when conducting business \nactivities, we will ensure effective risk management.\nToshiba’s shares were designated as securities on alert on September 15, 2015 due to inappropriate accounting. After that, Toshiba \nimproved its internal control system and the designation was lifted on October 12, 2017. As reported in the Report on Improvements of \nInternal Management System and Progress Report on Improvements of Internal Management System released on October 20, 2017 and \nJuly 25, 2018 respectively, Toshiba has continued its efforts to strengthen the internal control system and worked to regain the trust of \nshareholders, investors, and all other stakeholders.

Business risks refer to uncertain \nfactors that may prevent the achievement of business and project \nobjectives on strategic decision-making and execution of busi­\nness activities.\nTo address compliance and other risks, we appoint a Chief \nRisk Compliance Management Officer (CRO) to oversee risk man­\nagement and compliance for the whole Group. In addition, under \nthe CRO, the Legal & Compliance Division responds to whis­\ntleblower reports, attempts to achieve global compliance, aims \nto strengthen the whistleblower system, and is advancing effec­\ntive risk management and compliance activities.\nThe CRO chairs the Risk Compliance Committee, which is at­\ntended by executives in charge of corporate staff divisions. The \ncommittee analyzes whistleblower reports and cases both inside \nand outside the Company and evaluates the impacts of risks and \nthe status of risk control in accordance with the risk table that \ncovers compliance risks based on the Standards of Conduct for \nToshiba Group. It then determines priority measures of the im­\nmediate fiscal year. The Risk Compliance Committee is attended \nby members of the Audit Committee who also serve as directors. \nThe agenda deliberated at the committee is reported to the Board \nof Directors.\nIn response to the inappropriate accounting treatment in \n2015, Toshiba has worked to strengthen accounting compliance \nby establishing a special accounting compliance system. In order \nto further strengthen the overall compliance system, in FY2021, \nwe evolved the system into one that encompasses accounting \ncompliance and other types of compliance, and began promot­\ning centralized management.\nAt Toshiba Group, we formulated and are striving to entrench the Standards of Conduct for Toshiba Group (SOC) as a specific ac­\ntion guideline since we are a company that contributes to the realization of a sustainable society while conducting fair, sincere and highly \ntransparent business activities. We are also working toward making the SOC an integral part of the entire Toshiba Group.

      "text": "In order to create an open work environment, Toshiba is enhanc­\ning its whistleblower system, on top of preventing risks by stimu­\nlating day-to-day communication in each workplace.\nIn January 2000, Toshiba established a whistleblower system \nToshiba Hotline to collect internal information on SOC violations, \nparticularly those concerning laws and regulations, and to deal \nwith wrongdoing through a self-rectification system. Under this \nsystem, an employee can report an incident and seek advice via \ne-mail or phone. In April 2019, we transferred the function of re­\nceiving whistleblower reports to an external organization to fur­\nther ensure anonymity, lower the hurdle of reporting to the ho­\ntline, and build a stronger sense of safety. E-mail support is \navailable 24/7. In June 2022, we began accepting reports in En­\nglish, targeting those employees at Toshiba Group companies in \nJapan who find it difficult to make the reports in the Japanese \nlanguage. Also, a reception hotline was set up at an external attor­\nney’s office in January 2005, primarily to receive information \nabout potential legal violations.\nFurthermore, in October 2015, the new Audit Committee Ho­\ntline was set up, which allows people to report directly to the Au­\ndit Committee, which is composed of outside directors. With this \nnew system, even matters in which the involvement of top man­\nagement is suspected can be safely reported.\nThe Audit Committee also has access rights to the Toshiba \nHotline, and provides appropriate guidance and supervision.\nToshiba operates a risk management system (RMS) incorpo­\nrating a PDCA cycle* led by administrative divisions at the second \nline of internal control system. The aim is to identify the status at \neach Toshiba Group company of initiatives on compliance risk \nand to promote improvement in an integrated manner. With the \nRMS, we implement the Risk Assessment Program (RAP) to assess \nrisks of Toshiba Group companies. The administrative divisions \nprovide guidance to improve the compliance risks identified. At \nthe same time, the relevant business divisions at the front line of \ninternal control system themselves work to identify and mitigate \nthe risks autonomously.\nFurthermore, since FY2020, we have systematically organized \nfraud risk scenarios related to financial reporting and accounting, \nand conducted inspections on Group companies to understand \nthe status of their fraud risk, while strengthening guidance to im­\nprove such status.\nIn the event of a serious compliance-related incident, there is \na system in place by which such incident is reported immediately \nto the President and CEO, CRO, and members of the Audit Com­\nmittee, among others. A reporting system was also added in \nFY2021. Under these systems, the relevant in-house committees, \netc. promptly evaluate and implement countermeasures.\nMeanwhile, Toshiba deals with business risks by clarifying \nmanagement decision criteria, permissible risk limits and corpo­\nrate policy on business withdrawal in making management deci­\nsions for business execution to achieve Toshiba Group’s sustain­\nable growth and increase corporate value. In addition, for each \nrisk case, the Business Risk Review Committee conducts risk as­\nsessment, identifies the maximum risk, and establishes items for \nmonitoring.\nIn April 2006, Toshiba set up a supplier whistleblower system \nClean Partner Line to receive reports from suppliers and business \npartners to prevent SOC violations by employees in charge of pro­\ncurement and order placements for construction and other \nworks.\nEach Toshiba Group company has its own whistleblower sys­\ntem. In addition, employees of the Toshiba Group in Japan can \nuse the aforementioned Toshiba Hotline. Besides the whis­\ntleblower system at each company, in FY2021, we introduced the \nToshiba Group Overseas Hotline for Toshiba Group companies \noverseas, by designating each Regional Representative Subsidi­\nary as the secretariat for the corresponding region so as to cover \nlaws and regulations and languages for different countries and \nregions.\nAt Toshiba Group, in accordance with laws, regulations, and \ninternal regulations, officers and employees who make whis­\ntleblower reports with honest and legitimate intent do not re­\nceive unfavorable treatment such as dismissal and demotion as a \nresult of having made the reports. Toshiba Group strives to ensure \nthat the officers and employees can use the whistleblower sys­\ntem at ease. Specifically, each Group company has stipulated in \nits regulations a confidentiality obligation that allows limited per­\nsons in charge to access to what is reported by whistleblowers \nand a prohibition of unfavorable treatment of whistleblowers, as \nwell as prepared manuals for persons in charge of whistleblow­\ning. Toshiba Group in Japan maintains and operates a response \nsystem that complies with the amended Whistleblower Protec­\ntion Act. We notified employees about the existence of the system \nand its assurance of strict anonymity through e-learning. We also \nreported on whistleblower cases to the whole Company on a \nnumber of occasions.\nOf the reports received, Toshiba strived to investigate all facts \non cases of possible legal violations or fraud to identify the cause, \nand handled such cases rigorously and imposed appropriate dis­\nciplinary sanctions on the offenders and implementing such \nmeasures to prevent recurrence. Meanwhile, the majority of the \nreports received were related to labor and general affairs. When a \nreported case was not a legal violation but there were or likely to \nbe inappropriate situations, we provided instructions for im­\nprovement or issued alerts in cooperation with the relevant divi­\nsion. In cases involving consultations and questions about duties \nof the informants themselves, we gave advice on how to deal with \nthe situation. For reports other than anonymous reports, we ex­\nplained the status of our responses to the whistleblowers, in prin­\nciple.\nIn accordance with laws, regulations, and internal regula­\ntions, confidential advisers (at the external organization or attor­\nney’s office for the Toshiba Hotline, and at the internal secretariat \nfor the Audit Committee Hotline) never disclose the names or \ncontact addresses of the informants, except in cases in which \nconsent has been obtained from them.\nOut of the whistleblower reports, cases that everyone should \nbear in mind are taught as part of employee training. In order to \nprotect whistleblower anonymity, such cases are presented after \nthey are anonymized, with some details changed so that the \nwhistleblower and the workplace where they work cannot be \nidentified. The number of reports received is released regularly on \nthe company’s internal website.\n   Whistleblower System\n* \u0007Plan: Identification and assessment of risks; Do: creation and operation of rules; Check: review \nand fact-finding surveys; Action: formulation and implementation of improvement plans\n69\nToshiba Integrated Report 2022"
