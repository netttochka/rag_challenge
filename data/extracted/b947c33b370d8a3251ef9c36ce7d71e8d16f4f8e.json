      "text": "Part I\n \nItem 1.    Business.\nOverview\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. is a Maryland corporation formed on June 23, 2011. The Trust serves as the general partner of Wheeler REIT, L.P. (the “Operating\nPartnership”) which was formed as a Virginia limited partnership on April 5, 2012. Substantially, all of our assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, our Operating\nPartnership. At December 31, 2022, the Company owned 99.05% of the Operating Partnership. The Company is a fully-integrated, self-managed commercial real estate investment company\nthat owns, leases and operates income-producing retail properties with a primary focus on grocery-anchored centers.\nOn August 22, 2022, the Company completed a merger transaction with Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. (\"Cedar\" or \"CDR\"). As a result of the merger, the Company acquired all of the\noutstanding shares of Cedar’s common stock, which ceased to be publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). Cedar’s outstanding 7.25% Series B Preferred Stock and\n6.50% Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding and continue to trade on the NYSE. Each outstanding share of common stock of Cedar and outstanding common unit of the Cedar OP\nheld by persons other than Cedar immediately prior to the merger were cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment of $9.48 per share or unit. As a result Cedar became a\nsubsidiary of the REIT.\nFor additional information on recent business developments, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.\nOur corporate office is located at 2529 Virginia Beach Boulevard, Virginia Beach, Virginia 23452. Our telephone number is (757) 627-9088. Our registrar and stock transfer agent\nis Computershare Trust Company, N.A. and may be contacted at 150 Royall Street, Suite 101, Canton, MA 02021 or their website, www.computershare.com.\nPortfolio\nOur portfolio contains retail properties in secondary and tertiary markets, with a particular emphasis on grocery-anchored retail centers. Our properties are in communities that have\nstable demographics and have historically exhibited favorable trends, such as strong population and income growth. We generally lease our properties to national and regional retailers that\noffer consumer goods and services and generate regular consumer traffic. We believe our tenants carry goods and offer services that are less impacted by fluctuations in the broader U.S.\neconomy and consumers’ disposable income, generating more predictable property level cash flows.\nThe Company’s portfolio of properties is dependent upon regional and local economic conditions. As of December 31, 2022, we own a portfolio consisting of seventy-nine\nproperties, including seventy-five retail shopping centers, totaling 8,172,527 leasable square feet which is 92.9% leased (our \"operating portfolio\"), and four undeveloped land parcels totaling\napproximately 61 acres. The properties are geographically located in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Northeast, which markets represented approximately 44%, 41% and 15%, respectively,\nof the total annualized base rent of the properties in its portfolio as of December 31, 2022.\nNo tenant represents greater than approximately 10% of the Company’s annualized base rent or 10% of gross leasable square footage. The top 10 tenants account for 23.19% or\n$16.99 million of annualized base rent and 27.22% or 2.22 million of gross leasable square footage at December 31, 2022.\nHuman Capital Management\nInformation About our Executive Officers\nAndrew Franklin, age 42,was appointed as Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and President in October 2021. He previously served as Interim Chief Executive Officer since July\n2021, Chief Operating Officer since February 2018, and Senior Vice President of Operations since January 2017.

Prior to joining the\nCompany, Mr. Franklin was a partner with Broad Reach Retail Partners where he ran the day-to-day operations of the company, managing the leasing team as well as overseeing the asset,\nproperty and construction management of the portfolio with assets totaling $50 million. Mr. Franklin is a graduate of the University of Maryland, with a Bachelor of Science degree in\nFinance.\nCrystal Plum, age 41, was appointed as Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\") in February 2020. She most recently served as the Vice President of Financial Reporting and Corporate\nAccounting for the Company from March 2018 to February 2020 and as Director of Financial Reporting for the Company from September 2016 to March 2018. Prior to that time, she served\nas Manager at Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP from September 2014 to August 2016 and as Supervisor at Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP from 2008 to September 2014. Ms. Plum has\nexperience reviewing and performing audits, reviews, compilations and tax engagements for a diverse group of clients, as well as banking experience. Ms. Plum is a Certified Public\nAccountant and has a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration - Accounting and Finance from Old Dominion University.\nOur Team and Talent\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have 47 full-time employees. We seek to hire experienced leaders and team members and offer competitive wage and benefit programs. Employees\nare offered flexibility to meet personal and family needs, which was further expanded when the COVID-19 pandemic began. In addition to medical insurance support, the Company offers\nwellness programs including free short and long term disability insurance, free basic life insurance policy with accidental death and dismemberment coverage, employee assistance programs\nthat include emotional health support, gym memberships, volunteer time off and tuition assistance. Tuition assistance includes assistance to learn a new language as the Company identifies\nopportunities to better serve a diverse tenant base.\nBusiness Objectives and Investment Strategy\nOur primary business objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders. We intend to achieve this objective utilizing the following investment strategies:\n•\nFocus on necessity-based retail. Own and operate retail properties that serve the essential day-to-day shopping needs of the surrounding communities. These necessity-based centers\nattract high levels of daily traffic resulting in cross-selling of goods and services from our tenants. The majority of our tenants provide non-cyclical consumer goods and services that\nare less impacted by fluctuations in the economy. We believe these centers that provide essential goods and services such as groceries and electric vehicle charging stations result in a\nstable, lower-risk portfolio of retail investment properties.\n•\nFocus on secondary and tertiary markets with strong demographics and demand. Our properties are in markets that have strong demographics such as population density, population\ngrowth, stable tenant sales trends and growth in household income. We seek to identify new tenants and renew leases with existing tenants in these locations that support the need for\nnecessity-based retail and limited new supply.\n•\nIncrease operating income through leasing strategies and expense management. We employ intensive lease management strategies to optimize occupancy. Management has\nextensive expertise in acquiring and managing under-performing properties and increasing operating income through more effective leasing strategies and expense management. Our\nleases generally require the tenant to reimburse us for a substantial portion of the expenses incurred in operating, maintaining, repairing, and managing the shopping center and the\ncommon areas, along with the associated insurance costs and real estate taxes. In many cases the tenant is either fully or partially responsible for all maintenance of the property,\nthereby limiting our financial exposure towards maintaining the center and increasing our net income. We refer to this arrangement as a “triple net lease.”\n•\nSelectively utilize our capital to improve retail properties. We intend to make capital investments where the return on such capital is accretive to our stockholders. We allocate capital\nto value-added improvements of retail properties to increase rents, extend long-term leases with anchor tenants and increase occupancy. We selectively allocate capital to revenue\nenhancing projects that we believe will improve the market position of a given property.\n4"

      "text": "•\nRecycling and sensible management of capital structure. We intend to sell non-income producing land parcels utilizing sales proceeds to deleverage the balance sheet. In 2022, we\nsold two properties for a total of $10.51 million net proceeds which were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness. Additional properties may be slated for disposition based upon\nmanagement’s periodic review of our portfolio, and approval by our Board of Directors.\n•\nStrategy for Integrating Cedar Assets. Through integrations of both software and personnel, the increased scale will allow the Company to maximize efficiencies both at the property\nand corporate level. Focusing on our core model of necessity, service and convenience-based retailers, the assets obtained through the acquisition of Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. (the\n\"Cedar Assets\") complement our existing portfolio, further diversifying our tenant credit profiles and micro-market risks.\nGovernmental Regulations Affecting Our Properties\nWe and our properties are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental, health, safety, tax and similar laws. The application of these laws to a specific property that\nwe own depends on a variety of property-specific circumstances, including the current and former uses of the property, the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of\nthe property. Neither existing environmental, health, safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or\nresults of operations, and management does not believe they will in the future. In addition, we have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, any material costs or liabilities due to\nenvironmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past. However, we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we\ncurrently own or may acquire in the future. We have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental, health, safety and similar laws and\nwe carry environmental insurance that covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties.\nCompetition\nNumerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing of properties. Some of these competitors may possess greater capital\nresources than we do, although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that\nmarket. This competition may interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants, leading to increased vacancy rates and/or reduced rents and adversely affect our ability to minimize\noperating expenses.\nRetailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers, outlet stores, discount shopping clubs, superstores, and other forms of sales and marketing of goods\nand services, such as direct mail. This competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants.\nClimate\nSome of our properties could be subject to potential natural or other disasters. In addition, we may acquire properties that are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters,\nsuch as earthquakes and droughts. Properties could also be affected by increases in the frequency or severity of tornadoes, hurricanes or other storms, whether such increases are caused by\nglobal climate changes or other factors. The occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase\noperating costs, increase future property insurance costs, and/or negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space. If insurance is unavailable to us, or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or\nif our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from such events, our earnings, liquidity and/or capital resources could be adversely affected. While several of our\nproperties are located in areas that have experienced hurricanes, tornados, severe rain storms, or snow during the past two years, there has been no substantial damage or change in operations\nrelated to weather events.\nInformation Technology and Cyber Security\nThe Company depends on the proper functioning, availability and security of its information systems, including financial, data processing, communications and operating systems.\nSeveral information systems are software applications provided by third parties. Our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gain\nunauthorized access to our confidential data, and other electronic security breaches. Such cyber attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information\ntechnology systems to more sophisticated security threats.\n5"

The Company is not aware of any information security breaches over the last two years.\nInsurance\n    \nThe Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in its portfolio under an\ninsurance policy, in addition to other coverages, such as trademark and pollution coverage that may be appropriate for certain of its properties.

We maintain regular contact with our tenants and frequently visit each asset\nto ensure the proper implementation and execution of our market strategies. As part of our ongoing property management, we conduct regular physical property reviews to improve our\nproperties, react to changing market conditions and ensure proper maintenance.\nOur leasing representatives are experienced in the markets in which we operate; they are familiar with current tenants and potential local, regional, and national tenants that would\ncomplement our current tenant base. We study demographics, customer sales, merchandising mix and cultivate tenant relationships to optimize the sales performance of our centers and\nthereby increase rents.

This number excludes stockholders whose stock is held in nominee or street name by brokers.\nDividend Policy\n    \nIn March 2018, the Board of Directors suspended the payment of dividends on our Common Stock. The Board of Directors also suspended the quarterly dividends on shares of our\nSeries A Preferred Stock (\"Series A Preferred\"), Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred”) and Series D Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series D Preferred”),\nbeginning with the three months ended December 31, 2018. Dividends were suspended to retain cash flow to pay operating expenses and reduce debt.\nAs the Company has failed to pay cash dividends on the outstanding Series D Preferred, the annual dividend rate on the Series D Preferred has increased to 10.75%; commencing on\nthe first day after the first missed quarterly payment, January 1, 2019 and will continue until such time as the Company has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series D\nPreferred in full. See Note 8, Equity and Mezzanine Equity, to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nOn November 3, 2021, common stockholders of the Company voted to amend the Company’s charter (the “Charter”) to remove the cumulative dividend rights of the Series A\nPreferred and Series B Preferred.\n10"

For more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information, you should read the notes to the audited consolidated financial\nstatements included in this Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\n    \nWe are a Maryland corporation focused on owning, leasing and operating income producing grocery-anchored centers, neighborhood centers, community centers and free-standing\nretail properties. We have targeted properties located within developed areas, commonly referred to as in-fill, that are surrounded by communities that have strong demographics and\ndynamic, diversified economies that will continue to generate jobs and future demand for commercial real estate. Our primary target markets include the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and\nNortheast.\nOur portfolio is comprised of seventy-five retail shopping centers and four undeveloped land parcels.

The Company’s portfolio had total gross rentable space of approximately 8,173,000 square feet and a leased\nlevel of approximately 92.9% at December 31, 2022.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe spread of COVID-19 had a significant impact on the global economy, the U.S. economy, the economies of the local markets in which the Company’s properties are located, and\nthe broader financial markets. Local, state and federal authorities took preventative measures to alleviate the public health crisis primarily in 2020 and those preventative measures affected\nthe operations of the Company’s tenant base to varying degrees depending on the category and location of the tenant. While substantially all of the limitations and restrictions imposed during\nthe onset of the pandemic have been lifted and/or eased and people have largely resumed pre-pandemic activities, economic conditions continue to negatively impact the financial health of\ncertain retail stores.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic or variants or future outbreaks of other highly infectious diseases could impact the Company’s ability to collect rent and could lead to increases in rent\nrelief requests from tenants, termination of leases by tenants, tenant bankruptcies, decreases in demand for retail space at the Company’s properties, difficulties in accessing capital,\nimpairment of the Company’s long-lived assets and other impacts that could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to\npay distributions to stockholders.\nRecent Trends and Activities\nThere have been several significant events in 2022 that have impacted our Company. These events are summarized below.\nAcquisition of Cedar Realty Trust\nOn August 22, 2022 (the “Cedar Closing Date”), the Company consummated transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 2, 2022 (as\namended, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the\n11"

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on the Cedar Closing Date, Merger Sub II merged\nwith and into Cedar OP, with Cedar OP being the surviving limited partnership resulting from such merger, and immediately following such merger, Merger Sub I merged with and into\nCedar, with Cedar being the surviving company resulting from such merger (together, the “Cedar Acquisition”).\nEach outstanding share of common stock of Cedar and outstanding common unit of Cedar OP held by persons other than Cedar immediately prior to the merger were cancelled and\nconverted into the right to receive a cash payment of $9.48 per share or unit. As a result of the Cedar Acquisition, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Cedar’s common\nstock, which ceased to be publicly traded on the NYSE. Cedar’s 7.25% Series B Preferred Stock and 6.50% Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding and continue to trade on the NYSE.\nAs a result, Cedar became a subsidiary of the REIT.\nIn connection with the consummation of the Cedar Acquisition, the Company entered into a Guaranty of the obligations of Cedar OP under a Loan Agreement (the “KeyBank-Cedar\nLoan Agreement”) by and between the Borrower, KeyBanc Capital Markets, as Lead Arranger and Bookrunner, and KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent and as lender,\nand under the other loan documents executed in connection with the KeyBank-Cedar Loan Agreement.\nBy virtue of the Cedar Acquisition, the Company acquired 19 shopping centers (the majority of which are grocery-anchored), consisting of approximately 2.9 million square feet of\ngross leasable area and increased the Company’s presence in the Northeast.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”) include Cedar starting from the date of acquisition. We have determined that this acquisition is\nnot a variable interest entity, as defined under the consolidation topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\"), Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, and we\nevaluated such entity under the voting model and concluded we should consolidate the entity. Under the voting model, we consolidate the entity if we determine that we, directly or indirectly,\nhave greater than 50% of the voting rights and that other equity holders do not have substantive participating rights.\nKeyBank-Cedar Loan Agreement\nOn August 22, 2022, Cedar entered into the KeyBank-Cedar Loan Agreement for $130.00 million with interest-only payments due monthly through maturity, August 22, 2023. The\ninterest rate on this term loan consisted of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 0.10% plus an applicable margin of 2.5% through February 2023, at which time increases to 4.0% and\nwas collateralized by 19 properties.\nThe obligations under the KeyBank-Cedar Loan Agreement were satisfied in full with the proceeds of the loans under the Guggenheim-Cedar Loan Agreement (as defined below)\nentered into on October 28, 2022 and the Patuxent Crossing/Coliseum Marketplace Loan Agreement (as defined below) entered into on December 21, 2022.\nExchange Offer and Consent Solicitation\nOn November 22, 2022, the Company commenced an exchange offer for its outstanding shares of Series D Preferred (the “Exchange Offer”). As subsequently amended, the terms of the\nExchange Offer provided for the exchange of up to 2,112,103 outstanding shares of Series D Preferred, representing 67% of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred, for (i) 6.00%\nSubordinated Convertible Notes due 2028, and (ii) Common Stock, in each case to have been newly issued by the Company, and related consents (the “Consent Solicitation”) from the\nholders of the Series D Preferred (the “Series D Preferred Holders”) to certain amendments to the Company’s charter that would have modified the terms of the Series D Preferred (the\n“Proposed Amendments”).\nThe consummation of the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation was subject to, and was conditional upon, the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the condition that the\nholders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred (i) validly tender their Series D Preferred into the Exchange Offer, and do not validly withdraw such Series D\nPreferred, on or prior to the expiration date of the Exchange Offer, and (ii) consent to the Proposed Amendments.\n12"

Accordingly, the condition that the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred (i) validly\ntender their Series D Preferred into the Exchange Offer, and not validly withdraw such Series D Preferred, and (ii) consent to the Proposed Amendments, had not been satisfied, and the\nExchange Offer expired on January 20, 2023.\nAs a result, the Series D Preferred remains outstanding with no change to its terms.\nAssets Held for Sale and Dispositions\nAt December 31, 2022, there were no assets held for sale. At December 31, 2021, assets held for sale included Walnut Hill Plaza, which was sold in 2022.\nImpairment expenses on assets held for sale are a result of reducing the carrying value for the amount that exceeded the property's fair value less estimated selling costs.

On December 9, 2022, the Company made a $5.64 million principal payment on the Butler Square loan in conjunction with the sale of the\nButler Square property.\nGuggenheim Loan Agreement\nOn June 17, 2022, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the “Guggenheim Loan Agreement”) with Guggenheim Real Estate, LLC, for $75.00 million at a fixed rate of 4.25%\nwith interest-only payments due monthly. Commencing on August 10, 2027, until the maturity date of July 10, 2032, monthly principal and interest payments will be made based on a 30-\nyear amortization schedule calculated based on the principal amount as of that time. The Guggenheim Loan Agreement is collateralized by twenty-two properties and loan proceeds were used\nto refinance eleven loans including paying $1.46 million in defeasance.\nJANAF Loan Agreement\nOn July 6, 2022, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the “JANAF Loan Agreement”) with CITI Real Estate Funding Inc. for $60.00 million at a fixed interest rate of 5.31%\nwith interest-only payments due monthly through maturity, July 6, 2032.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates,\nassumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and\non various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and\nliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n(3)\n(1)\n(1) (2)\n15"

      "text": "The critical accounting estimates and policies summarized in this section are discussed in further detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in\nthis Form 10-K. We believe that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide useful and reliable financial information about our operating results and financial\ncondition. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that have a significant level of\nuncertainty at the time the accounting estimates are made, and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results.\nRevenue Recognition\n    \nPrincipal components of our total revenues include base and percentage rents and tenant reimbursements. The Company combines lease and nonlease components in lease contracts,\nwhich includes combining base rent and tenant reimbursement revenue. We accrue minimum (base) rent on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases which results in an\nunbilled rent asset or deferred rent liability being recorded on the balance sheet. Certain lease agreements contain provisions that grant additional rents based on tenants’ sales volumes\n(contingent or percentage rent) which we recognize when the tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements. Although we periodically review the valuation of the\nasset/liability resulting from the straight-line accounting treatment of our leases in light of any changes in lease terms, financial condition or other factors concerning our tenants, they are\nsubject to uncertainty. These assessments are inherently sensitive as they are based on the judgment of management and information available at the time of evaluation.\nRents and Other Tenant Receivables\nWe record a tenant receivable for amounts due from tenants such as base rents, tenant reimbursements and other charges allowed under the lease terms. We periodically review\ntenant receivables for collectability and determine the need for an allowance for the uncollectible portion of accrued rents and other accounts receivable based upon customer creditworthiness\n(including expected recovery of a claim with respect to any tenants in bankruptcy), historical bad debt levels and current economic trends. We consider a receivable past due once it becomes\ndelinquent per the terms of the lease; our standard lease form considers a rent charge past due after five days. A past due receivable triggers certain events such as notices, fees and other\nallowable and required actions per the lease.\nAcquired Properties and Lease Intangibles\nWe allocate the purchase price of the acquired properties to land, building and improvements, identifiable intangible assets and to the acquired liabilities based on their respective fair values.\nIdentifiable intangibles include amounts allocated to acquired out-of-market leases, tenant relationships, the value of in-place leases and ground. We determine fair value based on estimated\ncash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the\nhistorical operating results, known trends and specific market and economic conditions that may affect the property. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including\nleasing commissions, tenant improvements, legal and other related expenses. Such amounts are based on estimates and forecasts which, by their nature, are highly subjective and may result in\nfuture changes in the event forecasts are not realized.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe periodically review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of\ninvestment properties may not be recoverable, with an evaluation performed at least annually. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, declines in the property’s cash flows,\noccupancy and fair market value. We measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted future operating income before depreciation and amortization, plus its\nresidual value, is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over its estimated fair\nvalue. We estimate fair value using unobservable data such as operating income, estimated capitalization rates or multiples, leasing prospects and local market information. These valuation\nassumptions are based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurement and represent Level 3 inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no\nmarket activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe Company may decide to sell properties. Properties classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell. When\nthe carrying value exceeds the fair value, less estimated costs to sell, an impairment expense is recognized. The Company estimates fair value, less estimated closing costs, based on\n16"

Level 2\ninputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices. Level 3\ninputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments,\nincluding stock purchase warrants and convertible notes, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial\ninstruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value\nreported in the consolidated statement of operations. The assumptions used in these fair value estimates are based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurement and\nrepresent Level 3 inputs.

Net cash provided by operating activities, before net changes in operating assets and liabilities, was $19.71 million and $16.54 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively.

      "text": "In addition, the Board of Directors suspended Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series D Preferred dividend payments beginning with the fourth quarter 2018 dividend. On\nNovember 3, 2021, common stockholders of the Company approved amendments to the Company’s Charter to remove the cumulative dividend of the Series A Preferred and the Series B\nPreferred. The Company believes that these actions support the Company's liquidity needs and improve the Company's capital structure.\nSeries D Preferred Stock\nAfter September 21, 2023 (the “Series D Redemption Date”), the Series D Preferred Holders will have the right to cause the Company to redeem their Series D Preferred at a price\nof $25.00 per share plus the amount of all accrued and unpaid dividends. This redemption price is payable by the Company, at the Company’s election, in cash or shares of our common\nstock, $0.01 par value per share (“Common Stock”), or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock.\nSince January 2019, Series D Preferred (of which there are approximately 3.15 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2022) has been accruing unpaid dividends at a rate of\n10.75% per annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share, or at $2.6875 per share per annum.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the outstanding Series D Preferred had an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $78.81 million, with aggregate accrued and unpaid\ndividends in the amount of approximately $34.63 million, for a total liquidation value of $113.44 million. Assuming dividends continue to accrue and remain unpaid on the Series D\nPreferred, then on the Series D Redemption Date we estimate that the aggregate liquidation preference (based on the 3,152,392 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2022) would be\napproximately $78.81 million, with aggregate accrued and unpaid dividends in the amount of approximately $40.99 million, for a total liquidation value of $119.80 million.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Series D Preferred is convertible, in whole or in part, at any time, at the option of the Series D Preferred Holders, into previously unissued Common\nStock at a conversion price of $16.96 per share of Common Stock. Based upon the closing price of our Common Stock on February 28, 2023 of $1.58 per share, we believe it unlikely that\nSeries D Preferred Holders would convert their shares of Series D Preferred into Common Stock in advance of the Series D Redemption Date, and likely that they would instead choose to\nexercise their redemption rights after the Series D Redemption Date.\nIn an effort to address the risk of a significant reduction to the value of a Series D Preferred Holder’s investment in Series D Preferred and Common Stock following the Series D\nRedemption Date, the Company launched a modified Dutch auction tender offer in December 2020 for up to $19.00 million (subsequently reduced to $6.00 million) of Series D Preferred, in\nwhich 1,467,162 shares were tendered and 387,097 shares were accepted for purchase for an aggregate cost of $6.00 million. We subsequently launched a second modified Dutch auction\ntender offer in April 2021 for up to $12.00 million of our Series D Preferred, in which 103,513 shares were tendered and accepted for purchase for an aggregate cost of $1.86 million.\nIn July 2021, we raised additional capital for the Company through a rights offering pursuant to which the Common Stock holders purchased $30.00 million in aggregate principal\namount of our Convertible Notes. Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable at the Company’s option in cash, Series B Preferred and/or Series D Preferred.\nOn December 31, 2021, the first interest payment date on the Convertible Notes, interest was paid in the form of Series D Preferred. For purposes of determining the value of the\nSeries D Preferred paid as interest on the Convertible Notes, each share of Series D Preferred was deemed to have a value equal to the product of (x) the average of the per share volume-\nweighted average prices of the Series D Preferred for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the third business day immediately preceding the interest payment date, and (y) 0.55.\nOn June 30, 2022, interest on the Convertible Notes was paid in the form of Series B Preferred. For purposes of determining the value of the Series B Preferred paid as interest on\nthe Convertible Notes, each share of Series B Preferred was deemed to have a value equal to the product of (x) the average of the per share volume-weighted average prices of the Series B\nPreferred for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the third business day immediately preceding the interest payment date, and (y) 0.55.\n19"

      "text": "On January 3, 2023 (the next succeeding Business Day after December 31, 2022), interest was paid on the Convertible Notes in the form of Series B Preferred. For purposes of\ndetermining the value of the Series B Preferred paid as interest on the Convertible Notes, each share of Series B Preferred was deemed to have a value equal to the product of (x) the average\nof the per share volume-weighted average prices of the Series B Preferred for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the third business day immediately preceding the interest payment\ndate, and (y) 0.55.\nThe Convertible Notes could have the effect of causing, if interest is paid in the future in shares of Series D Preferred, substantial dilution of the Series D Preferred and reduction in\nthe value of any Series D Preferred.\nIn an effort to address the risk associated with the significant and growing financial obligation to the Series D Preferred Holders, and to provide the Series D Preferred Holders with\nan opportunity to receive value for their Series D Preferred prior to the Series D Redemption Date, on November 22, 2022, the Company commenced an Exchange Offer and related Consent\nSolicitation.\nThe consummation of the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation was subject to, and was conditional upon, the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the condition that the\nholders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred (i) validly tender their Series D Preferred into the Exchange Offer, and do not validly withdraw such Series D\nPreferred, on or prior to the expiration date of the Exchange Offer, and (ii) consent to the Proposed Amendments. As of the expiration of the Exchange Offer on January 20, 2023, 864,391\nshares of Series D Preferred (representing 26.8% of the total outstanding Series D Preferred) had been validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in the Exchange Offer. Accordingly, the\ncondition that the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred (i) validly tender their Series D Preferred into the Exchange Offer, and not validly withdraw such\nSeries D Preferred, and (ii) consent to the Proposed Amendments, had not been satisfied, and the Exchange Offer expired on January 20, 2023. As a result, the Series D Preferred remains\noutstanding with no change to its terms, including its redemption rights.\nWe anticipate that, in the event of the Series D Preferred Holders’ exercise of such redemption rights after the Series D Redemption Date, the Company will not have sufficient\navailable cash to pay the aggregate redemption price. Accordingly, in such event, we will not be able to meet our redemption obligation without either liquidating assets or issuing significant\nadditional amounts of Common Stock.\nThe Company does not believe it is in its interests to liquidate assets or incur indebtedness to fund cash redemptions of the Series D Preferred Stock and, accordingly, it has no\nintention of doing so. Therefore, the Company will likely be required to settle redemptions of Series D Preferred following the Series D Redemption Date in Common Stock.\nWe believe that the issuance of Common Stock to either (i) fund cash redemptions or (ii) directly settle redemptions in Common Stock, will result in a substantial dilution of\nCommon Stock.\nInflation, Deflation and Economic Condition Considerations\nPrior to 2021, inflation was relatively low and did not have a significant detrimental impact on the Company’s results of operations. However, inflation substantially increased in\n2022. In addition, substantially all of the Company’s tenant leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the negative impact of inflation in the near term. Such lease provisions\ninclude clauses that require tenants to reimburse the Company for inflation-sensitive costs such as real estate taxes, insurance and many of the operating expenses it incurs. In addition, many\nof our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates. Significant inflation rate increases over a prolonged period of time\nmay have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business. Conversely, deflation could lead to downward pressure on rents and other sources of income.\nInterest rate increases could result in higher incremental borrowing costs for the Company and our tenants. The duration of our indebtedness and our relatively low exposure to\nfloating rate debt have mitigated the direct impact of inflation and interest rate increases, the degree and pace of these changes have had and may continue to have impacts on our business.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n    \nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page 38 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n20"

Other income and other expense are non-operating in nature.\nSame Store and Non-same Store Operating Income\n    \nNOI is a widely-used non-GAAP financial measure for REITs. The Company believes that NOI is a useful measure of the Company's property operating performance. The Company\ndefines NOI as property revenues (rental and other revenues) less property and related expenses (property operation and maintenance and real estate taxes). Because NOI excludes general\nand administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes, gain or loss on sale or capital expenditures and leasing costs,\nimpairment charges, it provides a performance measure, that when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real\nestate properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. The Company\nuses NOI to evaluate its operating performance since NOI allows the Company to evaluate the impact of factors, such as occupancy levels, lease structure, lease rates and tenant base, have on\nthe Company's results, margins and returns. NOI should not be viewed as a measure of the Company's overall financial performance since it does not reflect general and administrative\nexpenses, depreciation and amortization, involuntary conversion, interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes, market lease amortization, gain or loss on sale or disposition of\nassets, and the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of the Company's properties. Other REITs may use different methodologies for\ncalculating NOI, and accordingly, the Company's NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of same and non-same store NOI from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of net income (loss). Same stores consist of\nthose properties owned during all periods presented in their entirety, non-same stores consist of those properties acquired or disposed of during the periods presented.

We compute FFO in\naccordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999, April 2002 and December 2018). As defined by\nNAREIT, FFO represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization\n(excluding amortization of loan origination costs), impairment of real estate related long-lived assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Most industry\nanalysts and equity REITs, including us, consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses on dispositions and\nexcluding depreciation, FFO is a helpful tool that can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods, or as compared to different\ncompanies. Management uses FFO as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using GAAP net income alone as the\nprimary measure of our operating performance.

Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of December 31,\n2022, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such\ninformation is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\n    \nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n    \nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting, as defined in rules\npromulgated under the Exchange Act, is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n \n26"

The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor\nour internal control over financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary, as disclosure and internal controls are intended to be dynamic systems that change (including\nimprovements and corrections) as conditions warrant.\n    \nManagement conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, utilizing the framework established\nin “INTERNAL CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). Based on this assessment,\nmanagement has determined that our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 were effective.\n    \nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable\nassurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may\nbecome inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal controls over financial reporting. Management's\nreport was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this Annual\nReport.\n    \nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n    \nOn August 22, 2022, the Company completed the Cedar Acquisition and accordingly the Company’s management has integrated Cedar’s operations into its internal control over\nfinancial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to its business processes related to the Cedar Acquisition. None of these integration activities had a material impact on our\nsystem of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2022\n \nItem 9B.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nconsolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its\ninternal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an\nopinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of Investment Properties for Impairment\nDescription of Matter\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company’s investment properties totaled $561.0 million. As more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluates its\ninvestment properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. Management evaluates\nvarious qualitative factors in determining whether or not events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an investment property may not be recoverable.\n30"

      "text": "Auditing the Company’s impairment assessment involved subjectivity due to the estimation required to assess significant assumptions utilized in estimating the recoverability of the\ninvestment properties based on undiscounted operating income and residual values, such as assumptions related to renewal and renegotiations of current leases, estimates of new leases on\nvacant spaces, and estimates of operating costs.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nTo test the Company’s evaluation of investment properties for impairment, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies applied, evaluating the\nsignificant assumptions discussed above and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the analysis. We compared the recoverability calculated to the remaining net\nbook value of the assets to ensure recoverability for the properties’ remaining useful lives. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to relevant market information and\nother applicable sources. As part of our evaluation, we performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the undiscounted cash flows of the related\ninvestment property that would result from changes in the assumptions.\nDerivative Liabilities\nDescription of Matter\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had convertible notes with an outstanding principal balance of $33.0 million and 1.6 million common stock warrants. Calculations and accounting for\nthe notes payable and embedded conversion features as well as the warrants require management’s judgments related to initial and subsequent recognition, use of a valuation model, and\ndetermination of the appropriate inputs used in the selected valuation model. As more fully described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes a multinomial\nlattice model valuation technique in measuring the fair value of the notes’ conversion features and a Monte Carlo simulation technique in measuring the fair value of the warrants\nAuditing management’s valuations of the derivative liabilities was challenging due to the complexity of valuation model and the inputs that are highly sensitive to changes such as the\ncommon stock market price, volatility, risk free rates, and yields.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nTo test the accounting for the derivative liabilities resulting from the issuance of warrants and convertible notes, our audit procedures included, among others, inspection of the contracts, and\ntesting completeness and accuracy of the data used as well as management’s application of the relevant accounting guidance. We also involved our valuation specialists to evaluate the\nCompany’s determination of the fair value of the convertible notes inclusive of the embedded features and warrants, including testing the appropriateness of the methodology and underlying\ninputs used and assessing the reasonableness of those inputs.\nValuation of Purchase Price Allocation for Acquisition\nDescription of Matter\nAs more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, on August 22, 2022 the Company acquired Cedar Realty Trust, a 2.9 million square foot shopping center portfolio\nconsisting of 19 properties for an aggregate of $135.5 million of cash merger consideration and acquisition costs. The acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition which required the\nCompany to assess the acquisition-date fair value of all tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities. The Company determines fair value based on estimated cash flow\nprojections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical\noperating results, known trends, and specific market and economic conditions that may affect the properties.\nAuditing management’s estimated fair value of all acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities required the assistance of our valuation professionals with\nspecialized skills and knowledge as the fair value estimates required subjective auditor judgment to evaluate the audit evidence obtained.\n31"

Organization and Basis of Presentation and Consolidation\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. is a Maryland corporation formed on June 23, 2011. The Trust serves as the general partner of Wheeler REIT, L.P. (the “Operating\nPartnership”), which was formed as a Virginia limited partnership on April 5, 2012. At December 31, 2022, the Company owned 99.05% of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31,\n2022, the Trust, through the Operating Partnership, owned and operated seventy-five centers and four undeveloped properties. Twenty-one of these properties are located in South Carolina,\ntwelve in Georgia, ten in Virginia, eight in Pennsylvania, six in North Carolina, four in Massachusetts, four in New Jersey, three in Florida, three in Connecticut, two in Kentucky, two in\nTennessee, one in Alabama, one in Maryland, one in West Virginia, and one in Oklahoma. The Company’s portfolio had total gross rentable space of approximately 8,173,000 square feet and\na leased level of approximately 92.9% at December 31, 2022. Accordingly, the use of the word “Company”, \"we\", \"our\" or \"us\" refers to the Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, except\nwhere the context otherwise requires. The Company includes the Trust, the Operating Partnership, the entities included in the REIT formation and the entities acquired since November 2012.\nThe Company prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. All\nmaterial balances and transactions between the consolidated entities of the Company have been eliminated.\nThe Company owns, leases and operates income producing grocery-anchored centers, neighborhood centers, community centers and free-standing retail properties with a strategy to\nacquire high quality retail properties that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. The Company targets properties in communities that have stable demographics. The Company considers\nproperties that are generally located in the most prominent shopping districts in their respective markets, ideally situated at major “Main and Main” intersections. The Company generally\nleases its properties to national and regional supermarket chains and selects retailers that offer necessity and value oriented services and items and generate regular consumer traffic. The\nCompany’s tenants carry goods and offer services that are less impacted by fluctuations in the broader U.S. economy and consumers’ disposable income, which it believes generates more\npredictable property-level cash flows.\nThe Trust through the Operating Partnership owns Wheeler Interests, LLC (“WI”) and Wheeler Real Estate, LLC (“WRE”) (collectively the “Operating Companies”). The Operating\nCompanies are Taxable REIT Subsidiaries (“TRS”) to accommodate serving the Non-REIT Properties since applicable REIT regulations consider the income derived from these services to\nbe “bad” income subject to taxation. The regulations allow for costs incurred by the Company commensurate with the services performed for the Non-REIT Properties to be allocated to a\nTRS.\nAcquisition of Cedar Realty Trust\nOn March 2, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”) with Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. (“Cedar”), Cedar Realty Trust\nPartnership, L.P., (“Cedar OP”), WHLR Merger Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and WHLR OP Merger Sub LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merger Sub I (“Merger\nSub II”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Cedar, including 19 of its shopping center assets, in an all-cash merger transaction consisting, in accordance with the terms of the\nMerger Agreement, of a payment to Cedar common shareholders of merger consideration of $9.48 per common share (the “Cedar Acquisition”).\nOn August 22, 2022, the Company completed the merger transaction with Cedar. As a result of the merger, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of the Cedar's\ncommon stock, which ceased to be publicly traded on the NYSE. Cedar’s outstanding 7.25% Series B Preferred Stock and 6.50% Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding and continue to\ntrade on the NYSE. Each outstanding share of common stock of Cedar and outstanding common unit of the Cedar OP held by persons other than Cedar immediately prior to the merger were\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment of $9.48 per share or unit. As a result Cedar became a subsidiary of the REIT.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company incurred acquisition related costs of $5.51 million for the merger. These costs were capitalized as part of the acquisition and\nare primarily comprised of professional fees and legal fees, see Note 3 included in this Form 10-K for further details.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K include Cedar starting from the date of acquisition. We have determined that this acquisition is not a variable\ninterest entity, as defined under the consolidation topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\"), Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, and we evaluated such entity\nunder the voting model and concluded we should consolidate the entity. Under the voting model, we consolidate the\n37"

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n    \nInvestment Properties\n    \nThe Company records investment properties and related intangibles at fair value upon acquisition. Investment properties include both acquired and constructed assets. Improvements\nand major repairs and maintenance are capitalized when the repair and maintenance substantially extends the useful life, increases capacity or improves the efficiency of the asset. All other\nrepair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\n    \nThe Company allocates the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the asset based upon the fair value of each component which may be derived from various\nobservable or unobservable inputs and assumptions. Also, the Company may utilize third party valuation specialists. These components typically include buildings, land and any intangible\nassets related to out-of-market leases, tenant relationships and in-place leases the Company determines to exist. The Company determines fair value based on estimated cash flow projections\nthat utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating\nresults, known trends and specific market and economic conditions that may affect the property. Factors considered by management in the analysis of determining the as-if-vacant property\nvalue include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, management\nincludes real estate taxes, insurance and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, tenant demand and other economic conditions. Management also\nestimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, tenant improvements, legal and other related expenses. Intangibles related to out-of-market leases, tenant relationships\nand in-place lease value are recorded at fair value as acquired lease intangibles and are amortized as an adjustment to rental revenue or amortization expense, as appropriate, over the\nremaining terms of the underlying leases.\n    \nThe Company records depreciation on buildings and improvements utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, generally 5 to 40 years. The\nCompany reviews depreciable lives of investment properties periodically and makes adjustments to reflect a shorter economic life, when necessary. Tenant allowances, tenant inducements\nand tenant improvements are amortized utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related lease or occupancy term of the tenant, if shorter.\n \nAmounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated remaining life of the acquired building or related improvements. The Company amortizes amounts allocated to\ntenant improvements, in-place lease assets and other lease-related intangibles over the remaining life of the underlying leases. The Company also estimates the value of other acquired\nintangible assets, if any, and amortizes them over the remaining life of the underlying related intangibles.\n    \nThe Company reviews investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of\ninvestment properties may not be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, declines in the property’s cash flows, occupancy and fair market value. The Company\nmeasures any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted future operating income before depreciation and amortization, plus its residual value, is less than the\ncarrying value of the property. Estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization include renewal and renegotiations of current leases, estimates of new leases on\nvacant spaces, estimates of operating costs and fluctuating market conditions. The renewal and renegotiations of leases in some cases must be approved by additional third parties outside the\ncontrol of the Company and the tenant. If such renewed or renegotiated leases are approved at amounts below current estimates, then impairment adjustments may be necessary in the future.\nTo the extent impairment has occurred, the Company charges to income the excess of the carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value. The Company estimates fair value using\nunobservable data such as operating income, estimated capitalization rates, or multiples, leasing prospects for vacant spaces and local market information. These valuation assumptions are\nbased on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurement and represent Level 3 inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity\nand that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.     \nAssets Held For Sale and Discontinued Operations\n38"

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nThe Company may decide to sell properties that are held for use. The Company records these properties as held for sale when management has committed to a plan to sell the assets,\nactively seeks a buyer for the assets, and the consummation of the sale is considered probable and is expected within one year. Properties classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of\ntheir carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell. When the carrying value exceeds the fair value, less estimated costs to sell, an impairment expense is recognized. The\nCompany estimates fair value, less estimated closing costs, based on similar real estate sales transactions. These valuation assumptions are based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair\nvalue measurement and represent Level 2 and 3 inputs. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets\nthat are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the\nassets or liabilities. See Note 3 for additional details on impairment of assets held for sale for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nAssets held for sale are presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the disposition represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on the\nCompany's financial position or results of operations. This includes the net gain (or loss) upon disposal of property held for sale, the property's operating results, depreciation and interest\nexpense.\n    \nConditional Asset Retirement Obligation\n    \nA conditional asset retirement obligation represents a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement depends on a future\nevent that may or may not be within the Company’s control. Currently, the Company does not have any conditional asset retirement obligations. However, any such obligations identified in\nthe future would result in the Company recording a liability if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Environmental studies conducted at the time the Company acquired\nits properties did not reveal any material environmental liabilities, and the Company is unaware of any subsequent environmental matters that would have created a material liability. The\nCompany believes that its properties are currently in material compliance with applicable environmental, as well as non-environmental, statutory and regulatory requirements. The Company\ndid not record any conditional asset retirement obligation liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n    \nCash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\n    \nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost,\nwhich approximates fair value. Cash equivalents consist primarily of bank operating accounts and money markets. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to\nconcentrations of credit risk include its cash and cash equivalents and its trade accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with institutions of high credit quality.\nRestricted cash represents amounts held by lenders for real estate taxes, insurance, reserves for capital improvements, leasing costs and tenant security deposits.\n    \nThe Company places its cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash on deposit with financial institutions in the United States, which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCompany (\"FDIC\") up to $250 thousand. The Company's loss in the event of failure of these financial institutions is represented by the difference between the FDIC limit and the total\namounts on deposit. Management monitors the financial institutions credit worthiness in conjunction with balances on deposit to minimize risk.\n    \nTenant Receivables\n    \nTenant receivables include base rents, tenant reimbursements and receivables attributable to recording rents on a straight-line basis. The Company determines an allowance for the\nuncollectible portion of accrued rents and accounts receivable based upon customer credit-worthiness (including expected recovery of a claim with respect to any tenants in bankruptcy),\nhistorical bad debt levels, and current economic trends. The Company considers a receivable past due once it becomes delinquent per the terms of the lease. The Company’s standard lease\nform considers a rent charge past due after five days. A past due receivable triggers certain events such as notices, fees and other allowable and required actions per the lease. As of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s allowance for uncollectible tenant receivables totaled $3.15 million and $633 thousand, respectively.\n39"

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nAbove and Below Market Lease Intangibles, net\nThe Company determines the above and below market lease intangibles upon acquiring a property. Above and below market lease intangibles are amortized over the life of the\nrespective leases. Amortization of above and below market lease intangibles is recorded as a component of rental revenues.\nDeferred Costs and Other Assets, net\n    \nThe Company’s deferred costs and other assets consist primarily of leasing commissions, leases in place, capitalized legal and marketing costs, tenant relationships and ground lease\nsandwich interest intangibles associated with acquisitions. The Company’s lease origination costs consist primarily of the portion of property acquisitions allocated to lease originations and\ncommissions paid to third parties in connection with lease originations. The Company generally records amortization of lease origination costs on a straight-line basis over the terms of the\nrelated leases. Amortization of deferred costs and other assets represents a component of depreciation and amortization expense.\nPaycheck Protection Program\nThe Company received proceeds of $552 thousand (the \"PPP funds\") pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the \"PPP\") under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic\nSecurity (“CARES”) Act.\nThe PPP funds were received in the form of a promissory note, dated April 24, 2020 (the “Promissory Note”), between the Company and KeyBank as the lender. Under the terms of\nthe CARES Act, the Promissory Note was forgiven during the year ended December 31, 2021 and the corresponding forgiveness of the liability was recorded as \"other income\" on the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments,\nincluding stock purchase warrants and convertible notes, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial\ninstruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value\nreported in the consolidated statements of operations. The assumptions used in these fair value estimates are based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurement and\nrepresent Level 3 inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nThe Company may incur debt issuance costs in connection with raising funds through debt. These costs may be paid in the form of cash, or equity (such as warrants and convertible\nnotes). These costs are amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately\nexpensed. Debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability in the consolidated balance sheets.\nRevenue Recognition\nLease Contract Revenue\n    \nThe Company has two classes of underlying assets relating to rental revenue activity, retail and office space. The Company retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of\nownership of these underlying assets and accounts for these leases as operating leases. The Company combines lease and nonlease components in lease contracts, which includes combining\nbase rent and tenant reimbursement revenue.\nThe Company accrues minimum rents on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases which results in an unbilled rent asset or deferred rent liability being recorded on\nthe balance sheet. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were $6.52 million and $5.77 million, respectively, in unbilled rent which is included in \"rents and other tenant receivables, net.\"\n40"

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nAdditionally, certain lease agreements contain provisions that grant additional rents based on tenants’ sales volumes (contingent or percentage rent). Percentage rents are recognized when the\ntenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements as variable lease income.\nThe Company’s leases generally require the tenant to reimburse the Company for a substantial portion of its expenses incurred in operating, maintaining, repairing, insuring and\nmanaging the shopping center and common areas (collectively defined as Common Area Maintenance or “CAM” expenses). This significantly reduces the Company’s exposure to increases\nin costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation or other outside factors. These reimbursements are considered nonlease components which the Company combines with the lease\ncomponent. The Company calculates the tenant’s share of operating costs by multiplying the total amount of the operating costs by the tenant's pro-rata percentage of square footage to total\nsquare footage of the property. The Company also receives monthly payments for these reimbursements from substantially all its tenants throughout the year. The Company recognizes tenant\nreimbursements as variable lease income.\nAdditionally, the Company has tenants who pay real estate taxes directly to the taxing authority. The Company excludes these Company costs paid directly by the tenant to third\nparties on the Company’s behalf from both variable revenue payments recognized and the associated property operating expenses. The Company does not evaluate whether certain sales taxes\nand other similar taxes are the Company’s costs or tenants' costs. Instead, the Company accounts for these costs as tenant costs.\nThe Company recognizes lease termination fees, which are included in \"other revenues\" on the consolidated statements of operations, in the year that the lease is terminated and\ncollection of the fee is reasonably assured. Upon early lease termination, the Company records losses related to unrecovered intangibles and other assets.\nThe below table disaggregates the Company’s revenue by type of service for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\nMinimum rent\n$\n57,533 \n$\n45,896 \nTenant reimbursements - variable lease revenue\n16,665 \n13,120 \nStraight-line rents\n800 \n1,060 \nPercentage rent - variable lease revenue\n558 \n531 \nLease termination fees\n134 \n139 \nOther\n1,316 \n803 \n     Total\n77,006 \n61,549 \nCredit losses on operating lease receivables\n(361)\n(239)\n     Total\n$\n76,645 \n$\n61,310 \nIncome Taxes\n    \nThe Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury regulations relating to REIT qualification. In\norder to maintain this REIT status, the regulations require the Company to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to stockholders and meet certain other asset and income tests, as well\nas other requirements. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT, it will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates for the years in which it fails to qualify. If the Company loses its REIT\nstatus it could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for five years unless the Company’s failure to qualify was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were satisfied.\n \nManagement has evaluated the effect of the guidance provided by GAAP on Accounting for Uncertainty of Income Taxes and has determined that the Company had no uncertain\nincome tax positions.\nFinancial Instruments\n    \n41"

Operating leases, in which the Company is the lessee, are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets\nand operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating\nlease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company's leases do not provide an\nimplicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating\nlease ROU assets include any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. The Company's lease terms may include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that the\ncompany will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company elects the practical expedient to combine lease and associated nonlease components. The lease components are the majority of its leasing arrangements and the\nCompany accounts for the combined component as an operating lease. In the event the Company modifies existing ground leases or enters into new ground leases, such leases may be\nclassified as finance leases.\nNoncontrolling Interests\n    \nNoncontrolling interests is the portion of equity in the Operating Partnership not attributable to the Trust and noncontrolling interest attributable to the acquisition of Cedar. The\nownership interests not held by the parent are considered noncontrolling interests. Accordingly, noncontrolling interests have been reported in equity on the consolidated balance sheets but\nseparate from the Company’s equity. On the consolidated statements of operations, the subsidiaries are reported at the consolidated amount, including both the amount attributable to the\nCompany and noncontrolling interests.

The noncontrolling interest percentage is calculated at any point in time by dividing the number of units not owned\nby the Company by the total number of units outstanding. The noncontrolling interest ownership percentage will change as additional units are issued or as units are exchanged for the\nCompany’s $0.01 par value per share common stock (\"Common Stock\"). In accordance with GAAP, any changes in the value from period to period are charged to additional paid-in capital.\nThe noncontrolling interest attributable to the acquisition of Cedar represents the fair value of Cedar's outstanding 7.25% Series B Preferred Stock (\"Cedar Series B Preferred\") and\n6.50% Series C Preferred Stock (\"Cedar Series C Preferred\") as of August 22, 2022, the date of acquisition. The valuation assumption was based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair\nvalue measurements and represents Level 1 inputs. Level 1 inputs represent observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. The\ntotal cumulative dividends for the Cedar Series B Preferred and Cedar Series C Preferred were $3.91 million as of December 31, 2022 and are included as a reduction to net loss attributable\nto Wheeler REIT Common Stockholders on the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2020-06, “Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and\nHedging—Contracts in Entities Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40).” This ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating two of the three models in ASC 470-20 that\nrequire separating embedded conversion features from convertible instruments. In addition, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings\nper share and the treasury stock method will be no longer available. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. We adopted this guidance effective January\n1, 2021 under the modified retrospective adoption approach. There was no effect to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of adoption. The comparative information has not\nbeen restated and continues to be presented according to accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\" This update enhances\nthe methodology of measuring expected credit losses to include the use of forward-looking information to better calculate credit loss estimates. The guidance will apply to most financial\nassets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, such as accounts receivable and loans. The guidance will require that the Company estimate the lifetime expected credit loss\nwith respect to these receivables and record allowances that, when deducted from the balance of the receivables, represent the net amounts expected to be collected. This guidance is effective\nfor fiscal years, and for interim reporting periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022, however the Company is early adopting as of January 1, 2022. In November\n2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19 to clarify that operating lease receivables, including straight-line rent receivables, recorded by lessors are explicitly excluded from the scope of Topic\n326. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standard-setting bodies are not currently applicable to the Company or are not expected to have\na significant impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n43"

Commitments and Contingencies\nInsurance\n    \nThe Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in its portfolio under an\ninsurance policy, in addition to other coverages, such as trademark and pollution coverage that may be appropriate for certain of its properties. Additionally, the Company carries a directors’,\nofficers’, entity and employment practices liability insurance policy that covers such claims made against the Company and its directors and officers. The Company believes the policy\nspecifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate for its properties given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice; however, its insurance coverage\nmay not be sufficient to fully cover losses.\n    \nConcentration of Credit Risk\n    \nThe Company is subject to risks incidental to the ownership and operation of commercial real estate. These risks include, among others, the risks normally associated with changes in\nthe general economic climate, trends in the retail industry, creditworthiness of tenants, competition for tenants and customers, changes in tax laws, interest rates, the availability of financing\nand potential liability under environmental and other laws.\n    \nThe Company’s portfolio of properties is dependent upon regional and local economic conditions and is geographically located in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and Northeast, which\nmarkets represented approximately 44%, 41% and 15%, respectively, of the total annualized base rent of the properties in its portfolio as of December 31, 2022. The Company’s geographic\nconcentration may cause it to be more susceptible to adverse developments in those markets than if it owned a more geographically diverse portfolio. Additionally, the Company’s retail\nshopping center properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of, or a store closure by, one or more of these tenants.    \n(1)\n59"

Commitments and Contingencies (continued)\nRegulatory and Environmental\n    \nAs the owner of the buildings on our properties, the Company could face liability for the presence of hazardous materials (e.g., asbestos or lead) or other adverse conditions (e.g.,\npoor indoor air quality) in its buildings. Environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of hazardous materials in buildings, and if the Company does not comply with\nsuch laws, it could face fines for such noncompliance. Also, the Company could be liable to third parties (e.g., occupants of the buildings) for damages related to exposure to hazardous\nmaterials or adverse conditions in its buildings, and the Company could incur material expenses with respect to abatement or remediation of hazardous materials or other adverse conditions in\nits buildings. In addition, some of the Company’s tenants routinely handle and use hazardous or regulated substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties, which are subject\nto regulation. Such environmental and health and safety laws and regulations could subject the Company or its tenants to liability resulting from these activities. Environmental liabilities\ncould affect a tenant’s ability to make rental payments to the Company, and changes in laws could increase the potential liability for noncompliance. This may result in significant\nunanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect the Company’s operations. The Company is not aware of any material contingent liabilities, regulatory matters or\nenvironmental matters that may exist.\n    \nLitigation\n    \nThe Company is involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business, including, but not limited to commercial disputes. The Company believes that\nsuch litigation, claims and administrative proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on its financial position or its results of operations. The Company records a liability when it\nconsiders the loss probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the below legal proceedings are in process.\nDavid Kelly v. Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc., Circuit Court for the City of Virginia Beach, Virginia. Former CEO David Kelly filed suit on May 28, 2020, alleging\nbreach of his employment contract. On March 15, 2022, the Court granted Mr. Kelly $340 thousand with interest thereon at a rate of 6% per annum from the date of termination, April\n13, 2020, until paid, plus attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of $311 thousand. On March 31, 2022, $691 thousand was paid to Mr. Kelly. The Company has now fulfilled its\nobligations pursuant to the Court’s Order in this case.\nJCP Investment Partnership LP, et al v.

On March 22, 2021, JCP Investment\nPartnership, LP, a Texas limited partnership and stockholder of the Company, JCP Investment Partners, LP, a Texas limited partnership and stockholder of the Company, JCP\nInvestment Holdings, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and stockholder of the Company, and JCP Investment Management, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and\nstockholder of the Company (collectively, the “JCP Plaintiffs”), filed suit against the Company and certain current and former directors and former officers of the Company (the\n“Individual Defendants”). The complaint alleged that the Company amended provisions of its charter (as set forth in the Articles Supplementary in 2018) governing the issuance of the\nCompany’s Series D Preferred in violation of Maryland corporate law and without obtaining the consent of preferred stockholders and, therefore, the court should declare the\nCompany’s said amendment invalid, enjoin further purportedly unauthorized amendments, and either compel the Company to redeem the JCP Plaintiffs' stock or enter judgment for\nmonetary damages the JCP Plaintiffs purportedly sustained based on the Company’s alleged breach of its contractual duties to redeem the JCP Plaintiffs’ Series D Preferred. The\ncomplaint also alleges certain violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and\nalleges that the Individual Defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The JCP Plaintiffs are each purportedly a holder of the Company’s Series D Preferred. The\ncomplaint sought damages, interest, attorneys’ fees, other costs and expenses, and such other relief as the court may deem just and equitable. The Company filed an answer to the\ncomplaint denying any liability. The Individual Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was denied. The JCP Plaintiffs filed a Motion For Partial Summary\nJudgment, as to which the Company and the Individual Defendants filed oppositions. The Judge denied the JCP Plaintiffs' Motion and ordered the parties to prepare a joint discovery\nschedule. The Judge also ordered the parties to engage in mediation with a Magistrate Judge. During the mediation process, the Company made no offers of settlement. On or about\nNovember 2, 2022, the JCP Plaintiffs entered into a Settlement Agreement resolving all their claims against the Individual Defendants, but to which the Company did not join.\nThereafter, the JCP Plaintiffs advised the Company that they had decided to dismiss their claims against the Company, and the JCP Plaintiffs requested pursuant to applicable rule that\nthe Company consent to the filing of a Stipulation of\n60"

Cedar Realty Trust, Inc., Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. et al. in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Case\nNo. 8:22-cv-01142. On May 6, 2022, a purported holder of preferred stock of Cedar filed a separate putative class action on the United States District Court for the District of\nMaryland, Case No. 1:22-cv-01103 against Cedar and Cedar’s former Board of Directors arising out of those same transactions. Following the denial of motions seeking to enjoin the\nacquisition of Cedar by the Company and other preliminary relief, the cases were consolidated under Case No.: 1-22-cv-1103. A consolidated amended complaint was filed on August\n24, 2022 (the “Operative Complaint”). The Operative Complaint includes allegations of breach of contract against Cedar with respect to the Articles Supplementary governing the\nterms of Cedar’s preferred stock and breach of fiduciary duty against the members of Cedar’s former Board of Directors. The plaintiffs allege that Cedar breached their liquidation and\nconversion rights as set forth in Cedar’s Articles Supplementary, and that the members of Cedar’s former Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duty in structuring the\ntransactions that include the merger. The Complaint further alleges that the Company tortiously interfered with Cedar’s contract with the owners of Cedar’s preferred stock and aided\nand abetted the alleged breach of fiduciary duty by Cedar’s former Board of Directors. The Operative Complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount. The Company and Cedar\nhave filed a motion to dismiss the Operative Complaint in its entirety which is fully briefed. The plaintiffs have recently filed a motion to certify an issue of law addressed in the\nmotion to dismiss to Maryland’s Supreme Court. That motion is not yet fully briefed. At this juncture, the outcome of the litigation is uncertain.\nKrasner v.

Preferred Shareholder Litigation discussed above. The defendants\nremoved the case to federal court. The plaintiff filed a motion to remand the case to state court which is fully briefed. The Company and Cedar intend to seek procedural relief\nprecluding this case from proceeding in tandem with the Maryland action. At this juncture, the outcome of the litigation is uncertain.\nHigh Income Securities Fund v. Cedar Realty Trust, Inc., et al., No. 2:22-cv-4031, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. On July 11, 2022, a\npurported holder of the Company's outstanding preferred stock filed a complaint against Cedar and Cedar's former Board of Directors alleging that the Defendants violated Section\n10(b) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by making false and misleading statements and omissions, and that the former Cedar Board are control\npersons under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. On August 12, 2022, Defendants requested permission to file a motion to dismiss, and Plaintiff responded to Defendants’ request on\nSeptember 7, 2022. The court granted Defendants’ request to file a motion to dismiss on October 25, 2022. Defendants served their motion to dismiss on December 23, 2022, which\nPlaintiff opposed on January 27, 2023.

Harbor Pointe Associates, LLC,\nthen owned by an affiliate of former CEO, Jon Wheeler, entered into an Economic Development Agreement with the Grove Economic Development Authority for this infrastructure\ndevelopment and in the event the ad valorem taxes were insufficient to cover annual debt service, Harbor Pointe Associates, LLC would reimburse the Grove Economic Development\nAuthority (the “Harbor Pointe Agreement”).

No liability was recorded as of December 31, 2022.\n11. Related Party Transactions\n    \nThe Company performs property management and leasing services for Cedar, a subsidiary of the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Cedar paid the Company\n$1.05 million for these services. Related party amounts due to the Company as of December 31, 2022 were $7.33 million, which consists primarily of financing costs, real estate taxes and\ncosts paid on Cedar's behalf at the closing of the KeyBank-Cedar Loan Agreement. These related party amounts have been eliminated for consolidation purposes.\nReimbursement of Proxy Solicitation Expenses\nThe Company agreed to reimburse the Stilwell Value Partners VII, L.P., Stilwell Activist Fund, L.P., Stilwell Activist Investments, L.P., Stilwell Value LLC and Joseph Stilwell\n(collectively, the “Stilwell Group”), for expenses it incurred in connection with the 2019 Stilwell Solicitation. At the 2019 annual meeting, our stockholders elected three nominees designated\nby the Stilwell Group to the Board of Directors. The Stilwell Group disclosed in the Stilwell Solicitation that it intended to seek reimbursement of the expenses it incurred in connection with\nsuch solicitation. This reimbursement was recorded on the consolidated statements of operations as \"other expense\".

The Series B Preferred has no redemption\nrights. However, the Series B Preferred is subject to a mandatory conversion once the 20-trading day volume-weighted average closing price of our Common Stock, $0.01 par\nvalue per share, exceeds $58 per share; once this weighted average closing price is met, each share of our Series B Preferred will automatically convert into shares of our\nCommon Stock at a conversion price equal to $40.00 per share. In addition, holders of our Series B Preferred also have the option, at any time, to convert shares of our Series B\nPreferred into shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price of $40.00 per share of Common Stock. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding\nup of our company, the holders of shares of our Series B Preferred shall be entitled to be paid out of our assets a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share.

We have listed the Notes on Nasdaq Capital Market under the trading symbol\n“WHLRL”. The Notes were issued under the Indenture.\nThe stated maturity of the Notes is December 31, 2031. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on June 30 and December 31 of each year starting on December 31, 2022\nto holders of record at the close of business on the preceding June 1 and December 1, respectively. Interest will accrue on the Notes at a rate of 7.0% per annum. Interest will\naccrue on the Notes from and including the issuance date or from, and including, the last date in respect of which interest has been paid or provided for, as the case may be, to,\nbut excluding, the next interest payment date or the maturity date, as the case may be.
