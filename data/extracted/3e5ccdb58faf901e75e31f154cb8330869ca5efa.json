      "text": "STRATEGIC REPORT\nREVIEW OF OPERATIONS\nDuring the financial year ended 30 June 2022, Structural Monitoring Systems Plc (“SMS”, the “Group” or the “Company”), \nachieved a key milestone in the granting of a Supplementary Type Certificate (“STC”) for its ground-breaking CVM™ \ntechnology. \nSMS and its Canadian-based, wholly owned subsidiary, Anodyne Electronics Manufacturing Corp (“AEM”), logged total \nsales for the 2022 financial year of $15.70m (excluding intercompany sales), an increase of 2% on the year prior.\nAt the reporting date, the balance of Group cash and cash equivalents was $1.80m (2021: $2.38m). Borrowings as at \n30 June 2022 amounted to $5.46m (2021: $nil) as the Company utilised an established loan facility with HSBC Canada \nto debt fund the successful acquisition of Canadian business, Eagle Audio, through its subsidiary Anodyne Electronics \nManufacturing Corp (“AEM”). The acquisition is already proving to be very successful with its suite of product offerings \nsignificantly improving overall revenue and profit margins. AEM also utilises a working capital facility with the same banker \nmaking up the balance of borrowings. The Group has placed $1.15m on deposit with HSBC Canada as security for its loan \nfacility.\nBREAKTHROUGH FAA CERTIFICATION OF CVM™ AND POST CERTIFICATION \nINITIATIVES\nSMS announced in March this year that the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had granted its authority \nto issue a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) approval for the use of the Company’s CVM™ technology on the B737-800 \nIntelstat (Gogo) Wi-Fi antenna support structure inspection. The approval marked a milestone in aviation history as the \nfirst ever in the world regulatory agency approved sensor technology validated and certified for detecting critical structural \ncracks on aircraft. \nThe certification of CVM™ sensors to detect cracks on aircraft is expected to meaningfully impact industry maintenance \ninspection methods and reduce operating costs for the industry as it continues to recover from the unprecedented impact \nof the pandemic. \nThe Company is focused on progressing the commercialisation strategy for CVM™ and on ongoing positive engagement \nwith potential customers both in the US and more broadly to achieve this end goal. \nTo that end, the management and engineering team received approval from Boeing for the procedures and equipment to \ncommence the POD testing phase of the 737 APB program in (August) at the new facility in Kelowna.  This critical APB \napplication developed in conjunction with Delta Air Lines has a potential market in excess of 400 aircraft. \nAdditionally, another major airline operator is working with the team to identify a range of applications where our \nmonitoring systems may avoid or defer out of cycle checks which currently consume several days.\n4\nSTRUCTURAL MONITORING SYSTEMS PLC – ANNUAL REPORT 2022"

A number of papers on CVM will be presented to the \nattendees.  This is a significant industry event where all major US airlines will be represented and presents an opportunity \nfor industry leaders to discuss current trends and developments in NDT methodologies and to further existing relationships \nand discussions with key stakeholders and initiate others. \nCORPORATE \nThe Company completed a Rights issue in April 2022 through the issue of 5,461,451 CDIs at an issue price of $0.90 per \nCDI with a 1:2 free attaching unlisted option exercisable at $1.20 with an expiry date of 6 April 2024 raising $4.91m \nbefore issue costs.\nDuring the year a legal claim for royalty fees against wholly owned subsidiary Structural Monitoring Systems Limited was \nupheld and settled. The claim was disclosed as a contingency in the notes to the 2021 Annual Report. A subsequent claim \nfor costs for the same case was also upheld and settled subsequent to the balance date.\nA number of changes occurred at Board level during the financial year. The Company accepted the resignations of former \nChairman Will Rouse and of directors Stephen Forman and Mike Reveley earlier this year and the Company wishes them \nwell in their future endeavours.\nBryant McLarty, Hendrik Deurloo and Brian Wall were all appointed as Non-executive Directors during the year. The \nCompany also announced the appointment of internationally recognised senior executive, Ross Love, as Executive \nChairman on July 13 this year, subsequent to the reporting date. \nMr Love is an experienced global executive and consultant with wide public and private sector experience in policy reform \nand business strategy transformation in Australia and the United States.\nHe was formerly a Senior Partner at the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) where he worked for more than 25 years, most \nrecently as head of its New York business, and prior to that its Australian and New Zealand businesses. \nMr Love is currently chair of the Western Australian Water Corporation, Chair of the Fremantle Port Authority and a \ndirector of Tellus Group Holdings and brings decades of business leadership and management to the role of Executive \nChair. \nANODYNE ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURING CORPORATION (“AEM”) FINANCIAL \nPERFORMANCE UPDATE\nWholly owned SMS subsidiary, Anodyne Electronics Manufacturing Corp (“AEM”), recorded $15.70m in revenue, an \nincrease of 2% on the prior year and normalised EBITDA** for the year to 30 June 2022 of $2.27m (inc. intercompany \nsales on an arms-length basis), a decrease of 31% year on year. \nThis was achieved against the backdrop of the significant impact of the Covid pandemic that affected both sales and \nproduction at the platform level, while concurrent supply chain difficulties and inflationary price pressures encountered \nduring the year compounded the overall business impact. AEM also navigated a move to new premises and the installation \nof new plant and equipment with minimal disruption to operations during the year.\nThis full year result, exceeding budget, is a tribute to the excellent team the Company has assembled in Kelowna, \noperating in extremely challenging conditions. Through substantial investment in research and development, the successful \nacquisition of Eagle audio and higher margins achieved from stronger sales of AEM-developed products, the Group was \nable to more than offset the effects of softer sales in contract manufactured products. \n5\nSTRUCTURAL MONITORING SYSTEMS PLC – ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nRegistered Number 04834265"

(929m2) from its previous premises.\nThe move represents a strategic investment in new manufacturing equipment and offers the AEM team further \nopportunities for improvement and innovation with its custom footprint and layout, new state of the art equipment and \noptimisation of available space. \nThe new premises are now fully operational with product departments open and operating at full capacity. \nACQUISITION OF EAGLE AUDIO SEPTEMBER 2021\nThe Company, via its wholly owned subsidiary AEM, announced the acquisition of key avionics division, Eagle Audio, from \nEagle Copters Ltd in September 2021 at a purchase price of CA$4.12m. The transaction was internally funded through \ncash and the use of existing low-cost debt facilities with HSBC Canada. \nThe audio acquisition represents a natural synergy with AEM’s existing product offering and manufacturing facilities and \ncomplements its current significant audio R&D effort, providing additional growth opportunities and clear new R&D \npathways into related product areas. \nAs outlined above, this strategic acquisition is already proving to be very successful with its suite of product offerings \nsignificantly improving revenue and profit margins.\nPROJECTED OUTLOOK\nLooking ahead to the next financial year, SMS will continue to increase investment in R&D and sales team expansion \nwhich will result in a continuation of the transition to sales of higher margin, AEM developed products. The move to a new \npurpose-built facility completed in January 2022 should result in increased efficiencies of production and improved profit \nmargins.\nDirectors and Management are constantly monitoring the Covid pandemic and are not in a position at this stage to provide \nfirm forecasts on the effects it may have on operations for FY2023. Current visibility and realised activity levels, however, \nindicate that at this stage as evidenced by improvement in revenues since March 2022 – that core operations will continue \nto recover from the Covid pandemic. The SMS Board and management will continue to monitor the evolving global \nsituation closely and regularly.\nANALYSIS USING KEY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND MILESTONES\nAs at 30 June 2022, the Group had approximately $1.80m cash at bank (2021: $2.38m).\nThe Group recorded a loss for the financial year of $4.03m (2021: $1.96m). The increase in loss was incurred due in \npart to the payment of royalty fees of $0.69m (2021: $nil), depreciation and amortisation expenses of $1.64m (2021: \n$0.97m) arising from assets acquired in the move to AEM’s new manufacturing facility, R&D expenses of $0.64m (2021: \n$0.18m) incurred by AEM as it continues to generate new products to meet customer demand and increased employee \ncosts of $6.86m (2021: $5.21m) arising from the increase in staff count undertaken by AEM during the year. The Group \nalso recorded revenue during the year of $15.70m (2021: $15.34m), an increase of 2% year on year. Other key expenses \nduring the year were consumables and raw materials used of $7.88m (2021: $8.26m) and sales and marketing expenses of \n$0.53m (2021: $0.28m).

Further information is provided in note 24 in the notes to the financial statements.\nAs a result of operations in Canada, USA and Australia, the Group’s assets and liabilities can be affected by movements in \nthe C$/A$, US$/A$ and UK/A$ exchange rates.\nThe Group also has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases by an operating unit in \ncurrencies other than the unit’s functional currency.\nThe Group is exposed to foreign currency risk following the acquisition of a Canadian-based subsidiary and the risk could \nincrease in the future as international commercialisation of the Group’s technologies increase. There is currently no form \nof currency hedging or risk strategy in place, but this policy is constantly monitored and appropriate strategies will be \nimplemented if required.\nLiquidity risk arises from the Group's management of working capital. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in \nmeeting its financial obligations as they fall due.\nIn order to maintain liquidity to ensure that sufficient funds are available for ongoing operations and future developments, \nthe Group monitors forecast cash inflows and outflows on a monthly basis. The Group has an established operating loan \nfacility for up to CA$5 million, of which CA$0.72m is available to assist with day to day operating requirements.\nBusiness risks and uncertainties\nThe Group has a reliance on one customer at the present time. The customer accounts for $7.54 million of revenues \ntotalling $15.70 million. The relationship with the customer is secured by a licence agreement and the Group is pursuing \ngrowth opportunities.\nThe ongoing impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is uncertain and it is not practicable to estimate the \npotential impact , positive or negative, after the reporting date.

The \nCompany’s registered office and principal place of business are disclosed on page 2 of this report. The Company’s \nordinary shares, when held as a Chess Depository Interest (CDI) and registered on the CDI register, are tradable on \nthe Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Ordinary shares on the UK register cannot be traded on the Australian \nSecurities Exchange.\n2\t\nSummary of significant accounting policies\n\t\n(a)\t Basis of Preparation\n\t\n\u0007The consolidated financial statements and those of the parent entity are presented in Australian dollars which is \nthe Company’s functional currency and are rounded to the nearest one thousand Australian dollars. The average \nAUD:CAD rate for the year was 0.9184 (2021: 0.9572) and the reporting date AUD:CAD spot rate was 0.8885 \n(2021: 0.9318). CAD is the presentational currency of Anodyne Electronics Manufacturing Corp (AEM), a wholly \nowned subsidiary of the Company.\n\t\n(b)\t Financial Position\n\t\n\u0007The Group reported a net loss after tax of $4.03m(2021: loss $1.96m) and an operating cash outflow of $4.62m \n(2021: cash inflow $1.70m) before tax for the year ended 30 June 2022 and reported working capital of $6.94m \nincluding cash of $1.80m as at that date.\n\u0007\t\n\u0007The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of normal \nbusiness activities, the continued financial performance of AEM, the contribution of the Eagle Audio business, which \nwas acquired during the year and the realisation of assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business \nas well as the availability of an established operating loan facility of up to CA$5 million, of which CA$4.63m has been \ndrawn to date as at the date of this report. The facility, which is provided by AEM’s bankers, while payable on demand \nis long standing and is secured upon receivables and inventory and is subject to loan covenants. Under the conditions \nof the facility two repayments, each of CA$0.5m will be paid by the Company within the next 12 months. Directors \nexpect compliance with the covenants to continue to be met. Subsequent to the reporting date the Completed has \ncompleted a share placement raising $1.93m before issue costs of $0.13m. The Group has included in its cashflow \nforecast a capital raise through the issue of shares to provide additional working capital should the need arise.\n\t\n\u0007The directors have prepared forecasts in respect of future trading. Achievement of such forecasts would allow the \nentity to manage well within its current funding facilities for the foreseeable future. In developing these forecasts, \nthe Directors have made assumptions and performed sensitivity analysis on variables such as revenues and exchange \nrates based upon their view of the current and future economic conditions that will prevail over the forecast period \nof 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements. Business risks and uncertainties applicable to the \nGroup are disclosed on page 21 of the Director’s report.\n\t\n\u0007The directors and senior management will formally consider all measures which would favourably reduce/defer \noperational expenses should actual cash flows be less than budgeted, as they have done in previous years.\n\t\n\u0007The directors therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. \nIt is noted, there is a material uncertainty over going concern should the Group be unable to execute one or more of \nthe following, raising capital through the issue of shares, amending the current debt structure to release further funds, \nor reduce/defer employee costs or other operating costs.\t\nNotes to the financial statements \n30 June 2022\n28\nSTRUCTURAL MONITORING SYSTEMS PLC – ANNUAL REPORT 2022"

The Group and the Company have not adopted \nany standards or interpretations in advance of the required implementation dates.  It is not expected that adoption of \nstandards or interpretations which have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board but have not \nbeen adopted will have a material impact on the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2022. See note 2(d) \nfor further consideration.\n\t\n(d)\t Accounting standards and Interpretations\n\t\nNew Accounting Standards and Interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted\n\t\n\u0007The Directors have also reviewed all of the new and revised Standards and Interpretations in issue not yet adopted \nfor the year ended 30 June 2022.  As a result of this review the Directors have determined that there is no material \nimpact of the Standards and Interpretations in issue not yet adopted on the Group and, therefore, no change is \nnecessary to Group accounting policies.\n\t\n(e) \t Basis of consolidation\n\t\n\u0007The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities and results of entities controlled by Structural \nMonitoring Systems Plc at the end of the reporting period. A controlled entity is any entity over which Structural \nMonitoring Systems Plc is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has \nthe ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity.\n\t\n\u0007Where controlled entities have entered or left the Group during the year, the financial performance of those entities \nis included only for the period of the year that they were controlled.  \n\t\n\u0007In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all inter-group balances and transactions between entities in the \nconsolidated group have been eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\t\n\u0007Non-controlling interests, being the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent, are \nreported separately within the equity section of the consolidated statement of financial position and statement of \ncomprehensive income.  The non-controlling interests in the net assets comprise their interests at the date of the \noriginal business combination and their share of changes in equity since that date.\n\t\nBusiness Combinations \n\t\n\u0007Business combinations occur where an acquirer obtains control over one or more businesses. A business combination \nis accounted for by applying the acquisition method, unless it is a combination involving entities or businesses under \ncommon control.  The business combination will be accounted for from the date that control is attained, whereby \nthe fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) assumed is recognised \n(subject to certain limited exemptions). \n\t\n\u0007When measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination, any asset or liability resulting from a \ncontingent consideration arrangement is also included.  Subsequent to initial recognition, contingent consideration \nclassified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent \nconsideration classified as an asset or liability is remeasured at the end of each reporting period to fair value, \nrecognising any change to fair value in profit or loss, unless the change in value can be identified as existing at \nacquisition date.\nNotes to the financial statements \n30 June 2022\n29\nSTRUCTURAL MONITORING SYSTEMS PLC – ANNUAL REPORT 2022"

Where an \nindicator of impairment exists, the Group makes a formal estimate of the recoverable amount.  Where the carrying \namount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its \nrecoverable amount.\n\t\n\u0007Recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.  It is determined for an individual \nasset, unless the asset’s value in use cannot be estimated to be close to its fair value less costs to sell and it does not \ngenerate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, in which case, the \nrecoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.\nNotes to the financial statements \n30 June 2022\n30\nSTRUCTURAL MONITORING SYSTEMS PLC – ANNUAL REPORT 2022"

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after \ndeducting all of its liabilities.\n\t\nTrade, other and Group payables\n\t\n\u0007Trade, Group and other payables are initially measured at fair value net of direct transaction costs and subsequently \nmeasured at amortised cost.\n\t\nEquity instruments\n\t\nEquity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at fair value on initial recognition net of transaction costs. \n\t\nDerecognition of financial assets (including write-offs) and financial liabilities\n\t\n\u0007A financial asset (or part thereof) is derecognised when the contractual rights to cash flows expire or are settled, or \nwhen the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards \nof ownership are transferred to another party. When there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial \nasset, it is derecognised (“written off”). The gain or loss on derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised \ncost is recognised in profit or loss. A financial liability (or part thereof) is derecognised when the obligation specified in \nthe contract is discharged, cancelled, or expires. Any difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability (or \npart thereof) that is derecognised and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss.\n\t\nImpairment of financial assets\n\u0007\t\n\u0007An impairment loss is recognised for the expected credit losses on financial assets when there is an increased \nprobability that the counterparty will be unable to settle an instrument’s contractual cash flows on the contractual due \ndates, a reduction in the amounts expected to be recovered, or both. The probability of default and expected amounts \nrecoverable are assessed using reasonable and supportable past and forward-looking information that is available \nwithout undue cost or effort. The expected credit loss is a probability-weighted amount determined from a range of \noutcomes and takes into account the time value of money.\n\t\n\u0007For trade receivables, material expected credit losses are measured by applying an expected loss rate to the gross \ncarrying amount.

The risk of a default occurring always takes into consideration all \npossible default events over the expected life of those receivables (“the lifetime expected credit losses”). Different \nprovision rates and periods are used based on groupings of historic credit loss experience by product type, customer \ntype and location.  \n\t\n\u0007For intercompany loans that are repayable on demand, expected credit losses are based on the assumption that \nrepayment of the loan is demanded at the reporting date. If the subsidiary does not have sufficient accessible highly \nliquid assets in order to repay the loan if demanded at the reporting date, an expected credit loss is calculated. This \nis calculated based on the expected cash flows arising from the subsidiary and weighted for probability likelihood \nvariations in cash flows. \n\t\nDefinition of default\n\t\nThe loss allowance on all financial assets is measured by considering the probability of default.\n\t\n\u0007Receivables are considered to be in default when the principal or any interest is significantly more than the associated \t\ncredit terms past due, based on an assessment of past payment practices and the likelihood of such overdue amounts \t\nbeing recovered.  \n\t\nWrite-off policy\n\t\n\u0007Receivables are written off by the Group when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as when the \t\ncounterparty is known to be going bankrupt, or into liquidation or administration.  Receivables will also be written off \nwhen the amount is more than materially past due.\n\t\n(i)\t Provisions\n\t\n\u0007Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it \nis probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a \nreliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\t\n\u0007Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the \nreimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense \nrelating to any provision is presented in the statement of comprehensive income net of any reimbursement. \n\t\n\u0007If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash \nflows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, \nthe risks specific to the liability.\n\t\n(j)\t Share-based payment transactions\n\t\n\u0007The Group provides benefits to employees (including directors) in the form of share-based payment transactions, \nwhereby employees render services in exchange for rights over shares (‘equity-settled transactions’). The fair value of \noptions is determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model or using the trinomial option pricing model.\n\t\n\u0007There is currently one plan in place to provide these benefits, the Employee Incentive Plan  (EIP), which provides \nbenefits to directors and employees.\n\t\n\u0007The cost of these equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at \nwhich they are granted. \n\t\n\u0007In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked \nto the price of the shares of Structural Monitoring Systems Plc (‘market conditions’).\nNotes to the financial statements \n30 June 2022\n32\nSTRUCTURAL MONITORING SYSTEMS PLC – ANNUAL REPORT 2022"

The point in time criteria are met as the following transfers of control exist: (a) The entity has the present \nright to payment for the asset; (b) the customer has the legal right to the asset; (c) the entity has transferred physical \npossession of the asset; (d) the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset; (e) the \ncustomer has accepted the asset.

Pricing is fixed and determinable \npursuant to agreed upon pricing lists that establish stand-alone selling prices. There are no further performance \nobligations associated with these sales.\n\t\n\u0007At times, multiple services or goods are sold to customers, however, contracts detail out separate prices for each \ndifferent good or service purchased.  As each service or good purchased has a standalone selling price in the \nnegotiated contract there is no need to allocate a purchase price across multiple deliverables. In addition, each \ncontract includes payment terms.  \n\t\n\u0007The Group recognises revenue on shipping for stock parts, customized product and customer product.  When the \nGroup provides a service (prototyping) it generally recognizes revenue when the prototype is shipped or as the \nservice is provided if there is no item to be shipped.  The Group recognises revenue when it satisfies its performance \nobligation under the contract (when the Group ships the product which is also when the customer obtains control \nover the product or service).\n\t\nRendering of services\n\t\n\u0007Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised over time as the services are rendered based on a fixed \nprice.\n\t\n(l) Inventories\n\t\n\u0007Raw materials, work in progress and finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a 'first \nin first out' basis.

Right-of use assets are \nsubject to impairment or adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.\n\t\n\u0007The group has elected not to recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with \nterms of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets.

The gains or losses \nrecognised in the statement of comprehensive income arising from the derecognition of intangible assets are \nmeasured as the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the intangible asset. The \nmethod and useful lives of finite life intangible assets are reviewed annually.

Risk management policies and systems are \nreviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company’s and Group’s activities.\nThe Board of Directors oversees how management monitors compliance with the Company’s and Group’s risk management \npolicies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the \nCompany and Group.\nThe Company and the Group's principal financial instruments are cash, receivables, borrowings and payables. The financial \nassets are categorised as loans and receivables measured at amortised cost and the financial liabilities are categorised as \nother financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.\nInterest rate risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument will \nfluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.  Interest rate risk arises from fluctuations in interest bearing financial \nassets and liabilities that the group uses.\nInterest bearing assets comprise cash and cash equivalents which are considered to be short-term liquid assets.  It is \nthe Group's policy to settle trade payables within the credit terms allowed and therefore not incur interest on overdue \nbalances. \nInterest bearing liabilities include a bank overdraft facility secured on trade receivables and inventory and lease finance on \nplant and equipment.\nCash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments\nA change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased / (decreased) equity and profit or \nloss by the amounts shown below.

In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an \nongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant.\nWith respect to credit and cash flow risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash \nequivalents and term deposits, the Group’s exposure to credit and cash flow risk arises from default of the counter party, \nwith a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments. This risk is minimised by reviewing term \ndeposit accounts from time to time with approved banks of a sufficient Fitch Ratings credit rating of at least A-, Moody’s \ncredit rating of at least A2, and Standard & Poor’s credit rating of at least A-. Other than a 1 year term deposit placed as \nsecurity for its working capital facility, the Group does not place funds on terms longer than 30 days and has the facility to \nplace the deposit funds with more than one bank. The Group does not hold collateral as security for any of its’ receivables.\nThe Company has exposure to credit and cashflow risk arising from the making of loans to subsidiaries. The loans carry no \ninterest rate or date for repayment. Loans are impaired to the carrying value of the subsidiary’s assets.\nThe Group and Company undertake the following procedures to determine whether there has been a significant increase \nin the credit risk of its other receivables, including group balances, since their initial recognition.  Where these procedures \nidentify a significant increase in credit risk, the loss allowance is measured based on the risk of a default occurring over the \nexpected life of the instrument rather than considering only the default events expected within 12 months of the year-end.\nThe Group and Company have not determined that credit loss has increased during the year in respect of the Group’s trade \nreceivables.\n61\nSTRUCTURAL MONITORING SYSTEMS PLC – ANNUAL REPORT 2022"

An impairment loss provision has been recognised to the extent \nthe carrying value at 30 June 2022 is covered by the recovery of net assets in the balance sheet of SMS Ltd. This has been \nmeasured based on lifetime expected credit losses on the basis that credit risk has increased since initial recognition. \nIn respect of the balance due from Structural Monitoring Systems Canada Corporation (SMSCC), the Company did not \nhave sufficient liquid resources at 30 June 2022 to repay the loan in full. However, on the basis that there has been no \nsignificant increase in credit risk and the balance is expected to be recovered by the subsidiary’s trading, no impairment loss \nprovision has been recognised on the basis that any impairment loss provision would be immaterial (2021: $nil). This has \nbeen measured based on 12 month expected credit losses.\nCredit risk\nThe measurement of impairment losses depends on whether the financial asset is “performing”, “underperforming” or \n“non-performing” based on the company’s assessment of increases in the credit risk of the financial asset since its initial \nrecognition and any events that have occurred before the year-end which have a detrimental impact on cash flows.\nThe financial asset moves from “performing” to “underperforming” when the increase in credit risk since initial recognition \nbecomes significant.\nIn assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly, the company compares the risk of default at the year-end with \nthe risk of a default when the investment was originally recognised using reasonable and supportable past and forward-\nlooking information that is available without undue cost.\nThe risk of a default occurring takes into consideration default events that are possible within 12 months of the year-end \n(“the 12 month expected credit losses”) for “performing financial assets, and all possible default events over the expected \nlife of those receivables(“the lifetime expected credit losses”) for “underperforming\" financial assets. \nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s \napproach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its \nliabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to \nthe Group’s reputation.\nThe following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities:\nCarrying \namount\nContractual \ncash flows\n1 year or less\nMore than 1 \nyear\n$000’\n$000’\n$000’\n$000’\nConsolidated - 30 June 2022\nTrade and other payables\n(3,677)\n(3,677)\n(3,677)\n-\nBorrowings\n(5,461)\n(5,461)\n(5,461)\n-\nLease liabilities\n(9,850)\n(9,850)\n(1,150)\n(8,700)\n(18,988)\n(18,988)\n(10,288)\n(8,700)\nConsolidated - 30 June 2021\nTrade and other payables\n(1,845)\n(1,845)\n(1,845)\n-\nBorrowings\n(338)\n(338)\n(268)\n(70)\n(2,183)\n(2,183)\n(2,113)\n(70)\n*Although classed as payable within 1 year or less, the debt facility is long standing and is expected to continue beyond \nFY2023.\n63\nSTRUCTURAL MONITORING SYSTEMS PLC – ANNUAL REPORT 2022"

The more removed that laws and regulations \nare from financial transactions, the less likely it is that we would become aware of non-compliance. Auditing standards \nalso limit the audit procedures required to identify non-compliance with laws and regulations to enquiry of the \ndirectors and other management and the inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. \nMaterial misstatements that arise due to fraud can be harder to detect than those that arise from error as they may \ninvolve deliberate concealment or collusion. \nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial \nReporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
