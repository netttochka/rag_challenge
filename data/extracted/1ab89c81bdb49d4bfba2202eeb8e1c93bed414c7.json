      "text": "PART I\nItem 1. Business\nOverview\nWe are a leading private mortgage insurance company serving the United States housing finance market since 1981 with a mission to\nhelp people buy a house and keep it their home. We operate in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Our principal mortgage insurance\ncustomers are originators of residential mortgage loans who typically determine which mortgage insurer or insurers they will use for the\nplacement of mortgage insurance written on loans they originate.\nAs a private mortgage insurer, we play a critical role in the United States housing finance system. We are engaged in the business of\nwriting and assuming residential mortgage guaranty insurance. The insurance covers a portion of the unpaid principal balance of Low Down\nPayment Loans and protects lenders and investors against certain losses resulting from nonpayment of loans secured by mortgages, deeds\nof trust, or other instruments constituting a first lien on residential real estate. We facilitate the sale of mortgages to the secondary market,\nincluding to private investors as well as the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage\nCorporation (“Freddie Mac”). Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sponsored enterprises and are collectively referred to as the\n“GSEs.” Credit protection and liquidity through secondary market sales allow mortgage lenders to increase their lending capacity, manage\nrisk and expand financing access to prospective homeowners, many of whom are first time home buyers (“FTHBs”).\nWe have a large and diverse customer base maintaining enduring relationships across the mortgage origination market, including with\nnational banks, non-bank mortgage lenders, local mortgage bankers, community banks and credit unions. In both 2022 and 2021, we\nprovided new insurance coverage to approximately 1,800 customers. For the full years ended December  31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 we\ngenerated new insurance written (“NIW”) of $66.5 billion, $97.0 billion and $99.9 billion, respectively. Net income was $704 million, $547\nmillion and $370 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Adjusted operating income was $709 million, $551 million and $373 million for\n2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWe have a rigorous approach to writing new insurance risk based on decades of loan-level data and experience in the mortgage\ninsurance industry. We believe our balance sheet is well capitalized to manage through macroeconomic uncertainty and maintain compliance\nwith private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements (“PMIERs”) and state regulatory standards of compliance. We utilize our credit risk\ntransfer (“CRT”) program to mitigate future loss volatility and drive efficient capital management. Our CRT program is a material component\nof our strategy, and we believe it helps to protect future business performance and stockholder capital under stress scenarios by transferring\nrisk from our balance sheet to highly rated counterparties or to investors through collateralized transactions. As of December 31, 2022, we\nhad a published PMIERs sufficiency ratio of 165%, representing $2,050 million of available assets above the published PMIERs requirement\nand approximately 89% of our insured portfolio was covered by our CRT program. Our PMIERs sufficiency ratio, which is based on the\npublished requirements applicable to private mortgage insurers, was above the requirement imposed by the GSE Restrictions of 120% in\n2022.\nOur Corporate Information\nEnact Holdings, Inc. (“EHI,” together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) (formerly known as Genworth Mortgage\nHoldings, Inc.) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Genworth Financial, Inc. (“Genworth” or “Parent”) since EHI’s incorporation in Delaware in\n2012 until our initial public offering on September 20, 2021.\nOn May  3, 2021, EHI amended its certificate of incorporation to change its name from Genworth Mortgage Holdings, Inc. This\namendment also authorized EHI to issue 600,000,000 shares of common stock, each having a par value of $0.01 per share. Concurrently,\nwe entered into a share exchange\n4"

(“Genworth Holdings”), pursuant to which Genworth Holdings exchanged the 100 shares of our\ncommon stock owned by it, representing all of our issued and outstanding capital stock, for 162,840,000 newly issued shares of common\nstock, par value $0.01, of EHI.\nOn September 15, 2021, we priced our initial public offering (“IPO”) of common stock, which resulted in the issuance and sale of\n13,310,400 shares of common stock at the IPO price of $19.00 per common share. All shares were offered by the selling stockholder, our\nparent company, Genworth Holdings. In addition to the shares sold in the IPO, 14,655,600 common shares were sold in a concurrent private\nsale (“Private Sale”) at a price per share of $17.86, which is equal to the IPO price less the underwriting discount share. Genworth Holdings\nalso granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,996,560 common shares (“Over-Allotment Option”) at the\nIPO price less the underwriting discount. On September 16, 2021, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase all 1,996,560 common\nshares permitted under the terms of the underwriting agreement. The IPO, Private Sale, and Over-Allotment Option (collectively the\n“Offering”) closed on September 20, 2021, and Genworth Holdings retained all net proceeds from the Offering.\nWe operate a majority of our business through our primary insurance subsidiary, Enact Mortgage Insurance Corporation (“EMICO”).\nEMICO is an approved insurer by the GSEs. EMICO was renamed from Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corporation effective February 7,\n2022. Our operations are all domestic with the exception of a run-off insurance block with reference properties in Mexico (“run-off business”),\nwhich is immaterial to our results.\nOur Strategy\nOur objective is to support our mission to help people buy a house and keep it their home, while leveraging our competitive strengths to\nmaximize value for our stockholders. This strategy is based on the following priorities:\nDifferentiate Enact from competitors\n•\nStrive to deliver best-in-class underwriting to a well-established, deep and diversified customer base.\n•\nInvest to increase differentiation, drive efficiencies, and enhance decision-making.\n•\nSeek to outpace industry average insurance-in-force growth.\nMaintain strong capital levels and earnings profile\n•\nSeek to maintain a strong capital position supported by robust underwriting standards, comprehensive stress testing, a conservative\nleverage ratio, and a diversified CRT program.\n•\nAim to optimize cost of capital and forward capacity across CRT channels to manage volatility, protect the balance sheet and\nenhance return on equity.\nDeliver attractive risk-adjusted returns\n•\nWrite profitable new business and leverage proprietary risk assessment and pricing tools to target growth and drive increased\nreturns.\n•\nStrive to maximize stockholder value through a disciplined capital allocation policy that supports existing policyholders, grows the\nbusiness, and returns excess capital to stockholders.\n5"

      "text": "Our Industry\nUnited States Mortgage Market\nThe United States residential mortgage market is one of the largest in the world and includes a range of private and government\nsponsored participants. Private industry participants include mortgage banks, mortgage brokers, commercial, regional and investment banks,\nsavings institutions, credit unions, real estate investment trusts, mortgage insurers and the GSEs. The overall United States residential\nmortgage market encompasses both primary and secondary markets. The primary market consists of lenders originating home loans to\nborrowers to support home purchases, which are referred to as purchase originations, and loans made to refinance existing mortgages,\nwhich are referred to as refinancing originations. The secondary market includes institutions buying and selling mortgages in the form of\nwhole loans or securitized assets, such as mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”).\nGSEs\nThe GSEs are the largest participants in the secondary mortgage market, buying residential mortgages from banks and other primary\nlenders as part of their government mandate to provide liquidity and stability in the United States housing finance system. According to the\ncompanies’ earnings reports, the GSEs held or guaranteed approximately $6.7 trillion as of September 30, 2022, or around 51%, of total\nUnited States 1-4 family residential mortgage debt according to most recent data from the Federal Reserve. The GSE charters generally\nrequire credit enhancement for Low Down Payment Loans to be eligible for purchase by the GSEs. Such credit enhancement can be\nsatisfied if a loan is insured by a GSE-qualified insurer, the mortgage seller retains at least a 10% participation in the loan, or the seller\nagrees to repurchase or replace the loan in the event of a default. Private mortgage insurance satisfies the GSEs’ credit enhancement\nrequirement and, historically, has been the preferred method lenders have utilized to meet this GSE charter requirement. As a result, the\nnature of the private mortgage insurance industry in the United States is driven in large part by the business practices and mortgage\ninsurance requirements of the GSEs. In furtherance of their respective charter requirements, each GSE maintains private mortgage insurer\neligibility criteria, known as PMIERs, to establish when a mortgage insurer is qualified to issue coverage that will be acceptable to the GSEs\nfor their portfolio. For more information about the financial and other requirements of the GSEs, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating\nto Our Business—If we are unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs, the GSE Restrictions and any additional\nrestrictions imposed on us by the GSEs, we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.”\nPrivate Mortgage Insurance\nPrivate mortgage insurance plays a critical role in the United States residential mortgage market by facilitating secondary market sales,\nparticularly for Low Down Payment Loans. This credit protection and the resulting liquidity it provides through secondary market sales allows\nmortgage lenders to increase their lending capacity, manage risk and expand prospective homeowners’ access to financing, many of whom\nare FTHBs. Mortgage insurance also provides lenders and investors a means to diversify their exposures, mitigate mortgage credit risk and\nmay offer credit against regulatory capital requirements to certain financial institutions that portfolio Low Down Payment Loans. Today,\nmortgage insurance products are primarily geared towards GSE secondary market sales. The increase in penetration of private mortgage\ninsurance in the mortgage market can be attributed to both the introduction of new GSE products designed to serve Low Down Payment\nLoan borrowers and more competitive pricing by private mortgage insurers relative to the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”). In\naddition, there are potential opportunities for the demand for and use of mortgage insurance to the extent that the private label securitization\nmarket expands in the future.\nThe overall new business opportunity in the private mortgage insurance market is also reflective of the mix between purchase and\nrefinancing originations. Historically, due to the higher prevalence of Low-\n6"

      "text": "Down Payment Loans in purchase originations, mortgage insurance utilization has been meaningfully higher for purchase originations than\nfor refinances.\nCompetition\nOur principal sources of competition are government (federal, state and local) agencies, such as the FHA and the United States\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) and other private mortgage insurers. We also compete with mortgage lenders and other investors, the\nGSEs, portfolio lenders who self-insure, reinsurers and other capital markets participants who may utilize financial instruments designed to\nmitigate risk.\nFederal, State and Local Government Agencies\nPrivate mortgage insurers, including us, compete for mortgage insurance business directly with federal government agencies, principally\nthe FHA and the VA, and, to a lesser extent, state and local housing finance agencies. According to Inside Mortgage Finance, for the first\nthree quarters of 2022, the FHA had a 26% share, and the VA a 25% share, of the mortgage insurance market. Our competition with\ngovernment agencies is principally on the basis of price and underwriting guidelines. In contrast to private mortgage insurers, government\nagencies generally have less restrictive guidelines and apply a flat pricing structure regardless of an individual borrower’s credit profile. As a\nresult, we believe borrowers with lower Fair Isaac Company (“FICO”) scores are more likely to secure mortgage loans with coverage by\npublic agencies and borrowers with higher FICO scores are more likely to secure mortgage loans with coverage by private mortgage\ninsurers. Mortgage insurance policies from government agencies are also generally non-cancellable, meaning that borrowers are obligated to\npay for coverage through the life of their loan, whereas policies from private mortgage insurers are cancellable in certain circumstances as\nprovided by the Homeowners Protection Act (“HOPA”), and under GSE guidelines when the loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio of an underlying\nmortgage falls below 80%. Private mortgage insurers also face limited competition from certain local and state housing finance agencies.\nPrivate Mortgage Insurers\nThe United States private mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive. We compete on pricing, underwriting guidelines, customer\nrelationships, service levels, policy terms, loss mitigation practices, perceived financial strength (including comparative credit ratings),\nreputation, strength of management, product features and effective use and ease of technology. There are currently six active mortgage\ninsurers, including us. Private mortgage insurance competitors include Arch Capital Group Ltd., Essent Group Ltd., MGIC Investment\nCorporation, NMI Holdings, Inc. and Radian Group Inc. (public holding companies of competitors listed). Since 2012, we have maintained\nbetween a 12.0% and 19.2% per quarter share of the private mortgage insurance market by per annum NIW, based on data from Inside\nMortgage Finance.\nGSEs, Portfolio Lenders, Reinsurers and Other Capital Markets Participants\nWe have also experienced competition in recent years from various participants in the mortgage finance industry including the GSEs,\nportfolio lenders, reinsurers and other participants in the capital markets. We compete with these participants primarily based on pricing,\npolicy terms and perceived financial strength. The GSEs enter into risk sharing transactions with financial institutions designed to reduce the\nrisk of their mortgage portfolios. Competition also comes from portfolio lenders that are willing to hold credit risk on their balance sheets\nwithout credit enhancement. In addition, investors can make use of risk-sharing structures designed to mitigate the impact of mortgage\ndefaults in place of private mortgage insurance. Finally, although their presence is a fraction of what it was in the past, there are products\ndesigned to eliminate the need for private mortgage insurance, such as “simultaneous seconds,” which combine a first lien loan with a\nsecond lien loan in order to meet the 80% LTV threshold required for sale to the GSEs without certain credit protections.\n7"

      "text": "Our Products and Services\nIn general, there are two types of private mortgage insurance: primary and pool.\nPrimary Mortgage Insurance\nSubstantially all of our policies are primary mortgage insurance, which provides protection on individual loans at specified coverage\npercentages. Primary mortgage insurance is placed on individual loans at the time of origination and are typically delivered to us on a loan-\nby-loan basis. Primary mortgage insurance can also be delivered to us on an aggregated basis, whereby each mortgage in a given loan\nportfolio is insured in a single transaction after the point of origination.\nCustomers who purchase our primary mortgage insurance select a specific coverage level for each insured loan. To be eligible for\npurchase by a GSE, a Low Down Payment Loan must comply with the coverage percentages established by that particular GSE. For loans\nnot sold to the GSEs, the customer determines its desired coverage percentage. Generally, our risk across all policies written is\napproximately 25% of the underlying primary insurance in-force (“IIF”), but may vary from policy to policy, typically between 6% and 35%\ncoverage.\nWe file our premium rates, as required, with insurance departments of U.S. States and the District of Columbia. Premium rates cannot be\nchanged after the issuance of coverage. Premium payments for primary mortgage insurance coverage are typically made by the borrower\nand are referred to as borrower-paid mortgage insurance. Loans for which premiums are paid by the lender are referred to as lender-paid\nmortgage insurance. In either case, the payment of premium to us is generally the responsibility of the insured.\nPremiums are generally calculated as a percentage of the original principal balance and may be paid as follows:\n•\nMonthly, where premiums are paid on a monthly basis over the life of the policy;\n•\nSingle, where the entire premium is paid upfront at the time the mortgage loan is originated;\n•\nAnnually, where premiums are paid annually in advance for the subsequent 12 months; or\n•\nSplit, where an initial lump sum premium is paid upfront at the time the mortgage is originated along with subsequent monthly\npayments.\nIn general, we may not terminate mortgage insurance coverage except in the event of non-payment of premiums or certain material\nviolations of our mortgage insurance policies. The insured may cancel mortgage insurance coverage at any time at their option or upon\nmortgage repayment, which is accelerated in the event of a refinancing. However, in the case of loans sold to the GSEs, lender cancellation\nof a policy not eligible for cancellation under GSE guidelines may be in violation of the GSEs’ respective charters. GSE guidelines generally\nprovide that a borrower meeting certain conditions may require the mortgage servicer to cancel mortgage insurance coverage upon the\nborrower’s request when the principal balance of the loan is 80% or less of the property’s current value. In addition to the GSE guidelines,\nHOPA provides an obligation for lenders to automatically terminate a borrower’s obligation to pay for mortgage insurance coverage once the\nLTV ratio reaches 78% of the original value, and also provides that a borrower may request cancellation of their obligation to pay for\nmortgage insurance when the LTV ratio, based on the current value of the property, reaches 80%. In addition, some states impose their own\nmortgage insurance notice and cancellation requirements on mortgage loan servicers.\nPool Mortgage Insurance\nPool mortgage insurance transactions provide coverage on a finite set of individual loans identified by the pool policy. Pool policies\ncontain coverage percentages and provisions limiting the insurer’s obligation to pay claims until a threshold amount is reached (known as a\n“deductible”) or capping the insurer’s\n8"

      "text": "potential aggregate liability for claims payments (known as a “stop loss”) or a combination of both provisions. Pool mortgage insurance is\ntypically used to provide additional credit enhancement for certain secondary market mortgage transactions. Pool insurance generally covers\nthe excess of the loss on a defaulted mortgage loan that exceeds the claim payment under the primary coverage, if such loan has primary\ncoverage, as well as the total loss on a defaulted mortgage loan that did not have primary coverage. In another variation, generally referred\nto as modified pool insurance, policies are structured to include both an exposure limit for each individual loan, as well as an aggregate loss\nlimit or a deductible for the entire pool. Currently, we have an insignificant amount of pool IIF.\nContract Underwriting Services\nWe also perform fee-based contract underwriting services for our customers. Contract underwriting provides our customers outsourced\nscalable capacity to underwrite mortgage loans. Our underwriters can underwrite the loan on behalf of our customers for both investor\ncompliance and mortgage insurance, thus reducing duplicative activities and increasing our ability to write mortgage insurance for these\nloans. Under the terms of our contract underwriting agreements, we indemnify our customer against losses incurred in the event we make\nmaterial errors in determining whether loans underwritten by our contract underwriters meet specified underwriting or purchase criteria,\nsubject to contractual limitations on liability.\nOur Mortgage Insurance Portfolio\nWe believe that our portfolio is of significant scale and aligns with our appetite for risk and return. The majority of our in-force exposures\nand all of our NIW is considered primary insurance, meaning we insure the loss on each loan up to the coverage amount without any stop\nloss or deductible for that loss. Our remaining pool exposures are significantly seasoned and represent less than 0.2% of total risk in-force\n(“RIF”).\nOur primary insurance portfolio is diversified through time. The distribution of our exposure by book year is influenced by market size\nopportunities, our commercial strategies and the persistency of our in-force policies. In 2021 and 2020, our portfolio was impacted by low\npersistency, a large origination market and commercial success in the market, leading to a concentration in recent years as the 2022, 2021\nand 2020 book years represent 25%, 33% and 22%, respectively, of our primary IIF. Our primary exposures from legacy books originated\nprior to 2009 continue to resolve in an orderly fashion and represented 3% of both our primary IIF and primary RIF as of December 31, 2022.\nThese books continue to represent a larger portion of our delinquencies and reserves driven by the continued aging of those delinquencies.\nWe measure the credit characteristics of our portfolio as represented in the original commitment for insurance. We support a growing\nFTHB segment that generally has little down payment saved for their first home and therefore higher LTV ratios. Generally, a higher LTV ratio\nhas a higher likelihood of claim than a lower LTV loan, absent other mitigating loan characteristics, which we consider in our underwriting and\npricing. The weighted average LTV of our IIF as of December 31, 2022 was 93% and the weighted average LTV of our NIW was 92% in 2022\nand 2021.\nThe credit profile of our portfolio as represented by FICO score remains strong. Generally, a borrower with a higher FICO score has a\nlower likelihood of claim than one with a lower FICO score. The weighted average FICO score of our IIF as of December 31, 2022 was 743\nand the weighted average FICO score of our NIW was 748 in 2022 and 746 in 2021.\nOur portfolio is diverse and representative of the United States origination market. We actively monitor our portfolio for concentrations at\nthe state, metropolitan statistical area and metropolitan division level in addition to economic and performance trends in these markets. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, our largest state concentration was in California, which represented 12% of primary RIF. Our largest MSA/MD is the\nChicago-Naperville, IL Metropolitan Division, which represents 3% of primary RIF.\n9"

Our sales force strives to build strong\nrelationships across all areas of our customers’ operations to include loan origination, loan processing, underwriting, product development,\nsecondary marketing, risk management, compliance, information technology and C-suite executives. With a vast database of established\nindividual contacts, the breadth and depth of relationships not only serves as a differentiator for our mortgage insurance platform but also\nenables us to form strategic partnerships with other mortgage service providers seeking to expand their distribution reach.\nWe support our sales force and improve their effectiveness in acquiring new customers by raising our brand awareness through\nadvertising and marketing campaigns, website enhancements, digital communication strategies and sponsorship of industry and educational\nevents. Our digital marketing capabilities position us to serve our decentralized market with targeted, personalized messages that help drive\na preference for our offering. Additionally, our marketing efforts include differentiators targeted to the needs of customers, in order to increase\nour brand affinity. Finally, our consulting services provide customers with strategy and process consulting to help improve quality, reduce\ncosts and grow their business.\nIn 2019, we launched a separate mortgage insurance policy underwritten by our wholly owned subsidiary, Enact Mortgage Insurance\nCorporation of North Carolina (“EMIC-NC”), to insure primary individually underwritten residential mortgage loans as well as portfolios of\nresidential mortgage loans at or after origination that are not intended for sale to the GSEs. Given that EMIC-NC is not a GSE approved\ninsurer, it is not subject to the requirements mandated by PMIERs. Accordingly, we are able to utilize EMIC-NC in a manner that provides us\nwith greater flexibility with our master policies and in our ability to efficiently use the capital of our subsidiaries, each with customers who\nretain loans in their own portfolio. We also believe utilizing EMIC-NC in this manner provides us strategic optionality if the private label MBS\nmarket increases.\nTechnology that supports connectivity with our customers is critical. As an established private mortgage insurance provider, we have\nlong-standing relationships with our customers’ technology organizations, as well as with the key pricing and loan origination/servicing\nplatform providers. In addition, we have an experienced technology integration team that allows us to quickly customize loan delivery\nsolutions for our customers.

The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for oversight and\nreview of our enterprise risk management policies and related risk profile. We believe our risk management framework is appropriately\ndesigned to manage volatility in our business performance and protect our balance sheet. We believe this framework encompasses all major\nrisks to which we are exposed, including credit risk, market risk, insurance risk, housing risk, operational risk, model risk, IT risk and any\nother risk that poses a material threat to the viability of the Company.\nOur risk management philosophy is designed to ensure all relevant risks are routinely identified, assessed, managed, monitored and\naddressed. We rely upon a strong organizational risk culture and governance process, ensuring that the risks we take are transparent and\nquantifiable, and that we can monitor the changing nature of those risks over time. We proactively work towards mitigating exposures outside\nof the risk appetite, limits and tolerances that we set and review annually. Our risk profile, top risks and any emerging risks are regularly\nreviewed in our senior management risk committee, chaired by our Chief Risk Officer who has direct reporting obligations to the Risk\nCommittee of our Board.\nWe believe our risk management and oversight structure is appropriate for our business, but we cannot be assured that it will be\nadequate in mitigating all our risks. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Our risk management programs may not\nbe effective in identifying or adequate in controlling or mitigating the risks we face.”\nModeling and Analytics\nWe use our proprietary risk modeling platform to evaluate returns and volatility through both an external regulatory lens and an economic\ncapital framework that is sensitive to the economic cycle and current housing market conditions. This risk model utilizes numerous predictive\nvariables and leverages our unique data set, which contains experience of over two decades of mortgage performance across all market\nconditions, to develop quantitative assessments of default probability, severity of loss, prepayment and expected volatility on each insured\nloan. Our model is used to assess the performance of new business and our in-force portfolio under expected and stress scenarios. The\nresults of these analyses inform our risk appetite, credit policy, pricing and targeted risk selection strategies. In addition, the results of these\nstress tests and our desire to reduce loss volatility inform our CRT strategy.\nCustomer Qualification\nCustomers applying for a new master policy undergo a process that reviews their business and financial profile, licensing, management\nexperience and track record of originating quality mortgages. Customers applying for delegated underwriting authority receive training and\nare reviewed on initial and ongoing submissions for compliance to our guidelines.\nPolicy Acquisition\nLoans delivered to us for insurance must meet our underwriting and eligibility guidelines. Our underwriting principles require borrowers to\nhave a verified capacity and willingness to support the obligation and a well-supported valuation of the collateral. Loans are underwritten on\neither a delegated or non-delegated basis, but all loans pass through our eligibility rules engine to screen out those outside of our guidelines.\nWe regularly monitor national and local market conditions, the performance of our products and the performance of our customers against\nour expectations for mix and profitability. We adjust our underwriting, pricing and risk selection strategies on a regular basis to ensure that\nour products remain competitive and consistent with our risk and profitability objectives.\n11"

We review statistically\nsignificant samples of loan files from individual customers and across our delegated and non-delegated underwriting channels to identify\nadverse trends and provide our underwriters and customers with timely feedback and training that fosters high quality loan production. Within\nour delegated channel, the frequency of our lender specific reviews is directly related to an account’s activity, that is larger accounts will\nreceive more frequent reviews. The results of these reviews also allow for adjustments to underwriting processes and credit policy. Finally,\nour quality assurance team conducts independent reviews on key operational processes and critically important vendor activities.\nPortfolio Management\nWe regularly monitor the characteristics and performance of our overall mortgage insurance portfolio. We monitor concentrations across\na range of metrics including lender, geography and policy year. Through stress testing, we evaluate the performance of the portfolio and\nidentify risks to our strategic plan caused by its makeup in adverse economic scenarios. We also monitor performance against expected loss\ndevelopment from time of origination. Variations identified by product, performance, geography or otherwise inform adjustments to our\nguidelines and pricing strategies.\nBusiness Continuity\nWe have a robust business continuity program to prepare for and manage through business interruptions. Maintenance and execution of\nour plan is led by a crisis management leader reporting to our Chief Risk Officer. We update our plan no less than annually to accommodate\nchanges in business processes and third-party providers and test the plan regularly through tabletop exercises. While we instituted a hybrid\nreturn to office staffing model in March 2022, we previously implemented a business continuity plan in response to COVID-19 and operated\nsuccessfully with a remote workforce from March 2020 through March 2022. We have used a decentralized team of underwriters and other\nkey functional employees for many years and all employees are capable and equipped to work remotely so that we can continue providing\nservice to our customers through prolonged absences from the office.\nUnderwriting\nWe establish and maintain underwriting guidelines based on our risk appetite. Our guidelines require borrowers to have a verified\ncapacity and willingness to support their obligation and a well-supported valuation of the collateral. Our underwriting guidelines incorporate\ncredit eligibility requirements that, among other things, limit our coverage to mortgages that meet our thresholds with respect to borrower\nFICO scores, maximum LTVs, documentation requirements and maximum Debt-to-Income (“DTI”) Ratio. All loans must pass through our\neligibility rules engine to screen out those outside of our guidelines.\nAt present, our underwriting guidelines are largely consistent with those of the GSEs. Many of our customers use the GSEs’ automated\nloan underwriting systems, Desktop Underwriter and Loan Product Advisor, for making credit determinations. We generally accept the\nunderwriting decisions and documentation requirements made by the GSEs’ underwriting systems, subject to our review as well as certain\nlimitations and requirements.\nOver the past few years, more customers have requested expedited underwriting services. To meet customer demand, we invested in\ntechnologies, automation, data science and analytics to develop our proprietary mortgage insurance underwriting system. Our mortgage\ninsurance underwriting system enables the capability to meet customer demand in a timely manner without sacrificing the accuracy of our\nunderwriting decisions. Specifically, it has contributed to a substantial increase in our underwriters’ productivity, more than doubling the\nnumber of loans our underwriters have processed on a daily basis since 2015, while remaining within our quality control tolerances. We\nbelieve our mortgage insurance underwriting system also differentiates us from the competition by allowing us to efficiently provide\n12"

We use our mortgage insurance underwriting system to perform our non-delegated underwriting evaluations. Our\nunderwriting staff is dispersed throughout the United States and we believe this allows us to make prompt, geographically based underwriting\ndeterminations across different time zones in a timely manner to best serve our diverse customer base. In addition to our employees, we use\ndomestically based, contract underwriters, as needed, to assist with underwriting capacity and drive efficiency.\nDelegated Underwriting\nWe delegate to eligible lender customers the ability to underwrite mortgage insurance based on our delegated underwriting guidelines.\nTo perform delegated underwriting, customers must be approved by our risk management team. Some customers prefer to assume\nunderwriting responsibility because it is more efficient within their loan origination process, and they are comfortable attesting that the data\nsubmitted is true and correct when making our insurance decision. We regularly perform quality assurance reviews on a statistically\nsignificant sample of delegated loans to assess compliance with our guidelines.\nWe also offer a post-closing underwriting review when requested by customers for both non-delegated and delegated loans. Upon\nsatisfactory completion of this review, we agree to waive our right to rescind coverage under certain circumstances. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 71% and 65%, respectively, of our NIW by loan count went through our delegated underwriting\nservices.\nPricing\nPricing is highly competitive in the mortgage insurance industry, with industry participants competing for market share, customer\nrelationships and overall value. Recent pricing trends have introduced an increasing number of loan, borrower, lender and property attributes,\nresulting in expanded granularity in pricing regimes and a shift from traditional published rate cards to dynamic pricing engines that better\nalign price and risk. Our risk-based pricing engine was developed to evaluate returns and volatility under both the PMIERs capital framework\nand our internal economic capital framework, which is sensitive to economic cycles and current housing market conditions. The model\nassesses the performance of new business under expected and stress scenarios on an individualized loan basis, which is used to determine\npricing and inform our risk selection strategy that optimizes economic value by balancing return and volatility.\nOur policy has been to set and charge premium rates commensurate with the underlying risk of each loan we insure. Our proprietary\npricing platform, however, provides us with a more flexible, granular and analytical approach to selecting and pricing risk. Using our platform,\nwe can quickly change price to modify our risk selection levels in response to changing economic conditions, new analytical insights or\nindustry pricing trends.\nCredit Risk Transfer\nOur risk management framework and analytics inform our CRT strategy, which is designed to reduce the loss volatility of our in-force\nportfolio during stress scenarios by transferring risk from our balance sheet to highly rated counterparties or to investors through\ncollateralized transactions. Our CRT program also provides capital relief under PMIERs and state insurance capital requirements. In normal\nmarket\n13"

Given the volatility protection and capital relief at attractive terms,\nCRT enables us to employ an “acquire, manage and distribute” strategy. We believe our CRT program is a material component of our\nstrategy and helps to protect future business performance and stockholder capital under stress scenarios.\nOur CRT program distributes risk to both highly rated counterparties through our traditional reinsurance program, as well as to insurance-\nlinked note (“ILN”) investors via fully collateralized special purpose reinsurance vehicles. Our reinsurance transactions generally cover a\nsubset of loans in a given book year and have been structured as excess of loss (“XOL”) coverage where typically both the attachment and\ndetachment points of the ceded risk tier are within the PMIERs capital requirements at inception, providing both loss volatility protection and\nPMIERs capital credit. Each reinsurance treaty has a term of ten years or more and provides a unilateral right to commute prior to the full\nterm, subject to certain performance triggers. We select the type and structure of our CRT transactions based on a variety of factors\nincluding, but not limited to, capacity, cost, flexibility, sustainability and diversification. Since 2015, we have executed $4.6 billion of CRT\ntransactions across both traditional reinsurance arrangements and ILN transactions through December 31, 2022, with approximately 89% of\nour RIF insurance covered under our current CRT program. We expect to begin transferring losses at an approximate 30 to 35% lifetime\nbook year loss ratio and extend up to an approximate 60 to 70% lifetime book year loss ratio at current pricing assumptions and depending\non our co-participation level within the reinsurance tier.\nThrough our traditional reinsurance transactions, we have executed $2.8 billion of XOL reinsurance coverage with highly rated reinsurers\ncovering the 2009 to 2022 book years.\nThe Company’s traditional reinsurance coverage is provided by a panel of reinsurance partners each currently rated “A-” or better by\nStandard & Poor’s (“S&P”) or A.M. Best Company, Inc. These reinsurers are contractually required to collateralize a portion (typically 20 to\n30%) of the reinsurance exposures consistent with PMIERs.\nThrough our ILN transactions, we have executed $1.8 billion of XOL reinsurance coverage supported by capital markets investors via\nfully collateralized special purpose reinsurance vehicles covering a portion of the 2014 to 2021 book years. The notes are non-recourse to us\nand our affiliates.\nOur CRT program provided an estimated aggregate of $1.6 billion of PMIERs capital credit and $1.8 billion of loss coverage as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\nDelinquencies, Loss Management and Claims\nThe delinquency and claim cycle generally begins with our receipt of a delinquency notice on an insured loan from the related servicer.\nWe consider a loan to be delinquent when it is two or more mortgage payments past due. The incidence of delinquency is affected by a\nvariety of factors, including housing price appreciation or depreciation, unemployment, the level of borrower income, divorce, illness, interest\nrate levels, general borrower creditworthiness and macroeconomic conditions. See “1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—A\ndeterioration in economic conditions, a severe recession or a decline in home prices, all of which could be driven by many potential factors,\nincluding inflation, may adversely affect our loss experience.” Delinquencies that are not cured result in a claim.\nOur loss mitigation and claims area is led by seasoned personnel who are supported by default tracking and claims processing\ncapabilities within our integrated platform. Our loss mitigation staff is also actively engaged with the GSEs and servicers regarding\nappropriate servicing and loss mitigation practices. We have granted loss mitigation delegation to the GSEs and servicers, whereby they\nperform certain loss mitigation efforts on our behalf. Moreover, the CFPB servicing rule obligates servicers to engage in early intervention\nand loss mitigation efforts with a borrower prior to foreclosure. These efforts have traditionally involved loan modifications intended to enable\nqualified borrowers to make restructured loan payments or efforts to sell the property, thereby potentially reducing claim amounts. With the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced unprecedented use of forbearance plans nationwide to assist\n14"

Historically, the use of forbearance plans was limited to 12 months\nand used for a natural disaster that impacted a region of the country. At the conclusion of the forbearance term, a borrower may either bring\nthe borrower’s loan current, defer any missed payments until the end of their loan, or the loan can be modified through a repayment plan or\nextension of the mortgage term.\nOur goal is to keep borrowers in their homes. If a loan becomes delinquent, we work closely with customers, investors and servicers to\nattempt to cure the delinquency and allow the homeowner to retain ownership of their property.\nClaims result from delinquencies that are not cured, or from losses on short sales, other third-party sales or deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure\nthat we approve. Various factors affect the frequency and severity of claims, including LTV at the time of foreclosure, size and coverage\npercentage of a loan, property values, employment levels and interest rates. Any delays in foreclosure, including foreclosure moratoriums\nimposed by state and local governments and the GSEs, such as those due to COVID-19, could cause our losses to increase as expenses\naccrue for longer periods or if the value of foreclosed homes further decline during such foreclosure delays. For loans insured on or after\nOctober 1, 2014, our mortgage insurance policies limit the number of months of unpaid interest and associated expenses that are included in\nthe mortgage insurance claim amount to a maximum of 36 months.\nUnder the terms of our primary insurance master policy, customers are required to file claims within 60 days of the earliest of (i) the date\nthey have acquired title to the underlying property (typically through foreclosure), (ii) the date of an approved short sale or other third-party\nsale of the underlying property or (iii) the date a request is made by us to file a claim.\nUpon review and determination that a filed claim is valid, we generally have the following three settlement options:\n•\nPercentage option—determined by multiplying the claim amount by the applicable coverage percentage, with the customer retaining\ntitle to the property. The claim amount generally consists of the unpaid loan principal as of the date of default, plus delinquent interest\nand certain expenses associated with the default;\n•\nThird-party sale option—pay the amount of the claim required to make the customer whole, commonly referred to as the “actual loss\namount,” following an approved sale; or\n•\nAcquisition option—pay the full claim amount and acquire title to the property.\nIn 2022 and 2021, we settled over half of our claims through the third-party sale or acquisition options due largely to embedded home\nprice appreciation.\nClaim activity is not evenly spread across the coverage period of loans we insure. The number of delinquencies may not correlate\ndirectly with the number of claims received because the rate at which delinquencies are cured is influenced by borrowers’ financial resources\nand circumstances, as well as regional economic differences. For those loans that fail to cure, whether delinquency leads to a claim\nprincipally depends upon the borrower’s equity at the time of delinquency and the borrower’s or the insured’s ability to sell the home for an\namount sufficient to satisfy all amounts due under the mortgage loan.\nWhen claim notices are received, we review loan and servicing files to determine the appropriateness of a claim amount. Failure to\ndeliver required documentation or our review of such documentation may result in rescission, cancellation or claims denial. Our insurance\npolicies provide that we can reduce or deny claims if the servicer does not materially comply with its obligations under our policies, including\nthe requirement to pursue reasonable loss mitigation actions. We also periodically receive claim notices that request coverage for costs and\nexpenses associated with items not covered under our policies, such as losses resulting from property damage to a covered home.

Our ability to rescind coverage is limited by the terms of our master policies. We may\nrescind coverage in situations where, among other things, (i) fraudulent misrepresentations were made or materially inaccurate information\nwas provided regarding a borrower’s income, debts, intention to occupy a property or property value or (ii) a loan was originated in material\nviolation of our underwriting guidelines.\nWe will consider an insured’s appeal of our decision and, if we agree with the appeal, we take the necessary steps to reinstate our\ninsurance coverage and reactivate the loan certificate or otherwise address the issues raised in the appeal. If the parties are unable to agree\non the outcome of the appeal, the insured may choose to pursue arbitration or litigation under the terms of the applicable master policy and\nchallenge the results. Subject to applicable limitations in our policies and State law, legal challenges to our actions may be brought several\nyears after we dispose of a claim.\nFrom time to time, we enter into agreements with policyholders to accelerate claims and negotiate an agreed-upon payment amount for\nclaims on an identified group of delinquent loans. In exchange for our accelerated claim payment, mortgage insurance is canceled, and we\nare discharged from any further liability on the identified loans.\nInformation Technology\nWe develop and invest in technology in order to drive operational excellence, ensure a superior customer experience and support our\noverall business objectives. Our business heavily relies upon information technology and a number of critical aspects are highly automated.\nWe accept insurance applications, issue approvals, process claims and reconcile premium remittance through electronic submission.

Our insurance products and business also are affected by federal, state and local laws, including tax laws.\nThe primary purpose of the state insurance laws and regulations regulating our insurance business is to protect our insureds, not our\nstockholders. These laws and regulations are regularly re-examined by state regulators and any changes to these laws or new laws may be\nmore restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nInsurance and other regulatory authorities (including state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general) may make inquiries\nregarding compliance with insurance, securities and other laws and regulations, and we cooperate with such inquiries and take corrective\naction when warranted.\n19"

      "text": "United States Insurance Regulation\nOur insurance subsidiaries are licensed and regulated in all jurisdictions in which they conduct insurance business. The extent of this\nregulation varies, but state insurance laws and regulations generally grant both broad and specific regulatory powers to agencies or officials\nto examine the affairs of our insurance subsidiaries and to enforce statutes and administrative rules or exercise discretion affecting almost\nevery aspect of their businesses. For example, state insurance laws and regulations typically govern the financial condition of insurers,\nincluding standards for solvency, types and concentrations of permissible investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, credit for\nreinsurance, requirements for capital adequacy, and the business conduct of insurers, including marketing, sales practices and claims\nhandling. State insurance laws and regulations also usually require the licensing of insurers and agents, and the approval of policy forms and\nrates. In addition, states may require actuarial justification of rates on the basis of the insurer’s loss experience, expenses and future\nprojections.\nMortgage guaranty insurance premium rates and policy forms are subject to regulation in every jurisdiction in which our insurance\nsubsidiaries are licensed to transact business in order to protect policyholders against the adverse effects of excessive, inadequate or\nunfairly discriminatory rates. In most jurisdictions, premium rates and policy forms must be filed prior to their use. In some states, such rates\nand forms must also be approved prior to use. Changes in premium rates are often subject to justification, generally on the basis of loss\nexperience, expenses and future trend analysis. In addition, jurisdictions may consider general default experience in the mortgage insurance\nindustry in assessing the premium rates charged by mortgage guaranty insurers. The state insurance laws and regulations of general\napplicability, along with certain additional state insurance laws and regulations that are applicable specifically to mortgage guaranty insurers,\nare described below.\nInsurance Holding Company Regulation\nCertain of our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the Insurance Holding Company Act in North Carolina and are required to furnish\nvarious types of information concerning the operations of, and the interrelationships and transactions among, companies within our holding\ncompany system that may affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within such holding company system.\nUnder state insurance laws and regulations, our insurance subsidiaries must file reports, including detailed annual and quarterly financial\nstatements, with the insurance regulator in North Carolina and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”), and our\noperations and accounts are subject to periodic or target examination by any insurance regulator of a jurisdiction in which we conduct\nbusiness. Mortgage guaranty insurers generally are limited by state insurance laws and regulations to directly writing only mortgage guaranty\ninsurance business to the exclusion of other types of insurance.\nState insurance laws and regulations also regulate transactions between insurers and their affiliates, sometimes mandating prior notice\nto the regulator and/or regulatory approval. Generally, state insurance laws and regulations require that all transactions between an insurer\nand an affiliate be fair and reasonable, and that the insurer’s statutory surplus following such transaction be reasonable in relation to its\noutstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. Certain transactions may not be entered into unless the applicable regulator is\ngiven 30 days’ prior notification and does not disapprove the transaction during such 30-day period.\nState insurance laws and regulations also require that an insurance holding company system’s ultimate controlling person submit\nannually to its lead state insurance regulator an “enterprise risk report” that identifies activities, circumstances or events involving one or\nmore affiliates of an insurer that, if not remedied properly, are likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity\nof the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. Finally, most jurisdictions have adopted insurance laws or regulations\nsetting forth detailed requirements for cost sharing and management agreements between an insurer and its affiliates.\n20"

      "text": "State insurance laws and regulations require that a person obtain the approval of the insurance commissioner of an insurer’s domiciliary\njurisdiction prior to acquiring control of such insurer. Control of an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly,\nowns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing, 10% or more of the voting securities of the insurer or any parent\nentity; although such presumption may be rebutted. In considering an application to acquire control of an insurer, the insurance commissioner\ngenerally considers factors such as the experience, competence and financial strength of the applicant, the integrity of the applicant’s board\nof directors and executive officers, the acquirer’s plans for the management and operation of the insurer, and any anti-competitive results that\nmay arise from the acquisition. Most jurisdictions also now require a person seeking to acquire control of an insurer licensed but not\ndomiciled in that jurisdiction to make a filing prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and its affiliates and the target insurer and its\naffiliates have specified market shares in the same lines of insurance in that jurisdiction. These provisions may not require acquisition\napproval but can lead to imposition of conditions on an acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation. In certain situations, state\ninsurance laws and regulations also require that a controlling person of an insurer submit prior notice to the insurer’s domiciliary insurance\nregulator of a divestiture of control. Similarly, with respect to our contract underwriting entity, Enact Financial Services, Inc., prior approval\nfrom state banking commissioners is required in some jurisdictions prior to acquiring control of our contract underwriting entity, which is\nlicensed or has an approved license exemption in most states.\nOur insurance subsidiaries’ payment of dividends or other distributions to our holding company is regulated by the state insurance laws\nand regulations of their respective domiciliary states. Our insurance subsidiaries must deliver notice to the Commissioner of any dividend or\ndistribution within 5 business days after declaration of the dividend or distribution, and at least 30 days before payment thereof. Any\ndistribution, regardless of amount, requires that same 30-day notice to the Commissioner, but also requires the Commissioner’s affirmative\napproval before being paid.\nUnder the insurance laws of the State of North Carolina, an “extraordinary” dividend or distribution is defined as a dividend or distribution\nthat, together with other dividends and distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of: (i) 10% of the insurer’s\nstatutory surplus as of the immediately prior year end; or (ii) the statutory net income (loss) during the prior calendar year.\nIn addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends and distributions or other payments by our insurers\n(such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement, for employment or other services) if they determine that such payment could be adverse\nto our policyholders or would not be fair and reasonable to the insurer.\nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners\nThe NAIC is an organization, the mandate of which is to benefit state insurance regulatory authorities and consumers by promulgating\nmodel insurance laws and regulations for adoption by the states. The NAIC also provides standardized insurance industry accounting and\nreporting guidance through the NAIC Accounting Manual. However, model insurance laws and regulations are only effective when adopted\nby the states, and Statutory Accounting Principles (“SAP”) continue to be established by individual state laws, regulations and permitted\npractices. Changes to the NAIC Accounting Manual or modifications by the various state insurance departments may affect the statutory\ncapital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries.\nThe NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (the “ORSA Model Act”). The ORSA\nModel Act requires an insurance holding company to, regularly, no less than annually, assess the adequacy of our insurance subsidiaries’\nrisk management framework, and current and estimated projected future solvency position; internally document the process and results of\nthe assessment; and provide a confidential high-level report annually to the lead state commissioner.\n21"

      "text": "Examinations\nState insurance laws and regulations govern the marketplace for insurers, affecting the form and content of disclosure to insureds,\nadvertising, sales and underwriting practices and complaint and claims handling, and these provisions are generally enforced through\nperiodic or target market conduct examinations. State insurance departments may conduct periodic or target detailed examinations of the\nbooks, records, accounts and business practices of insurers licensed in their states. These examinations are sometimes conducted in\ncooperation with insurance departments of multiple other states or jurisdictions representing each of the NAIC zones, under guidelines\npromulgated by the NAIC.\nAccounting Principles\nState insurance regulators developed SAP as a basis of accounting used to monitor and regulate the solvency of insurers. Since\ninsurance regulators are primarily concerned with ensuring an insurer’s ability to pay its current and future obligations to policyholders,\nstatutory accounting conservatively values the assets and liabilities of insurers, generally in accordance with standards specified by such\ninsurer’s domiciliary jurisdiction. Uniform statutory accounting practices are established by the NAIC and are generally adopted by regulators\nin the various state jurisdictions. Due to differences in methodology between SAP and United States generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (“U.S. GAAP”), the values for assets, liabilities and equity reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP\nare often materially different from those reflected in financial statements prepared under SAP.\nMarket Conduct\nState insurance laws and regulations govern the marketplace activities of insurers, affecting the form and content of disclosure to\nconsumers, advertising, product replacement, sales and underwriting practices and complaint and claims handling, and these provisions are\ngenerally enforced through periodic market conduct examinations. Our insurance subsidiaries are not currently undergoing market conduct\nreviews in any states.\nInvestments\nState insurance laws and regulations require diversification of our insurance subsidiaries’ investment portfolio and limit the proportion of,\nor in some cases totally prohibit, investments our insurance subsidiaries may hold in different asset categories. Assets invested contrary to\nsuch regulatory limitations must be treated as non-admitted assets for assessing an insurer’s solvency unless a waiver is given by the\ninsurer’s domestic insurance regulator, and, in some instances, regulations require divestiture of such non-complying investments. We\nbelieve our insurance subsidiaries’ investments are in compliance with these state insurance laws and regulations or are subject to any\napplicable waivers.\nCapital and Surplus Requirements\nInsurance regulators have the discretionary authority, in connection with maintaining the licensing of our insurance subsidiaries, to limit or\nrestrict insurers from issuing new policies, or to take other actions, if, in the regulators’ judgment, the insurer is not maintaining a sufficient\namount of surplus or reserves, or is in a hazardous financial condition. We seek to maintain new business and capital management\nstrategies to support meeting related regulatory requirements.\nMortgage Guaranty Insurance Capital and Surplus Requirements. Mortgage guaranty insurers are not subject to the NAIC’s risk-based\ncapital (“RBC”) requirements, but certain states impose other forms of capital requirements on mortgage guaranty insurers, requiring\nmaintenance of a RTC ratio not to exceed 25:1. Policyholder position is defined as surplus as regards policyholders plus contingency\nreserves, less ceded reinsurance. In this Annual Report, we show policyholder position as statutory capital.\n22"

      "text": "The NAIC is in the process of considering changes to the Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act (the “MGI Model”) and revisions to\nStatement of Statutory Accounting Principles No. 58—Mortgage Guaranty Insurance. In 2020 the NAIC developed a mortgage guaranty\nsupplemental filing. In September 2022, the Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Working Group (the “MGIWG”) released its most recent exposure\ndrafts of the revised MGI Model. The process for developing this framework is ongoing, and the outcome of this process remains uncertain.\nAt this time, we cannot predict (i) the outcome of this process; (ii) which states, if any, may adopt the MGI Model; (iii) the effect changes, if\nany, will have on the mortgage guaranty insurance market generally, or on our business specifically; (iv) the additional costs associated with\ncompliance with any such changes; or (v) any changes to our operations that may be necessary to comply, any of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also cannot predict whether other regulatory\ninitiatives will be adopted and what impact, if any, such initiatives, if adopted as laws, may have on our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nGroup Capital Requirements. The NAIC has developed a group capital calculation (“GCC”) tool using an RBC aggregation methodology\nfor all entities within the insurance holding company system, including non-U.S. entities. The GCC provides regulators with an additional tool\nfor conducting group-wide supervision and enhances transparency into how capital is allocated. In December 2020, the NAIC adopted\namendments to the Holding Company System Model Act and Regulation. The amendments adopt a Group Capital Calculation Template and\nInstructions (“GCC Template and Instructions”) as well as an annual filing requirement for the GCC. The amendments were adopted by\nVirginia, Genworth’s insurance holding company group’s lead state, in 2022.\nDuring 2021, certain insurance groups agreed to voluntarily submit data to lead states using the newly adopted template as part of a trial\nimplementation phase. Based on the trial results and feedback from these insurance groups, the NAIC implemented changes to the GCC\nTemplate and Instructions.\nIn May 2022, the Group Capital Calculation Working Group of the NAIC adopted the 2022 GCC Instructions and Template, which will be\nused by a number of states, including Delaware and Virginia, for year end 2022 filings. The GCC also adopted guidance for insurance\nregulators to use in reviewing GCC submissions in the form of changes to the NAIC Financial Analysis Handbook. It is unclear how the\ndevelopment of group capital measures by the NAIC will interact with existing capital requirements for U.S. insurance companies.\nReserves\nState insurance laws and regulations require our insurance subsidiaries to establish a special statutory contingency reserve reflected in\ntheir statutory financial statements to provide for payable claims and other expenses and purposes in the event of significant economic\ndeclines. Annual additions to the statutory contingency reserve must be at least 50% of net earned premiums as defined by state insurance\nlaws and regulations. These contingency reserves generally are held until the earlier of (i) 10 years after which such amounts can be\nreleased into surplus or (ii) when loss ratios exceed 35% in which case, the amount above 35% can be released under certain\ncircumstances, although regulators have granted discretionary releases from time to time. However, approval by the NCDOI is required for\ncontingency reserve releases when loss ratios exceed 35%. The establishment of the statutory contingency reserve is funded by premiums\nthat would otherwise generate net earnings that would be reflected in policyholder surplus. This deferral of premiums into the contingency\nreserve limits our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends to stockholders until those contingency reserves are released back into\nsurplus. Our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory contingency reserve was approximately $3,551 million and $3,042 million as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDodd-Frank Act\nAlthough the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business, federal initiatives often have an impact on\nour business in a variety of ways. From time to time, federal measures\n23"

      "text": "are proposed that may significantly affect the insurance business. These areas include financial services regulation, securities regulation,\nderivatives regulation, money laundering, privacy regulation and taxation. In addition, various forms of direct federal regulation of insurance\nhave been proposed in recent years.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and required various federal agencies to\nadopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act prohibits a creditor from making a residential mortgage loan unless the creditor makes a reasonable and good faith\ndetermination that, at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan. In addition, the Dodd-Frank\nAct created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which regulates certain aspects of the offering and provision of consumer\nfinancial products or services but not the business of insurance. Certain rules and regulations established by the CFPB require mortgage\nlenders to demonstrate that they have effectively considered the consumer’s ability to repay a mortgage loan, establish when a mortgage\nmay be classified as a Qualified Mortgage (“QM”) and determine when a lender is eligible for a safe harbor as a presumption that the lender\nhas complied with the ability-to-repay requirements. The regulations include the QM Patch for mortgages that comply with certain prohibitions\nand limitations and meet the GSE underwriting and product guidelines. Mortgages that meet these requirements are deemed to be QMs. The\nQM Patch permits loans that exceed a DTI ratio of 43% to be eligible for QM status. Many of the loans that qualify under the QM Patch\nrequire credit enhancement, of which private mortgage insurance is the predominate form of coverage. On December 29, 2020, the CFPB\npromulgated two final rules amending the QM Rule: (i) the Amended QM Rule and (ii) the Seasoned QM Final Rule. The effective date of\nboth rules was March 1, 2021, with a mandatory compliance date for the Amended QM Rule of July 1, 2021. However, April 27, 2021, the\nCFPB promulgated a final rule delaying the mandatory compliance date of the Amended QM Rule until October 1, 2022 and noting that the\nAmended QM Rule and Seasoned QM Final Rule would be reconsidered at a later time. As provided under the final rule, the prior 43% DTI-\nbased QM Rule definition, the new price-based Average Prime Offer Rate (“APOR”) definition and the QM Patch all remained available to\nlenders for loan applications received prior to October 1, 2022. However, on April 8, 2021, Fannie Mae issued Lender Letter 2021-09 and\nFreddie Mac issued Bulletin 2021-13 stating that due to the requirements of the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements (“PSPAs”) between\nthe Treasury Department and each of the GSEs they would only acquire loans that meet the new price-based (APOR) definition set forth\nunder the Amended QM Rule for applications received on or after July 1, 2021. We believe that loans which previously qualified under the\n43% DTI-based QM Rule definition and the QM Patch will continue to qualify under the new price-based (APOR) definition and therefore we\nexpect little impact from this change.\nIn October 2022, the SEC adopted final rules requiring the recovery of erroneously awarded compensation as mandated by the Dodd-\nFrank Act. The rules will, among other things, require national securities exchanges to establish listing standards that would require listed\ncompanies to adopt and comply with a compensation recovery policy, often known as a clawback policy, and require listed companies to\nprovide disclosure about such policies and how they are being implemented. In the event a company is required to prepare an accounting\nrestatement, including to correct an error that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left\nuncorrected in the current period, the company must recover from any current or former executive officers incentive-based compensation that\nwas erroneously awarded during the three years preceding the date such a restatement was required. The recoverable amount would be the\namount of incentive-based compensation received in excess of the amount that otherwise would have been received had it been determined\nbased on the restated financial measure. The updated listing standards related to clawback policies will become effective no later than\nNovember 28, 2023. Listed companies will be required to adopt a clawback policy no later than 60 days following the applicable listing\nstandards effective date and make the required disclosure in proxy and information statements, as well as annual reports filed after the\nadoption of their clawback policy. We are currently awaiting the finalization of the relevant listing standards and are evaluating our existing\nclawback policy to determine if any updates are required.\n24"

      "text": "On August 25, 2022, the SEC adopted final rules implementing the pay versus performance requirement as mandated by the Dodd-\nFrank Act. The rules require public companies to disclose the relationship between their executive compensation and financial performance\nin proxy or information statements in which executive compensation disclosures are required. Under the new rules, companies will be\nrequired to provide a table disclosing specified executive compensation and financial performance measures for the five most recently\ncompleted fiscal years after an initial phase-in period. Companies are also required to describe the relationship between the actual executive\ncompensation paid, as defined by the new rules, and each of the financial performance measures in the table, as well as the company’s total\nshareholder return (“TSR”) and the TSR of its selected peer group. In addition, companies are required to disclose three to seven financial\nperformance measures they determine to be the most important performance measures for linking executive compensation actually paid to\ncompany performance. These final rules are effective in proxy and information statements for fiscal years ending on or after December 16,\n2022 and will be reflected in our proxy statement for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAgency Qualification Requirements\nAs the largest purchasers of conventional mortgage loans, and therefore, the main beneficiaries of private mortgage insurance, the\nGSEs impose eligibility requirements that private mortgage insurers must satisfy in order to be approved to insure loans purchased by the\nGSEs. Effective December 31, 2015, each GSE adopted the original PMIERs, which set forth operational and financial requirements that\nmortgage insurers must meet in order to remain eligible. On September 27, 2018, the GSEs issued revisions to the PMIERs, which became\neffective March 31, 2019. The PMIERs aim to ensure that approved insurers possess the financial and operational capacity to serve as\nstrong counterparties to the GSEs throughout various market conditions. The PMIERs are comprehensive, covering virtually all aspects of\nthe business and operations of a private mortgage insurer of GSE loans, including internal risk management and quality controls,\nunderwriting, claim processing and loss mitigation among others. In addition, the PMIERs require private mortgage insurers to obtain the\nprior consent of the GSEs before taking certain actions, which may include entering into various intercompany agreements and commuting or\nreinsuring risk, among others. As of December 31, 2022, we met the PMIERs financial and operational requirements and currently hold a\nreasonable amount in excess of the financial requirements.\nThe PMIERs include financial requirements for mortgage insurers under which a mortgage insurer’s “Available Assets” (generally only\nthe most liquid assets of an insurer) must meet or exceed “Minimum Required Assets” (which are based on an insurer’s RIF and are\ncalculated from tables of factors with several risk dimensions and are subject to a floor amount) and otherwise generally establish when a\nmortgage insurer is qualified to issue coverage that will be acceptable to the respective GSE for acquisition of high LTV mortgages. The\nGSEs may amend or waive PMIERs at their discretion, impose additional conditions or restrictions on us and also have broad discretion to\ninterpret PMIERs, which could impact the calculation of our “Available Assets” and/or “Minimum Required Assets”.\nThe operational PMIERs requirements include standards that govern the relationship between the GSEs and approved insurers and are\ndesigned to ensure that approved insurers operate under uniform guidelines, such as claim processing timelines. They include quality control\nrequirements that are designed to ensure that approved insurers have a strong internal risk management infrastructure and senior\nmanagement oversight.\nDuring 2020 and 2021, the GSEs issued several amendments to PMIERS. Many of the provisions are no longer applicable but for loans\nthat became non-performing due to a COVID-19 hardship, PMIERs was temporarily amended with respect to each non-performing loan that\n(i) had an initial missed monthly payment occurring on or after March 1, 2020 and prior to April 1, 2021 or (ii) is subject to a forbearance plan\ngranted in response to a financial hardship related to COVID-19, the terms of which are materially consistent with terms of forbearance plans\noffered by the GSEs. The risk-based required asset amount factor for the non-performing loan is the greater of (a) the applicable risk-based\nrequired asset amount factor for a performing loan were it not delinquent, and (b) the product of a 0.30 multiplier and the\n25"

In the case of (i) above, absent the loan being subject to a\nforbearance plan described in (ii) above, the 0.30 multiplier is applicable for no longer than three calendar months beginning with the month\nin which the loan became a non-performing loan due to having missed two monthly payments. Loans subject to a forbearance plan described\nin (ii) above include those that are either in a repayment plan or loan modification trial period following the forbearance plan unless reported\nto the approved insurer that the loan is no longer in such forbearance plan, repayment plan, or loan modification trial period. In addition, the\nPMIERs Amendment made permanent revisions to the risk-based required asset amount factor for non-performing loans for properties\nlocated in future FEMA-Declared Major Disaster Areas eligible for individual assistance.\nUnder PMIERs, we are subject to these operational and financial requirements. Each approved mortgage insurer is required to provide\nthe GSEs with an annual certification and a quarterly report as to its compliance with PMIERs. As of December 31, 2022, we had estimated\navailable assets of $5,206 million against $3,156 million net required assets under PMIERs compared to available assets of $5,077 million\nagainst $3,074 million net required assets as of December 31, 2021. The sufficiency ratio as of December 31, 2022 was 165% or $2,050\nmillion above the published PMIERs requirements, compared to 165% or $2,003 million above the published PMIERs requirements as of\nDecember  31, 2021. Sufficiency was above the requirements imposed by the GSE Restrictions that require us to maintain a PMIERs\nsufficiency ratio of 120% in 2022 and 115% in 2021. For information with respect to higher PMIERs sufficiency ratios in future periods as a\nresult of the GSE Restrictions, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors —Risks Relating to Our Business— If we are unable to continue to meet the\nrequirements mandated by PMIERs, the GSE Restrictions and any additional restrictions imposed on us by the GSEs, we may not be eligible\nto write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations\nand financial condition.”\nIn addition, our PMIERs required assets as of December 31, 2022 benefited from the application of a 0.30 multiplier applied to the risk-\nbased required asset amount factor for certain non-performing loans.\nIn their respective letters approving credit for reinsurance against PMIERs financial requirements, the GSEs require our mortgage\ninsurance subsidiary not to exceed a maximum statutory RTC ratio of 18:1 or they reserve the right to reevaluate the amount of PMIERs\ncredit for reinsurance and other CRT transactions available under PMIERs indicated in their approval letters. Freddie Mac has also imposed\nadditional requirements on our option to commute these reinsurance agreements. Both GSEs reserved the right to periodically review the\nreinsurance transactions for treatment under PMIERs.\nIn September 2020, subsequent to the issuance of our 2025 Senior Notes, the GSEs imposed the GSE Restrictions with respect to\ncapital on our business. In May 2021, in connection with their conditional approval of the consummation of our IPO, the GSEs confirmed the\nGSE Restrictions will remain in effect until the following collective GSE Conditions are met: (i) EMICO obtains a “BBB+”/“Baa1” (or higher)\nrating from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s or Fitch for two consecutive quarters and (ii) our Parent achieves a debt leverage ratio (excluding\nU.S. life business equity) that is less than 25% and a cash coverage ratio that is at least 2.5 for two consecutive quarters. Prior to the\nsatisfaction of the GSE Conditions, the GSE Restrictions require (a) EMICO to maintain 115% of PMIERs Minimum Required Assets through\n2021, 120% during 2022 and 125% thereafter, (b) the Company to retain available liquidity the greater of either 13.5% of outstanding EHI\ndebt or $300 million of its holding company cash that can be drawn down exclusively for Company debt service or to contribute to EMICO to\nmeet its regulatory capital needs including PMIERs and (c) prior written approval must be received from the GSEs before any additional debt\nissuance by either EMICO or the Company. In addition, EMICO is not permitted to make any dividends or distributions that would cause the\nPMIERs Available Assets to fall below the PMIERs Minimum Required Assets percentages set forth in clause (a) above. In addition, in\ncalculating PMIERs Available Assets relative to any dividend or distribution, PMIERs Available Assets shall be calculated consistent with the\ncapital preservation provisions of the PMIERs Amendment, and any amendments thereto. Our Parent expects to continue own at least 80%\nof EHI common stock. However, if our Parent no longer owns directly or indirectly 50% or more of our common stock, Fannie Mae agreed to\nreconsider the GSE Restrictions.

Mortgage origination and servicing transactions are subject to compliance with various state and federal laws, including RESPA,\nHOPA, Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), the Fair Housing Act, the Truth In Lending Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLB\nAct”), the Dodd-Frank Act and others, including those discussed in this section. Among other things, these laws and their implementing\nregulations prohibit payments for referrals of settlement service business, require fairness and non-discrimination in granting or facilitating the\ngranting of insurance, govern the circumstances under which companies may obtain and use consumer credit information, and provide for\nother consumer protections. Additionally, changes in federal housing legislation and other laws and regulations that affect the demand for\nprivate mortgage insurance may have a material effect on private mortgage insurers. For example, in December 2020, the Federal Housing\nFinance Agency (“FHFA”) promulgated the Enterprise Capital Framework that imposes a new capital framework on the GSEs, including risk-\nbased and leverage capital requirements and buffers in excess of regulatory minimums that can be drawn down in periods of financial stress.\nThis rule is part of the process to potentially end the conservatorships of the GSEs. The final rule could cause the GSEs to increase their\nguarantee pricing in order to meet the new capital requirements.\nOn December 14, 2022, the SEC adopted amendments to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and added new\ndisclosure requirements to enhance investor protections against insider trading. The amendments add new conditions to the availability of\nthe affirmative defense to insider trading provided by Rule 10b5-1(c), including cooling-off periods for directors, officers and persons other\nthan issuers. The amendments create new disclosure requirements regarding a company’s insider trading policies and procedures and the\nadoption and termination (including modification) of Rule 10b5-1 and certain other trading arrangements by directors and officers. The\namendments also create new disclosure requirements for executive and director compensation regarding certain equity compensation\nawards granted in close proximity to a company’s disclosure of material nonpublic information. Companies must also identify transactions\nmade pursuant to a plan that is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c). Beneficial ownership reports filed on\nor after April 1, 2023 will be required to comply with the amendments and public companies will be required to comply with the new\ndisclosure requirements in periodic reports and any proxy or information statements for full fiscal periods beginning on or after April 1, 2023.\n27"

      "text": "Federal Laws\nThe Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (“RESPA”) applies to most residential mortgages insured by private mortgage\ninsurers. Mortgage insurance is considered a “settlement service” for purposes of loans subject to RESPA. Subject to limited exceptions,\nRESPA precludes us from providing services to mortgage lenders or other settlement service providers free of charge, charging fees for\nservices that are lower than their reasonable or fair market value and paying fees for services that others provide that are higher than their\nreasonable or fair market value. In addition, RESPA prohibits persons from giving or accepting any portion or percentage of a charge for a\nreal estate settlement service, other than for services actually performed. Although many states prohibit mortgage insurers from giving\nrebates, RESPA has been interpreted to cover many non-fee services as well. Mortgage insurers and their customers are subject to the\npossible sanctions of this law, which may be enforced by the CFPB, state insurance departments, state attorneys general and other\nenforcement authorities.\nHOPA provides for the automatic termination, or cancellation upon a borrower’s request, of the borrower’s obligation to pay for private\nmortgage insurance upon satisfaction of certain conditions. HOPA applies to owner-occupied residential mortgage loans regardless of lien\npriority and to borrower-paid mortgage insurance closed after July 29, 1999. HOPA requires lenders to automatically terminate a borrower’s\nobligation to pay for mortgage insurance coverage once the LTV ratio reaches 78% of the original value. A borrower generally may also\nrequest cancellation of mortgage insurance from their lender once the actual payments reduce the loan balance to 80% of the home’s\noriginal value. For borrower-initiated cancellation of mortgage insurance, the borrower must have a “good payment history” as defined by\nHOPA.\nFCRA imposes restrictions on the permissible use of credit report information and requires mortgage insurance companies to provide\n“adverse action” notices to consumers in the event an application for mortgage insurance is declined or offered at less than the best available\nrate for the loan program applied for due to information contained in a consumer’s credit report. There has been past class action litigation\nover these FCRA adverse action notices involving the mortgage insurance industry, including court-approved settlements.\nThe Fair Housing Act generally prohibits discrimination in the terms, conditions or privileges in residential real estate-related transactions\non the basis of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin. Numerous courts have held that the Fair Housing Act prohibits\ndiscriminatory insurance practices. In addition, both the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the CFPB have pursued claims under the Fair\nHousing Act on a disparate impact theory as well. There has been litigation over the Fair Housing Act involving other mortgage insurers,\nresulting in some cases in court-approved settlements.\nMortgage Servicing Rules\nThe CFPB Servicing Rule established servicer requirements for handling loans that are in default, handling escrow accounts, responding\nto borrower assertions of error and loss mitigation in the event that a borrower defaults. A provision of the required loss mitigation procedures\nprohibits a loan holder or servicers from commencing foreclosure until 120 days after the borrower’s delinquency. Since 2014, the CFPB has\nclarified those rules through subsequent rule makings and provided guidance on how servicers must apply them in certain circumstances,\nincluding recent clarifications as a result of COVID-19.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. On April 3, 2020, the CFPB, the National Credit Union Administration, the\nFederal Banking Agencies and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors issued a joint statement to clarify existing flexibility in the mortgage\nservicing rules that services can use to help consumers during the COVID-19 emergency, including those applicable to mortgage\nforbearance options under the CARES Act. The joint statement addressed flexibility around required notices from servicers and the existing\nrequirements related to continuity of contact and reasonable diligence steps required when the forbearance ends. This guidance could\nreduce claims and\n28"

The forbearance could be extended for an additional 180 days, up to a year in total, or shortened at the request of the\nborrower. In addition, on February 25, 2021, the FHFA announced that borrowers with a mortgage backed by the GSEs who are in an active\nCOVID-19 forbearance plan as of February 28, 2021 may request up to two additional forbearance extensions for a maximum of 18 months\nof total forbearance relief. In addition, the CARES Act provides that furnishers of credit reporting information, including servicers, should\ncontinue to report a loan as current to credit reporting agencies if the loan is subject to a payment accommodation, such as forbearance, so\nlong as the borrower abides by the terms of the accommodation. Many servicers have updated and improved their reporting to private\nmortgage insurers for when a loan is covered by forbearance.\nThe foreclosure moratorium for mortgages that are purchased by the GSEs expired on July 31, 2021. However, on June 28, 2021 the\nCFPB issued a final rule to amend Regulation X of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act effective August 31, 2021 to assist mortgage\nborrowers affected by the COVID-19 emergency. The final rule established temporary procedural changes that require a loss mitigation\nreview prior to a servicer’s first notice or foreclosure filing on certain mortgages. On June 29, 2021, the FHFA announced that servicers were\nimmediately prohibited from making a first notice or foreclosure filing for mortgages backed by the GSEs that would be prohibited by the\nCFPB Regulation X Final Rule before it took effect on August 31, 2021. These announcements generally prohibited servicers from starting\nforeclosures on mortgages purchased by the GSEs until after December 31, 2021.\nRegulation of Mortgage Origination\nPrivate mortgage insurers are also indirectly impacted by federal law and regulation affecting mortgage originators and lenders,\npurchasers of mortgage loans and governmental insurers. Among the most significant of these laws and regulations are the Dodd-Frank Act\nQM and the ability-to-repay (“ATR”) Requirement and the qualified residential mortgage (“QRM”) securitization risk retention provisions.\nATR and QM Rules\nThe Dodd-Frank Act ATR Requirement prohibits a creditor from making a residential mortgage loan unless the creditor makes a\nreasonable and good faith determination that, at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, which regulates certain aspects of the offering and provision of consumer financial\nproducts or services but not the business of insurance. Certain rules and regulations established by the CFPB require mortgage lenders to\ndemonstrate that they have effectively considered the consumer’s ability to repay a mortgage loan, establish when a mortgage may be\nclassified as a QM and determine when a lender is eligible for a safe harbor as a presumption that the lender has complied with the ability-to-\nrepay requirements. The regulations include the QM Patch for mortgages that comply with certain prohibitions and limitations and meet the\nGSE underwriting and product guidelines. Mortgages that meet these requirements are deemed to be QMs. The QM Patch permits loans that\nexceed a DTI ratio of 43% to be eligible for QM status. Many of the loans that qualify under the QM Patch require credit enhancement, of\nwhich private mortgage insurance is the predominate form of coverage. In addition, on December 29, 2020, the CFPB promulgated two final\nrules amending the QM Rule: (i) the Amended QM Rule and (ii) the Seasoned QM Final Rule. The effective date of both rules was March 1,\n2021, with a mandatory compliance date for the Amended QM Rule of July 1, 2021. On April 27, 2021, the CFPB promulgated a final rule\ndelaying the mandatory compliance date of the Amended QM Rule until October\n29"

      "text": "1, 2022 and noting that the Amended QM Rule and Seasoned QM Final Rule would be reconsidered at a later time. As provided under the\nfinal rule, the prior 43% DTI-based QM Rule definition, the new price-based (APOR) definition and the QM Patch will all remain available to\nlenders for loan applications received prior to October 1, 2022. However, on April 8, 2021, Fannie Mae issued Lender Letter 2021-09 and\nFreddie Mac issued Bulletin 2021-13 stating that due to the requirements of the PSPAs they would only acquire loans that meet the new\nprice-based (APOR) definition set forth under the Amended QM Rule for applications received on or after July 1, 2021. We believe that loans\nwhich previously qualified under the 43% DTI-based QM Rule definition and the QM Patch will continue to qualify under the new price-based\n(APOR) definition and therefore we expect little impact from this change.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act separately granted statutory authority to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”)\n(for FHA-insured loans), the VA (for VA-guaranteed loans), the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and Rural Housing Service\n(“RHS”) to develop their own definitions of a QM in consultation with the CFPB. In December 2013, HUD adopted a separate definition of a\nQM for loans insured by the FHA. HUD’s QM definition is less restrictive than the CFPB QM Rule in certain respects. To the extent that other\ngovernment agencies guaranteeing residential mortgage loans may adopt definitions of a QM that are more favorable to lenders and\nmortgage holders than the CFPB QM Rule, our mortgage insurance business could also be negatively impacted.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires an originator or issuer to retain a specified percentage of the credit risk exposure on securitized mortgages\nthat do not meet the definition of a QRM. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, in 2015 the Federal Banking Agencies, the FHFA, the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and HUD adopted a joint final rule implementing the QRM rules that aligns the definition of a\nQRM with that of a QM. In December 2019, the Federal Banking Agencies initiated a review of certain provisions of the risk retention rule,\nincluding the QRM definition. Among other things, the review allows the Federal Banking Agencies to consider the QRM definition in light of\nany changes to the QM definition under the QM Rule adopted by the CFPB, which would include the final rule promulgated by the CFPB on\nDecember 29, 2020. If the QRM definition is changed in a manner that is unfavorable to us, such as to require a large down payment for a\nloan to qualify as a QRM, without giving consideration to mortgage insurance in computing LTV ratios, the attractiveness of originating and\nsecuritizing loans with lower down payments may be reduced, which may adversely affect the future demand for mortgage insurance.\nBasel III\nIn 1988, the Basel Committee developed Basel I which set out international benchmarks for assessing banks’ capital adequacy\nrequirements. In 2005, the Basel Committee issued Basel II, which, among other things, sets forth capital treatment of mortgage insurance\npurchased and held on balance sheet by banks in respect of their origination and securitization activities. Following the financial crisis of\n2008, the Basel Committee issued Basel III that established RBC and leverage capital requirements for most United States banking\norganizations (although banking organizations with less than $10 billion in total assets may now choose to comply with an alternative\ncommunity bank leverage ratio framework established by the Federal Banking Agencies in 2019).\nIn December 2017, the Basel Committee published the 2017 Basel III Revisions that were generally targeted for implementation by each\nparticipating country by January 1, 2023. Under these revisions to the international framework, banks using the standardized approach to\ndetermine their credit risk may consider mortgage insurance in calculating the exposure amount for real estate but will determine the risk-\nweight for residential mortgages based on the LTV ratio at loan origination, without consideration of mortgage insurance. Under the\nstandardized approach, after the appropriate risk-weight is determined, the existence of mortgage insurance could be considered, but only if\nthe company issuing the insurance has a lower risk-weight than the underlying exposure. Mortgage insurance issued by private companies\nwould not meet this test. Therefore, under the 2017 Basel III Revisions, mortgage insurance could not mitigate credit and lower the capital\ncharge under the standardized approach. It is possible that the Federal Banking Agencies could determine that their current capital rules are\nat least as stringent as the\n30"

However, if the Federal Banking Agencies decide to implement the\n2017 Basel III Revisions as specifically drafted by the Basel Committee, mortgage insurance would not lower the LTV ratio of residential\nloans for capital purposes, and therefore may decrease the demand for mortgage insurance. It remains unclear whether new guidelines will\nbe proposed or finalized in the United States in response to the most recent 2017 Basel III Revisions.\nPrivacy of Consumer Information and Cybersecurity\nFederal and state laws and regulations require financial institutions, including insurance companies, to protect, among other things, the\nsecurity and confidentiality of consumer financial information and to notify consumers about policies and practices relating to the collection\nand disclosure of consumer information and policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information and to notify\nregulators and consumers in the event of certain data breaches affecting personal information.\nFederal and state lawmakers and regulatory bodies may consider additional or more detailed regulations regarding these subjects and\nthe privacy and security of nonpublic personal information, confidential business information, information security systems, and vendors and\nother third parties that may have access to sensitive data or systems. Furthermore, the issues surrounding data security and the\nsafeguarding of consumers’ protected information are under increasing regulatory scrutiny by state and federal regulators, particularly in light\nof the number and severity of recent United States companies’ data breaches. The Federal Trade Commission, the DOJ, the New York State\nDepartment of Financial Services (“NYDFS”), the SEC and the NAIC have undertaken various studies, reports and actions regarding privacy\nand data security for entities under their respective supervision. Some states have recently enacted new privacy and information security\nrequirements and new insurance laws that require certain regulated entities to implement and maintain comprehensive information security\nprograms to safeguard the personal information of insureds and enrollees.\nThe GLB Act and the FCRA impose privacy and information security requirements on financial institutions, including obligations to\nprotect and safeguard consumers’ nonpublic personal information and creditworthiness information, respectively, and limitations on the use\nand sharing of such information. The GLB Act requires administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security,\nconfidentiality, integrity and the proper disposal of nonpublic personal information, and the FCRA imposes similar information security\nrequirements regarding the protection of creditworthiness information. The FCRA limits an entity’s ability to disclose creditworthiness\ninformation to affiliates and nonaffiliates unless certain notice requirements are met and the consumer does not elect to prevent or “opt out”\nof the disclosure, and it limits an entity’s ability to use creditworthiness information except for certain authorized purposes. The GLB Act limits\na financial institution’s disclosure of nonpublic personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless certain notice requirements are met,\nand the consumer does not elect to prevent or “opt out” of the disclosure. The GLB Act requires that financial institutions provide privacy\nnotices to their customers. With respect to our business, the GLB Act is enforced by the CFPB and state insurance regulators, and the FCRA\nis enforced by the CFPB. CFPB regulations implement certain sections of the GLB Act regarding privacy and information security, and state\ninsurance regulations also implement certain sections of the GLB Act regarding privacy and information security, including requirements to\nnotify individuals regarding certain data security incidents that affect their nonpublic personal information. Certain states have implemented\ncertain requirements of the GLB Act, including North Carolina through the Consumer and Customer Information Privacy Act.\nMany states have enacted privacy and data security laws that impose compliance obligations beyond those imposed by the GLB Act,\nincluding obligations to protect sensitive personal information. On July 25, 2019, New York enacted the Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic\nData Security Act to increase information security requirements regarding New York residents’ personal information. This law became\neffective March 21, 2020. All fifty states also require entities to provide notification to affected state residents and, in certain instances, state\nregulators, such as state attorneys general or state insurance\n31"

The NYDFS cybersecurity regulation includes specific technical safeguards as well as\nrequirements regarding governance, incident planning, training, data management, system testing and regulator notification in the event of\ncertain cybersecurity events. In addition, on March 2, 2021, Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”) which\nbecame effective on January 1, 2023. The VCDPA borrows heavily from the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) and the\nEuropean Union General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”) and includes exemptions that may be broader than the CCPA in certain\nrespects, including an exemption for any data or financial institution subject to the GLB Act. Other states are also working on legislation\nrelated to consumer data privacy similar to the CCPA.\nIn October 2017, the NAIC adopted a new Insurance Data Security Model Law, which establishes model standards for states to adopt\nregarding data security and notification of data breaches applicable to insurance licensees in states adopting such law, with provisions that\nare generally consistent with the NYDFS cybersecurity regulation discussed above. As with all NAIC model laws, this Insurance Data\nSecurity Model Law must be adopted by a state before becoming law in such state. The Insurance Data Security Model Law has not been\nadopted by a majority of the states. North Carolina has not adopted a version of the Insurance Data Security Model Law. We anticipate that\nmore states will begin adopting the Insurance Data Security Model Law, sometimes with state-specific modifications, in the near term,\nalthough it is not yet an accreditation standard. The NAIC has also adopted a guidance document that sets forth twelve principles for\neffective insurance regulation of cybersecurity risks based on similar regulatory guidance adopted by the Securities Industry and Financial\nMarkets Association and the “Roadmap for Cybersecurity Consumer Protections,” which describes the protections to which the NAIC\nbelieves consumers should be entitled from their insurance companies, agents and other businesses concerning the collection and\nmaintenance of consumers’ personal information, as well as what consumers should expect when such information has been involved in a\ndata breach. We expect cybersecurity risk management, prioritization and reporting to continue to be an area of significant regulatory focus\nby such regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations.\nThe CCPA, effective as of January 1, 2020, affords California residents expanded privacy protections and control over the collection, use\nand sharing of their personal information. The CCPA has been amended, and it is possible it will be amended again by other pending\nlegislative initiatives or by popular referendum. The CCPA requires certain companies doing business in California to disclose to California\nconsumers information regarding the companies’ privacy practices and the privacy rights that businesses must offer to California residents to\naccess and delete their personal information.\nAs noted above, state governments, Congress and agencies may consider and enact additional legislation or promulgate regulations\ngoverning privacy, cybersecurity and data breach reporting requirements.

PMIERs has since been amended on several occasions, including as a result of COVID-19 (as amended, the “PMIERs Amendment”).\nThe PMIERs include financial requirements for mortgage insurers under which a mortgage insurer’s “Available Assets” (generally only\nthe most liquid assets of an insurer) must meet or exceed “Minimum Required Assets” (which are based on an insurer’s RIF and are\ncalculated from tables of factors with several risk dimensions and are subject to a floor amount) and otherwise generally establish when a\nmortgage insurer is qualified to issue coverage that will be acceptable to the respective GSE for acquisition of high LTV mortgages. The\nGSEs may amend or waive PMIERs at their discretion, impose additional conditions or restrictions on us and also have broad discretion to\ninterpret PMIERs, which could impact the calculation of our “Available Assets” and/or “Minimum Required Assets.” The amount of capital that\nEMICO may be required in the future to maintain the “Minimum Required Assets” as defined in PMIERs, and operate our business is\ndependent upon, among other things: (i) the way PMIERs are applied and interpreted by the GSEs and the FHFA; (ii) the future performance\nof the housing market; (iii) our generation of earnings in our business, “Available Assets” and “Minimum Required Assets,” reducing RIF and\nreducing delinquencies as anticipated, and writing anticipated amounts and types of new mortgage insurance business; and (iv) our overall\nfinancial performance, capital and liquidity levels. Depending on our actual experience, the amount of capital required under PMIERs may be\nhigher than currently anticipated. In the absence of a premium increase for new business, if we hold more capital relative to insured loans,\nour returns will be lower. We may be unable to increase premium rates for various reasons, principally due to competition. Our inability to\nincrease the capital as required in the anticipated timeframes and on the anticipated terms, and to realize the anticipated benefits, could have\na material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. More particularly, our ability to continue to meet the\nPMIERs financial requirements and maintain a prudent amount of capital in excess of those requirements, given the dynamic nature of asset\nvaluations and requirement changes over time, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) our ability to complete CRT transactions on our\nanticipated terms and timetable, which, as applicable, are subject to market conditions, third-party approvals and other actions (including\napproval by the GSEs), and other factors that are outside of our control and (ii) our ability to contribute holding company cash or other\nsources of capital to satisfy the portion of the financial requirements that are not satisfied through these transactions. See “—CRT\ntransactions may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses.” The GSEs may amend or waive PMIERs at their\ndiscretion, and also have broad discretion to interpret PMIERs, which could impact the calculation of our “Available Assets” and/or “Minimum\nRequired Assets.”\nThe PMIERs Amendment implemented both permanent and temporary revisions to PMIERs. For loans that became non-performing due\nto a COVID-19 hardship, PMIERs was amended with respect to each non-performing loan that (i) had an initial missed monthly payment\noccurring on or after March 1, 2020 and prior to April 1, 2021 or (ii) is subject to a forbearance plan granted in response to a financial\nhardship related to COVID-19, the terms of which are materially consistent with terms of forbearance plans offered by the GSEs. The risk-\nbased required asset amount factor for a non-performing loan is the greater of (a) the applicable risk-based required asset amount factor for\na performing loan were it not delinquent, and (b) the product of a 0.30 multiplier and the applicable risk-based required asset amount factor\nfor a non-performing loan. In the case of (i) above, absent the loan being subject to a forbearance plan described in (ii) above, the 0.30\nmultiplier will be applicable for no longer than three calendar months beginning with the month in which the loan became a non-performing\nloan due to having missed two monthly payments. Loans subject to a forbearance plan described in (ii) above include those that are either in\na repayment plan or loan modification trial period following the forbearance plan unless reported\n36"

Although we believe we have sufficient capital as required under PMIERs and we remain an approved\ninsurer, there can be no assurance these conditions will continue. The GSEs require EMICO not to exceed a maximum ratio of RIF to\nstatutory capital (“RTC ratio”) of 18:1 or they reserve the right to reevaluate the amount of PMIERs credit for reinsurance and other CRT\ntransactions available under PMIERs indicated in their approval letters. There can be no assurance we will continue to meet the conditions\ncontained in the GSE letters approving credit for reinsurance and other CRT transactions against PMIERs financial requirements. Freddie\nMac has also imposed additional requirements on our option to commute these reinsurance agreements. Both GSEs reserved the right to\nperiodically review the reinsurance transactions for treatment under PMIERs. If we are unable to continue to meet the requirements\nmandated by PMIERs, the GSE Restrictions and any additional restrictions imposed on us by the GSEs, whether because the GSEs amend\nthem or the GSEs’ interpretation of the financial requirements requires us to hold amounts of capital that are higher than we have planned or\notherwise, we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, compliance with PMIERs requires us to seek the GSEs’ prior approval before taking many actions, including implementing\ncertain new products or services, entering into inter-company agreements among others. PMIERs’ prior approval requirements could prohibit,\nmaterially modify or delay us in our intended course of action. The GSEs may modify or change their interpretation of terms they require us to\ninclude in our mortgage insurance coverage for loans purchased by them, requiring us to modify our terms of coverage or operational\nprocedures to remain an approved insurer, and such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations\nand financial condition. It is possible the GSEs could, in their own discretion, require additional limitations and/or conditions on our activities\nand practices that are not currently in PMIERs for us to remain an approved insurer.\nIn September 2020, subsequent to the issuance of our $750 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2025, the GSEs\nimposed certain additional restrictions with respect to capital on our business.

Rising unemployment rates and deterioration in economic conditions across\nthe United States or in specific regional economies, generally increase the likelihood of borrower defaults and can also adversely affect\nhousing values, which increases our risk of loss.\nAn imbalance in supply and demand, supply-chain disruptions and a tightening labor market have led to 40-year high inflation in the\nUnited States. To combat persistent high inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy throughout 2022, which led to the\nhighest interest rates in over a decade and could be a contributing factor on whether the United States goes into a recession in 2023. It is\nunclear what the ultimate impact will be from the tightening monetary policy implemented by the U.S. Federal Reserve, but it is possible\ninterest rate hikes could result in a slowdown in economic growth or a U.S. recession. Unemployment claims generally have returned to pre-\nCOVID-19 levels, but the labor participation rate continues to be suppressed. Variability in consumer confidence due in part to high inflation\nand elevated interest rates, along with developments related to the U.S. federal debt ceiling, continue to create a backdrop of uncertainty in\nthe overall macroeconomic environment. Economic conditions, including unemployment rates and housing values, may also be adversely\naffected by the current or anticipated impact of climate change, including any regulations intended to address it. These circumstances could\nlead to an increase in defaults and losses within our portfolio.\nUnfavorable economic conditions, such as those described above, could also impact home prices. A decline in home values typically\nmakes it more difficult for borrowers to sell or refinance their homes, increasing the likelihood of a default followed by a claim if borrowers\nexperience a job loss or other life events that reduce their incomes or increase their expenses. In addition, declines in home values may also\ndecrease the willingness of borrowers with sufficient resources to make mortgage payments when their mortgage balances exceed the\nvalues of their homes. Declines in home values typically increase the severity of any claims we may pay. The seasonally adjusted Purchase-\nOnly U.S. Home Price Index of the FHFA, which is based on single-family properties whose mortgages have been purchased or securitized\nby Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, indicates that home prices increased by 8.2% in November 2022, after increasing by 17.5%, and 11.6% in\n2021 and 2020, respectively. Recent home price appreciation coupled with high interest rates, has placed pressure on affordability. We have\nseen home prices begin to decline in latter half of 2022. Given this steady rise in such home prices from 2016 through 2019 and steep rise in\nhome prices in 2020 and 2021, we could experience a higher frequency and severity of defaults on more recent vintages should home\nvalues continue to decline in 2023 or subsequent years. Any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nHousing values could also decline due to specific trends that would affect the housing and mortgage markets, such as changes in supply\nor demand for homes, changes in homebuyers’ expectations for potential future home value appreciation, increased restrictions or costs for\nobtaining mortgage credit due to tightened underwriting standards, tax policy, regulatory developments, higher interest rates and customers’\nliquidity issues. Declining housing values may impact the effectiveness of our loss\n38"

In previous economic slowdowns in the United\nStates, we experienced a pronounced weakness in the housing market, as well as declines in home prices. These economic slowdowns and\nthe resulting impact on the housing market drove high levels of delinquencies. Mortgage forbearance programs and any delays in foreclosure\nprocesses could cause our losses to increase as expenses accrue for longer periods or if the value of foreclosed homes further decline\nduring such delays; however, for new loans originated and insured on or after October 1, 2014, our mortgage insurance policies limit the\nnumber of months of unpaid interest and associated expenses that are included in the mortgage insurance claim amount to a maximum of 36\nmonths. If we experience an increase in the number or the cost of delinquencies or losses that are higher than expected, including as a result\nof borrowers’ exit from forbearance programs upon such borrowers reaching the maximum term of forbearance, our business, results of\noperations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nCOVID-19 has and could continue to adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe financial markets, both globally and within the United States continue to feel the aftereffects of COVID-19. While most pandemic-\nrelated safety measures (stay at home orders, travel restrictions, business closures, etc.) have ended, the markets are still feeling the impact\nof inflation and home price appreciation. FEMA has not rescinded the state of emergency status associated with COVID-19 in any of the\ndomestic states or jurisdictions.\nDuring 2020 and 2021, the federal government offered forbearance options for borrowers impacted by COVID-19. Many of these\nprograms are still in effect, which could serve to delay emergence of foreclosures on current delinquencies. Any delays in foreclosure, could\ncause our losses to increase as interest and expenses accrue for longer periods or if the value of foreclosed homes decline during such\nforeclosure delays. If we experience an increase in claim severity resulting in claim amounts that are higher than expected, our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, the expiration or discontinuation of any governmental or\nGSE forbearance or foreclosure relief program could further exacerbate the financial condition of borrowers on loans we insure or economic\nconditions generally, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. While we have seen\ncure experience on COVID-19-related delinquencies that is above our expectations, uncertainty still remains as to the timing and ultimate\nseverity of COVID-19-related delinquencies as a result of the continued availability of forbearance and lack of foreclosure experience and the\nimpact it will have on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCOVID-19 could continue to impact our business, subjecting us to the following risks:\n•\nThe pandemic initially resulted in a material increase in new defaults as borrowers failed to make timely payments on their\nmortgages, primarily as a result of unemployment and mortgage forbearance programs that allow borrowers to defer mortgage\npayments. While many of these delinquencies have cured, our delinquencies in our most aged buckets remain elevated compared to\npre-pandemic levels.\n•\nAs a result of COVID-19-related relief programs, many loans in our delinquency inventory have entered forbearance plans and we\nanticipate that defaults related to the pandemic, if not cured or otherwise substantially mitigated, could remain in our defaulted loan\ninventory for a protracted period of time, potentially resulting in higher levels of claim severity for loans that ultimately result in a\nclaim.

However, given the uncertainty around the long-term impact of COVID-\n19, it is difficult to predict whether a loan’s delinquency will result in a cure or claim when its forbearance plan ends. The severity of\nlosses associated with loans whose delinquencies do not cure will depend on the duration of the forbearance and economic\nconditions at that time and our current estimates about the number of delinquencies for which we will receive claims, and the\namount, or severity, of each claim, could increase or decrease. For new loans originated and insured on or after October 1, 2014, our\nmortgage insurance policies limit the number of months of unpaid interest and associated expenses that are included in the\nmortgage insurance claim amount to a maximum of 36 months.\nWhen we are notified that an insured loan is in default, we establish loss reserves based on management’s estimate of claim rates\nand claim sizes, which are subject to uncertainties and are based on assumptions about certain estimation parameters that may be\nvolatile. As a result, the actual claim payments we make may materially differ from the amount of our corresponding loss reserves.\nOur practice, consistent with industry practice and SAP applicable to insurance companies, is to establish loss reserves in our\nconsolidated U.S. GAAP financial statements based on claim rates and severity for loans that servicers have reported to us as being in\ndefault, which is typically after the second missed payment. We also establish incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) reserves for estimated\nlosses incurred on loans in default that have not yet been reported to us by servicers.\nThe establishment of loss reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment and numerous assumptions by\nmanagement. Changes in assumptions or deviations of actual experience for assumptions can have material impacts on our loss reserves\nand net income (loss). Thus, our loss estimates may vary widely from quarter to quarter. We establish loss reserves using our best estimates\nof claim rates and severity to estimate the ultimate losses on loans reported to us as being in default as of the end of each reporting period.\nThe sources of uncertainty affecting the estimates are numerous and include both internal and external factors. Internal factors include, but\nare not limited to, changes in the mix of exposures, loss mitigation activities and claim settlement practices. Significant external factors\ninclude changes in general economic conditions, including home prices, unemployment/underemployment, interest rates, tax policy, credit\navailability, government housing policies, government and GSE loss mitigation and mortgage forbearance programs, state foreclosure\ntimelines, GSE and state foreclosure moratoriums and types of mortgage products. For example, during recessionary periods in the past,\naccompanied by increased unemployment and declining home prices, we have experienced higher delinquencies and increased losses.\nBecause our assumptions relate to these factors that are not known in advance, change over time, are difficult to accurately predict and are\ninherently uncertain, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments.\nEven in a stable economic environment, the actual claim payments we make may be substantially different and even materially exceed the\namount of our corresponding loss reserves for such claims. Small changes in assumptions or small deviations of actual experience from\nassumptions can have, and in the past have had, material impacts on our reserves, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, sudden and/or unexpected deterioration of economic conditions, may cause our estimates of loss reserves to be materially\nunderstated. Our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely impacted if, and to the extent, our actual losses are\ngreater than our loss and IBNR reserves.\nWe saw a significant increase in new delinquencies from borrower forbearance since the onset of COVID-19. While a large portion of\nthese delinquencies have cured at higher levels than our expectations, reserves recorded related to borrower forbearance rely on a high\ndegree of estimation and assumptions that lack comparable historic data. Therefore, it is possible we could have higher contractual\nobligations related to these loss reserves if these delinquencies do not perform as we expect.

Thus, future potential losses that may develop from loans not currently in default are not reflected in our financial\nstatements, except in the case where we are required to establish a premium deficiency reserve. As a result, future losses on loans that are\nnot currently in default may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity if, and when, such losses\nemerge.\nWe regularly review our reserves and associated assumptions as part of our ongoing assessment of our business performance and risks.\nIf we conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected claim payments as a result of changes in experience,\nassumptions or otherwise, we would be required to increase our reserves and incur charges in the period in which we make the\ndetermination, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nFor additional information on reserves, including the financial impact of some of these risks, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates.”\nIf the models used in our business are inaccurate or there are differences and/or variability in loss development compared to our\nmodel estimates and actuarial assumptions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nWe employ models to, among other uses, price our mortgage insurance products, calculate reserves, value assets and generate\nprojections used to estimate future pre-tax income, as well as to evaluate risk, determine internal capital requirements and perform stress\ntesting. These models rely on estimates and projections that are inherently uncertain, may use data and/or assumptions that do not\nadequately reflect recent experience and relevant industry data, and may not operate as intended. The models require accurate data,\nincluding financial statements, credit reports or other financial information, and reliance on such data could result in unexpected losses,\nreputational damage or other effects that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, if any of our models contain programming or other errors, are ineffective, use data provided by third parties that is incorrect, or if\nwe are unable to obtain relevant data from third parties, our processes could be negatively affected. The models may prove to be less\npredictive than we expect for a variety of reasons, including economic conditions that develop differently than we forecast, unique conditions\nfor which we do not have good historical comparators, unexpected economic and unemployment conditions that arise, changes in the law or\nin the PMIERs, issues arising in the construction, implementation, interpretation or use of the models or other programs, the use of\ninaccurate assumptions or use of short-term financial metrics that do not reveal long-term trends. The limitations of our models may be\nmaterial and could lead us to make wrong or sub-optimal decisions in aspects of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, from time to time we seek to improve our actuarial and financial models, and the conversion process may result in material\nchanges to assumptions and financial results. The models we employ are complex, which increases our risk of error in their design,\nimplementation or use. The associated input data, assumptions and calculations, and the controls we have in place to mitigate these risks\nmay not be effective in all cases. The risks related to our models often increase when we change assumptions and/or methodologies, add or\nchange modeling platforms, or implement model changes under time constraints. These risks are exacerbated when the process for\nassumption changes strains our overall governance and timing around our financial reporting. We intend to continue developing our modeling\ncapabilities. During or after the implementation of these enhancements, we may discover errors or other deficiencies in existing models,\nassumptions and/or methodologies.

We believe the principal competitive factors in the sale of\nour products are price, reputation, customer relationships, financial strength ratings and service.\nThere are currently six active mortgage insurers in the United States, including us. Competition on price remains highly competitive. We\nmonitor various competitive, risk and economic factors while seeking to balance both profitability and market share considerations in\ndeveloping our pricing strategies. We have and may again in the future reduce certain of our rates, which may reduce our premium yield (net\npremiums earned divided by the average IIF) over time as older mortgage insurance coverage with higher premium rates run off and new\nmortgage insurance coverage with lower premium rates are written. In addition, as a result of the current macroeconomic environment, we\nhave implemented pricing changes that we believe align our risk and return profile.\nBy mid-2019, the use of opaque, proprietary risk-based pricing models became widespread in the mortgage insurance industry. As\nopposed to traditional rate card pricing, mortgage insurance premium rates in these risk-based plans are visible only to customers and\ncannot be seen by competitors. In addition, our customers use of technology solutions to deliver rate quotes from mortgage insurers has\nplaced an additional emphasis on price, including emerging tools that provide the ability to automate the selection of a mortgage insurance\nprovider based on price alone. These factors may result in mortgage insurance companies responding aggressively resulting in further\nlowering of premiums. However, risk-based plans are designed to also allow mortgage insurers to price risk more effectively and provide the\nability to manage the credit risk and geographic makeup of their NIW.\nIn addition, not all of our mortgage insurance products have the same return on capital profile. To the extent that some of our competitors\nare willing to set lower pricing and accept lower returns than we find acceptable, we may lose business opportunities, and this may affect our\noverall business relationship with certain customers. If we, in response to competitor actions, lower pricing on these products, we will\nexperience a similar reduction in returns on capital. Depending upon the degree to which we undertake or match such pricing practices or\notherwise reduce our rates due to competition, there may be a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nOne or more of our competitors may seek to capture increased market share by reducing pricing, offering alternative coverage and\nproduct options, loosening their underwriting guidelines or relaxing risk management policies, any of which could improve their competitive\npositions in the industry and negatively impact our ability to achieve our business goals. Specifically, such competitive moves could result in a\nloss of customers, require us to lower premiums or adopt riskier credit guidelines in order to remain competitive, or implement other changes\nthat could lower our revenues, increase the risk of the loans we insure or increase our expenses.

The GSEs could be directed to make such changes by the FHFA, which\nwas appointed as their conservator in September 2008 and has the authority to control and direct the operations of the GSEs.\nWith the GSEs in a prolonged conservatorship, there has been ongoing debate over the future role and purpose of the GSEs in the\nUnited States housing market. Congress may legislate, or the administration may implement through administrative reform, structural and\nother changes to the GSEs and the functioning of the secondary mortgage market. Since 2011, there have been numerous legislative\nproposals intended to incrementally scale back the GSEs (such as a statutory mandate for the GSEs to transfer mortgage credit risk to the\nprivate sector) or to completely reform the United States housing finance system. Congress, however, has not enacted any legislation to\ndate. The proposals vary as to the government’s role in the housing market, and more specifically, with regard to the existence of an explicit\nor implicit government guarantee.\nIn the absence of legislation, the FHFA continues to move forward on administrative reform efforts to prepare the GSEs for the end of\nconservatorship, once fully and adequately capitalized. Between FHFA and the United States Treasury Department (the “Treasury\nDepartment”), they possess significant capacity to effect administrative GSE reforms.\nToday, the FHFA and the GSEs are focused on increasing the accessibility and affordability of homeownership, in particular for low- and\nmoderate-income borrowers and underserved minority communities. Among other things, FHFA (i) directed the GSEs to submit Equitable\nHousing Plans to identify and address barriers to sustainable housing opportunities, including the GSEs' goals and action plans to advance\nequity in housing finance for the next three years; (ii) lifted the 50 bps adverse market fee applicable to most refinance loans; (iii) directed the\nGSEs to expand their streamlined refinance programs; and (iv) directed the GSEs to make permanent desktop appraisals by incorporating\nthe practice into their Selling Guides, which originally was a temporary practice implemented in light of COVID-19. The FHFA announced the\nrelease of Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s respective Equitable Housing Finance Plans in 2022. The proposals included many initiatives,\nincluding language discussing potential changes that could impact the mortgage insurance industry. These initiatives remain preliminary, and\nwe will continue to work with the FHFA, the GSEs, and the broader housing finance industry as these proposals develop and to the extent\nthey are implemented. We cannot predict whether or when any new practices or programs will be implemented under the GSEs’ Equitable\nHousing Finance Plans or other affordability initiatives, and if so in what form, nor can we predict what effect, if any, such practices or\nprograms may have on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAs part of the process to potentially end the conservatorships of the GSEs, on December 17, 2020, the FHFA promulgated a final rule\nimposing a new capital framework on the GSEs, including risk-based and leverage capital requirements and capital buffers in excess of\nregulatory minimums that can be drawn down in periods of financial stress (the “Enterprise Capital Framework”). The Enterprise Capital\nFramework became effective on February 16, 2021. However, the GSEs will not be subject to any requirement under the Enterprise Capital\nFramework until the applicable compliance date. Compliance with the Enterprise Capital Framework, other than the requirements to maintain\na prescribed capital conservation buffer amount (“PCCBA”) and a prescribed leverage buffer amount (“PLBA”), is required on the later of (i)\nthe date of termination of the conservatorship of a GSE and (ii) any later compliance date provided in a consent order or other transition\norder applicable to such GSE. FHFA contemplates that the compliance dates for the PCCBA and the PLBA will be the date of termination of\nthe conservatorship of a GSE. The Enterprise Capital Framework’s advanced approaches requirements will be delayed until the later of (i)\nJanuary 1, 2025 and (ii) any later compliance date provided by a transition order applicable to such GSE. The Enterprise Capital Framework\nsignificantly increases capital requirements and reduces capital credit on CRT transactions as compared to the previous framework. This\nfinal rule could accelerate the recent diversification of the GSE’s risk transfer programs to encompass a broader array of instruments beyond\nprivate mortgage insurance, which could adversely impact our business. Also, in preparation for the end of the FHFA’s conservatorship of the\nGSEs, the FHFA promulgated a final rule on May 4, 2021, effective July 6, 2021, that requires the GSEs to develop plans that would facilitate\ntheir\n43"

The FHFA’s new leadership may result in a delay of the GSEs’ exit from\nconservatorship and in changes to the FHFA’s policies, including, but not limited to, (a) possible delays in the implementation of or the\nreworking of the Enterprise Capital Framework, (b) adjustments to the GSEs’ loan-level pricing adjustments that could make private\nmortgage insurance less competitive or (c) revisions to the PSPAs, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nOn January 14, 2021, the FHFA and the Treasury Department agreed to amend the PSPAs between the Treasury Department and each\nof the GSEs to increase the amount of capital each GSE may retain. Among other things, the amendments to the PSPAs limit the number of\ncertain mortgages the GSEs may acquire with two or more prescribed risk factors, including certain mortgages with combined loan-to-value\nLTV ratios above 90%. However, on September 14, 2021, the FHFA and Treasury Department suspended certain provisions of the\namendments to the PSPAs, including the limit on the number of mortgages with two or more risk factors that the GSEs may acquire. Such\nsuspensions end six months after the Treasury Department notifies the GSEs of termination. The limit on the number of mortgages with two\nor more risk factors was based on the market size at the time. While we do not expect any material impact to the private mortgage market,\nchanges in the provisions or enforcement of this rule could impact our results.\nThe adoption of any GSE reform, whether through legislation or administrative action, could impact the current role of private mortgage\ninsurance as credit enhancement, including its reduction or elimination, which would have an adverse effect on our business, revenue,\nresults of operations and financial condition. At present, it is uncertain what role private capital, including mortgage insurance, will play in the\nUnited States residential housing finance system in the future or the impact any changes to that system could have on our business. Any\nchanges to the charters or statutory authorities of the GSEs would require congressional action to implement. Passage and timing of any\ncomprehensive GSE reform or incremental change (legislative or administrative) is uncertain, making the actual impact on us and our\nindustry difficult to predict. Any such changes that come to pass could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations\nand financial condition.\nIn recent years, the FHFA has set goals for the GSEs to transfer significant portions of the GSEs’ mortgage credit risk to the private\nsector; however, under the FHFA’s new leadership, the timing of these goals could change. This mandate builds upon the goals set in each\nof the last five years for the GSEs to increase the role of private capital by experimenting with different forms of transactions and structures.\nWe have participated in these CRT programs developed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on a limited basis. The GSEs have in the past\npiloted and may in the future attempt to launch alternative products or transactions that compete with private mortgage insurance. To the\nextent these credit risk products evolve in a manner that displaces primary mortgage insurance coverage, the amount of insurance we write\nmay be reduced. It is difficult to predict the impact of alternative CRT products that are developed to meet the goals established by the FHFA.\nIn addition, the Enterprise Capital Framework that was promulgated on December 17, 2020 may impact the CRT programs developed by\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac and/or the role of private mortgage insurance as credit enhancement by potentially accelerating the recent\ndiversification of the GSE’s risk transfer programs to encompass a broader array of instruments, beyond private mortgage insurance.\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac also possess substantial market power, which enables them to influence our business and the mortgage\ninsurance industry in general. Although we actively monitor and develop our relationships with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a deterioration\nin any of these relationships, or the loss of business or opportunities for new business, could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\n44"

      "text": "The amount of mortgage insurance we write could decline significantly if alternatives to private mortgage insurance are used or\nlower coverage levels of mortgage insurance are selected.\nThere are a variety of alternatives to private mortgage insurance that may reduce the amount of mortgage insurance we write. These\nalternatives include:\n•\noriginating mortgages that consist of two simultaneous loans, known as “simultaneous seconds” comprising a first mortgage with an\nLTV ratio of 80% and a simultaneous second mortgage for the excess portion of the loan, instead of a single mortgage with an LTV\nratio of more than 80%;\n•\nusing government mortgage insurance programs;\n•\nholding mortgages in the lenders’ own loan portfolios and self-insuring;\n•\nusing programs, such as those offered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, requiring lower mortgage insurance coverage levels;\n•\noriginating and securitizing loans in MBS whose underlying mortgages are not insured with private mortgage insurance or which are\nstructured so that the risk of default lies with the investor, rather than a private mortgage insurer; and\n•\nusing risk-sharing insurance programs, credit default swaps or similar instruments, instead of private mortgage insurance, to transfer\ncredit risk on mortgages.\nThe degree to which lenders or borrowers may select these alternatives now, or in the future, is difficult to predict. The performance and\nresiliency of the private mortgage insurance industry could impact the perception of the industry and private mortgage insurance execution as\nthe primary choice of first-loss credit protection, which could influence the popularity of alternative forms of mortgage insurance in the future.\nAs one or more of the alternatives described above, or new alternatives that enter the market, are chosen over private mortgage insurance,\nour revenues could be adversely impacted. The loss of business in general or the specific loss of more profitable business could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in the composition of our business or undue concentration by customer or geographic region may adversely affect us by\nincreasing our exposure to loss of business or adverse performance of a small segment of our portfolio.\nOur largest customer accounted for approximately 18% of our total NIW in 2022 and our top five customers generated approximately\n30% of our NIW in 2022. Additionally, no customer had earned premiums that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for 2022.\nChanges in our ability to attract and retain a diverse customer base and avoid undue concentration by geographic region or customer may\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the past, regional housing markets have experienced changes in home prices and unemployment at different rates and to different\nextents. In addition, certain geographic regions have experienced local recessions, falling home prices and rising unemployment based on\neconomic conditions that did not impact, or impacted to a lesser degree, other geographic regions or the overall United States economy. See\n“—A deterioration in economic conditions, a severe recession or a decline in home prices, all of which could be driven by many potential\nfactors, including inflation, may adversely affect our loss experience.” Geographic concentration in our mortgage portfolio therefore increases\nour exposure to losses due to localized economic conditions. We seek to diversify our insured loan portfolio geographically; however,\ncustomer concentration might lead to concentrations in specific regions in the United States. If we do not adequately maintain the geographic\ndiversity of our portfolio, we could be exposed to greater losses.\nAlso, customer concentration may adversely affect our financial condition if a significant customer chooses to increase its use of other\nmortgage insurers, merges with a competitor or exits the mortgage\n45"

Maintaining our business relationships and business volumes\nwith our largest lending customers remains critical to the success of our business.\nWe cannot be certain that any loss of business from significant customers, or any single customer, would be replaced by business from\nother customers, existing or new. As a result of market conditions or changed regulatory requirements, our lending customers may decide to\nwrite business only with a limited number of mortgage insurers or only with certain mortgage insurers, based on their views with respect to an\ninsurer’s pricing, service levels, underwriting guidelines, loss mitigation practices, financial strength, ratings, mechanisms of credit\nenhancements or other factors, including our customers’ perceptions of the strength of our Parent and its other subsidiaries. See “—We\ncould be affected by issues affecting our Parent in a way that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity\nand prospects.”\nOur risk management programs may not be effective in identifying or adequate in controlling or mitigating the risks we face.\nWe have developed risk management programs that include risk appetite, limits, identification, quantification, governance, policies and\nprocedures and seek to appropriately identify, monitor, measure, control, mitigate and report the types of risks to which we are subject. We\nregularly review our risk management programs and work to update them on an ongoing basis to be consistent with then current best market\npractices. However, our risk management programs may not fully control or mitigate all the risks we face or anticipate all potential material\nnegative events.\nMany of our methods for managing certain financial risks (e.g., credit, market and insurance risks) are based on observed historical\nmarket behaviors and/or historical, statistically based models. Historical measures may not accurately predict future exposures, which could\nbe significantly greater than historical measures have indicated. We have also established internal risk limits based upon these historical,\nstatistically based models and we monitor compliance with these limits. Our internal risk limits may be insufficient, and our monitoring may\nnot detect all violations (inadvertent or otherwise) of these limits. Other risk management methods are based on our evaluation of information\nregarding markets, customers and customer behavior, macroeconomic and environmental conditions, catastrophic occurrences and potential\nchanging paradigms that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. See “Business—Risk Management.” This collective information\nmay not always be accurate, complete, up to date or properly considered, interpreted or evaluated in our analyses. Moreover, the models\nand other parts of our risk management programs we rely on in managing various aspects of our business may prove to be less predictive\nthan we expect. See “—If the models used in our business are inaccurate or there are differences and/or variability in loss development\ncompared to our model estimates and actuarial assumptions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations\nand financial condition.” The limitations of our models and other parts of our risk management programs may be material and could lead us\nto make wrong or sub-optimal decisions in managing our risk and other aspects of our business, either of which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nManagement of operational, legal, franchise and regulatory risks requires, among other things, methods to appropriately identify all such\nkey risks, systems to record incidents and policies and procedures designed to mitigate, detect, record and address all such risks and\noccurrences. Management of technology risks requires methods to ensure our systems, processes and people are maintaining the\nconfidentiality, availability and integrity of our information, ensuring technology is enabling our overall strategy and our ability to comply with\napplicable laws and regulations.

Such transactions may not always be available to us, but when they are, they subject\nus to counterparty credit risk. The execution of these strategies also introduces operational risks and considerations. Developing effective\nstrategies for dealing with these risks is a complex process, and no strategy can fully insulate us from those financial risks. See “—CRT\ntransactions may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses.”\nWe may choose to retain certain levels of financial and/or non-financial risk, even when it is possible to mitigate these risks. The decision\nto retain certain levels of financial risk is predicated on our belief that the expected future returns that we will realize from retaining the risk, in\nrelation to the level of risk retained, is favorable, but our expectations may be incorrect, and we may incur material losses or suffer other\nadverse consequences that arise from the retained risk.\nOur performance is highly dependent on our ability to manage risks that arise from day-to-day business activities, including underwriting,\nclaims processing, administration and servicing, execution of our investment strategy, actuarial estimates and calculations, financial and tax\nreporting and other activities, many of which are very complex. We seek to monitor and control our exposure to risks arising out of or related\nto these activities through a variety of internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. However, the occurrence of\nunforeseen events, such as COVID-19, or the occurrence of events of a greater magnitude than expected, including those arising from\ninadequate or ineffective controls, a failure in processes, procedures or systems implemented by us or a failure on the part of employees\nupon which we rely, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a failure\nfrom a third-party vendor providing agreed upon products or services to the specifications required, may pose a risk to our business.\nPast or future misconduct by our employees or employees of our vendors or suppliers could result in violations of laws by us, regulatory\nsanctions against us and/or serious reputational, legal or financial harm to our business, and the precautions we employ to prevent and\ndetect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor the business decisions\nand activities of these individuals to prevent us from engaging in inappropriate activities, excessive risk taking, fraud or security breaches,\nthese individuals may undertake these activities or risks regardless of our controls and procedures and such controls and procedures may\nfail to detect all such decisions and activities. Our compensation policies and procedures are reviewed by us as part of our overall risk\nmanagement program, but it is possible that such compensation policies and practices could inadvertently incentivize excessive or\ninappropriate risk taking. If these individuals take excessive or inappropriate risks, those risks could harm our reputation and have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe extent of the benefits we realize from loss mitigation actions or programs in the future may be limited compared to years past.\nAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we periodically investigate insured loans and evaluate the related servicing to ensure compliance\nwith applicable guidelines and to detect possible fraud or misrepresentation. As a result, we have rescinded, and may in the future rescind,\ncoverage on loans that do not meet our guidelines. In the past, we recognized significant benefits from taking action on these investigations\nand evaluations under our master policies. However, the PMIERs rescission relief principles, which have been incorporated into our\nmortgage insurance policies since 2014, limit our rescission rights for underwriting defects, misrepresentation, and in other circumstances,\nsuch as in cases where the borrower makes a certain number of timely mortgage payments. Therefore, we may not recognize the same level\nof future benefits from rescission actions as we have in years prior to 2014, potentially resulting in higher losses than under our older master\npolicies.

The\nmortgage finance industry (with government support) has adopted various programs to modify delinquent loans to make them more\naffordable to borrowers with the goal of reducing the number of foreclosures. Our master policies contain covenants that require cooperation\nand loss mitigation by the insured. The effect on us of a loan modification depends on re-default rates, which can be affected by factors such\nas changes in home values and unemployment. Our estimates of the number of loans qualifying for modification programs is based on\nmanagement’s judgment as informed by past experience and current market conditions but are inherently uncertain. We cannot predict what\nthe actual volume of loan modifications will be or the ultimate re-default rate, and therefore, we cannot be certain whether these efforts will\nprovide material benefits to us.\nInterest rates and changes in rates, including changes in monetary policy to combat inflation, could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nRising interest rates generally reduce the volume of new mortgage originations and refinances. A decline in the volume of new or\nrefinance mortgage originations would have an adverse effect on our NIW, which may in turn decrease our earned premiums. While the\nterms of recent vintages of adjustable-rate mortgages (“ARMs”) have changed to limit the frequency and severity of payment shocks, rising\ninterest rates also can increase the monthly mortgage payments for homeowners with insured loans that have ARMs that could have the\neffect of increasing default rates on ARM loans. Higher interest rates can lead to an increase in defaults as borrowers at risk of default will\nfind it harder to qualify for a replacement loan. The significant increases in mortgage rates during 2022, driven by monetary and fiscal policies\ndesigned at combating continued inflationary pressures, caused a decline in the mortgage insurance market, which reduced our NIW for the\nyear. This has effectively eliminated the refinance market and affordability pressures from both higher rates and recent home price\nappreciation have strained the purchase market as well. This impact is offset by higher persistency on our existing insured loans since the\nprevailing market interest rate is above the loan interest rate of substantially all of our portfolio. We expect this trend to continue into 2023 as\nrates remain elevated, but the ultimate impact on our premium and future NIW is difficult to predict.\nDeclining interest rates historically increase the rate at which borrowers refinance their existing mortgages, thereby resulting in\ncancellations of the mortgage insurance covering existing loans. Declining interest rates can contribute to home price appreciation, which\nmay provide borrowers with the option of cancelling mortgage insurance coverage earlier than we anticipate when we price that coverage. In\naddition, during 2020 and 2021, as a result of the low interest rate environment, our business experienced a decline in primary persistency\nrates. Lower primary persistency rates result in reduced IIF and earned premiums, which could have a significant adverse impact on our\nresults of operations.\nIn addition, interest rate fluctuations could also have an adverse effect on the results of our investment portfolio. In the current period of\nrising market interest rates, the market value of our lower yielding instruments has declined, driving substantial unrealized losses in our\nportfolio. While we intend to hold these securities until maturity so as to realize their book value, pressure to sell securities in an unrealized\nloss position could drive realized losses and impact future earnings. This impact is partially offset by higher yields on new securities\npurchased. During periods of declining market interest rates, the interest we receive on variable interest rate investments decreases. In\naddition, during those periods, we reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower-yielding high-\ngrade instruments or in lower-credit investment grade instruments to maintain comparable returns. Issuers of fixed-income securities may\nalso decide to prepay their obligations in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates the risk that we have to invest the cash\nproceeds of these securities in lower-yielding or lower-credit investment grade instruments. See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures About Market Risk” for additional information about interest rate risk.\n48"

If we need additional capital\nin the future, we may not be able to fund or raise the required capital as and when required and the amount of capital required may be higher\nthan anticipated. Our inability to fund or raise the capital required in the anticipated timeframes and on the anticipated terms, could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including causing us to reduce our business levels or\nbe subject to a variety of regulatory actions.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we met the PMIERs financial and operational requirements. As of December 31, 2022, we had estimated\navailable assets of $5,206 million against $3,156 million net required assets under PMIERs compared to available assets of $5,077 million\nagainst $3,074 million net required assets as of December 31, 2021.

For information with respect to higher PMIERs sufficiency ratios in future periods as a result of the GSE Restrictions,\nsee “— If we are unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs, the GSE Restrictions and any additional restrictions\nimposed on us by the GSEs, we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.” During 2020 and 2021, the GSEs issued several amendments\nto PMIERs including extension of reduced capital factors for COVID-19 non-performing loans. In order to continue to provide a prudent level\nof financial flexibility in connection with the current PMIERs capital requirements, and given the dynamic nature of asset and liability\nvaluations, requirement changes over time and recent conditions and restrictions imposed on us by the GSEs, we may be required to\nexecute future capital transactions, including additional CRT transactions and other transactions with third parties to provide additional\ncapital.\nHowever, the implementation of any further CRT transactions or other transactions with third parties to provide additional capital depends\non a number of factors, including but not limited to: market conditions, necessary third-party approvals (including approval by regulators and\nthe GSEs) and other factors that are outside of our control. Therefore, we cannot be sure we will be able to successfully implement these\nactions on the timetable and terms acceptable to us or at all or achieve the anticipated benefits. We also cannot be sure we will be able to\nmeet any additional capital requirements imposed by regulators or the GSEs. See “—CRT transactions may not be available, affordable or\nadequate to protect us against losses” and “—If we are unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs, the GSE\nRestrictions and any additional restrictions imposed on us by the GSEs, we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by\nthe GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.”\nIn order to preserve certain tax benefits it obtains from consolidation, our Parent is expected to hold at least 80% of our common stock.\nThus, our ability to raise additional capital by issuing stock to third parties will be limited. See “—Our Parent's continued ownership of at least\n80% of our common stock may limit our ability to raise additional capital by issuing common stock to third parties.”\nCRT transactions may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses.\nAs part of our overall risk and capital management strategy, we use CRT transactions. These transactions enable our mortgage\ninsurance business to transfer risks in exchange for some of the associated economic benefits and, as a result, improve our PMIERs and\nother regulatory RTC measurements and manage risk to within our anticipated tolerance level.

For example,\nCRT transactions were more costly to obtain following the economic downturn caused by COVID-19 and ILN pricing remains elevated. In the\nfuture, we may be unable to obtain new transactions on acceptable terms or at all. Absent the availability and affordability to enter into new\nCRT transactions, our ability to obtain PMIERs or statutory credit for new transactions could be adversely impacted or could require us to\nmake capital contributions to maintain regulatory capital requirements. See “—If we are unable to continue to meet the requirements\nmandated by PMIERs, the GSE Restrictions and any additional restrictions imposed on us by the GSEs, we may not be eligible to write new\ninsurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.”\nAdditionally, many of the CRT transactions we execute expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparties or a change in\ncollateral value. For instance, traditional reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders, even when the reinsurer is\nliable to us. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. We cannot be sure that our reinsurers will pay amounts owed to us\nnow or in the future or that they will pay these amounts on a timely basis. A reinsurer’s insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make\npayments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of\noperations. Collateral is often posted by the counterparty to offset this risk; however, we bear the risk that the collateral declines in value or\notherwise is inadequate to fully compensate us in the event of a default.\nAdverse rating agency actions may result in a loss of business and adversely affect our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nFinancial strength ratings, which various rating agencies publish as measures of an insurance company’s ability to meet obligations, are\nimportant to maintaining public confidence in our mortgage insurance coverage and our competitive position. In assigning financial strength\nratings, we believe the rating agencies consider several factors, including but not limited to, the adequacy of the mortgage insurer’s capital to\nwithstand high claim scenarios, a mortgage insurer’s historical and projected operating performance, a mortgage insurer’s enterprise risk\nmanagement framework, parent company financial strength, business outlook, competitive position, management and corporate strategy.\nThe rating agency issuing the financial strength rating can withdraw or change its rating at any time.\nUnder PMIERs, the GSEs require maintenance of at least one rating with a rating agency acceptable to the respective GSEs. The\ncurrent PMIERs do not include a specific ratings requirement with respect to eligibility, but if this were to change in the future, we may\nbecome subject to a ratings requirement in order to retain our eligibility status under PMIERs. Ratings downgrades that result in our inability\nto insure new mortgage loans sold to the GSEs, or the transfer by the GSEs of our existing policies to an alternative mortgage insurer, would\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial strength ratings are relatively consistent with our competitors. However, any assigned financial strength rating that is below\nour peers, a downgrade in our financial strength ratings, or the announcement of a potential downgrade could hinder our competitiveness in\nthe marketplace and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition in many ways,\nincluding: (i) increasing scrutiny of us and our financial condition by the GSEs and/or our customers, potentially resulting in a decrease in the\namount of our NIW or, in the most severe case, the cessation of writing new business altogether, or limiting the business opportunities we are\npresented with and (ii) requiring us to reduce the premiums that we charge for mortgage insurance or introduce new products and services in\norder to remain competitive. Further, our relationships with our customers may be adversely affected by the ratings assigned to our Parent or\nits other operating subsidiaries, which may be impacted by factors such as any risk or perceived risk regarding our Parent’s liquidity and its\n(or its affiliates) ability to meet obligations as they become due, and which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.

Rating agencies may review the ratings assigned to us due to\ndevelopments that are beyond our control and any anticipated positive changes in ratings, may never develop or be realized.\nWe compete with government-owned enterprises and GSEs, and this may put us at a competitive disadvantage on pricing and\nother terms and conditions.\nWe compete with the FHA and the VA, as well as certain local-and state-level housing finance agencies. Separately, the GSEs compete\nwith us through certain of their risk-sharing insurance programs. Those competitors may establish pricing terms and business practices that\nmay be influenced by motives such as advancing social housing policy or stabilizing the mortgage lending industry. Those motives may not\nbe consistent with maximizing return on capital or other profitability measures. In addition, those governmental enterprises typically do not\nhave the same capital requirements or costs of capital that we and other mortgage insurance companies have and therefore may have\nfinancial flexibility in their pricing and capacity that could put us at a competitive disadvantage. In the event that a government-owned\nenterprise or GSE in one of our markets determines to change prices significantly or alter the terms and conditions of its mortgage insurance\nor other credit enhancement products in furtherance of social or other goals rather than a profit or risk management motive, we may be\nunable to compete in that market effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.

If we or our investment\nmanagers improperly structure our investments to meet those future liabilities or we have unexpected losses, including losses resulting from\nthe forced liquidation of investments before their maturity, we may be unable to meet those obligations. Our investments and investment\npolicies are subject to state insurance laws, which results in our portfolio being predominantly limited to highly rated fixed income securities.\nAs interest rates have risen, this has led to a significant increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. While we have the intent\nand ability to hold those securities until maturity, changing conditions requiring the sale of these investments could adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. See “—Interest rates and changes in rates, including changes in monetary\npolicy to combat inflation, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.”\nWe report fixed maturity securities at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets.

Without reliable, consistent third-party servicing, we may be unable to\nreceive and process payments on insured loans and/or properly recognize and establish reserves on loans when a delinquency exists or\noccurs but is not reported to us. In addition, if these servicers fail to limit and mitigate losses when appropriate, our losses may unexpectedly\nincrease. The current economic environment may significantly impair the financial condition and liquidity of mortgage servicers who are\nrequired to advance principal, interest and tax payments to mortgage investors during borrower mortgage forbearance periods.\nIn recent years, the number of non-bank mortgage loan servicers has increased as the mortgage lending and mortgage loan servicing\nindustries have come under increasing regulation and scrutiny. Significant, sustained failures by large servicers or other disruptions in the\nservicing of mortgage loans may damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny\nand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInadequate staffing levels could lead to disruptions in the servicing of mortgage loans, which in turn may contribute to a rise in\ndelinquencies and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. High delinquency rates\ncould also strain the resources of servicers, reducing their ability to undertake mitigation efforts that would help limit losses.\nFurthermore, we have delegated to the GSEs, which have in turn delegated to most of their servicers, the authority to accept\nmodifications, short sales and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure on loans we insure. Servicers are required to operate under protocols established\nby the GSEs in accepting these loss mitigation alternatives. We depend on servicers in making these decisions and mitigating our exposure\nto losses. In some cases, loss mitigation decisions favorable to the GSEs may not be favorable to us and may increase the incidence of paid\nclaims. Inappropriate delegation protocols or failure of servicers to service in accordance with the protocols may increase the magnitude of\nour losses and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our delegation of loss mitigation\ndecisions to the GSEs is subject to cancellation, but exercise of our cancellation rights may have an adverse effect on our relationship with\nthe GSEs and customers.\n52"

      "text": "Our delegated underwriting program may subject our mortgage insurance business to unanticipated claims.\nWe enter into agreements with our customers that commit us to insure loans made by them using our pre-established guidelines for\ndelegated underwriting. Delegated underwriting represented 71% and 65% of our total NIW by loan count for the years ended December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively. Once we accept a customer into our delegated underwriting program, we generally insure a loan originated by\nthat customer without validating the accuracy of the data submitted by the customer, investigating the loan file for fraud, or confirming that the\ncustomer followed our pre-established guidelines for delegated underwriting. See “Business—Underwriting.” Under this program, a customer\ncould commit us to insure a material number of loans that would fail our pre-established guidelines for delegated underwriting but pass our\nmodel and certain gating criteria before we discover the problem and terminate that customer’s delegated underwriting authority. Although\ncoverage on such loans may be rescindable or otherwise limited under the terms of our master policies, the burden of establishing the right\nto rescind or deny coverage lies with the insurer. To the extent that our customers exceed their delegated underwriting authorities, our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nPotential liabilities in connection with our contract underwriting services could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nWe offer contract underwriting services to certain of our customers, pursuant to which our employees and contractors work directly with\nthe customer to determine whether the data relating to a borrower and a proposed loan contained in a mortgage loan application file\ncomplies with the customer’s loan underwriting guidelines or the investor’s loan purchase requirements. In connection with that service, we\nalso compile the application data and submit it to the automated underwriting systems of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which independently\nanalyze the data to determine if the proposed loan complies with their investor requirements.\nUnder the terms of our contract underwriting agreements, we agree to indemnify the customer against losses incurred if we make\nmaterial errors in determining whether loans processed by our contract underwriters meet specified underwriting or purchase criteria, subject\nto contractual limitations on liability. As a result, we assume credit and processing risk in connection with our contract underwriting services. If\nour reserves for potential claims in connection with our contract underwriting services are inadequate as a result of differences from our\nestimates and assumptions or other reasons, we may be required to increase our underlying reserves, which could materially adversely\naffect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe premiums we agree to charge for our mortgage insurance coverage may not adequately compensate us for the risks and costs\nassociated with the coverage we provide.\nWe establish premium rates for the duration of a mortgage insurance certificate upon issuance, and we cannot adjust the premiums after\na certificate is issued. As a result, we cannot offset the impact of unanticipated claims with premium increases on coverage in-force. Our\npremium rates vary with the perceived risk of a claim and prepayment on the insured loan and are developed using models based on our\nlong-term historical experience, which takes into account a number of factors including, but not limited to, the LTV ratio, whether the\nmortgage provides for fixed payments or variable payments, the term of the mortgage, the borrower’s credit history, the borrower’s income\nand assets, and home price appreciation. See “—If the models used in our business are inaccurate or there are differences and/or variability\nin loss development compared to our model estimates and actuarial assumptions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.” In the event the premiums we charge for our mortgage insurance coverage may not adequately\ncompensate us for the risks and costs associated with the coverage, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperation and financial condition.\n53"

Factors that could lead to a decrease in the volume of Low\nDown Payment Loan originations include, but are not limited to:\n•\nan increase in home mortgage interest rates\n•\nlimitations on the tax benefits of home ownership and mortgage interest;\n•\nimplementation of more rigorous mortgage lending regulation, such as under the Dodd-Frank Act;\n•\na decline in economic conditions generally, or in conditions in regional and local economies;\n•\nevents outside of our control, including natural and man-made disasters and pandemics adversely affecting housing markets and\nhome buying;\n•\nthe level of consumer confidence, which may be adversely affected by economic instability, war or terrorist events;\n•\nan increase in the price of homes relative to income levels;\n•\na lack of housing supply at lower home prices;\n•\nadverse population trends, including lower homeownership rates;\n•\nhigh rates of home price appreciation, which for refinancings affect whether refinanced loans have LTV ratios that require mortgage\ninsurance; and\n•\nchanges in government housing policy encouraging loans to FTHBs.\nA decline in the volume of Low Down Payment Loan originations would reduce the demand for mortgage insurance and, therefore, could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “—A deterioration in economic conditions, a\nsevere recession or a decline in home prices, all of which could be driven by many potential factors, including inflation, may adversely affect\nour loss experience.”\nIn addition, a significant percentage of the premiums we earn each year are renewal premiums from mortgage insurance coverage\nwritten in previous years. We estimate that approximately 90% of our gross premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2022 were\nrenewal premiums compared to approximately 84% and 85% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As a result, the\nlength of time insurance remains in-force is an important determinant of our mortgage insurance revenues. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and\nmany other mortgage investors generally permit a borrower to ask the loan servicer to cancel the borrower’s obligation to pay for mortgage\ninsurance when the principal amount of the mortgage falls below 80% of the home’s value. Furthermore, HOPA provides a right for a\nborrower, so long as the borrower meets other criteria, to request cancellation of private mortgage insurance from their lender either on the\ndate the LTV ratio of the mortgage is first scheduled to reach 80% of its original value or the date on which the LTV ratio of the mortgage\nreaches 80% of the original value based on actual payments. Likewise, under HOPA, there is an obligation for lenders to automatically\nterminate a borrower’s obligation to pay for mortgage insurance coverage once the LTV ratio reaches 78% of the original value. Factors that\ntend to reduce the length of time our mortgage insurance remains in-force include:\n•\ndeclining interest rates, which may result in the refinancing of the mortgages underlying our mortgage insurance coverage with new\nmortgage loans that may not require mortgage insurance or that we do not insure;\n54"

State insurance laws\nregulate most aspects of our business, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they\nare domiciled and licensed. Failure to comply with applicable regulations or to obtain or maintain appropriate authorizations or exemptions\nunder any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to conduct business or engage in activities regulated in one or more\njurisdictions in which we operate and could subject us to fines, injunctions and other sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the nature and extent of regulation could materially change, which\nmay result in additional costs associated with compliance with any such changes, or changes to our operations that may be necessary to\ncomply, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business.

Further, we could become subject to future legislation or regulatory\nrequirements related to climate change.\nWe face the risk of litigation and regulatory investigations or other actions in the ordinary course of operating our business, which may\nresult in financial losses, injunctions, or harm to our reputation.\nMortgage insurers have been involved in litigation alleging violations of Section 8 of RESPA or related state anti-inducement laws and\nthe notice provisions of the FCRA. Among other things, Section 8 of RESPA generally precludes mortgage insurers from paying referral fees\nto mortgage lenders for the referral of mortgage insurance business. This limitation also can prohibit providing services or products to\nmortgage lenders free of charge, charging fees for services that are lower than their reasonable or fair market value, and paying fees for\nservices that mortgage lenders provide that are higher than their reasonable or fair market value, in exchange for the referral of mortgage\ninsurance business. Various regulators, including the CFPB, state insurance commissioners and state attorneys general may bring actions\nseeking various forms of relief in connection with alleged violations of the referral fee limitations of RESPA, as well as by private litigants in\nclass actions. The insurance law provisions of many states also prohibit or restrict paying for the referral of insurance business and provide\nvarious mechanisms to enforce this prohibition.\nIn addition, the use by the private mortgage insurance industry of risk-based pricing systems that establish premium rates based on more\nattributes than previously considered may result in increased state and/or federal scrutiny of premium rates. The increased use of algorithms,\nartificial intelligence and data and analytics in the mortgage insurance industry may also lead to additional regulatory scrutiny related to other\nmatters such as discrimination in pricing and underwriting, data privacy and access to insurance.\nA substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition. It is possible that we could become subject to future investigations, regulatory actions, lawsuits, or\nenforcement actions, which could cause us to incur legal costs and, if we were found to have violated any laws or regulations, require us to\npay fines and damages, result in injunctions and incur other sanctions, perhaps in material amounts. Increased regulatory scrutiny and any\nresulting investigations or legal proceedings could result in new legal precedents and industry-wide regulations or practices that could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation,\nregulatory action or investigation, we could suffer significant reputational harm and incur significant legal expenses, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any future\ninvestigations, regulatory actions or legal proceedings.\nInability to maintain sufficient regulatory capital could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our doing business or impact our\nfinancial strength ratings which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nWe are required by certain states and other regulators to maintain certain RTC ratios. In addition, PMIERs include financial requirements\nfor mortgage insurers to do business with the GSEs under which a mortgage insurer’s “Available Assets” (generally only the most liquid\nassets of an insurer) must meet or exceed “Minimum Required Assets” (which are based on an insurer’s RIF and are calculated from tables\nof factors with several risk dimensions and are subject to a floor amount). The failure of our insurance subsidiaries to meet their regulatory\nrequirements, and additionally the current PMIERs financial requirements on our principal operating subsidiary, could limit our ability to write\nnew business.\nIf we fail to maintain the required minimum capital level in a state where we write business, we would generally be required to\nimmediately stop writing new business in the state until we re-establish the required level of capital or receive a waiver of the requirement\nfrom the state’s insurance regulator, or until we have established an alternative source of underwriting capacity acceptable to the regulator.\nAs of\n57"

However, there can be no assurance if, and on what terms, such forbearance and approvals may be\nobtained.\nThe NAIC established the MGIWG to determine and make recommendations to the NAIC’s Financial Condition Committee as to what, if\nany, changes to make to the solvency and other regulations relating to mortgage guaranty insurers. The MGIWG continues to work on\nrevisions to the MGI Model and revisions to Statement of Statutory Accounting Principles No. 58—Mortgage Guaranty Insurance. It also\nimplemented a mortgage guaranty supplemental filing in 2021. In September 2022, the MGIWG released a revised exposure draft of the\nrevised MGI Model. The proposed amendments of the MGI Model are expected to be finalized by the MGIWC in the Spring of 2023. The\nMGIWC has also worked towards developing a mortgage guaranty capital model. We cannot predict the outcome of this work, whether any\nstate will adopt the amended MGI Model or any of its specific provisions, the effect changes, if any, will have on the mortgage guaranty\ninsurance market generally, or on our business specifically, the additional costs associated with compliance with any such changes, or any\nchanges to our operations that may be necessary to comply, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition. We also cannot predict whether other regulatory initiatives will be adopted or what impact, if any, such\ninitiatives, if adopted as laws, may have on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries are significantly influenced by their statutory surplus amounts,\nstatutory contingency reserve amounts and capital adequacy ratios. The statutory capital adequacy ratio is known as the RTC ratio, of which\nthe numerator consists of RIF and the denominator consists of the sum of (i) statutory surplus and (ii) the statutory contingency reserve. In\nany particular year, statutory surplus amounts, statutory contingency reserve amounts, and the RTC ratio may increase or decrease\ndepending on a variety of factors, most of which are outside of our control, including, but not limited to, the following:\n•\nthe amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries (which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit\nmarket conditions);\n•\nthe amount of insurance we onboard;\n•\nthe amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth;\n•\nchanges in statutory accounting or reserve requirements applicable to our insurance subsidiaries;\n•\nour ability to access capital markets to provide reserve and surplus relief;\n•\nchanges in equity market levels;\n•\nthe value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio;\n•\nchanges in the credit ratings of investments held in our portfolio;\n•\nthe value of certain derivative instruments;\n•\nchanges in interest rates;\n•\ncredit market volatility; and\n•\nchanges to the maximum permissible RTC ratio.\nAn adverse change in our RTC ratio or our ability to meet other minimum regulatory requirements could cause rating agencies to\ndowngrade our financial strength ratings, which could have an adverse\n58"

For further\ndiscussion on the importance of ratings, see “—Adverse rating agency actions may result in a loss of business and adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.”\nThese regulations are principally designed for the protection of policyholders rather than for the benefit of investors. Any proposed or\nfuture legislation or NAIC initiatives, if adopted, may be more restrictive on our ability to conduct business than current regulatory\nrequirements or may result in higher costs or increased statutory capital and reserve requirements. Further, because laws and regulations\ncan be complex and sometimes inexact, there is also a risk that any particular regulator’s or enforcement authority’s interpretation of a legal,\naccounting or reserving issue may change over time to our detriment or expose us to different or additional regulatory risks. The application\nof these regulations and guidelines by insurers involves interpretations and judgments that may differ from those of state insurance\ndepartments. We cannot provide assurance that such differences of opinion will not result in regulatory, tax or other challenges to the actions\nwe have taken to date. The result of those potential challenges could require us to increase levels of statutory capital and reserves or incur\nhigher operating costs and/or have implications on certain tax positions.\nChanges in regulations that adversely affect the mortgage insurance markets in which we operate could affect our operations\nsignificantly and could reduce the demand for mortgage insurance.\nIn addition to the general regulatory risks that are described under “—Our business is extensively regulated and changes in regulation\nmay reduce our profitability and limit our growth,” we are also affected by various additional regulations relating particularly to our mortgage\ninsurance operations.\nFederal and state regulations affect the scope of our competitors’ operations, which influences the size of the mortgage insurance market\nand the intensity of the competition. This competition includes not only other private mortgage insurers, but also federal and state\ngovernmental and quasi-governmental agencies, principally the FHA and the VA, which are governed by federal regulations. Increases in the\nmaximum loan amount that the FHA can insure, and reductions in the mortgage insurance premiums the FHA charges, including a potential\n25 basis point reduction, can reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance. Decreases in the maximum loan amounts the GSEs will\npurchase or guarantee, increases in GSE fees or decreases in the maximum LTV ratio for loans the GSEs will purchase can also reduce\ndemand for private mortgage insurance. See “—Changes to the charters or practices of the GSEs, including actions or decisions to decrease\nor discontinue the use of mortgage insurance, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.” Legislative,\nregulatory and administrative changes could cause demand for private mortgage insurance to decrease.\nAdditionally, on December 17, 2020, the FHFA promulgated the Enterprise Capital Framework, which imposes a new capital framework\non the GSEs, including risk-based and leverage capital requirement and capital buffers in excess of regulatory minimums that can be drawn\ndown in periods of financial distress. The Enterprise Capital Framework became effective on February 16, 2021. However, the GSEs will not\nbe subject to any requirement under the Enterprise Capital Framework until the applicable compliance date. Compliance with the Enterprise\nCapital Framework, other than the requirements to maintain a PCCBA and a PLBA, is required on the later of (i) the date of termination of the\nconservatorship of a GSE and (ii) any later compliance date provided in a consent order or other transition order applicable to such GSE.\nFHFA contemplates that the compliance dates for the PCCBA and the PLBA will be the date of termination of the conservatorship of a GSE.\nThe Enterprise Capital Framework’s advanced approaches requirements will be delayed until the later of (i) January 1, 2025 and (ii) any later\ncompliance date provided by a transition order applicable to such GSE. The Enterprise Capital Framework significantly increases capital\nrequirements and reduces capital credit on CRT transactions as compared to the previous framework.

Furthermore, higher GSE capital requirements could ultimately lead to\nincreased costs to borrowers for GSE loans, which in turn could shift the market away from the GSEs to the FHA or lender portfolios. Such a\nshift could result in a smaller market size for private mortgage insurance. This rule could also accelerate the recent diversification of the\nGSE’s risk transfer programs to encompass a broader array of instruments beyond private for mortgage insurance, which could adversely\nimpact our business. Also, in preparation for the end of the FHFA’s conservatorship of the GSEs, the FHFA promulgated a final rule on May\n4, 2021, effective July 6, 2021, that requires the GSEs to develop plans that would facilitate their rapid and orderly resolution in the event\nFHFA is appointed as their receiver.\nAs a credit enhancement provider in the residential mortgage lending industry, we are also subject to compliance with or otherwise\nimpacted by various federal and state consumer protection and insurance laws, including RESPA, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (the “Fair\nHousing Act”), HOPA, the FCRA and others. Among other things, these laws: (i)  prohibit payments for referrals of settlement service\nbusiness, providing services to lenders for no or reduced fees or payments for services not actually performed; (ii) require cancellation of\ninsurance and refund of unearned premiums under certain circumstances; and (iii) govern the circumstances under which companies may\nobtain and use consumer credit information. Changes in these laws or regulations, changes in the appropriate regulator’s interpretation of\nthese laws or regulations or heightened enforcement activity could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nDodd-Frank Act Risk Retention\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also requires an originator or issuer to retain a specified percentage of the credit risk exposure on securitized\nmortgages that do not meet the definition of a QRM.\nAs required by the Dodd-Frank Act, in 2015 the Federal Banking Agencies, the FHFA, the SEC and HUD adopted a joint final rule\nimplementing the QRM rules that aligns the definition of a QRM with that of a QM. In December 2019, the Federal Banking Agencies initiated\na review of certain provisions of the risk retention rule, including the QRM definition. Among other things, the review allows the Federal\nBanking Agencies to consider the QRM definition in light of any changes to the QM definition under the QM Rule adopted by the CFPB,\nwhich would include the final rule promulgated by the CFPB on December 29, 2020. If the QRM definition is changed in a manner that is\nunfavorable to us, such as to require a large down payment for a loan to qualify as a QRM, without giving consideration to mortgage\ninsurance in computing LTV ratios, the attractiveness of originating and securitizing loans with lower down payments may be reduced, which\nmay adversely affect the future demand for mortgage insurance.\nIn addition, if international banking standards set forth by the Basel Committee are implemented in the United States, without\nmodification by the Federal Banking Agencies (as defined below), the rules could discourage the use of mortgage insurance in the United\nStates.\nBasel III\nIn 1988, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”), developed the Basel Capital Accord (“Basel I”), which\nsets out international benchmarks for assessing banks’ capital adequacy requirements. In 2005, the Basel Committee issued an update to\nBasel I (“Basel II”), which, among other things, sets forth capital treatment of mortgage insurance purchased and held on balance sheet by\nbanks in respect of their origination and securitization activities. Following the financial crisis of 2008, the Basel Committee made further\nrevisions to improve the quality and quantity of capital banking organizations hold through Basel III. The Federal Reserve, the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) (collectively, the “Federal Banking Agencies”)\nimplemented Basel III through the adoption of revisions to their regulatory capital rules (the “Basel III Rules”), which establish minimum RBC\nand leverage capital requirements for most United States banking organizations (although banking organizations with less than $10 billion in\ntotal assets may now choose\n60"

In December 2017, the Basel\nCommittee published final revisions to the Basel III capital framework (the “2017 Basel III Revisions”) that were generally targeted for\nimplementation by each participating country by January 1, 2023. Under these revisions to the international framework, banks using the\nstandardized approach to determine their credit risk may consider mortgage insurance in calculating the exposure amount for real estate but\nwill determine the risk-weight for residential mortgages based on the LTV ratio at loan origination, without consideration of mortgage\ninsurance. Under the standardized approach, after the appropriate risk-weight is determined, the existence of mortgage insurance could be\nconsidered, but only if the company issuing the insurance has a lower risk-weight than the underlying exposure. Mortgage insurance issued\nby private companies would not meet this test. Therefore, under the 2017 Basel III Revisions, mortgage insurance could not mitigate credit\nand lower the capital charge under the standardized approach. It is possible that the Federal Banking Agencies could determine that their\ncurrent capital rules are at least as stringent as the 2017 Basel III Revisions, in which case no change would be mandated. However, if the\nFederal Banking Agencies decide to implement the 2017 Basel III Revisions as specifically drafted by the Basel Committee, mortgage\ninsurance would not lower the LTV ratio of residential loans for capital purposes, and therefore may decrease the demand for mortgage\ninsurance.\nFurther, it is possible (but not mandated by the 2017 Basel III Revisions) that the Federal Banking Agencies and the GSEs might likewise\ndiscontinue taking mortgage insurance into account when determining a mortgage’s LTV ratio for prudential (non-capital) purposes.\nRisks Relating to Our Continuing Relationship with Our Parent\nOur Parent has the ability to exert significant influence over us and our corporate decisions.\nOur Parent continues to beneficially own at least 80% of our common stock. As a result, our Parent controls all matters requiring a\nstockholder vote, including: the election of directors; mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; the sale of all or substantially all of our assets\nand other decisions affecting our capital structure; the amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended\nand restated bylaws; and our winding up and dissolution. This concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be\nfavored by our other stockholders. The interests of our Parent may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other\nstockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of us. Our\nParent’s high ownership percentage risk may also impact our stock price as price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading\nvolume of shares of our common stock are low.\nAlso, our Parent may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in us, but which might\ninvolve risks to our other stockholders or adversely affect us or our other stockholders. However, any dividends or other capital transactions\nmust be approved by our Independent Capital Committee, which is composed entirely of independent directors. We also have entered into a\nregistration rights agreement with our Parent, which will give our Parent a right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale\nof our common stock beneficially owned by our Parent.\nSo long as our Parent continues to beneficially own more than 50% of our outstanding common stock, our Parent will have certain rights,\nincluding the right to nominate the majority of our directors. Certain of these directors may also be officers or employees of our Parent or\ncertain of our Parent’s other subsidiaries. Because of their current or former positions with our Parent or certain of our Parent’s other\nsubsidiaries, these directors, as well as a number of our officers, own substantial amounts of our Parent’s\n61"

Disagreements regarding the rights and obligations of our Parent or certain of our\nParent’s other subsidiaries or us under each of these agreements or any renegotiation of their terms could create conflicts of interest for\ncertain of these directors and officers, as well as actual disputes that may be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us and our other\nstockholders.

If our Parent or certain of our Parent’s other subsidiaries cease to provide\nservices pursuant to the terms of our existing agreements, our costs of procuring services from third parties may increase. As a standalone\ncompany, we may be unable to obtain such goods and services at comparable prices or on terms as favorable as those provided by our\nParent, either of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

These aspects are inherently difficult to interpret and apply, and the Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue\nService (the “IRS”) and other standard-setting bodies could interpret these aspects differently than us. In addition, these departments could\nissue guidance on how provisions of tax regulations should be applied or administered that could be different from our interpretation.\nTherefore, even though we believe we have applied tax laws and regulations appropriately in our financial statements it is possible that we\nhave interpreted the rules differently and therefore applied the impacts to our financial results in a way that differs from those of these\nauthoritative bodies. Likewise, changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax\nliability and results of operations or financial condition. Changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or\nthe economy may also impact our results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or\nregulations will not materially and/or adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing\ntax regulations and legislation. The ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial\nstatements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income (loss), cash flows or operations.\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. federal government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) which, among other things, implements a\n15% corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) based on adjusted financial statement income and imposes a 1% excise tax on corporate\nstock repurchases. The effective date of these provisions is January 1, 2023. We do not expect the enactment of the CAMT to have a\nmaterial impact on our financial statements as we do not expect to be an applicable corporation in 2023. The US Treasury Department is\nexpected to issue guidance throughout 2023 that may differ from our interpretations and assumptions and that could alter our determination.\nAny excise tax incurred on our share repurchases will generally be recognized as part of the cost basis of the treasury stock acquired and will\nnot be reported as part of income tax expense. There was no U.S. federal income tax-related legislation or administrative guidance issued in\n2021 that had a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are jointly and severally liable for any U.S. federal income taxes owed by the Genworth Consolidated Group for taxable periods\nin which we are a member of the group.\nWe currently join in the filing of a United States consolidated income tax return of which our Parent is the common parent (the “Genworth\nConsolidated Group”) with our other insurance and non-insurance affiliates. As a result, we are jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal\nincome taxes owed by the group for periods in which we are a member of the group. Accordingly, for any taxable periods for which we are\nincluded in the Genworth Consolidated Group for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be liable in the event that any income tax\nliability was incurred but was not discharged by the Parent or any other member of the group.

As a consequence, we will pay our Parent our share of the\nconsolidated income tax liability when we have taxable income or receive benefit for losses we contribute and which are utilized to the\nGenworth Consolidated Group.\nOur Parent and certain of its non-insurance subsidiaries expect to incur material federal income tax deductions in the future, primarily\nrelated to interest expense on third-party debt and expenses in respect of stewardship with respect to the enterprise and subsidiary\noperations. If we were to cease to be a member of the Genworth Consolidated Group, our income could no longer offset tax losses of other\nmembers of the Genworth Consolidated Group, and the Genworth Consolidated Group may not have sufficient taxable income from other\noperations to fully absorb the anticipated tax deductions of our Parent and its non-insurance subsidiaries, reducing the value of such tax\ndeductions to our Parent. Given that our Parent expects to incur federal income tax deductions for the foreseeable future, our Parent may\nfind it beneficial to retain at least 80% ownership of our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nAs a condition to us remaining a member of the Genworth Consolidated Group, our Parent generally must continue to own an amount of\nour stock which possesses at least 80% of the total voting power of our stock and has a value equal to at least 80% of the total value of our\nstock. For these purposes, the term “stock” does not include any stock that (i) is not entitled to vote; (ii) is limited and preferred as to\ndividends and does not participate in corporate growth to any significant extent; (iii) has redemption and liquidation rights which do not\nexceed the issue price of such stock (except for a reasonable redemption or liquidation premium) and (iv) is not convertible into another class\nof stock. Accordingly, while we will have the ability to raise additional capital through certain preferred stock or other means, we will be limited\nin our ability to raise additional capital by issuing common stock to third parties without leaving our Parent’s consolidated group, which our\nParent may not permit. We may also be limited pursuant to restrictions imposed by insurance regulators, GSEs and any limitations under\nintercompany agreements. This limitation on our ability to raise additional capital through the issuance of common stock could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we leave the Genworth Consolidated Group, we may be required to make payments under the Tax Allocation Agreement and\npotentially to pay more income tax in the future.\nWe are currently a member of the Genworth Consolidated Group, and we expect to continue to be a member as long as our Parent\ncontinues to own an amount of our stock which possesses at least 80% of the total voting power of our stock, and it has a value equal to at\nleast 80% of the total value of our stock. See “—Our Parent’s continued ownership of at least 80% of our common stock may limit our ability\nto raise additional capital by issuing common stock to third parties”. Our Parent may cease to own such amount of stock in the future and in\nthat event, we would cease to be a member of the Genworth Consolidated Group.\nIn the event we were to cease being a member of the Genworth Consolidated Group, we may be required to make a payment to our\nParent of $24.3 million for tax benefits related to foreign tax credits for which we received credit under the Tax Allocation Agreement, but\nwhich had not been utilized by the Genworth Consolidated Group at such time.

In addition, the tax consequences of any transaction between us and other members of the Genworth Consolidated\nGroup which were deferred under the consolidated return rules would likely be triggered, which could require us to make additional payments\nunder the Tax Allocation Agreement.\nIn addition, in the event we were to cease being a member of the Genworth Consolidated Group, we and our Parent would be subject to\nthe application of the “unified loss rules,” which may require us to pay more income tax in the future.

Our Parent could, at such time, elect to reduce its tax basis in our shares at such time to prevent such attribute reduction, although\nour Parent has not committed to do so.\nAt this time, we do not expect that the unified loss rules would cause a material reduction in the tax basis of our assets if we were to\ndepart the Genworth Consolidated Group. The application of the unified loss rules is complex, however, and will depend upon a number of\nfactual determinations that must be made at the time of such departure. Accordingly, no guarantee can be given that we would not be\nrequired to pay more income tax as a result of the application of the unified loss rules upon a deconsolidation. Such increased tax obligations\ncould have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are a holding company, and our only material assets are our equity interests in our subsidiaries. As a consequence, we depend\non the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments and distributions to us in order to meet our\nobligations.\nWe are a holding company with limited direct business operations. Our primary subsidiaries are insurance companies that own a large\nmajority of our assets and conduct substantially all of our operations. Dividends from our subsidiaries and permitted payments to us under\narrangements with our subsidiaries are our principal sources of cash to meet our obligations. These obligations include operating expenses\nand interest and principal on current and any future borrowings. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted by regulators\nto, pay dividends or make distributions to enable us to meet our obligations. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and legal and\ncontractual restrictions may also limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. If the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to\ndividends and other arrangements is insufficient to fund any of these obligations, or if a subsidiary is unable or unwilling to pay future\ndividends or distributions to us to meet our obligations, we may be required to raise cash through, among other things, incurring debt\n(including convertible or exchangeable debt), selling assets or issuing equity.\nThe payment of dividends and other distributions by our insurance subsidiaries is dependent on, among other things, their financial\ncondition and operating performance, corporate law restrictions, insurance laws and regulations and maintaining adequate capital to meet\nthe requirements mandated by PMIERs, including the GSE Restrictions. In general, dividends and distributions are required to be submitted\nto an insurer’s domiciliary department of insurance for review. In addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of dividends and\ndistributions, or other payments by the insurance subsidiaries (such as a payment under an agreement or for employee or other services,\nincluding expense reimbursements) if they determine that such payment could be adverse to policyholders. Courts typically grant regulators\nsignificant deference when considering challenges of an insurance company to a determination by insurance regulators to grant or withhold\napprovals with respect to dividends and other distributions. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that insurance regulators will approve\npayment of a dividend or distribution or other transfers of assets to us by our insurance subsidiaries.\nOur liquidity and capital position are highly dependent on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay future dividends and\ndistributions to us as anticipated. The evaluation of future dividend sources and our overall liquidity plans are subject to current and future\nmarket conditions, the regulatory landscape and business performance.\nOur business could be adversely impacted from deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nThe design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all\nerrors, misstatements or misrepresentations.

We face the risk of litigation and regulatory proceedings or other actions\nin the ordinary course of operating our business, including class action lawsuits. We are also subject to litigation arising out of our general\nbusiness activities such as our contractual and employment relationships. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory\nproceedings, we cannot determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of any such litigation or proceedings. A substantial legal liability or\ninjunction or a significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of\noperations. Moreover, even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation, regulatory proceeding or other action, we could suffer significant\nreputational harm and incur significant legal expenses and such litigation may divert management’s attention and resources, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in accounting and reporting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting\nbodies and insurance regulators could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. GAAP, which is periodically revised. Accordingly, from time to time, we are\nrequired to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (the “FASB”). We are also subject to reporting requirements from the SEC. It is possible that future accounting and\nreporting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our financial statements,\nincluding impacting the calculation of net earnings, stockholders’ equity and other relevant financial statement line items. The impact of\nchanges in accounting and reporting standards, particularly those that apply to insurance companies, cannot be predicted, but such changes\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, we may be unable to implement new accounting guidance or other proposals by the adoption date which\nwould materially adversely impact our business.

The frequency\nand severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters may be increased by the effects of climate change, which is resulting in an\nincrease in average global temperatures and rising sea levels. While mortgage insurance does not cover property damage, a natural or man-\nmade disaster or public health emergency, such as a pandemic, could disrupt our computer systems and our ability to conduct or process\nbusiness (including as a result of widespread absences of our employees) as well as lead to higher delinquency rates as borrowers who are\naffected by the disaster may be unable to meet their contractual obligations, such as mortgage payments on loans insured under our\nmortgage insurance coverage.

This may cause us to retain more risk than we otherwise\nwould retain and could negatively affect our compliance with the financial requirements of the PMIERs. The PMIERs require us to maintain\nsignificantly more “Minimum Required Assets” for delinquent loans than for performing loans; however, the increase in Minimum Required\nAssets is not as great for certain delinquent loans in areas that FEMA has declared major disaster areas. For example, in response to\nCOVID-19, the GSEs made temporary revisions to PMIERs in the PMIERs Amendment, providing relief on the risk-based required asset\namount factor for certain non-performing loans impacted by a COVID-19 hardship. See “—If we are unable to continue to meet the\nrequirements mandated by PMIERs, the GSE Restrictions and any additional restrictions imposed on us by the GSEs, we may not be eligible\nto write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations\nand financial condition.” An increase in delinquency notices resulting from a natural or man-made disaster or a pandemic/public health\nemergency may result in an increase in “Minimum Required Assets” and a decrease in the level of our excess “Available Assets” that is\ndiscussed in our risk factor titled “—Risks Relating to Regulatory Matters—Inability to maintain sufficient regulatory capital could result in\nrestrictions or prohibitions on our doing business or impact our financial strength ratings which could have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.”\nProvisions of state corporate and state insurance laws, of PMIERs and of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation\nand our amended and restated bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our\ncommon stock.\nState laws, PMIERs and provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may\ndelay, deter, prevent, or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. For example,\nsuch laws or provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock\noffered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect\nthe prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nThe insurance laws and regulations of the various states in which our insurance subsidiaries are organized may delay or impede a\nbusiness combination involving our company. State insurance laws prohibit an entity from acquiring control of an insurance company without\nthe prior approval of the domestic insurance regulator. Under most states’ statutes, an entity is presumed to have control of an insurance\ncompany if it owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of that insurance company or its parent company. In addition,\nPMIERs may delay or impede a business combination or change of control involving our company. PMIERs requires us to obtain the prior\nwritten approval of the GSEs before we permit a material change in, or acquisition of, control or beneficial ownership of our company or make\nchanges to our corporate or legal structure. These restrictions may delay, deter, or prevent a potential merger or sale of our company, even if\nour board of directors decides that it is in the best interests of stockholders for us to merge or be sold. These restrictions also may delay\nsales by us or acquisitions by third parties of our insurance subsidiaries.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that may have anti-takeover effects, such as\nprohibiting stockholders from calling special meetings of our stockholders\n70"

References to EHI, the “Company,” “we” or “our” herein are, unless the context otherwise requires, to EHI\non a consolidated basis.\nOverview of Business\nWe are a leading private mortgage insurance company, having served the United States housing finance market since 1981, and operate\nin all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Our mortgage insurance products provide credit protection to mortgage lenders, covering a\nportion of the unpaid principal balance of Low Down Payment Loans in the event of a default. We believe we have built a leading platform\nbased on long-tenured customer relationships, underwriting excellence and prudent risk and capital management practices. Our business\nobjective is to leverage our competitive strengths to drive market share, maintain our strong capitalization and strong earnings profile and\ndeliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders.\nWe generate revenues by providing mortgage credit protection to our customers in exchange for premiums, which we set based on our\nevaluation of the underlying risk we insure. Once the premium rate is established and coverage is activated, the premium rate remains\nunchanged for the first ten years of the policy; thereafter the premium rate resets to a lower rate used for the remaining life of the policy. In\ngeneral, we can only cancel coverage for a failure to pay premiums or at servicer direction when the borrowers achieve the required amount\nof home equity. Our premium rate is applied predominantly to the original loan balance to determine either a monthly payment that the lender\nadds to the borrower’s monthly loan payment or a single upfront payment made by either the borrower or lender at loan closing. The amount\nof premiums earned from our insurance portfolio and the timing of premium recognition are also affected by persistency rate, which we\nmeasure as the percentage of loans that remain on our books based on the annualized cancellations for the period.\nWe also employ a CRT program to transfer a portion of our risk through both traditional XOL reinsurance arrangements and the issuance\nof ILNs. In exchange, we cede a negotiated amount of our premiums to the reinsurers and ILN investors that participate in our CRT\ntransactions. Our net premiums earned (i.e., materially, the gross premiums charged less premiums ceded as part of our CRT program)\nrepresent the largest source of our revenues. Importantly, our CRT program helps to de-risk our operating model and spread the risk of loss\nacross our counterparties while also providing capital relief.\nWe also invest our premiums in high quality, predominantly fixed income assets with the primary business objectives of preserving\ncapital, generating investment income and maintaining sufficient liquidity to cover our operating expenses and pay future claims. The\ninvestment income generated through our investment portfolio is another significant source of our revenues.\nWe generate profits through collection of premiums and investment income less losses, operating expenses, interest expense and taxes.\nOur mortgage insurance coverage protects lenders against loss in the event of a borrower default by covering a portion of the outstanding\nprincipal balance of a loan. In the event of a borrower default, our coverage reduces and, in certain instances eliminates, losses to the\ninsured by transferring the covered portion of the economic loss to us. Borrower defaults are first reported to us as new delinquencies when\nthe borrower fails to make two consecutive monthly mortgage payments. Incurred losses are our estimate of future claims on these new\ndelinquencies as well as any change in the prior estimates for previously existing delinquencies. In addition, incurred losses include\nestimates of future claims on IBNR delinquencies. Our incurred losses are based on estimates of both the rate at which delinquencies will go\nto claim (i.e., claim rate) and the ultimate claim amount (i.e., claim severity). Claim frequency and severity estimates are established based\non historical experience focusing on certain delinquency and loan attributes that influence the probability and amount of ultimate claim. Our\nestimates of ultimate claim amounts for each delinquency include loss adjustment expense (“LAE”) that are costs incurred in the settlement\nof the claim process such as legal fees and costs to record, process and adjust claims. Incurred losses are generally affected by\nmacroeconomic conditions, borrower credit\n75"

The overall mortgage origination market is influenced by\nmacroeconomic factors such as the rate of economic growth, the unemployment rate, interest rates, home affordability, household savings\nrates, the inventory of unsold homes, demographics of potential homebuyers and credit availability. The mortgage origination market is also\ninfluenced by various legislative and regulatory actions and GSE programs and policies that impact the housing and mortgage finance\nindustries.\nPenetration\nThe penetration rate of private mortgage insurance is mainly influenced by the competitiveness of private mortgage insurance compared\nto alternative products for Low Down Payment Loans provided by government agencies (principally the FHA and the VA), portfolio lenders\nthat self-insure, reinsurers and capital market transactions designed to mitigate risk. In addition, the private mortgage insurance industry’s\npenetration rate is driven by the relative percentage of purchase mortgage originations versus refinances. Private mortgage insurance\npenetration tends to be significantly higher on new mortgages for purchased homes than on the refinance of existing mortgages, because\naverage LTV ratios are typically higher on home purchases and therefore are more likely to require mortgage insurance. Lastly, we believe\nthe penetration rate of private mortgage insurance is influenced by other factors, including lender preference, FHA competitiveness and risk\nappetite, loan limits, contractual terms including cancellability and loss mitigation practices.\nCredit and Regulatory Environment\nThe level of private mortgage insurance market penetration (“market penetration”) and eventual market size is affected in part by actions\ntaken by the GSEs and the United States government, including the FHA, the FHFA and Congress, that impact housing or housing finance\npolicy. In the past, these actions have included announced changes, or potential changes, to underwriting standards, FHA pricing, GSE\nguaranty fees and loan limits, as well as low down payment programs available through the FHA or GSEs.\nCompetition and Market Share\nCompetitors include other private mortgage insurers that are eligible to write business for the GSEs. We compete with other private\nmortgage insurers based on pricing, underwriting guidelines, customer relationships, service levels, policy terms, loss mitigation practices,\nperceived financial strength (including comparative credit ratings), reputation, strength of management, product features and technology\nease-of-use. We also compete with governmental agencies (principally the FHA and the VA) primarily based on price and underwriting\nguidelines.\nPricing is highly competitive in the mortgage insurance industry, with industry participants competing for market share, customer\nrelationships and overall value. Recent pricing trends have introduced an increasing number of loan, borrower, lender and property attributes,\nresulting in expanded granularity in pricing regimes and a shift from traditional published rate cards to dynamic pricing engines that better\nalign price and risk. Our proprietary risk-based pricing engine evaluates returns and volatility under both the PMIERs capital framework and\nour internal economic capital framework, which is sensitive to economic cycles and current housing market conditions. The model assesses\nthe performance of new\n76"

Refinancing volume, however, does\nnot follow a similar seasonal trend and instead is primarily influenced by interest rates, which can overwhelm typical seasonal trends.\nDelinquency performance (new delinquency formation and cure behavior) is generally favorable in the first and second quarters of the year.\nTherefore, we typically experience lower levels of losses resulting from favorable delinquency activity in the first and second quarters, as\ntypically compared to the third and fourth quarters.

NIW increases our IIF, premiums written\nand premiums earned. NIW is affected by the overall size of the mortgage origination market, the penetration rate of private mortgage\ninsurance into the overall mortgage origination market and our market share of the private mortgage insurance market.\nPricing\nOur pricing strategy is designed to charge premium rates commensurate with the underlying risk of each loan we insure. Our proprietary\nplatform provides us with a more flexible, granular and analytical approach to selecting and pricing risk. Using our platform, we can quickly\nchange price to modify our risk selection levels, respond to industry pricing trends or adjust to changing economic conditions. We believe that\nour platform, powered by our proprietary risk model and our understanding of mortgage risk volatility, provides us with a highly sophisticated\npricing regime that improves our risk selection and is designed to yield attractive risk adjusted returns through credit cycles.\nIIF\nIIF at the time of origination is used to determine premiums as the premium rate is expressed as a percentage of IIF. IIF is one of the\nprimary drivers of our future earned premium. Based on the composition of our insurance portfolio, with monthly premium policies comprising\na larger proportion of our total portfolio than single premium policies, an increase or decrease in IIF generally has a corresponding impact on\npremiums earned. Cancellations of our insurance policies as a result of prepayments and other reductions of IIF, such as rescissions of\ncoverage and claims paid, generally have a negative effect on premiums earned.\n77"

      "text": "Persistency Rate and Business Mix\nThe percentage of our IIF that remains insured after taking into account annualized cancellations for the period presented is defined as\nour persistency rate. Because our insurance premiums are earned over the life of a policy, higher or lower persistency rates can have a\nsignificant impact on our profitability. The rise of interest rates throughout 2022 has significantly increased persistency in the portfolio, but this\nimpact is partially offset by lower NIW.\nLoan prepayment speeds and the relative mix of business between single premium policies and monthly premium policies also impact\nour profitability. Assuming all other factors remain constant over the life of the policies, prepayment speeds have an inverse impact on IIF and\nthe expected premium from our monthly policies. Slower prepayment speeds, demonstrated by a higher persistency rate, result in IIF\nremaining in place, providing increased premium from monthly policies over time as premium payments continue. Earlier than anticipated\nprepayments, demonstrated by a lower persistency rate, reduce IIF and the premium from our monthly policies.\nThe following table presents the weighted average mortgage interest rate on outstanding primary IIF as of December 31, 2022, excluding\nour run-off business. Prepayment speeds may be affected by changes in interest rates, among other factors. An increasing interest rate\nenvironment generally will reduce refinancing activity and result in lower prepayments.

As of December 31,\n2022 and 2021, single premium policies comprised 12% and 13% of primary IIF, respectively.\nCredit Quality\nImproved analytics, stronger loan origination quality controls and the regulatory implementation of the QM Rule have resulted in a\nsignificant improvement in the credit quality for loans originated in the private mortgage insurance market over time. Additionally, private\nmortgage insurers and the GSEs have maintained strong credit standards over the past decade, with average FICO scores for NIW\npersisting at levels significantly above historical averages. As a result, the industry is insuring loans from borrowers who should be better\npositioned to meet their mortgage obligations. More recently, in response to FTHB\n(1)\n78"

Incurred losses depend to\na significant extent on the following factors:\n•\ndeterioration of regional or national economic conditions leading to a reduction in borrowers’ income and thus their ability to make\nmortgage payments;\n•\nlegislative, regulatory, FHFA or GSE action, or executive orders permitting or mandating forbearance or a moratorium on\nforeclosures or evictions due to events such as natural disasters or COVID-19;\n•\na drop in housing values that could expose us to greater loss on resale of properties obtained through foreclosure proceedings and\nan adverse change in the effectiveness of loss mitigation actions that could result in an increase in the frequency of expected claim\nrates;\n•\na drop in housing values that negatively impacts a borrower’s willingness to continue mortgage payments, potentially leading to\nhigher delinquencies and ultimately claims;\n•\nif the foreclosure occurs in a state that imposes judicial process, which generally increases the amount of time it takes for a\nforeclosure to be completed, which impacts severity of the claim;\n•\nthe credit characteristics in our in-force portfolio, as loans with higher risk characteristics generally result in more delinquencies and\nclaims;\n•\nthe size of loans we insure, as loans with relatively higher average loan amounts generally result in higher incurred losses;\n•\nthe coverage percentage on insured loans, as loans with higher percentages of insurance coverage generally correlate with higher\nincurred losses;\n•\nthe level and amount of reinsurance coverage maintained with third parties; and\n•\nthe distribution of claims over the life of a book. Historically, the first few years after origination have relatively low claims, with claims\nincreasing for several years subsequently and then declining. However, persistency, the condition of the economy, including\nunemployment and housing prices and other factors can affect this pattern.\n79"

      "text": "Credit Risk Transfer\nWe use CRT transactions to transfer a portion of our risk to third parties, through both traditional XOL reinsurance and the issuance of\nILNs. Our CRT program reduces the volatility of our in-force portfolio and provides capital relief under PMIERs. When we enter into a CRT\ntransaction, the reinsurer receives a premium and, in exchange, insures an agreed upon portion of incurred losses. These arrangements\nhave the impact of reducing our earned premiums but also provide capital relief under PMIERs in exchange for a negotiated ceded premium\nrate. Under certain stress scenarios, our incurred losses are also reduced by any incurred losses ceded in accordance with our reinsurance\nagreements.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses include costs related to the acquisition and ongoing maintenance of our insurance contracts, including sales,\nunderwriting and general operating costs. Acquisition expenses are influenced by the amount of our NIW. Acquisition costs that are related\ndirectly to the successful acquisition of new insurance policies, such as underwriting expenses, are deferred and amortized over the life of\nthe underlying insurance policies. These deferred acquisition costs are referred to as “DAC.” The ongoing maintenance expenses of our\ninsurance contracts are generally fixed in nature and include costs such as information technology, finance and legal, among others,\nincluding costs allocated from our Parent for certain activities on our behalf. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements regarding\nour related party transactions.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe accounting estimates (including sensitivities) discussed in this section are those that we consider to be particularly critical to an\nunderstanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our ability to judge\nthe effect of inherently uncertain matters on our financial results. The sensitivities included in this section involve matters that are also\ninherently uncertain and involve the exercise of significant judgment in selecting the factors and amounts used in the sensitivities. Small\nchanges in the amounts used in the sensitivities or the use of different factors could result in materially different outcomes from those\nreflected in the sensitivities. For all of these accounting estimates, we caution that future events seldom develop as estimated and\nmanagement’s best estimates often require adjustment.\nLoss Reserves\nLoss reserves represents the amount needed to provide for the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims relating to insured events that\nhave occurred on or before the end of the respective reporting period. The estimated liability includes requirements for future payments of:\n(a) losses that have been reported to the insurer; (b) losses related to insured events that have occurred but that have not been reported to\nthe insurer as of the date the liability is estimated; and (c) LAE. Loss adjustment expenses include costs incurred in the claim settlement\nprocess such as legal fees and costs to record, process and adjust claims. Consistent with U.S. GAAP and industry accounting practices, we\ndo not establish loss reserves for future claims on insured loans that are not in default or believed to be in default.\nEstimates and actuarial assumptions used for establishing loss reserves involve the exercise of significant judgment, and changes in\nassumptions or deviations of actual experience from assumptions can have material impacts on our loss reserves and net income (loss).\nBecause these assumptions relate to factors that are not known in advance, change over time, are difficult to accurately predict and are\ninherently uncertain, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments.\nThe sources of uncertainty affecting the estimates are numerous and include factors internal and external to us. Internal factors include, but\nare not limited to, changes in the mix of exposures, loss mitigation activities and claim settlement practices. Significant external influences\ninclude changes in home prices, unemployment, government housing policies, state foreclosure timeline, general economic conditions,\ninterest rates, tax policy, credit availability and mortgage products. Small changes in assumptions or small deviations of actual experience\nfrom\n80"

      "text": "assumptions can have, and in the past have had, material impacts on our reserves, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe establish reserves to recognize the estimated liability for losses and LAE related to defaults on insured mortgage loans. Loss\nreserves are established by estimating the number of loans in our inventory of delinquent loans that will result in a claim payment, which is\nreferred to as the claim rate, and further estimating the amount of the claim payment, which is referred to as claim severity. The estimates are\ndetermined using a factor-based approach, in which assumptions of claim rates for loans in default and the average amount paid for loans\nthat result in a claim are calculated using traditional actuarial techniques. Over time, as the status of the underlying delinquent loans moves\ntoward foreclosure and the likelihood of the associated claim loss increases, the amount of the loss reserves associated with the potential\nclaims may also increase.\nManagement monitors actual experience, and where circumstances warrant, will revise its assumptions. Our liability for loss reserves is\nreviewed regularly, with changes in our estimates of future claims recorded through net income. Estimation of losses is based on historical\nclaim and cure experience and covered exposures and is inherently judgmental. Future developments may result in losses greater or less\nthan the liability for loss reserves provided.\nLoss reserves as of December 31, 2022, were $519 million, a decrease of $122 million since December 31, 2021. In considering the\npotential sensitivity of the factors underlying management’s best estimate of our loss reserve, it is possible that even a relatively small\nchange in the estimated claim and severity rates could have a significant impact on loss reserves and, correspondingly, on results of\noperations. For example, based on our actual experience during the three-year period immediately preceding December 31, 2022, a change\nof 6 percentage points, or 15%, in the average claim rate would change the gross loss reserve amount for such quarter by approximately $80\nmillion. Likewise, a change of 6 percentage points, or a change of 5%, in the average severity rate would change the gross loss reserve\namount for such quarter by approximately $26 million.\nInvestments\nValuation of Fixed Maturity Securities\nOur portfolio of fixed maturity securities was valued at $4,885 million as of December  31, 2022, a decrease of $382 million from\nDecember 31, 2021.\nThe methodologies, estimates and assumptions used in valuing our fixed maturity securities evolve over time and are subject to different\ninterpretations, all of which can lead to materially different estimates of fair value. Additionally, because the valuation is based on market\nconditions at a specific point in time, the period-to-period changes in fair value may vary significantly due to changing interest rates, external\nmacroeconomic and credit market conditions. For example, widening credit spreads will generally result in a decrease, while tightening of\ncredit spreads will generally result in an increase, in the fair value of our fixed maturity securities. As well, during periods of increasing\ninterest rates, the market values of lower-yielding assets will decline. See “Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market\nRisk—Sensitivity Analysis—Interest Rate Risk” for the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our investments portfolio.\nOur portfolio of fixed maturity securities comprises primarily investment grade securities, which are carried at fair value. Estimates of fair\nvalues for fixed maturity securities are obtained primarily from industry-standard pricing methodologies utilizing market observable inputs. For\nour less liquid securities, such as our privately placed securities, we utilize independent market data to employ alternative valuation methods\ncommonly used in the financial services industry to estimate fair value. Based on the market observability of the inputs used in estimating the\nfair value, the pricing level is assigned.\n81"

Determining the value of the unrealized losses is dependent on the same methodologies and assumptions used in our valuation of\nfixed maturity securities. We also consider all available information relevant to the collectability of the security, including information about\npast events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, when developing the estimate of cash flows expected to be\ncollected. There is no recorded allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2022.\nSee Note 2 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses on fixed\nmaturity securities.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our insurance contracts have recurring monthly premiums. We recognize recurring premiums over the terms of the\nrelated insurance policy on a pro-rata basis. Premiums written on single premium policies and annual premium policies are initially deferred\nas unearned premium reserve and earned over the policy life. A portion of the revenue from single premium policies is recognized in\npremiums earned in the current period, and the remaining portion is deferred as unearned premiums and earned over the estimated\nexpiration of risk of the policy. If single premium policies are cancelled and the premium is non-refundable, then the remaining unearned\npremium related to each cancelled policy is recognized to earned premiums upon notification of the cancellation. For borrower-paid mortgage\ninsurance, coverage ceases at the earlier of prepayment, or when the original principal is amortized to a 78% loan-to-value ratio in\naccordance with the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998. Variation in cancellation rates and projected losses are inputs into our premium\nrecognition models, causing uncertainty within our estimates.\nWe periodically review our premium earnings recognition models with any adjustments to the estimates reflected as a cumulative\nadjustment on a retrospective basis in current period net income. These reviews include the consideration of recent and projected loss and\npolicy cancellation experience, and adjustments to the estimated earnings patterns are made, if warranted.\nUnearned premium was $203 million as of December 31, 2022, a decrease of $44 million compared to December 31, 2021. Changes in\nmarket conditions could cause a decline in mortgage originations, mortgage insurance penetration rates, persistency and our market share,\nall of which could impact new insurance written. For example, a decline in primary new insurance written of $1.0 billion would result in a\nreduction in earned premiums of approximately $3 million in the first full year. Likewise, if primary persistency rates declined on our existing\ninsurance in-force by 10%, earned premiums would decline by approximately $94 million during the first full year, partially offset by higher\npolicy cancellations in our single premium products. These reductions in earned premiums could be potentially offset by lower reserves due\nto policies no longer being in-force.\n82"

      "text": "Trends and Conditions\nDuring 2022, the United States and global economies experienced continued volatility due to high inflation, geopolitical uncertainty and\nsupply chain disruption. Inflationary pressures lessened in the latter half of 2022 but remain elevated, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics\nreporting in December that the Consumer Price Index was 6.5% year-over-year. As a result, the Federal Reserve has continued its\naggressive approach towards addressing inflation through interest rate increases and a reduction of its balance sheet. The Federal Reserve\napproved an interest rate increase of 0.25% in February 2023, following increases of 0.50% in December 2022, 0.75% in November,\nSeptember, July and June 2022, 0.50% in May 2022 and 0.25% in March 2022. Financial markets have reacted with increased volatility and\nrates have increased across the Treasury yield curve. The Federal Reserve has signaled that it may make additional interest rate increases\nto address persistent inflationary pressure.\nMortgage origination activity declined during 2022 in response to rising mortgage rates. If interest rates remain high, the refinance market\nis likely to remain depressed. Housing affordability was challenged in 2022 compared to recent years due to sharply increasing interest rates\nand elevated home prices, modestly offset by rising median family income according to the National Association of Realtors Housing\nAffordability Index. Year-over-year home price appreciation slowed through early 2022, and home prices declined during the second half of\nthe year, according to the FHFA Monthly Purchase-Only House Price Index.\nThe unemployment rate declined to 3.5% in December 2022 compared to 3.9% in December 2021, following a decline from its peak of\n14.8% in April 2020, bringing unemployment in line with the pre-COVID-19 level of 3.5% in February 2020. As of December 31, 2022, the\nnumber of unemployed Americans stands at approximately 5.7 million and the number of long term unemployed over 26 weeks was\napproximately 1.1 million. Both metrics remain relatively in line with February 2020 levels.\nFor mortgages insured by the federal government, including those purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, forbearance allows\nborrowers impacted by COVID-19 to temporarily suspend mortgage payments up to 18 months subject to certain limits. Currently, the GSEs\ndo not have a deadline for requesting an initial forbearance. Federal laws and regulations continue to require servicers to discuss loss\nmitigation options with borrowers before proceeding with foreclosures. These requirements could further extend the foreclosure timeline,\nwhich could negatively impact the severity of loss on loans that go to claim.\nAlthough it is difficult to predict the future level of reported forbearance and how many of the policies in a forbearance plan that remain\ncurrent on their monthly mortgage payment will go delinquent, servicer-reported forbearances have generally declined. As of December 31,\n2022, approximately 1.5%, or 14,270, of our active primary policies were reported in a forbearance plan. Of these policies in forbearance\nplans, approximately 36% were reported as delinquent at year end. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, often lead to temporary increases\nin delinquencies in forbearance. We experienced a small increase in delinquencies in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to the recent\nhurricane affecting the southeastern United States, but these did not have a material impact on reserves as of December 31, 2022. We will\ncontinue to monitor the affected areas and support the measures enacted by the GSEs allowing forbearance, restricting foreclosure actions\nand providing other forms of mortgage relief for those dealing with damage.\nTotal delinquencies decreased during 2022 as a result of cures outpacing new delinquencies. The annual new delinquency rate for 2022\nwas 3.8%, up slightly from 2021 but in line with historical pre-COVID-19 levels.\nThe full impact of COVID-19 and its ancillary economic effects on our future business results are difficult to predict. Given the maximum\nlength of forbearance plans, the resolution of a delinquency in a plan still may not be known for several quarters or longer. We continue to\nmonitor regulatory and government actions and the resolution of forbearance delinquencies. While the associated risks have\n83"

In June 2022, the FHFA announced the release of Fannie Mae’s and\nFreddie Mac’s respective Equitable Housing Finance Plans. The plans included many initiatives, including language discussing potential\nchanges that could impact the mortgage insurance industry. The plans are in their early stages, and we will continue to work with the FHFA,\nthe GSEs, and the broader housing finance industry as these proposals develop and to the extent they are implemented. We cannot predict\nwhether or when any new practices or programs will be implemented under the GSEs’ Equitable Housing Finance Plans or other affordability\ninitiatives, and if so in what form, nor can we predict what effect, if any, such practices or programs may have on our business, results of\noperations or financial condition.\nPrivate mortgage insurance market penetration and eventual market size are affected in part by actions that impact housing or housing\nfinance policy taken by the GSEs and the U.S. government, including but not limited to, the FHA and the FHFA. In the past, these actions\nhave included announced changes, or potential changes, to underwriting standards, including changes to the GSEs’ automated underwriting\nsystems, FHA pricing, GSE guaranty fees, loan limits and alternative products. On February 25, 2022, the FHFA finalized the rule for the\nEnterprise Capital Framework, which included technical corrections to its December 17, 2020 rule. Higher GSE capital requirements could\nlead to increased costs to borrowers of GSE loans, which in turn could shift the market away from the GSEs to the FHA or lender portfolios.\nSuch a shift could potentially result in a smaller market for private mortgage insurance.\nIn January 2022, the FHFA introduced new upfront fees for some high-balance and second-home loans sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac. Upfront fees for high balance loans increased between 0.25% and 0.75%, tiered by loan-to-value ratio. For second home loans, the\nupfront fees increased between 1.125% and 3.875%, also tiered by loan-to-value ratio. The new pricing framework became effective April 1,\n2022. To date, we have not experienced a significant impact to the mortgage insurance market or our projections based on this initiative.\nOn October 24, 2022, the FHFA announced two initiatives: 1) targeted changes to the GSEs’ guarantee fee pricing by eliminating upfront\nfees for certain borrowers and affordable mortgage products, while implementing targeted increases to the upfront fees for most cash-out\nrefinance loans; and 2) the validation and approval of both the FICO 10T credit score model and the VantageScore 4.0 credit score model for\nuse by the GSEs as well as changing the requirement that lenders provide credit reports from all three nationwide consumer reporting\nagencies and instead only require credit reports from two of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies.\nThe upfront fees are eliminated for certain first-time home buyers with income at or below area median income and certain other GSE\naffordable housing products. The fee reductions went into effect in the fourth quarter of 2022 while the new fees on cash-out refinance loans\nbegan February 1, 2023. We expect these price changes to be a net positive to the mortgage insurance market. The validation of the new\ncredit scores requires lenders to deliver both credit scores for each loan sold to the GSEs. There is currently no implementation deadline, but\nthis is expected to be a multiple year process that will require system and process updates along with coordination across stakeholders of the\nindustry.\nIn January 2023, the FHFA announced additional updates to its up-front fee structure and a recalibration and reformatting of their entire\npricing matrix. The changes marked the third iteration of FHFA’s ongoing pricing review since early last year and impact purchase and rate-\nterm refinance loans. Pricing grids are now broken out by loan purpose and are recalibrated to new credit score and loan-to-value ratio\ncategories along with associated loan attributes. The new pricing matrix also includes new up-front fees for loans with DTI ratios greater than\n40%. The changes are effective May 1, 2023. The effects of these changes will ultimately be dependent on any changes made by the FHA,\nbut we do not expect a significant impact to the private mortgage insurance market.\n84"

      "text": "On February 22, 2023, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced a 30-basis point reduction of the annual\ninsurance premium charged to borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages. This action is designed to reduce the cost of borrowing for lower- and\nmiddle-class homebuyers who are eligible for the federal program The price reduction is expected to have a negative impact on the private\nmortgage insurance market, but will be partially offset by the effects of the recent FHFA pricing changes referenced above. We do not believe\nthis net impact will be material.\nThe U.S. private mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive. Our market share is influenced by the execution of our go to market\nstrategy, including but not limited to, pricing competitiveness relative to our peers and our selective participation in forward commitment\ntransactions. We continue to manage the quality of new business through pricing and our underwriting guidelines, which are modified from\ntime to time when circumstances warrant. We see the market and underwriting conditions, including the pricing environment, as being within\nour risk-adjusted return appetite enabling us to write new business at attractive returns. Ultimately, we expect our new insurance written with\nits strong credit profile and attractive pricing to positively contribute to our future profitability and return on equity.\nNew insurance written of $66.5 billion in 2022 decreased 31% compared to 2021 primarily due to a smaller estimated private mortgage\ninsurance market in the current year as refinance and purchase originations were impacted by rising interest rates.\nOur largest customer accounted for 18% and 14% of our total NIW during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNo customer had earned premiums that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021.\nOur primary persistency rate increased to 80% during 2022 compared to 62% during 2021. The persistency rate increased throughout\n2022, with a rate in the fourth quarter of 86%. The increase in persistency was primarily driven by a decline in the percentage of our in-force\npolicies with mortgage rates above current mortgage rates as a result of the rising rate environment during 2022. Higher persistency\nimpacted business performance trends in several ways including, but not limited to, slowing the recognition of earned premiums due to single\npremium policy cancellations, slowing the amortization of our existing reinsurance transactions and reduction of their associated PMIERs\ncapital credit and shifting the concentration of our primary IIF by policy year. As of December 31, 2022, primary IIF had approximately 58%\nconcentration in 2022 and 2021 compared to 71% concentration in 2021 and 2020 as of December 31, 2021. Despite slower NIW\nproduction, our IIF grew $21.6 billion, or 10% in 2022, compared to $18.3 billion or 9% in 2021, driven by increased persistency.\nNet earned premiums declined in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily as a result of the lapse of older, higher priced policies and a decrease\nin single premium cancellations. This was partially offset by IIF growth. The total number of delinquent loans has declined from the COVID-19\npeak in the second quarter of 2020 as forbearance exits continue and new forbearances declined. During this time and consistent with prior\nyears, servicers continued the practice of remitting premiums during the early stages of default, and we refund the post-delinquent premiums\nto the insured party if the delinquent loan goes to claim. We record a liability and a reduction to net earned premiums for the post-delinquent\npremiums we expect to refund. The post-delinquent premium liability recorded since the beginning of COVID-19 in the second quarter of\n2020 through the fourth quarter of 2022 was not significant to the change in earned premiums for those periods as a result of the high\nconcentration of new delinquencies being subject to a servicer reported forbearance plan and the lower estimated rate at which\ndelinquencies go to claim for these loans.\nOur loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2022, was (10%) as compared to 13% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The\ndecrease was largely from favorable reserve adjustments in 2022. We released $314 million of reserves on delinquencies from prior years,\nprimarily related to favorable cure performance on COVID-19 delinquencies from 2020 and 2021. During the peak of COVID-19, we\nexperienced elevated new delinquencies subject to forbearance plans. Those delinquencies have continued to cure at levels above our\nreserve expectations, which led to the release of reserves in 2022.\n85"

      "text": "Due to uncertainty in the current economic environment, we increased the expected claim rate on new delinquencies throughout 2022. This\ncontributed to reserve strengthening of $46 million on previous quarter delinquencies in 2022 and increased the amount of reserves on new\ndelinquencies in the fourth quarter of 2022. These 2022 reserve adjustments compare to reserve releases of $22 million in 2021 related\nprimarily to pre-COVID-19 delinquencies.\nOur loss reserves continue to be impacted by COVID-19 and remain subject to uncertainty. Borrowers who have experienced a financial\nhardship including, but not limited to, the loss of income due to the closing of a business or the loss of a job, continue to take advantage of\navailable loss mitigation options including forbearance programs, payment deferral options and other modifications. Loss reserves recorded\non these delinquencies have a high degree of estimation due to the level of uncertainty regarding whether delinquencies in forbearance will\nultimately cure or result in claim payments as well as the timing and severity of those payments.\nThe severity of loss on loans that do go to claim may be negatively impacted by the extended forbearance and foreclosure timelines, the\nassociated elevated expenses and the higher loan amount of the recent new delinquencies. These negative influences on loss severity could\nbe mitigated, in part, by embedded home price appreciation. For loans insured on or after October 1, 2014, our mortgage insurance policies\nlimit the number of months of unpaid interest and associated expenses that are included in the mortgage insurance claim amount to a\nmaximum of 36 months.\nNew delinquencies in 2022 increased compared to 2021. Current period primary delinquencies of 35,996 contributed $171 million of loss\nexpense in 2022. We incurred $144 million of losses from 32,624 current period delinquencies in 2021. In determining the loss expense\nestimate, considerations were given to forbearance and non-forbearance delinquencies, recent cure and claim experience, and the prevailing\nand prospective economic conditions. Approximately 21% of our primary new delinquencies in 2022 were subject to a forbearance plan as\ncompared to 42% in 2021.\nEMICO’s risk-to-capital ratio under the current regulatory framework as established under North Carolina law and enforced by the\nNCDOI, EMICO’s domestic insurance regulator, was approximately 12.9:1 as of December 31, 2022 and 12.3:1 as of December 31, 2021.\nEMICO’s risk-to-capital ratio remains below the NCDOI’s maximum risk-to-capital ratio of 25:1. North Carolina’s calculation of risk-to-capital\nexcludes the risk-in-force for delinquent loans given the established loss reserves against all delinquencies. EMICO’s ongoing risk-to-capital\nratio will depend principally on the magnitude of future losses incurred by EMICO, the effectiveness of ongoing loss mitigation activities, new\nbusiness volume and profitability, the amount of policy lapses and the amount of additional capital that is generated or distributed by the\nbusiness.\nUnder PMIERs, we are subject to operational and financial requirements that private mortgage insurers must meet in order to remain\neligible to insure loans that are purchased by the GSEs. Since 2020, the GSEs have issued several amendments to PMIERs, which\nimplemented both permanent and temporary revisions.\nFor loans that became non-performing due to a COVID-19 hardship, PMIERs was temporarily amended with respect to each non-\nperforming loan that (i) had an initial missed monthly payment occurring on or after March 1, 2020, and prior to April 1, 2021, or (ii) is subject\nto a forbearance plan granted in response to a financial hardship related to COVID-19, the terms of which are materially consistent with\nterms of forbearance plans offered by the GSEs. The risk-based required asset amount factor for the non-performing loan is the greater of (a)\nthe applicable risk-based required asset amount factor for a performing loan were it not delinquent, and (b) the product of a 0.30 multiplier\nand the applicable risk-based required asset amount factor for a non-performing loan. In the case of (i) above, absent the loan being subject\nto a forbearance plan described in (ii) above, the 0.30 multiplier was applicable for no longer than three calendar months beginning with the\nmonth in which the loan became a non-performing loan due to having missed two monthly payments.

We understand that Genworth’s current plans do not include a potential sale in which Genworth owns less than\n80% of EHI. As of December 31, 2022, the balance of the 2025 Senior Notes proceeds required to be held by our holding company was\napproximately $203 million compared to $453 million of cash and invested assets held at EHI.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had estimated available assets of $5,206 million against $3,156 million net required assets under PMIERs\ncompared to available assets of $5,077 million against $3,074 million net required assets as of December 31, 2021. The sufficiency ratio as\nof December 31, 2022, was 165% or $2,050 million above the published PMIERs requirements, compared to 165% or $2,003 million above\nthe published PMIERs requirements as of December 31, 2021. PMIERs sufficiency is based on the published requirements applicable to\nprivate mortgage insurers and does not give effect to the GSE Restrictions imposed on our business. Credit risk transfer transactions\nprovided an aggregate of approximately $1,578 million of PMIERs capital credit as of December 31, 2022, compared to $1,404 million as of\nDecember 31, 2021. Our PMIERs required assets as of December 31, 2022, benefited from the application of a 0.30 multiplier applied to the\nrisk-based required asset amount factor for certain non-performing loans. The application of the 0.30 multiplier to all eligible delinquencies\nprovided $132 million of benefit to our December 31, 2022, PMIERs required assets. This amount is gross of any incremental reinsurance\nbenefit from the elimination of the 0.30 multiplier.\nOn July 21, 2022, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded the insurance financial strength rating of EMICO to Baa1 from Baa2. The\nincrease was driven by improvement in our overall credit profile, including market position, profitability, capital adequacy and financial\nflexibility. Our continued\n87"

Based on actual 2022 NIW, this agreement provided up to\n$221 million of reinsurance coverage.\nOn March 24, 2022, we executed an excess of loss reinsurance transaction with a panel of reinsurers, which provides up to $325 million\nof reinsurance coverage on a portfolio of existing mortgage insurance policies written from July 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021,\neffective March 1, 2022.\nOn September 15, 2022, we executed an excess of loss reinsurance transaction with a panel of reinsurers, which provides up to $201\nmillion of reinsurance coverage on a portfolio of existing mortgage insurance policies written from January 1, 2022, through June 30, 2022,\neffective September 1, 2022.\nOn June 30, 2022, we entered into a five-year, unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Facility”) with a syndicate of lenders in the initial\naggregate principal amount of $200 million. The Facility may be used for working capital needs and general corporate purposes, including\nthe execution of dividends to our shareholders and capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries. The Facility remains undrawn as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\nOn April 26, 2022, our Board of Directors approved the initiation of a dividend program under which the Company intends to pay a\nquarterly cash dividend. We paid quarterly dividends of $0.14 per share in May, September and December of 2022. Future dividend\npayments are subject to quarterly review and approval by our Board of Directors and Genworth and will be targeted to be paid in the third\nmonth of each subsequent quarter. In April and October of 2022, our primary mortgage insurance operating company, EMICO, completed\ndistributions to EHI supporting our ability to pay cash dividends. Future EMICO distributions will be used to fund the quarterly dividend as well\nas to bolster our financial flexibility and potentially return additional capital to shareholders.\nReturning capital to shareholders, balanced with our growth and risk management priorities, remains a key commitment as we look to\ndrive shareholder value through time. We believe the initiation of a quarterly dividend in 2022 reflects meaningful progress towards that goal.\nFurther, we announced a special cash dividend of $183 million, or $1.12 per share, that was paid during the fourth quarter of 2022. We also\nannounced the initiation of a share repurchase program which authorized the repurchase of up to $75 million of the Company’s common\nstock. Under the program, share repurchases may be made at the Company’s discretion from time to time in open market transactions,\nprivately negotiated transactions, or by other means, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. In support, we have entered into an\nagreement with Genworth Holdings, Inc. to repurchase its EHI shares on a pro rata basis as part of the program. The share repurchase\nprogram is not expected to change Genworth’s ownership interest in EHI post-completion. We began repurchases in the fourth quarter of\n2022 which were immaterial. We expect the timing and amount of any future share repurchases will be opportunistic and will depend on a\nvariety of factors, including EHI’s share price, capital availability, business and market conditions, regulatory requirements, and debt\ncovenant restrictions. The program does not obligate EHI to acquire any amount of common stock, it may be suspended or terminated at any\ntime at the Company’s discretion without prior notice, and it does not have a specified expiration date.\nFuture return of capital will be shaped by our capital prioritization framework: supporting our existing policyholders, growing our mortgage\ninsurance business, funding attractive new business opportunities and returning capital to shareholders. Our total return of capital will also be\nbased on our view of the prevailing and prospective macroeconomic conditions, regulatory landscape and business performance.\n88"

New primary delinquencies were 35,996 in 2022 compared to 32,624 in 2021, resulting in\n$171 million and $144 million of losses, respectively. During 2022, we recorded a $314 million reserve release primarily related to COVID-19\ndelinquencies from 2020 and 2021. Due to uncertainty in the current economic environment, we increased the expected claim rate on new\ndelinquencies throughout 2022. This contributed to reserve strengthening of $46 million on previous quarter delinquencies in 2022 and\nincreased the amount of reserves on new delinquencies in the fourth quarter of 2022. In 2021 we recorded a $22 million reserve release\nrelated to pre-COVID-19 claim years.\nThe following table shows incurred losses related to current and prior accident years for the years ended December 31:\n(Amounts in thousands)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nLosses and LAE incurred related to current accident year\n$\n219,461  $\n141,225  $\n364,548 \nLosses and LAE incurred related to prior accident years\n(313,652)\n(15,822)\n16,202 \nTotal incurred \n$\n(94,191) $\n125,403  $\n380,750 \n_______________\nExcludes run-off business.\nAcquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals, decreased primarily attributable to lower corporate overhead.\nAmortization of DAC and intangibles declined due to lower DAC amortization as a result of higher persistency, driven by rising mortgage\nrates.\nThe expense ratio remained flat due to similar percentage declines in premiums and expenses.\nInterest expense was relatively flat in the current year and related primarily to our 2025 Senior Notes issued in August 2020.

This measure has been\nestablished in order to increase transparency for the purposes of evaluating our core operating trends and enabling more meaningful\ncomparisons with our peers. Although “adjusted operating income” is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the reasons discussed above we\nbelieve this measure aids in understanding the underlying performance of our operations. Our senior management, including our chief\noperating decision maker (who is our Chief Executive Officer), use “adjusted operating income” as the primary measure to evaluate the\nfundamental financial performance of our business and to allocate resources.\n“Adjusted operating income” is defined as U.S. GAAP net income excluding the effects of (i) net investment gains (losses) and (ii)\nrestructuring costs and infrequent or unusual non-operating items.\n(i)\nNet investment gains (losses)—The recognition of realized investment gains or losses can vary significantly across periods as the\nactivity is highly discretionary based on the timing of individual securities sales due to such factors as market opportunities or\nexposure management.

Generally, our master policies require an insured to notify us of a delinquency if the borrower fails to make two\nconsecutive monthly mortgage payments prior to the due date of the next mortgage payment. We generally consider a loan to be delinquent\nand establish required reserves after the insured notifies us that the borrower has failed to make two scheduled mortgage payments.\nBorrowers default for a variety of reasons, including a reduction of income, unemployment, divorce, illness/death, inability to manage credit,\nfalling home prices and interest rate levels. Borrowers may cure delinquencies by making all of the delinquent loan payments, agreeing to a\nloan modification, or by selling the property in full satisfaction of all amounts due under the mortgage. In most cases, delinquencies that are\nnot cured result in a claim under our policy.\n(1)\n(1)\n97"

This number was\nelevated in 2021 in large part to borrowers entering a forbearance plan driven by COVID-19 and we saw cure activity within these\ndelinquencies during 2022. Our current reserve estimate assumes that remaining COVID-19 delinquencies will have a higher likelihood of\ngoing to claim given the uncertainty around the lack of progression through the foreclosure process. While we have seen significant cure\nactivity in aged delinquencies, continued forbearance options exist, so we could continue to experience elevated delinquencies in this aged\ncategory. Resolution of a delinquency in a forbearance plan, whether it ultimately results in a cure or a claim, is difficult to estimate and may\nnot be known for several quarters, if not longer.\nThe ratio of the claim paid to the current risk in-force for a loan is referred to as “claim severity.” The current risk in-force is equal to the\nunpaid principal amount multiplied by the coverage percentage. The main determinants of claim severity are the age of the mortgage loan,\nthe value of the underlying property, accrued interest on the loan, expenses advanced by the insured and foreclosure expenses. These\namounts depend partly upon the time required to complete foreclosure, which varies depending upon state laws. Pre-foreclosure sales,\nacquisitions and other early workout and claim administration actions help to reduce overall claim severity. Our average primary mortgage\ninsurance claim severity was 94%, 103% and 106% for the years ended December  31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The 2022\naverage claim severity was impacted by low claim volumes and lifetime home price appreciation. These figures do not include the effects of\nagreements on non-performing loans.\nPrimary insurance delinquency rates differ from region to region in the United States at any one time depending upon economic\nconditions and cyclical growth patterns. Delinquency rates are shown by region based upon the location of the underlying property, rather\nthan the location of the lender. The table\n(1)\n(1)\n99"

Loss mitigation actions include loan modification, extension of credit to bring a loan current, foreclosure forbearance, pre-\nforeclosure sale and deed-in-lieu. These loss mitigation efforts often are an effective way to reduce our claim exposure and ultimate payouts.\n103"

Net cash from operating\nactivities decreased largely due to lower premiums. Cash flows from operations were also impacted by changes in reserves, changes in\nunearned premium, stock-based compensation expense and amortization of discounts and premiums on fixed maturity securities.\nInvesting activities are primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of our investment portfolio. We had cash outflows from\ninvesting activities in 2022 and 2021 as a result of continued fixed maturity security purchases driven by premium growth and lower losses\npaid. Outflows of cash in 2020 were primarily as a result of purchases of fixed maturity securities using the net proceeds from the December\n2019 sale of our investment in Genworth Canada and our operating cash flows, partially offset by higher maturities and sales of our fixed\nmaturity securities.\nFinancing activities in 2022 reflect dividends paid for the year including a regular quarterly dividend initiated in the second quarter of\n2022 along with an additional special dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2022. We also began our share repurchase program in the fourth\nquarter of 2022. Financing activities in 2021 included a $200 million dividend paid in the fourth quarter while 2020 includes $738 million net\nproceeds from the issuance of our 2025 Senior Notes, discussed below, partially offset by a $437 million dividend paid to our Parent from the\nnet proceeds of the offering.

We may redeem the 2025 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to\nFebruary  15, 2025 at our option, by paying a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. At any time on or after\nFebruary 15, 2025, we may redeem the 2025 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at our option, at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued\nand unpaid interest. The 2025 Senior Notes contain customary events of default, which subject to certain notice and cure conditions, can\nresult in the acceleration of the principal and accrued interest on the outstanding 2025 Senior Notes if we breach the terms of the indenture.\nPursuant to the GSE Restrictions, we are required to retain $300  million of our holding company cash that can be drawn down\nexclusively for our debt service or to contribute to EMICO to meet its regulatory capital needs including PMIERs. As of December 31, 2022,\nthe balance of the 2025 Senior Notes proceeds required to be held by our holding company was approximately $203 million. See “—Trends\nand Conditions” for additional information regarding the GSE Restrictions.\nOn June 30, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders that provides for a five-year, unsecured revolving credit\nfacility (the “Facility”) in the initial aggregate principal amount of $200 million. We may use borrowings under the Facility for working capital\nneeds and general corporate purposes, including the execution of dividends to our shareholders and capital contributions to our insurance\nsubsidiaries. The Facility contains several covenants, including financial covenants relating to minimum net worth, capital and liquidity levels,\nmaximum debt to capitalization level and PMIERS compliance. We are in compliance with all covenants of the Facility and the Facility\nremained undrawn as of December 31, 2022.\nRestrictions on the Payment of Dividends\nThe ability of our regulated insurance operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and distributions to us is restricted by certain provisions of\nNorth Carolina insurance laws. Our insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends only from unassigned surplus; payments made from sources\nother than unassigned surplus, such as paid-in and contributed surplus, are categorized as distributions. Notice of all dividends must be\nsubmitted to the Commissioner of the NCDOI (the “Commissioner”) within 5 business days after declaration of the dividend or distribution,\nand at least 30 days before payment thereof. No dividend may be paid until 30 days after the Commissioner has received notice of the\ndeclaration thereof and (i) has not within that period disapproved the payment or (ii) has approved the payment within the 30-day period. Any\ndistribution, regardless of amount, requires that same 30-day notice to the Commissioner, but also requires the Commissioner’s affirmative\napproval before being paid. Based on our estimated statutory results and in accordance with applicable dividend restrictions, our insurance\nsubsidiaries have the capacity to pay dividends of $292 million from unassigned surplus as of December 31, 2022, with 30-day advance\nnotice to the Commissioner of the intent to pay. In addition to dividends and distributions, alternative mechanisms, such as share\nrepurchases, subject to any requisite regulatory approvals, may be utilized from time to time to upstream surplus.\nAnother consideration in the development of the dividend strategies for our regulated insurance operating subsidiaries is our expected\nlevel of compliance with PMIERs. Prior to the satisfaction of the GSE Conditions, the GSE Restrictions also required EMICO to maintain\n120% of PMIERs Minimum Required Assets through 2022, and 125% thereafter. In addition, under PMIERs, EMICO is subject to other\noperational and financial requirements that approved insurers must meet in order to remain eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs.\nRefer to “—Trends and Conditions” for recent updates related to these requirements.\nIn addition, we review multiple other considerations in parallel to determine a prospective dividend strategy for our regulated insurance\noperating subsidiaries.

      "text": "reasonableness of an insurer’s surplus in relation to its outstanding liabilities and the adequacy of its surplus relative to its financial needs for\nany dividend, our insurance subsidiaries consider the minimum amount of policyholder surplus after giving effect to any contemplated future\ndividends. Regulatory minimum policyholder surplus is not codified in North Carolina law and limitations may vary based on prevailing\nbusiness conditions including, but not limited to, the prevailing and future macroeconomic conditions. We estimate regulators would require a\nminimum policyholder surplus of approximately $300 million to meet their threshold standard. Given (i) we are subject to statutory accounting\nrequirements that establish a contingency reserve of at least 50% of net earned premiums annually for ten years, after which time it is\nreleased into policyholder surplus and (ii)  that no material 10-year contingency reserve releases are scheduled before 2024, we expect\nmodest growth in policyholder surplus through 2024. As a result, minimum policyholder surplus could be a limitation on the future dividends\nof our regulated operating subsidiaries.\nAs mentioned above, another consideration in the development of the dividend strategies for our regulated insurance operating\nsubsidiaries is our expected level of compliance with PMIERs. Under PMIERs, EMICO is subject to operational and financial requirements\nthat approved insurers must meet in order to remain eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs.\nOur regulated insurance operating subsidiaries are also subject to statutory RTC requirements that affect the dividend strategies of our\nregulated operating subsidiaries. EMICO’s domiciliary regulator, the NCDOI, requires the maintenance of a statutory RTC ratio not to exceed\n25:1. See “—Risk-to-Capital Ratio” for additional RTC trend analysis.\nWe consider potential future dividends compared to the prior year statutory net income in the evaluation of dividend strategies for our\nregulated operating subsidiaries. We also consider the dividend payout ratio, or the ratio of potential future dividends compared to the\nestimated U.S. GAAP net income, in the evaluation of our dividend strategies. In either case, we do not have prescribed target or maximum\nthresholds, but we do evaluate the reasonableness of a potential dividend relative to the actual or estimated income generated in the\nproceeding or preceding calendar year after giving consideration to prevailing business conditions including, but not limited to the prevailing\nand future macroeconomic conditions. In addition, the dividend strategies of our regulated operating subsidiaries are made in consultation\nwith our Parent.\nEMICO completed distributions of approximately $242 million to EHI in both April and October of 2022 that supported our ability to pay\ncash dividends. We intend to use future EMICO distributions to fund the quarterly dividend as well as to bolster our financial flexibility at EHI\nand return additional capital to shareholders.\nThe credit agreement entered into in connection with the Facility contains customary restrictions on EHI’s ability to pay cash dividends.\nUnder the credit agreement, EHI is permitted to make cash distributions (1) so long as no Default or Event of Default (as each are defined in\nthe credit agreement) has occurred and is continuing and EHI is in pro forma compliance with its financial covenants as described below at\nthe time of and after giving effect to such payment, (2) within 60 days of declaration of any cash dividend so long as the payment was\npermitted under the credit agreement at the time of such declaration and (3) other customary exceptions as more fully set forth in the credit\nagreement.\nThe credit agreement requires EHI to maintain the following financial covenants: a minimum consolidated net worth equal to the sum of\n(i) 72.5% of EHI’s consolidated net worth as of June 30, 2022 (“the Closing Date”), (ii) 50% of EHI’s positive consolidated net income for\neach fiscal quarter after the Closing Date and (iii) 50% of any increase in EHI’s consolidated net worth after the Closing Date resulting from\nequity issuances or capital contributions; in respect of EMICO, a minimum total adjusted capital amount equal to 72.5% of EMICO’s total\nadjusted capital as of the Closing Date; a maximum debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 0.35 to 1.00; a minimum liquidity level of $25,000,000;\nand compliance with all applicable financial requirements under the Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements published by the\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association.

The RTC ratio is\nnet RIF divided by policyholders’ surplus plus statutory contingency reserve. Our net RIF represents RIF, net of reinsurance ceded, and\nexcludes risk on policies that are currently delinquent and for which loss reserves have been established. Statutory capital consists primarily\nof statutory policyholders’ surplus (which increases as a result of statutory net income and decreases as a result of statutory net loss and\ndividends paid), plus the statutory contingency reserve. The statutory contingency reserve is reported as a liability on the statutory balance\nsheet.\nCertain states have insurance laws or regulations that require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital\n(including the statutory contingency reserve) relative to its level of RIF in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business.\nWhile formulations of minimum capital vary in certain states, the most common measure applied allows for a maximum permitted RTC ratio\nof 25:1.\nThe following table presents the calculation of our RTC ratio for our combined insurance subsidiaries as of the dates indicated:\n(Dollar amounts in millions)\nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021\nDecember 31, 2020\nStatutory policyholders’ surplus\n$\n1,136  $\n1,397  $\n1,555 \nContingency reserves\n3,551 \n3,042 \n2,518 \nCombined statutory capital\n$\n4,687  $\n4,439  $\n4,073 \nAdjusted RIF \n$\n60,061  $\n54,201  $\n49,104 \nCombined risk-to-capital ratio\n12.8 \n12.2 \n12.1 \n______________\nAdjusted RIF for purposes of calculating combined statutory RTC differs from RIF presented elsewhere herein.

On August 21, 2020, we issued the 2025 Senior Notes. The GSE Restrictions require us to retain $300 million of the net\nproceeds in our holding company cash that can be drawn down exclusively for our debt service or to contribute to EMICO to meet its\nregulatory capital needs including PMIERs, until the GSE Conditions are satisfied. We distributed $437 million of the net proceeds to\nGenworth Holdings at the closing of the offering of our 2025 Senior Notes. The 2025 Senior Notes were issued to persons reasonably\nbelieved to be qualified institutional buyers in a private offering exempt from registration pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and\nto non-U.S. persons outside of the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2022, the\nbalance of the 2025 Senior Notes proceeds required to be held by our holding company was approximately $203 million.\nAdditionally, on June 30, 2022, we entered into a five-year, unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders in the initial\naggregate principal amount of $200 million. The Facility may be used for working capital needs and general corporate purposes, including\nthe execution of dividends to our shareholders and capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries. The Facility remains undrawn as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\nThe principal sources of liquidity in our business currently include insurance premiums, net investment income and cash flows from\ninvestment sales and maturities. We believe that the operating cash flows generated by our mortgage insurance subsidiary will provide the\nfunds necessary to satisfy our claim payments, operating expenses and taxes in both the short-term and long-term. However, our\nsubsidiaries are subject to regulatory and other capital restrictions with respect to the payment of dividends. The net proceeds of the 2025\nSenior Notes offering retained by EHI comprise substantially all of the cash and cash equivalents held directly by EHI and initially available to\npay interest on the 2025 Senior Notes. To the extent the net proceeds retained from the offering is used to provide capital support to EMICO,\nthe GSEs and the NCDOI may seek to prevent EMICO from returning that capital to EHI in the form of a dividend, distribution or an\nintercompany loan. We currently have no material financing commitments, such as drawn lines of credit or guarantees, that are expected to\naffect our liquidity over the next five years, other than the 2025 Senior Notes.\nFinancial Strength Ratings\nRatings with respect to the financial strength of operating subsidiaries are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of\ninsurance companies. Ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in us and our ability to market our products. Rating\norganizations review the financial performance and condition of most insurers and provide opinions regarding financial strength, operating\nperformance and ability to meet obligations to policyholders.\nThe financial strength ratings of our operating companies are not designed to be, and do not serve as, measures of protection or\nvaluation offered to our stockholders. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us from any future disruptions in the credit markets\nor downgrades by one or more of the rating agencies of the financial strength ratings of our insurance company subsidiaries and/or the credit\nratings of our holding company as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ensuing economic uncertainty or otherwise. We also\ncannot predict the impact on our ratings or future ratings of actions taken with respect to our Parent.\nThe following EMICO financial strength ratings have been independently assigned by third-party rating organizations and represent our\ncurrent ratings, which are subject to change.\nName of Agency\nRating\nOutlook\nChange\nDate of Rating\nMoody’s Investor Service, Inc.\nBaa1\nStable\nUpgrade\nJuly 21, 2022\nFitch Ratings, Inc.\nBBB+\nStable\nAffirmed\nApril 27, 2022\nS&P Global Ratings\nBBB+\nStable\nUpgrade\nFebruary 16, 2023\n111"

However, we do not believe\nthat our cash flow requirements can be assessed based upon this analysis of these obligations, as the funding of these future cash\nobligations will be from future cash flows from premiums and investment income. Future cash outflows, whether they are contractual\nobligations or not, also will vary based upon our future needs. Although some outflows are fixed, others depend on future events. An\nexample of obligations that are fixed include future lease payments. An example of obligations that will vary include insurance liabilities that\ndepend on losses incurred. Refer to Note 7 and Note 12 of our audited consolidated financial statements for discussion of borrowings and\ncommitments in contingencies, respectively.\nWe continue to hold reserves as of December 31, 2022, related to delinquencies from borrower forbearance programs due to COVID-19.\nWe have seen COVID-19-related delinquencies cure above expectations, but reserves recorded related to borrower forbearance have a high\ndegree of estimation. Therefore, it is possible we could have higher contractual obligations related to these loss reserves if they do not\nperform as we expect. Refer to Note 5 in our audited consolidated financial statements for discussion of our loss reserves.\nRefer to Note 2 in our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December  31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, for a\ndiscussion of recently adopted and not yet adopted accounting standards.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe own and manage a large investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. Investment income is one of our material\nsources of revenue and the investment portfolio represents the primary resource supporting operational and claim payments. The assets\nwithin the investment portfolio are exposed to the same factors that affect overall financial market performance. While our investment\nportfolio is exposed to factors affecting markets worldwide, it is most sensitive to fluctuations in the drivers of United States markets.\nWe manage market risk via our defined investment policy guidelines implemented by our investment managers with oversight from our\nBoard of Directors and our senior management. Important drivers of our market risk exposure that we monitor and manage include but are\nnot limited to:\n•\nChanges to the level of interest rates. Increasing interest rates may reduce the value of certain fixed-rate bonds held in the\ninvestment portfolio. Higher rates may cause variable-rate assets to generate additional income. Decreasing rates will have the reverse\nimpact. Significant changes in interest rates can also affect persistency and claim rates that may require that the investment portfolio be\nrestructured to better align it with future liabilities and claim payments. Such restructuring may cause investments to be liquidated when\nmarket conditions are adverse.\n•\nChanges to the term structure of interest rates. Rising or falling rates typically change by different amounts along the yield curve.\nThese changes may have unforeseen impacts on the value of certain assets.\n•\nMarket volatility/changes in the real or perceived credit quality of investments. Deterioration in the quality of investments, identified\nthrough changes to our own or third-party (e.g., rating agency) assessments, will reduce the value and potentially the liquidity of investments.\n•\nConcentration risk. If the investment portfolio is highly concentrated in one asset, or in multiple assets whose values are highly\ncorrelated, the value of the total portfolio may be greatly affected by the change in value of just one asset or a group of highly correlated\nassets.\n112"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for\neach of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 28,\n2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthese consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material\nto the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of\na critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to\nwhich it relates.\nLoss reserves\nAs described in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates the liabilities for losses on insured\nmortgage loans (loss reserves) by estimating the number of loans in their inventory of delinquent loans that will result in a claim payment,\nwhich is referred to as the claim\n115"

The estimates are determined using a\nfactor-based approach, in which assumptions of claim rates for loans in default and the average amount paid for loans that result in a\nclaim are calculated using traditional actuarial techniques. The Company’s loss reserves were $519 million as of December 31, 2022.\nWe identified the assessment of the valuation of loss reserves to be a critical audit matter. The claim severity and claim rate assumptions\nused to develop reserves were inherently uncertain and involved significant management judgment, which required especially subjective\nauditor judgment. Additionally, the audit effort to assess the valuation of loss reserves required the involvement of professionals with\nspecialized knowledge and experience.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address the critical audit matter. We evaluated, with the assistance of actuarial\nprofessionals, the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the valuation of loss reserves. This\nincluded controls related to the review and approval of the claim severity and claim rate reserve factors used in the estimate for loss\nreserves. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized knowledge and experience, who assisted in:\n•\nAssessing the Company’s reserving methodology by comparing to accepted actuarial methodologies; and\n•\nDeveloping an independent estimate and range for a portion of the loss reserves, using the Company’s underlying historical claims\nand delinquency data and independently developed models and assumptions and assessing the position in the range and the year-\nover-year movements of the Company’s recorded loss reserves within the developed independent range.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1989.\nRaleigh, North Carolina\nFebruary 28, 2023\n116"

(“EHI,” together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) (formerly known as Genworth Mortgage\nHoldings, Inc.) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Genworth Financial, Inc. (“Genworth” or “Parent”) since EHI’s incorporation in Delaware in\n2012. On May  3, 2021, EHI amended its certificate of incorporation to change its name from Genworth Mortgage Holdings, Inc. This\namendment also authorized EHI to issue 600,000,000 shares of common stock, each having a par value of $0.01 per share. Concurrently,\nwe entered into a share exchange agreement with Genworth Holdings, Inc. (“Genworth Holdings”), pursuant to which Genworth Holdings\nexchanged the 100 shares of our common stock owned by it, representing all of our issued and outstanding capital stock, for 162,840,000\nnewly issued shares of common stock, par value $0.01, of EHI. All of the share and per share information presented in the consolidated\nfinancial statements, notes to the consolidated financial statements and supplemental schedules to the financial statements has been\nadjusted to reflect the share exchange on a retroactive basis for all periods and as of all dates presented.\nWe are engaged in the business of writing and assuming residential mortgage guaranty insurance. The insurance protects lenders and\ninvestors against certain losses resulting from nonpayment of loans secured by mortgages, deeds of trust, or other instruments constituting a\nlien on residential real estate.\nOn September  15, 2021, we priced our initial public offering (“IPO”) of common stock, which resulted in the issuance and sale of\n13,310,400 shares of common stock at the IPO price of $19.00 per common share. All shares were offered by the selling stockholder, our\nparent company, Genworth Holdings. In addition to the shares sold in the IPO, 14,655,600 common shares were sold in a concurrent private\nsale (“Private Sale”) at a price per share of $17.86, which is equal to the IPO price less the underwriting discount share. Genworth Holdings\nalso granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,996,560 common shares (“Over-Allotment Option”) at the\nIPO price less the underwriting discount. On September 16, 2021, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase all 1,996,560 common\nshares permitted under the terms of the underwriting agreement. The IPO, Private Sale and Over-Allotment Option (collectively the\n“Offering”) closed on September 20, 2021, and Genworth Holdings retained all net proceeds from the Offering. The gross proceeds of the\nOffering, before payment of underwriter fees and other expenses, were approximately $553 million. Costs directly related to the Offering,\nincluding underwriting fees and other expenses, were approximately $24 million.\nWe offer private mortgage insurance products predominantly insuring prime-based, individually underwritten residential mortgage loans\n(“primary mortgage insurance”). Our primary mortgage insurance enables borrowers to buy homes with a down payment of less than 20% of\nthe home’s value. Primary mortgage insurance also facilitates the sale of these low down payment mortgage loans in the secondary\nmortgage market, most of which are sold to government sponsored enterprises. We also selectively enter into insurance transactions with\nlenders and investors, under which we insure a portfolio of loans at or after origination.\nWe operate our business through our primary insurance subsidiary, Enact Mortgage Insurance Corporation, (“EMICO”), formerly known\nas Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corporation, with operations in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We completed name changes to\nsome of our subsidiary legal entities, including EMICO, during the first quarter of 2022. EMICO is an approved insurer by the Federal\nNational Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac are government-sponsored enterprises, and we refer to them collectively as the “GSEs.”\nWe also perform fee-based contract underwriting services for mortgage lenders. The provision of underwriting services by mortgage\ninsurers eliminates the duplicative lender and mortgage insurer underwriting activities and expedites the approval process.\n122"

Our segment includes a run-off insurance block with reference properties in\nMexico (“run-off business”), which is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.\nOn July  20, 2020, Genworth reached a settlement agreement with AXA S.A. (“AXA”) regarding a dispute over payment protection\ninsurance mis-selling claims sold by Genworth’s former lifestyle protection insurance business that was acquired by AXA in 2015. As part of\nthe settlement agreement, Genworth issued a secured promissory note agreeing to pay AXA in two installments in 2023. Under the terms of\nthe secured promissory note, as amended, Genworth pledged as collateral to AXA a 19.9% security interest in our outstanding common\nstock. On March 3, 2021, Genworth repaid the first installment payment originally due to AXA in June 2022 and a portion of the second\ninstallment payment due to AXA in September 2022 from cash proceeds received from the sale of Genworth Mortgage Insurance Australia\nLimited. On September 21, 2021, Genworth used a portion of the net proceeds from our IPO to repay the remaining outstanding balance of\nthe secured promissory note of approximately £215 million ($296 million), excluding future claims still being processed. Following the full\nrepayment of the secured promissory note, AXA released its 19.9% security interest in our outstanding common shares.\n(2)\nSummary of significant accounting policies\nBasis of Presentation\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S.\nGAAP”). Preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported\namounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to\nconform to the current year presentation.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a standalone basis. The consolidated financial statements include the\naccounts of EHI, its subsidiaries and those entities required to be consolidated under the applicable accounting standards. All intercompany\ntransactions and balances have been eliminated.\nThe consolidated financial statements include allocations of certain Genworth expenses. The allocated expenses relate to various\nservices that have historically been provided to us by Genworth, including investment management, information technology services and\nadministrative services (such as finance, human resources and employee benefit administration). These allocations were made on a direct\nusage basis when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on the basis of equity, proportional effort or other relevant measures. Expenses\nallocated to us are not necessarily representative of the amounts that would have been incurred had we operated independently of\nGenworth. See Note 11 for further information regarding the allocation of Genworth expenses.\nPremiums\nFor monthly insurance contracts, we report premiums as revenue over the period that coverage is provided. For single premium\nmortgage insurance contracts, we report premiums over the estimated policy life in accordance with the expected pattern of risk emergence\nas further described in our accounting policy for unearned premiums. In addition, we refund post-delinquent premiums received to the\ninsured party if the delinquent loan goes to claim. We record a liability for premiums received on the delinquent loans consistent with our\nexpectations of ultimate claim rates.\nNet Investment Income and Net Investment Gains and Losses\nInvestment income is recognized when earned. Income or loss upon call or prepayment of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities is\nrecognized in net investment income, except for hybrid securities\n123"

Investment gains and losses are calculated on the\nbasis of specific identification on the trade date.\nInvestment income on asset-backed securities is initially based upon yield, cash flow and prepayment assumptions at the date of\npurchase. Subsequent revisions in those assumptions are recorded using the retrospective or prospective method. Under the retrospective\nmethod used for asset-backed securities of high credit quality (ratings equal to or greater than “AA” or that are backed by a U.S. agency)\nwhich cannot be contractually prepaid in such a manner that we would not recover a substantial portion of the initial investment, amortized\ncost of the security is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the revised assumptions been in place at the date of purchase.\nThe adjustments to amortized cost are recorded as a charge or credit to net investment income. Under the prospective method, which is\nused for all other asset-backed securities, future cash flows are estimated, and interest income is recognized going forward using the new\ninternal rate of return.\nOther Income\nOther income primarily includes underwriting fee revenue and other revenue. Underwriting fee revenue is earned for underwriting\nservices provided on a per-unit or per-diem basis, as defined in the underwriting agreements. Underwriting fee revenue is recognized at the\npoint in time when the service obligation is satisfied.\nInvestments\nThe investment portfolios of our subsidiaries are managed by Genworth. We conduct the purchases, sales and related investment\nmanagement decisions with the advice of Genworth. As part of these services, we are charged an investment management fee, as agreed\nbetween both parties. These fees are charged to investment expense and are included in net investment income in the consolidated\nstatements of income. Refer to Note 11 for further details. Investments held at EHI are managed by a third party.\nFixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale are reported in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Our portfolio of\nfixed maturity securities comprises primarily investment grade securities. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale fixed maturity\nsecurities, net of deferred income taxes, are reflected as unrealized investment gains or losses in a separate component of accumulated\nother comprehensive income (“OCI”).\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Impairments on Available-For-Sale Securities\nOn January 1, 2021, we adopted new accounting guidance related to accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. The guidance\nrequires entities to recognize an allowance equal to its estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and applies to most debt instruments not\nmeasured at fair value.\nThe guidance retained most of the existing impairment guidance for available-for-sale fixed maturity securities but amends the\npresentation of credit losses to be presented as an allowance as opposed to a write-down and permits the reversal of credit losses when\nreassessing changes in the credit losses each reporting period. Available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position are\nevaluated to determine whether the decline in fair value is related to credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, we consider\nthe extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency/agencies and adverse\nconditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be\ncollected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be\ncollected is less than the amortized cost basis, an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited by the amount that the fair value is less\nthan the amortized cost basis. Estimating the cash flows expected to be collected is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates\ninformation received from third-party sources along with internal assumptions and judgments. When developing the estimate of cash flows\nexpected to be collected, we utilize an analytical\n124"

Losses are written off against\nthe allowance when deemed uncollectible or when we intend to sell or expect we will be required to sell a security prior to recovering our\namortized cost. We exclude accrued interest related to available-for-sale fixed maturity securities from the estimate of allowance for credit\nlosses. Accrued interest is included in accrued investment income in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We do not measure an\nallowance for credit losses related to accrued interest as uncollectible accrued interest related to our available-for-sale fixed maturity\nsecurities is written off after 90 days and once collectability is determined to be uncertain and not probable. Amounts written off related to\naccrued interest are recorded as a credit loss expense included in net investment gains (losses). We adopted the guidance related to our\navailable-for-sale fixed maturity securities using the modified retrospective method, which did not have a significant impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nPrior to the adoption of new accounting guidance related to credit losses on financial instruments on January 1, 2021, we evaluated\nsecurities in an unrealized loss position for other-than-temporary impairment as of each balance sheet date. For debt securities, we\nconsidered all available information relevant to the collectability of the security, including information about past events, current conditions,\nand reasonable and supportable forecasts, when developing the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. More specifically for asset-\nbacked securities, we also utilized performance indicators of the underlying assets including default or delinquency rates, loan to collateral\nvalue ratios, third-party credit enhancements, current levels of subordination, vintage and other relevant characteristics of the security or\nunderlying assets to develop our estimate of cash flows. Estimating the cash flows expected to be collected was a quantitative and qualitative\nprocess that incorporates information received from third-party sources along with certain internal assumptions and judgments regarding the\nfuture performance of the underlying collateral. Where possible, this data is benchmarked against third-party sources.\nWe recognized other-than-temporary impairments on debt securities in an unrealized loss position when one of the following\ncircumstances existed:\n•\nwe did not expect full recovery of our amortized cost basis when due,\n•\nthe present value of cash flows expected to be collected was less than our amortized cost basis,\n•\nwe intended to sell a security, or\n•\nit was more likely than not that we would be required to sell a security prior to recovery.\nTotal other-than-temporary impairments that emerged in the period were calculated as the difference between the amortized cost and fair\nvalue. For other-than-temporarily impaired securities where we did not intend to sell the security and it was not more likely than not that we\nwould be required to sell the security prior to recovery, total other-than-temporary impairments were adjusted by the portion of other-than-\ntemporary impairments recognized in OCI (“non-credit”). Net other-than-temporary impairments recorded in net income (loss) represented\nthe credit loss on the other-than-temporarily impaired securities with the offset recognized as an adjustment to the amortized cost to\ndetermine the new amortized cost basis of the securities.\nFor securities that were deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired and a non-credit loss was recorded in OCI, the amount recorded\nas an unrealized gain (loss) represented the difference between the current fair value and the new amortized cost for each period presented.\nThe unrealized gain (loss) on an other-than-temporarily impaired security was recorded as a separate component in OCI until the security\nwas sold or until we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment where we intended to sell the security or were required to sell the security\nprior to recovery.\nTo estimate the amount of other-than-temporary impairment attributed to credit losses on debt securities where we did not intend to sell\nthe security and it was not more likely than not that we would be\n125"

If the present value of the\ndiscounted cash flows was lower than the amortized cost of the security, the difference between the present value and amortized cost\nrepresented the credit loss associated with the security with the remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost recorded as a\nnon-credit other-than-temporary impairment in OCI.\nWhile the other-than-temporary impairment model for debt securities generally included fixed maturity securities, there were certain\nhybrid securities that are classified as fixed maturity securities where the application of a debt impairment model depended on whether there\nhas been any evidence of deterioration in credit of the issuer, such as a downgrade to below investment grade. Under certain circumstances,\nevidence of deterioration in credit of the issuer may have resulted in the application of the equity securities impairment model where we\nrecognized an impairment charge in the period in which we determined that the security would not recover to book value within a reasonable\nperiod of time. We determined what constitutes a reasonable period on a security-by-security basis based upon consideration of all the\nevidence available to us, including the magnitude of an unrealized loss and its duration. In any event, this period did not exceed 15 months.\nWe measured other-than-temporary impairments based upon the difference between the amortized cost of a security and its fair value.\nEquity Method Investments\nInvestments in which we are deemed to exert significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of\naccounting except in cases where the fair value option has been elected. Equity method investments not carried at fair value, which are not\nmaterial as of December 31, 2022, are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets with their related income recorded within\nother income in the consolidated statements of income. See Note 3 for details.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date. We have fixed maturity securities, which are carried at fair value, and previously had an\ninvestment in an unconsolidated affiliate for which the fair value option had been elected.\nFair value measurements are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from\nindependent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information. We\nutilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nAll assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\n•\nLevel 1—Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\n•\nLevel 2—Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are\nnot active; and model-derived valuations for which inputs are observable or where those significant value drivers are observable.\n•\nLevel 3—Instruments for which significant value drivers are unobservable.\nLevel 1 primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as equity securities and actively\ntraded mutual fund investments.\nLevel 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using industry-standard pricing methodologies, models or other valuation\nmethodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various inputs, such as interest rate, credit spread and\nforeign exchange rates for the underlying financial instruments. All significant inputs are observable, or derived from observable,\n126"

Financial\ninstruments in this category primarily include: certain public and private corporate fixed maturity securities; government or agency securities;\nand certain asset-backed securities.\nLevel 3 comprises financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on industry-standard pricing methodologies and internally\ndeveloped models utilizing significant inputs not based on, nor corroborated by, readily available market information. In certain instances, this\ncategory may also utilize non-binding broker quotes. This category primarily consists of certain less liquid fixed maturity securities where we\ncannot corroborate the significant valuation inputs with market observable data.\nAs of each reporting period, all assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input\nthat is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its\nentirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability, such as the relative impact on the fair value as a result of\nincluding a particular input. We review the fair value hierarchy classifications each reporting period. Changes in the observability of the\nvaluation attributes may result in a reclassification of certain financial assets or liabilities. Such reclassifications are reported as transfers in\nand out of Level 3 at the beginning fair value for the reporting period in which the changes occur. See Note 4 for additional information\nrelated to fair value measurements.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCertificates of deposit, money market funds and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are\nconsidered cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows. Items with maturities greater\nthan three months but less than one year at the time of acquisition are generally considered short-term investments.\nAccrued Investment Income\nAccrued investment income consists primarily of interest earned on available-for-sale securities. Interest is recognized on an accrual\nbasis, and dividends are recorded as earned on the ex-dividend date. Interest income is not recorded on fixed maturity securities in default\nand fixed maturity securities delinquent more than 90 days or where collection of interest is improbable.\nDeferred Acquisition Costs (“DAC”)\nAcquisition costs include costs that are directly related to the successful acquisition of new insurance contracts. Acquisition costs are\ndeferred and amortized to the extent they are recoverable from future profits. Acquisition costs primarily consist of underwriting costs and are\namortized in proportion to estimated gross profit. Judgment is used in evaluating these estimates and the assumptions upon which they are\nbased. The use of different assumptions may have a significant effect on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs.\nDeferred acquisition costs were $26.1 million and $27.2 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization of DAC\nwas $7.8 million, $14.7 million and $14.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and was included\nwithin amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles in the consolidated statements of income.\nPremium Deficiency Reserves (“PDR”)\nPremium deficiency reserves are established, if necessary, when the present value of expected future losses and expenses exceeds the\npresent value of expected future premium and already established reserves. The discount rate used in the calculation is based upon our\npretax investment yield. We do not utilize anticipated investment income on our assets when evaluating the need for a PDR. The calculation\nof premium deficiency reserves requires the use of significant judgments and estimates to determine the present value of future premium and\npresent value of expected losses and expenses in our business.

We completed a PDR analysis as of December 31, 2022 and\n2021 and determined that no PDR was required.\nReinsurance\nPremium revenue, benefits and acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals, are reported net of the amounts relating to\nreinsurance ceded to other companies. The cost of reinsurance is accounted for over the terms of the related treaties using assumptions\nconsistent with those used to account for the underlying reinsured policies. See Note 6 for details.\nLoss Reserves\nLoss reserves represent the amount needed to provide for the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims relating to insured events that\nhave occurred on or before the end of the respective reporting period. The estimated liability includes requirements for future payments of:\n(a) losses that have been reported to the insurer; (b) losses related to insured events that have occurred but that have not been reported to\nthe insurer as of the date the liability is estimated; and (c)  loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”). Loss adjustment expenses include costs\nincurred in the claim settlement process such as legal fees and costs to record, process and adjust claims. Consistent with U.S. GAAP and\nindustry accounting practices, we do not establish loss reserves for future claims on insured loans that are not in default or believed to be in\ndefault.\nEstimates and actuarial assumptions used for establishing loss reserves involve the exercise of significant judgment, and changes in\nassumptions or deviations of actual experience from assumptions can have material impacts on our loss reserves and net income (loss).\nBecause these assumptions relate to factors that are not known in advance, change over time, are difficult to accurately predict and are\ninherently uncertain, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments.\nThe sources of uncertainty affecting the estimates are numerous and include factors internal and external to us. Internal factors include, but\nare not limited to, changes in the mix of exposures, loss mitigation activities and claim settlement practices. Significant external influences\ninclude changes in home prices, unemployment, government housing policies, state foreclosure timeline, general economic conditions,\ninterest rates, tax policy, credit availability and mortgage products. Small changes in assumptions or small deviations of actual experience\nfrom assumptions can have, and in the past have had, material impacts on our reserves, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe establish reserves to recognize the estimated liability for losses and LAE related to defaults on insured mortgage loans. Loss\nreserves are established by estimating the number of loans in our inventory of delinquent loans that will result in a claim payment, which is\nreferred to as the claim rate, and further estimating the amount of the claim payment, which is referred to as claim severity. The estimates are\ndetermined using a factor-based approach, in which assumptions of claim rates for loans in default and the average amount paid for loans\nthat result in a claim are calculated using traditional actuarial techniques. Over time, as the status of the underlying delinquent loans moves\ntoward foreclosure and the likelihood of the associated claim loss increases, the amount of the loss reserves associated with the potential\nclaims may also increase.\nManagement monitors actual experience, and where circumstances warrant, will revise its assumptions. Our liability for loss reserves is\nreviewed regularly, with changes in our estimates of future claims recorded through net income. Estimation of losses are based on historical\nclaim and cure experience and covered exposures and is inherently judgmental. Future developments may result in losses greater or less\nthan the liability for loss reserves provided.\nUnearned Premiums\nPremiums written on single premium policies and annual premium policies are initially deferred as unearned premium reserve and\nearned over the policy life.

For\nborrower-paid mortgage insurance, coverage ceases at the earlier of prepayment, or when the original principal is amortized to a 78% loan-\nto-value ratio in accordance with the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998.\nWe periodically review our premium earnings recognition models with any adjustments to the estimates reflected as a cumulative\nadjustment on a retrospective basis in current period net income. These reviews include the consideration of recent and projected loss and\npolicy cancellation experience, and adjustments to the estimated earnings patterns are made, if warranted.\nShare-Based Compensation\nPrior to our IPO, certain of our employees participated in Genworth’s incentive plans, under which our employees were granted share-\nbased awards, including stock options. In 2021, we approved an incentive compensation plan that allows EHI to grant share-based awards to\nits employees and directors.\nFor grants from both of these plans, compensation expense is recognized based on a grant date fair value, adjusted for expected\nforfeitures, through the income statement over the respective vesting period of the awards. See Note 10 for additional information related to\nshare-based compensation.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nOur employees are provided a number of Genworth employee benefits. Genworth, as sponsor of these employee benefit plans, is\nultimately responsible for maintenance of these plans in compliance with applicable laws. The plans are accounted for by Genworth in\naccordance with relevant accounting guidance. We account for these employee benefit plans as multiemployer benefit plans. Accordingly, we\ndo not record an asset or liability to recognize the funded status of the employee benefit plans. Expenses related to employee benefits are\nincluded within acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals in the consolidated statements of income. See Note 9 for additional\ninformation related to employee benefits.\nIncome Taxes\nWe determine deferred tax assets and/or liabilities by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases\nfor assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are recovered or settled if there is no change\nin law. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in net income (loss) in the period that includes the enactment date.\nValuation allowances on deferred tax assets are estimated based on our assessment of the realizability of such amounts.\nWe have elected to participate in a single U.S. consolidated income tax return filing (the “Genworth consolidated return”). All Genworth\ncompanies domesticated in the United States are included in the Genworth consolidated return as allowed by the tax law and regulations.\nWe have a tax sharing agreement in place and all intercompany balances related to this agreement are settled at least annually. Refer to\nNote 8 for further details.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe are involved in certain entities that are considered variable interest entities (“VIEs”) as defined under U.S. GAAP, and, accordingly,\nwe evaluate the VIE to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary and are required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the\nentity. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the enterprise that has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impacts the\nVIE’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could\n129"

The determination of the primary beneficiary for a VIE can be complex and requires management\njudgment regarding the expected results of the entity and how those results are absorbed by variable interest holders, as well as which party\nhas the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the performance of the VIEs.\nOur involvement with VIEs consists of excess of loss reinsurance agreements with special purpose insurers domiciled in Bermuda.\nThese entities finance the reinsurance coverage by issuing mortgage insurance-linked notes to unaffiliated investors. The assets of the VIEs\nare deposited in reinsurance trusts for our benefit that will be the source of reinsurance claim payments. Our involvement with these VIEs\ndoes not result in the unilateral power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the VIEs’ economic performance or result in the\nobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits. Accordingly, consolidation of the VIEs is not required. See Note 6 for details.\nLeases\nOur leased assets are classified as operating leases and consist of office space in two locations in the United States. Lease payments\nincluded in the calculation of our lease liability include fixed amounts contained within each rental agreement and variable lease payments\nthat are based upon an index or rate. We have elected to combine lease and non-lease components, as permitted under the accounting\nguidance, and as a result, non-lease components are included in the calculation of our lease liability as opposed to being separated and\naccounted for as consideration under revenue recognition accounting. The right-of-use asset and the lease liability are included in other\nassets and other liabilities, respectively.\nAccounting Pronouncements Adopted\nCredit Losses\nOn January 1, 2021, we early adopted new accounting guidance related to accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. The\nguidance requires entities to recognize an allowance equal to its estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and applies to most debt\ninstruments not measured at fair value.\nDiscussion of adoption of this guidance in relation to our portfolio of fixed maturity securities is included in the discussion of the\nallowance for credit losses and impairments of available-for-sale securities, above.\nThe new guidance further requires that expected credit losses on premiums receivable are measured in accordance with the credit loss\nrequirements for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. Due to the short-term nature of our premiums receivable, we consider\nlifetime expected credit losses on premiums receivable to be consistent with our current allowance and as a result the new accounting\nguidance did not have an impact on premiums receivable upon adoption. The allowance for credit losses on premiums receivable is not\nmaterial.\nThe new guidance also requires the recognition of an allowance for expected credit losses as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet\nfor off-balance sheet credit exposures, including private placement investments. We adopted the guidance related to our off-balance sheet\ncredit exposures using the modified retrospective method, which did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nFair Value Disclosures\nOn January  1, 2020, we adopted new accounting guidance related to fair value disclosure requirements as part of the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) disclosure framework project. The guidance adds, eliminates and modifies certain disclosure\nrequirements for fair value measurements. The guidance includes new disclosure requirements related to changes in unrealized gains and\nlosses included in other comprehensive income (loss) for recurring Level 3 fair value\n130"

We adopted this new accounting guidance using the prospective method for disclosures related to\nchanges in unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income (loss) for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at\nthe end of the reporting period, the range and weighted-average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty and the retrospective method for all other disclosures. This\naccounting guidance did not impact our consolidated financial statements but impacted our fair value disclosures.\nReference Rate Reform\nIn March 2020 and January 2021, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to reference rate reform, which was effective for us\non January 1, 2020. The guidance provides temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for, or recognizing the effects of,\nreference rate reform, which includes the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other interbank offered\nrates to alternative reference rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. This new guidance provides optional practical expedients\nand exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to investments, derivatives or other transactions affected by reference\nrate reform. In addition to the optional practical expedients, the guidance includes a general principle that permits an entity to consider\ncontract modifications due to reference rate reform to be an event that does not require contract remeasurement at the modification date or\nreassessment of a previous accounting determination. We adopted this guidance prospectively and it did not have a significant impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements or disclosures. However, the amendments in this guidance may be elected over time, as reference rate\nreform activities occur and therefore, this guidance may impact our procedures as we implement measures to transition away from LIBOR.\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to simplifying the accounting for income taxes. The guidance\neliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim\nperiod and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. We early adopted this new accounting guidance on\nJanuary 1, 2021, using the retrospective method or modified retrospective method for certain changes and prospective method for all other\nchanges, which did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nNo significant new pronouncements.\n(3)\nInvestments\nNet Investment Income\nSources of net investment income were as follows for the year ended December 31:\n(Amounts in thousands)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nFixed maturity securities available-for-sale\n$\n153,649  $\n146,587  $\n136,143 \nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\n7,167 \n74 \n2,180 \nGross investment income before expenses and fees\n160,816 \n146,661 \n138,323 \nInvestment expenses and fees\n(5,505)\n(5,472)\n(5,480)\nNet investment income\n$\n155,311  $\n141,189  $\n132,843 \n131"

The primary asset of the entity is a minority ownership interest in\na mortgage guarantee business in India. We invested an additional $6.5 million during 2022.

The fair value of fixed maturity securities\nand short-term investments are estimated primarily based on information derived from third-party pricing services (“pricing services”), internal\nmodels and/or broker quotes, which use a market approach, income approach or a combination of the market and income approach\ndepending on the type of instrument and availability of information. In general, a market approach is utilized if there is readily available and\nrelevant market activity for an individual security. In certain cases where market information is not available for a specific security but is\navailable for similar securities, that security is valued using market information for similar securities, which is also a market approach. When\nmarket information is not available for a specific security (or similar securities) or is available but such information is less relevant or reliable,\nan income approach or a combination of a market and income approach is utilized. For securities with optionality, such as call or prepayment\nfeatures (including asset-backed securities), an income or combination approach may be used. These valuation techniques may change from\nperiod to period, based on the relevance and availability of market data.\n135"

If prices are unavailable for public securities, we obtain broker quotes. For all\nsecurities, excluding certain private fixed maturity securities, if neither a pricing service nor broker quotes valuation is available, we determine\nfair value using internal models. For certain private fixed maturity securities where we do not obtain valuations from pricing services, we\nutilize an internal model to determine fair value since transactions for similar securities are not readily observable and these securities are not\ntypically valued by pricing services.\nGiven our understanding of the pricing methodologies and procedures of pricing services, the securities valued by pricing services are\ntypically classified as Level 2 unless we determine the valuation process for a security or group of securities utilizes significant unobservable\ninputs, which would result in the valuation being classified as Level 3.\nBroker quotes are typically based on an income approach given the lack of available market data. As the valuation typically includes\nsignificant unobservable inputs, we classify the securities where fair value is based on our consideration of broker quotes as Level 3\nmeasurements.\nFor private fixed maturity securities, we utilize an income approach where we obtain public bond spreads and utilize those in an internal\nmodel to determine fair value. Other inputs to the model include rating and weighted-average life, as well as sector which is used to assign\nthe spread. We then add an additional premium, which represents an unobservable input, to the public bond spread to adjust for the liquidity\nand other features of our private placements. We utilize the estimated market yield to discount the expected cash flows of the security to\ndetermine fair value. We utilize price caps for securities where the estimated market yield results in a valuation that may exceed the amount\nthat would be received in a market transaction. When a security does not have an external rating, we assign the security an internal rating to\ndetermine the appropriate public bond spread that should be utilized in the valuation. While we generally consider the public bond spreads by\nsector and maturity to be observable inputs, we evaluate the similarities of our private placement with the public bonds, any price caps\nutilized, liquidity premiums applied, and whether external ratings are available for our private placements to determine whether the spreads\nutilized would be considered observable inputs. We classify private securities without an external rating or public bond spread as Level 3. In\ngeneral, a significant increase (decrease) in credit spreads would have resulted in a significant decrease (increase) in the fair value for our\nfixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2022.\nFor remaining securities priced using internal models, we determine fair value using an income approach. We maximize the use of\nobservable inputs but typically utilize significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value. Accordingly, the valuations are typically\nclassified as Level 3.\nOur assessment of whether or not there were significant unobservable inputs related to fixed maturity securities was based on our\nobservations obtained through the course of managing our investment portfolio, including interaction with other market participants,\nobservations related to the availability and consistency of pricing and/or rating, and understanding of general market activity such as new\nissuance and the level of secondary market trading for a class of securities. Additionally, we considered data obtained from pricing services\nto determine whether our estimated values incorporate significant unobservable inputs that would result in the valuation being classified as\nLevel 3.\nA summary of the inputs used for our fixed maturity securities and short-term investments based on the level in which instruments are\nclassified is included below. We have combined certain classes of instruments together as the nature of the inputs is similar.\nLevel 1 measurements\nThere were no fixed maturity securities classified as Level 1 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n136"

These pricing services utilize industry-standard valuation techniques that include market-based approaches, income-\nbased approaches, a combination of market-based and income-based approaches or other proprietary, internally generated models as part\nof the valuation processes. These third-party pricing vendors maximize the use of publicly available data inputs to generate valuations for\neach asset class. Priority and type of inputs used may change frequently as certain inputs may be more direct drivers of valuation at the time\nof pricing. Examples of significant inputs incorporated by pricing services may include sector and issuer spreads, seasoning, capital\nstructure, security optionality, collateral data, prepayment assumptions, default assumptions, delinquencies, debt covenants, benchmark\nyields, trade data, dealer quotes, credit ratings, maturity and weighted-average life.

      "text": "ENACT HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYears Ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nLosses incurred related to insured events of the current accident year relate to defaults that occurred in that year and represent the\nestimated ultimate amount of losses to be paid on such defaults. Losses incurred related to insured events of prior accident years represent\nthe (favorable) or unfavorable development of reserves as a result of actual claim rates and claim amounts being different than those we\nestimated when originally establishing the reserves. Such estimates are based on our historical experience which we believe is\nrepresentative of expected future losses at the time of estimation. As a result of the extended period of time that may exist between the\nreporting of a delinquency and the claim payment, as well as changes in economic conditions and the real estate market, significant\nuncertainty and variability exist on amounts ultimately paid.\nThe liability for loss reserves represents our current best estimate; however, there may be future adjustments to this estimate and related\nassumptions. Such adjustments, reflecting any variety of new and adverse trends, could possibly be significant and result in future increases\nto reserves by amounts that could be material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIn 2022, losses and LAE incurred of $219.5 million related to insured events of the current accident year was primarily attributable to new\ndelinquencies coupled with $46 million of reserve strengthening on current year delinquencies. Due to uncertainty in the current economic\nenvironment, we increased the expected claim rate on new delinquencies in 2022, which contributed to these amounts. A portion of new\ndelinquencies in the periods presented were from borrowers participating in deferred or reduced payments (“forbearance”) as a result of\nCOVID-19. Through the third quarter of 2022, when establishing loss reserves for borrowers in forbearance, we assumed a lower rate of\ndelinquencies becoming active claims, which has the effect of producing a lower reserve compared to delinquencies that are not in\nforbearance. Historical experience with localized natural disasters, such as hurricanes, indicates a higher cure rate for borrowers in\nforbearance. Unlike a hurricane where the natural disaster occurs at a point in time and the rebuild starts soon after, COVID-19 brought\nongoing displacement to the mortgage insurance market, making it more difficult to determine the effectiveness of forbearance and the\nresulting claim rates for new delinquencies in forbearance plans. Given this difference, we initially leveraged our prior hurricane experience\nand have recently layered in cure activity from COVID-19 related delinquencies as considerations in the establishment of an appropriate\nclaim rate estimate for new delinquencies in forbearance plans that have emerged as a result of COVID-19. Loss reserves recorded on these\nnew delinquencies have a high degree of estimation due to the level of uncertainty regarding whether delinquencies in forbearance will\nultimately cure or result in claim payments as well as the timing and severity of those payments.\nDuring 2022, we experienced favorable reserve development of $313.7 million in incurred losses attributable to prior years, primarily from\nbetter-than-expected cure performance on COVID-19 delinquencies from 2020 and 2021. The change was almost exclusively attributable to\n$314 million in favorable reserves adjustments.\nDuring 2021, we experienced favorable reserve development of $15.8 million in incurred losses attributable to prior years, primarily from\nlower expected claim rates on pre-COVID-19 delinquencies. Included within this decrease to incurred losses attributable to prior years, we\nrecorded $22.0 million in favorable reserve adjustments.\nIn 2020, losses and LAE incurred of $364.5 million related to insured events of the current accident year was primarily attributable to a\nsignificant increase in the number of new delinquencies driven mostly by borrower forbearance as a result of COVID-19.\nDuring 2020, we experienced unfavorable reserve development of $16.2 million in incurred losses attributable to prior years, primarily\nfrom higher expected claim rates due to economic conditions occurring in the COVID-19 environment. Included within this increase to\nincurred losses attributable to prior years, we recorded $28.4 million in unfavorable reserves adjustments, primarily associated with higher\nexpected, future claim rates, partially offset by a $12.2 million decrease, primarily due to higher-than-expected delinquency cures.\n142"

In the event that the reinsurers are unable to meet their\nobligations, we remain liable for the reinsured claims.

The state deferred tax assets related primarily to the future deductions associated with non-insurance and insurance net\noperating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were no U.S. federal NOL carryforwards.\nExcept as discussed above with regard to our state deferred tax assets, we have not established a valuation allowance with respect to\nany other deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022, based primarily upon projections of future taxable income. With respect to deferred\ntax assets associated with unrealized losses on investment securities, management has the ability and intent to execute tax planning\nstrategies, including to hold those investment assets to recovery or maturity. We have determined that such strategies are prudent and\nfeasible, and would be implemented, if necessary, to ensure recognition of the deferred tax asset. After consideration of all available\nevidence, we concluded that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. If our actual results do not validate the\ncurrent projections of pre-tax income, we may be required to record an additional valuation allowance which could have a material impact on\nour consolidated financial statements in future periods.\nThere were no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nWe recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as components of the provision for income taxes. We\nhave recorded $0 of benefits related to interest and penalties for 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nAs previously discussed, we have elected to participate in the Genworth consolidated return. All Genworth companies domesticated in\nthe United States are included in the Genworth consolidated return as allowed by the tax law and regulations. We have a tax sharing\nagreement in place and all intercompany balances related to this agreement are settled at least annually.

The tax allocation methodology is based on the separate return liabilities with offsets for losses and credits utilized to\nreduce the current consolidated tax liability as allowed by applicable law and regulation. Our policy is to settle intercompany tax balances\nquarterly, with a final settlement after filing of Genworth’s federal consolidated U.S. corporate income tax return.\nAdditionally, Enact Mortgage Insurance Corporation, Enact Mortgage Reinsurance Corporation, Enact Mortgage Insurance Corporation\nof North Carolina and Enact Financial Assurance Corporation (collectively, the “MI Group”), were parties to a supplemental tax sharing\nagreement that allowed them to accelerate the utilization of benefits as if they filed a stand-alone MI Group federal income tax return, even if\nthose benefits had not been utilized in the consolidated federal return (“deemed used losses”). If any deemed used losses are subsequently\nactually used in a consolidated return, the members of the MI Group which received the benefit for such deemed used losses would not\nreceive a second benefit for such losses. Also, if any member of the MI Group received benefit for any deemed used losses and leaves the\nconsolidated group before such deemed used losses are actually used in a consolidated return, such member will repay such benefit\nreceived. Any benefits generated by the MI Group after January 1, 2021 will follow the TAA mentioned above, which does not allow for an\nacceleration when utilizing benefits.\nThe TAA prevents any allocation of tax to a separate company that is greater than the tax incurred on a separate company basis, subject\nto consolidated loss carry-forward adjustments. The total tax refund allocated to the MI Group, therefore, may exceed the consolidated tax\nrefund received.\nSeparate Return Method\nIf during the year ended December  31, 2022, we had computed taxes using the separate return method, the unaudited pro forma\nprovision for income taxes would remain unchanged.\n(9)\nEmployee benefits\nAs a consolidated company within Genworth, our employees are generally provided a number of Genworth employee benefits.\nGenworth, as sponsor of the plans described below (collectively, “Shared Plans”), is ultimately responsible for maintenance of these plans in\ncompliance with applicable laws. Our obligation results from an allocation of our share of expenses from Genworth’s plans based on benefits\neligible earnings. Benefits eligible earnings includes base pay, overtime, annual incentives and sales commissions.\nWe account for such Shared Plans as multiemployer benefit plans. Accordingly, we do not record an asset or liability to recognize the\nfunded status of the Shared Plans. We recognize a liability only for any required contributions to the Shared Plans that are accrued and\nunpaid at the balance sheet date, which is included within other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nPension and Retiree Health and Life Insurance Benefit Plans\nMost of our employees are enrolled in a qualified defined contribution pension plan sponsored by Genworth. The plan is 100% funded by\nGenworth. Genworth makes annual contributions to each employee’s pension plan account based on the employee’s age, service and\neligible pay. Employees are vested in the plan after three years of service. Expenses associated with the qualified defined contribution\npension plan were $2.1 million, $2.1 million, and $2.7 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIn addition, certain employees also participate in non-qualified defined contribution plans and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit\npension plans sponsored by Genworth. Expenses associated with non-qualified defined contribution plans were $1.2 million, $1.0 million and\n$0.8 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Expenses allocated to us for qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans\nwere $0.3 million, $0.4 million, and $0.3 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n148"

Under\nthis plan, retirees over 65 years of age receive a subsidy towards the purchase of a Medigap policy, and retirees under 65 years of age\nreceive medical benefits similar to our employees’ medical benefits. In December 2009, Genworth announced that eligibility for retiree\nmedical benefits will be limited to associates who were within 10 years of retirement eligibility as of January 1, 2010. Genworth also provides\nretiree life and long-term care insurance benefits. Expenses allocated to us for retiree health and life insurance benefits plans were $0.5\nmillion, $0.5 million and $0.5 million for the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSavings Plans\nOur employees participate in qualified and non-qualified defined contribution savings plans that allow employees to contribute a portion\nof their pay to the plan on a pre-tax basis. Genworth makes matching contributions equal to 100% of the first 4% of pay deferred by an\nemployee and 50% of the next 2% of pay deferred by an employee so that our matching contribution does not exceed 5% of an employee’s\npay. Employees do not vest immediately in Genworth matching contributions but fully vest in the matching contributions after two complete\nyears of service. One option available to employees in the defined contribution savings plan is the ClearCourse  variable annuity option\noffered by certain of Genworth’s life insurance subsidiaries.\nPrior to January 2021, employees also had the option of purchasing a fund which invests primarily in Genworth stock as part of the\ndefined contribution savings plan. Several years ago, Genworth had contracted with Newport Trust Company (“Newport”) to act as an\nindependent fiduciary and investment manager with respect to Genworth stock in the defined contribution savings plan. The independent\nfiduciary’s role is to act on behalf of a plan to protect the interests of participants and beneficiaries. As part of its on-going process, on\nJanuary 8, 2021, Newport froze the fund and accordingly, future investments or transfers into the fund are no longer permitted.\nOur cost associated with these plans was $3.2 million, $3.4 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and\n2020, respectively.\nHealth and Welfare Benefits for Active Employees\nWe provide health and welfare benefits to our employees, including health, life, disability dental and long-term care insurance, among\nothers. Our long-term care insurance is provided through Genworth’s long-term care insurance products.\n(10)\nShare-based compensation\nEHI share-based compensation\nBeginning with our initial public offering in 2021, we offer share-based awards to employees and directors including restricted stock units\n(“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) for employees and deferred stock units (“DSUs”) to directors. In 2021, the Enact Holdings,\nInc. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2021 Omnibus Plan”) was adopted and approved by EHI’s stockholders. Under the 2021 Omnibus\nincentive Plan, EHI was authorized to grant a maximum number of shares of Common Stock for issuance not to exceed 4 million shares.\nShare-based compensation expense under the 2021 Omnibus Plan was $9.9 million and $1.5 million, for the years ended December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively, and is recorded with acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals in the consolidated statement of\nincome.

For awards issued prior to\nJanuary 1, 2006, share-based compensation expense was recognized on a graded vesting attribution method over the awards’ respective\nvesting schedule. For awards issued after January 1, 2006, share-based compensation expense was recognized evenly on a straight-line\nattribution method over the awards’ respective vesting period.\nFor purposes of determining the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant, Genworth has historically used the\nBlack-Scholes Model. However, no SARs or stock options were granted during 2022, 2021 or 2020 and therefore the Black-Scholes Model\nwas not used in those respective years. The Black-Scholes Model requires the input of certain assumptions that involve judgment.\nCircumstances may change, and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to these assumptions and\nmethodologies.\nDuring 2021 and 2020, Genworth issued RSUs to our employees with average restriction periods of three years, with a fair value of\n$3.31 and $3.53, respectively, which were measured at the market price of a share of Genworth’s Class A Common Stock on the grant date.\nDuring 2021 and 2020, we granted PSUs with a weighted-average fair value of $3.45 and $3.03, respectively. The PSUs were granted at\nmarket price as of the approval date by Genworth’s Board of Directors. PSUs may be earned over a three-year period based upon the\nachievement of certain performance goals.\nThe PSUs granted in 2021 have a three-year measurement period starting on January 1, 2021, going through December 31, 2023. The\nperformance metrics are based on Genworth’s consolidated adjusted operating income and its stockholder return relative to certain of its\npeer companies as of the grant date.\nThe PSUs granted in 2020 have a three-year measurement period starting on January 1, 2020, going through December 31, 2022. The\nperformance metrics are based on adjusted operating income of Genworth’s U.S. Mortgage Insurance and Australia Mortgage Insurance\nsegments and gross incremental annual premiums in Genworth’s long-term care insurance business, defined as approved weighted-average\npremium rate increases multiplied by the annualized in-force premiums.\nFor all PSU awards granted, the compensation committee of Genworth’s Board of Directors determines and approves no later than\nMarch 15, following the end of the three-year performance period for each applicable performance period, the number of units earned and\nvested for each distinct performance period.\nExpense associated with our PSUs was less than $1.0 million in 2022, $1.3 million in 2021 and less than $1.0 million in 2020.\nIn 2021 and 2020, Genworth granted cash awards with a fair value of $1.00.

In addition, insurance departments have the right to permit other specific practices that may\ndeviate from prescribed practices. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any prescribed or permitted statutory accounting practices that\nresulted in reported statutory surplus or risk-to-capital ratios being different from what would have been reported had NAIC statutory\naccounting practices been followed.\nThe key areas where SSAP financial statements differ from financial statements presented on a U.S. GAAP basis include:\n(a) Under SSAP, mortgage insurance companies are required each year to establish a special contingency reserve in their statutory\nfinancial statements to provide for losses in the event of significant economic declines. Annual additions to the statutory contingency\nreserve must be at least 50% of net earned premiums earned in such year. Such amount must be maintained in the contingency\nreserve for 10 years, after which time it is released to unassigned surplus. Prior to 10 years, the contingency reserve may be\nreduced with regulatory approval to the extent that losses in any calendar year exceed 35% of earned premiums for such year.\n(b) Under SSAP, insurance policy acquisition costs are charged against operations in the year incurred. Under U.S. GAAP, such costs\nare deferred and amortized.\n(c) Under SSAP, income tax expense is calculated on the basis of amounts currently payable. Generally, deferred tax assets are\nrecognized under both SSAP and U.S. GAAP when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However,\nSSAP standards impose additional admissibility requirements whereby deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent they are\nexpected to be recovered within a one- to three-year period subject to a capital and surplus limitation. Changes in deferred tax\nassets and liabilities are recognized as a direct benefit or charge to unassigned surplus, whereas under U.S. GAAP changes in\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, except for changes in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, are recorded as\na component of income tax expense.\n(d) Under SSAP, most of our fixed maturity investments are recorded at amortized cost while securities with certain NAIC designations\nare carried at the lower of amortized cost or market value. Under U.S. GAAP, our fixed maturity securities are classified as available-\nfor-sale and are recorded at fair value, with the unrealized gain or loss recognized, net of tax, as an increase or decrease to\naccumulated other comprehensive income.\n(e) Under SSAP, certain assets, designated as non-admitted assets, are charged directly against statutory surplus. Such assets are\nreflected in our U.S. GAAP financial statements.\nThe table below presents statutory net income, statutory policyholders’ surplus and contingency reserve for the combined insurance\nsubsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31:\n(Amounts in thousands)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nStatutory net income\n$\n747,150  $\n593,093  $\n404,315 \nStatutory policyholders’ surplus\n$\n1,135,797  $\n1,397,229  $\n1,555,035 \nContingency reserve\n$\n3,551,022  $\n3,042,117  $\n2,518,194 \n157"

      "text": "ENACT HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYears Ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nStatutory Capital Requirements\nMortgage insurers are not subject to the NAIC’s risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements, but certain states and other regulators impose\nanother form of capital requirement on mortgage insurers requiring maintenance of a risk-to-capital ratio not to exceed 25:1. Our insurance\nsubsidiaries are domiciled in North Carolina. Fifteen other states maintain similar risk-to-capital requirements. As of December 31, 2022 and\n2021, the risk-to-capital ratio for our combined insurance subsidiaries under the current regulatory framework as established under North\nCarolina law and enforced by the North Carolina Department of Insurance (“NCDOI”) was approximately 12.8:1 and 12.2:1, respectively.\nEach of our insurance subsidiaries met its respective capital requirement as of 2022 and 2021.\nPMIERs Regulatory Requirements\nMortgage insurers must meet the private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements (“PMIERs”) as set forth by each GSE in order to\nremain eligible to insure loans that are purchased by the GSEs. Each approved mortgage insurer is required to provide the GSEs with an\nannual certification and a quarterly report as to its compliance with PMIERs.\nSince its adoption in 2015, PMIERs has been amended on several occasions, including as a result of COVID-19 (as amended, the\n“PMIERs Amendment”).\nThe PMIERs include financial requirements for mortgage insurers under which a mortgage insurer’s “Available Assets” (generally only\nthe most liquid assets of an insurer) must meet or exceed “Minimum Required Assets” (which are based on an insurer’s risk-in-force (“RIF”)\nand are calculated from tables of factors with several risk dimensions and are subject to a floor amount) and otherwise generally establish\nwhen a mortgage insurer is qualified to issue coverage that will be acceptable to the respective GSE for acquisition of high loan-to-value\n(“LTV”) mortgages. The GSEs may amend or waive PMIERs at their discretion, impose additional conditions or restrictions on us and also\nhave broad discretion to interpret PMIERs, which could impact the calculation of our “Available Assets” and/or “Minimum Required Assets.”\nThe amount of capital that EMICO may be required in the future to maintain the “Minimum Required Assets” as defined in PMIERs, and\noperate our business is dependent upon, among other things: (i) the way PMIERs are applied and interpreted by the GSEs and the Federal\nHousing Finance Agency (“FHFA”); (ii)  the future performance of the housing market; (iii) our generation of earnings in our business,\n“Available Assets” and “Minimum Required Assets,” reducing RIF and reducing delinquencies as anticipated, and writing anticipated amounts\nand types of new mortgage insurance business; and (iv) our overall financial performance, capital and liquidity levels. Depending on our\nactual experience, the amount of capital required under PMIERs may be higher than currently anticipated. In the absence of a premium\nincrease for new business, if we hold more capital relative to insured loans, our returns will be lower. We may be unable to increase premium\nrates for various reasons, principally due to competition. Our inability, to increase the capital as required in the anticipated timeframes and on\nthe anticipated terms, and to realize the anticipated benefits, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition. More particularly, our ability to continue to meet the PMIERs financial requirements and maintain a prudent amount of\ncapital in excess of those requirements, given the dynamic nature of asset valuations and requirement changes over time, is dependent\nupon, among other things: (i) our ability to complete credit risk transfer (“CRT”) transactions on our anticipated terms and timetable, which, as\napplicable, are subject to market conditions, third-party approvals and other actions (including approval by the GSEs), and other factors that\nare outside of our control and (ii) our ability to contribute holding company cash or other sources of capital to satisfy the portion of the\nfinancial requirements that are not satisfied through these transactions.\nThe PMIERs Amendment implemented both permanent and temporary revisions to PMIERs. For loans that became non-performing due\nto a COVID-19 hardship, PMIERs was amended with respect to each non-performing loan that (i) had an initial missed monthly payment\noccurring on or after March 1, 2020 and prior to April 1, 2021 or (ii) is subject to a forbearance plan granted in response to a financial\nhardship related to COVID-19, the terms of which are materially consistent with terms of forbearance\n158"

The risk-based required asset amount factor for a non-performing loan is the greater of (a) the applicable risk-\nbased required asset amount factor for a performing loan were it not delinquent, and (b) the product of a 0.30 multiplier and the applicable\nrisk-based required asset amount factor for a non-performing loan. In the case of (i) above, absent the loan being subject to a forbearance\nplan described in (ii) above, the 0.30 multiplier will be applicable for no longer than three calendar months beginning with the month in which\nthe loan became a non-performing loan due to having missed two monthly payments. Loans subject to a forbearance plan described in\n(ii) above include those that are either in a repayment plan or loan modification trial period following the forbearance plan unless reported to\nthe approved insurer that the loan is no longer in such forbearance plan, repayment plan, or loan modification trial period.\nThe PMIERs Amendment additionally made permanent revisions to the risk-based required asset amount factor for non-performing loans\nfor properties located in future Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”)-Declared Major Disaster Areas eligible for individual\nassistance.\nOur assessment of PMIERs compliance is based on a number of factors, including our understanding of the GSEs’ interpretation of the\nPMIERs financial requirements. The GSEs require our mortgage insurance subsidiaries not to exceed a maximum statutory RTC ratio of 18:1\nor they reserve the right to reevaluate the amount of PMIERs credit for reinsurance and other CRT transactions available under PMIERs\nindicated in their approval letters. Freddie Mac has also imposed additional requirements on our option to commute these reinsurance\nagreements. Both GSEs reserved the right to periodically review the reinsurance transactions for treatment under PMIERs. If we are unable\nto continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs, the GSE Restrictions (as defined herein) and any additional restrictions imposed\non us by the GSEs, we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have met all PMIERs reporting requirements as required by the GSEs. As of December 31, 2022, we had available assets of $5,206\nmillion against $3,156 million net required assets under PMIERs, compared to available assets of $5,077 million against $3,074 million net\nrequired assets as of December 31, 2021. The sufficiency above the published PMIERs financial requirements as of December 31, 2022,\nwas $2,050 million, compared to $2,003 million above the published PMIERs requirements as of December 31, 2021, resulting in a PMIERs\nsufficiency ratio of 165% as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, which in each case, was above the requirement imposed by the GSE\nRestrictions that required us to maintain a PMIERs sufficiency ratio of 120% in 2022 and 115% in 2021. In addition, our PMIERs required\nassets as of December  31, 2022 and December  31, 2021, benefited from the application of a 0.30 multiplier applied to the risk-based\nrequired asset amount factor for certain non-performing loans. The application of the 0.30 multiplier to all eligible delinquencies provided\n$132 million of benefit to our December 31, 2022 PMIERs required assets and $390 million to our December 31, 2021 required assets. Our\nCRT transactions provided an estimated aggregate of $1,578 million of PMIERs capital credit as of December 31, 2022 compared to $1,404\nmillion on as of December 31, 2021.\nDividend Restrictions\nThe majority of our investments are held by our regulated U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries which may be limited in their ability to\nmake dividends or distributions to a holding company in the future due to restrictions related to their capital levels. Our U.S. mortgage\ninsurance subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital on a statutory basis, as well as pursuant to the PMIERs promulgated by the\nGSEs. Moreover, even where such dividends or distributions would not cause capital to fall below the minimum levels required by state\ninsurance regulators and the GSEs, all proposed dividends or distributions, regardless of amount and source, by our U.S. mortgage\ninsurance subsidiaries are subject to review and potential disapproval by the North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance (the\n“Commissioner”). Within that general regulatory right of review process, there are three (3) minor procedural variances depending on (i) the\namount of the dividend or distribution as well as (ii) the source\n159"

As regards amount, dividends and distributions may be classified as either “ordinary” or “extraordinary.” (1) The review standard for\nan “ordinary” dividend or distribution is that notice must be given to the Commissioner 30 days in advance of the proposed payment date,\nduring which period the Commissioner may disapprove the proposed dividend or distribution. An “extraordinary dividend or distribution” is\ndefined by statute as one, which combined with all others made in the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer’s\nsurplus as regards policyholders as of the preceding December 31, or (ii) net income, excluding realized capital gains, for the 12-month\nperiod ending the preceding December 31. (2) The review standard for an “extraordinary” dividend or distribution is effectively the same as\nthat for an “ordinary” dividend or distribution that the insurer must give 30 days’ notice and the Commissioner has not disapproved the\nproposal in that 30-day period. For both “ordinary” and “extraordinary” dividends, the Commissioner has the option to affirmatively grant\napproval prior to the expiration of the 30-day notice period. (3) Finally, as regards source of funds, the payment of any dividend or distribution\nfrom any source other than unassigned surplus, regardless of the amount, requires prior written approval of the Commissioner. In each of the\nthree (3) instances, approval or non-disapproval of any dividend or distribution is based upon the reasonableness of the insurer’s surplus in\nrelation to its outstanding liabilities and the adequacy of its surplus relative to its financial needs. Based on estimated statutory results as of\nDecember 31, 2022, in accordance with applicable dividend restrictions, our insurance subsidiaries could pay dividends of approximately\n$292 million from unassigned surplus in 2023 without obtaining prior regulatory approval, although notice of the intent to pay must be\nprovided to the Commissioner 30 days in advance thereof during which period the Commissioner may review the dividend pursuant to\nstatutory standards.\n(16)\nEarnings per share\nThe basic earnings per share computation is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. For the\nyears ended December  31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the calculation of dilutive weighted average shares considers the impact of\nrestricted stock units and performance stock units issued to employees as well deferred stock units issued to our directors.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of December 31, 2022, an evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including\nour Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules\n13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief\nFinancial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in\nExchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of\nany evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nWith the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated\nFramework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our\nmanagement has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.\nOur independent auditor, KPMG LLP, a registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting which appears below.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d)\nor 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n168"

      "text": "REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nEnact Holdings, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Enact Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as\nof December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\nconsolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income,\ncomprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the\nrelated notes and financial statement schedules I to II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 28,\n2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the\neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over\nFinancial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our\naudit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the\nrisk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the\nassessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that\nour audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of\nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n169"

The description of the relevant provisions of our\namended and restated certificate of incorporation (“Certificate of Incorporation”), amended and restated bylaws (“Bylaws”) and the General\nCorporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full\ntext of the documents. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report and are incorporated by\nreference herein\nWe have one class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act: Common stock, par value $0.01 per share\n(“common stock”).\nGeneral\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes 600,000,000 shares of common stock $0.01 par value per share, and 50,000,000 shares\nof undesignated preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, (“preferred stock”) the rights, preferences and privileges of which may be\ndesignated from time to time by our board of directors. We currently do not have any preferred stock outstanding.\nCommon Stock\nDividend Rights\nSubject to preferences that may apply to shares of our preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of outstanding shares of\nour common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of funds legally available if our board of directors, in its discretion, determines to issue\ndividends and only then at the times and in the amounts that our board of directors may determine, subject to any statutory, regulatory or\ncontractual restrictions on the payment of dividends.\nVoting Rights\nThe holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share with respect to each matter presented to our stockholders on\nwhich the holders of our common stock are entitled to vote; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of common\nstock, are not entitled to vote on any amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation, including any certificate of designations relating to any\nseries of preferred stock, that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of preferred stock if the holders of such affected\nseries are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to the Certificate\nof Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of preferred stock) or the DGCL. Holders of our common stock\nwill not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors.\nNo Preemptive or Similar Rights\nOur common stock is not entitled to preemptive rights and is not subject to redemption or sinking fund provisions.\nRight to Receive Liquidation Distributions\nUpon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders would be distributable\nratably among the holders of our common stock and any participating preferred stock outstanding at that time, subject to prior satisfaction of\nall outstanding debt and liabilities"

Our board of directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of any series of\npreferred stock, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by our stockholders.\nOur board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting\npower or other rights of the holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with\npossible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change\nin our control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common\nstock.\nRegistration Rights\nWe entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with Genworth Financial, Inc. (the “Parent”),\npursuant to which our Parent is able to require us, beginning after the 180-day lock-up period, to file one or more registration statements with\nthe SEC covering the public resale of registrable securities beneficially owned by our Parent or to effect a shelf takedown offering. We are\nrequired to bear the registration expenses, other than the underwriting discount and transfer taxes, associated with any registration of stock\npursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. The Registration Rights Agreement includes customary indemnification provisions in favor of\nour Parent, any person who is or might be deemed a control person (within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the\n“Securities Act”) and the Exchange Act) and related parties against certain losses and liabilities (including reasonable costs of investigation\nand legal expenses) arising out of or based upon any filing or other disclosure made by us under the securities laws relating to any such\nregistration. Our Parent additionally has “piggyback” rights, pursuant to which our Parent is entitled to participate in certain registrations or\nofferings we may undertake, subject to cutback in certain cases.\nMaster Agreement\nUnder the terms of the master agreement that we entered into with our Parent in connection with our initial public offering (the\n“Master Agreement”), our Parent is entitled to designate a certain number of persons to our board of directors and certain committees thereof\ndepending on the beneficial ownership by our Parent of our outstanding common stock. In addition, for so long as our Parent beneficially\nowns more than 50% of our outstanding common stock, we are required to seek the prior written consent of our Parent to take various\nsignificant corporation actions (subject to certain exceptions).\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\nThe provisions of the DGCL, our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws could have the effect of delaying, deferring or\ndiscouraging another person from acquiring control of our company. These provisions, which are summarized below, are expected to\ndiscourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and encourage persons seeking to acquire control of\nour company to first negotiate with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to\nnegotiate with an unfriendly or unsolicited acquirer outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging a proposal to acquire us because negotiation\nof these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms."

Our Certificate of Incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting.\nIssuance of Undesignated Preferred Stock\nAs discussed above, our board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to 50,000,000\nshares of undesignated preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by our board of\ndirectors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of our preferred stock enables our board of directors to render more difficult or to\ndiscourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise.\nAbility to Fill Vacancies\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the Master Agreement and the rights of one or more series of preferred stock then\noutstanding, (i) any newly created directorship or any vacancy on the Board of Directors for any cause, shall be filled solely by a majority of\nthe directors then in office, even if less than a quorum remains, or by the sole remaining director, and (ii) the right of stockholders to fill\nvacancies on the Board of Directors is hereby specifically denied.\nStockholder Action by Written Consent; Special Meetings of Stockholders\nSubject to the terms of any series of preferred stock, (i) for so long as Parent beneficially owns (directly or indirectly) at least a\nmajority of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the\n“Voting Stock”), any action that is required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders may be effected by consent in lieu of a meeting and\n(ii) if Parent no longer beneficially owns (directly or indirectly) at least a majority of the Voting Stock, any action required or permitted to be\ntaken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of our stockholders and may not be effected by any\nconsent in lieu of a meeting. In addition, except as otherwise required by law, special meetings of our stockholders, for any purpose or\npurposes, may be called at any time only (i) by the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, (ii) by our Chief Executive Officer (or, in the\nabsence of a Chief Executive Officer, the President), (iii) pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by a majority of the Board of Directors or (iv)\nso long as Parent beneficially owns (directly or indirectly) at least 50% or more of the Voting Stock, by the Secretary of the Company at the\nrequest of the holders of shares representing at least 50% of the Voting Stock. Other than as set forth in clause (iv) of the preceding\nsentence, stockholders cannot otherwise call a special meeting of stockholders.\nRequirements for Advance Notification of Stockholder Nominations and Proposals\nOur Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and stockholder nomination of candidates for\nelection as directors. For any matter to be “properly brought” before a meeting, a stockholder will have to comply with advance notice\nrequirements and provide us, as applicable, among other things, with certain information related to the stockholder giving the notice, the\nbeneficial owner (if any) on whose behalf the nomination is made, and information about the proposal or nominee for election to the Board of\nDirectors."
