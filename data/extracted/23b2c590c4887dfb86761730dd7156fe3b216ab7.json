      "text": "Dear Shareholders, Customers \nand Friends,\nWe are continuing to navigate \nthrough the lingering challenges \nof the pandemic and respond \nto changing market conditions, \ndriven by the steep and rapid \nrise in interest rates. The Federal \nOpen Market Committee (“FOMC”) \nresponded to sharply elevated price \ninflation, brought on by supply chain \nconstraints and international unrest, \nincluding the war in Ukraine, by \nincreasing the target federal funds \nrange a total of 425 basis points in \nseven tightening actions in 2022. \nThe unprecedented pace of the rate \nincreases has lowered asset values \nand has begun to put pressure \non bank net interest margins, as \nincreases in funding costs are \nbeginning to surpass earning asset \nyields.\nStrong 2022 financial performance.\nAlthough 2022 presented challenges, \nFNCB posted a strong earnings \nperformance as we remained focused \non executing strategic initiatives \ndesigned to advance financial \nperformance and create efficiencies \nover the long-term, while delivering \nexceptional service and support to \nthe customers and communities we \nserve. We reported net income for \n2022 of $20.1 million, or $1.03 per \ndiluted common share compared to \nnet income of $21.4 million, or $1.06 \nper diluted common share, in 2021. \nThe $1.0 million, or 4.4% decrease \nprimarily reflected increases in non-\ninterest expense and the provision \nfor loan and lease losses, partially \noffset by an increase in net interest \nincome. Return on average assets \nand return on average shareholders’ \nequity equaled 1.21% and 15.55%, \nrespectively in 2022, compared to \n1.36% and 13.46%, respectively in \n2021. \nWe experienced a $5.3 million, or \n10.5%, increase in tax-equivalent net \ninterest income to $55.2 million in \n2022 from $49.9 million in 2021, as \na greater amount of tax-equivalent \ninterest income was partially reduced \nby an increase in interest expense. \nStrong earning asset growth and \nan increase in the yield on earning \nassets contributed to a $9.3 million, \nor 17.6%, increase in tax-equivalent \ninterest income to $61.9 million in \n2022 from $52.6 million in 2021. \nAverage earning assets increased \n$183.5 million, or 12.7%, to $1.633 \nbillion in 2022 compared to $1.449 \nbillion in 2021. Specifically, average \nloans and leases increased $123.9 \nmillion, or 13.0%, to $1.074 billion \nin 2022 from $950.5 million in 2021, \nwhich reflected new lending product \nofferings, strong organic loan demand \nand the purchase of third-party \noriginated loans and loan pools. \nAlso contributing to the increase in \naverage earning assets was a $120.4 \nmillion, or 28.0%, increase in average \ninvestment securities to $550.0 \nmillion in 2022, compared to $429.6 \nmillion in 2021. Partially offsetting \nthe higher amount of tax-equivalent \ninterest income was a $4.0 million, or \n148.9%, increase in interest expense \nto $6.7 million in 2022 from $2.7 \nmillion in 2021. Greater reliance on \nwholesale funding and increases in \ndeposit costs due to higher deposit \nrates and increased competition \nfor deposits in our market area \ncontributed to the increase in interest \nexpense. Like the banking industry \nin general, FNCB was more reliant \non wholesale funding in 2022, \nwhich resulted in the $97.3 million \nincrease in average borrowed funds \nto $109.5 million in 2022 compared \nto just $12.2 million in 2021. For the \nfirst half of 2022, management was \nsuccessful in stalling deposit rate \nincreases, however in the latter half \nof 2022, additional rate increases, \nand heightened competition caused \nus to respond with increases in \ndeposit rates, which was the primary \nfactor leading to a 30-basis point \nincrease in the cost of funds to 0.55% \nin 2022 from 0.25% in 2021. The \ntax-equivalent net interest margin \ncompressed seven basis points to \n3.38% in 2022 from 3.45% in 2021. \nFNCB recorded a provision for loan \nand lease losses of $2.0 million in \n2022, compared to $166 thousand in \n2021, which primarily reflected higher \nloan and lease volumes. Non-interest \nincome decreased $287 thousand, \nor 3.5%, to $8.0 million compared \nto $8.3 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2021. The year over \nyear decrease in non-interest income \nresulted primarily from an unfavorable \nchange in market value of equity \nsecurities and net loss on the sale \nof available-for-sale debt securities, \ncoupled with reductions in net gains \non the sale of mortgages held for sale, \nand loan related fees. Non-interest \nexpense totaled $35.5 million in 2022, \nan increase of $4.4 million, or 14.2%, \nfrom $31.1 million in 2021, which \nprimarily reflected increases in salaries \nand employee benefits, professional \nfees, data processing, regulatory \nassessments, and other operating \nexpenses. These increases were \nreflected in the increase in the Bank’s \nefficiency ratio to 55.06% in 2022, \ncompared to 53.63% in 2021. \nWe continue to focus on providing \nan annual return to our shareholders \nthat is meaningful and aligned with \nour peers.

We are pleased to say that \non January 25, 2023, the Board of \nDirectors approved an increase in the \nfirst quarter 2023 dividend of $0.015 \nper share, or 25.0%, to $0.090 per \nshare from $0.075 per share for the \nsame quarter of 2022.   \nStrong balance sheet positioning \nand favorable asset quality.\nTotal assets increased $81.2 million, or \n4.9%, to $1.746 billion at December 31, \n2022, from $1.664 billion at December \n31, 2021.  The strong balance sheet \ngrowth reflected substantial increases \nin loans and leases, net of allowance \nfor loan and lease losses, of $143.1 \nmillion, or 14.8%, to $1.110 billion \nat December 31, 2022, from $967.0 \nmillion at December 31, 2021. While, \navailable-for-sale debt securities \ndecreased $46.5 million, or 8.9%, to \n$476.1 million, from $522.6 million \nat December 31, 2021, caused largely \nby a decline in the fair value of these \nsecurities due to rising interest rates. \nTotal deposits decreased $34.8 \nmillion, or 2.4%, to $1.421 billion \nat December 31, 2022 from $1.455 \nbillion at December 31, 2021, which \nreflected the return of municipal \ndeposit seasonality and the outflow \nof excess COVID-19 deposits. FNCB \nincreased its utilization of wholesale \nfunding, specifically advances \nthrough the Federal Home Loan Bank \n(“FHLB”) of Pittsburgh, to fund loan \ngrowth. As a result, borrowed funds \nincreased $152.1 million, or 501.6%, \nto $182.4 million at December 31, \n2022, compared to $30.3 million at \nDecember 31, 2021.   \nFNCB’s asset quality was favorable \nthroughout 2022, as total non-\nperforming loans decreased $1.0 \nmillion to $2.8 million, or 0.25% \nof total loans, at December 31, \n2022, from $3.8 million, or 0.39% of \ntotal loans, at December 31, 2021. \nFNCB’s loan delinquency rate (total \ndelinquent loans as a percentage of \ntotal loans) was 0.45% at December \n31, 2022 compared to 0.55% at the \nend of 2021. FNCB’s strong asset \nquality reflects continued discipline \nin our lending practices and our \nproactive attention with respect to \ncredit management. We recorded a \nprovision for loan and lease losses \nof $2.0 million in 2022, compared \nto $166 thousand in 2021, which \nprimarily reflected the increase in loan \nand lease volumes. The allowance for \nloan and lease losses as a percentage \nof gross loans was 1.26% at December \n31, 2022 and 1.27% at December 31, \n2021.  \nTotal shareholders’ equity decreased \n$43.6 million, or 26.8%, to $118.9 \nmillion at December 31, 2022, from \n$162.5 million at December 31, 2021.  \nThe decrease in capital was primarily \ndue to an accumulated other \ncomprehensive loss of $48.0 million \nat December 31, 2022, compared to \naccumulated other comprehensive \nincome of $6.4 million at December \n31, 2021. The negative change of \n$54.4 million related primarily to \nthe depreciation in the fair value of \nFNCB’s available-for-sale securities, \nnet of deferred taxes, due to changing \nmarket conditions and rise in interest \nrates. Also impacting capital in 2022 \nwas net income of $20.4 million \npartially offset by dividends declared \nand paid in 2022 of $6.5 million and \ncommon share repurchases of $3.6 \nmillion. FNCB Bank was considered \nwell-capitalized with total risk-based \ncapital and Tier I leverage ratios of \n13.11% and 8.77%, respectively, at \nDecember 31, 2022. \nDiversifying, expanding product \nofferings, and implementing new \ntechnologies.\nIn 2022, FNCB’s new commercial \nequipment financing and leasing \nproduct offerings, operating under \n1st Equipment Finance were fully \nintegrated with originations in \n2022 that exceeded initial budget \nexpectations.

Tax-free municipal leases \noriginated under this initiative \nare included in state and political \nsubdivisions were $4.4 million at \nDecember 31, 2022 and $2.4 million \nat December 31, 2021. This along with \nthe purchase of several third-party \noriginated loan pools, allowed us to \ndiversify FNCB’s loan portfolio, reduce \nrisk and enhance net interest income \nrun rates going forward.\nIn addition, during 2022, FNCB \nacquired Chiaro Investment \nServices, LLC (“CIS”), through an \nasset purchase agreement. CIS \nwas combined with FNCB’s wealth \nmanagement team, and now operates \nunder a new brand, 1st Investment \nServices, with offices located in \nDunmore, Lackawanna County, \nPennsylvania and at FNCB Bank’s \nExeter Community Office, in Luzerne \nCounty, Pennsylvania.

These \nproducts and services will help us \nto strengthen and build long-lasting \ncustomer relationships, through all \nthe stages of life for our clients.\nWith the continuous shift from \nnon-traditional banking, FNCB \nremained committed to a “digital \nfirst” philosophy. A key component \nof this philosophy was developing \na digital road map to identify \ntactics and projects that align with \nstrategy. This includes utilizing in-\nhouse experts to manage projects \nthat improve existing technology \nchannels and empowering employees \nto make recommendations to \nimprove processes. Externally, we \nreview, analyze, and test the latest \ntechnology provided by 3rd parties \nand invest, where necessary, to \ndeliver our strategic plans. \nA key component of the digital \nfirst philosophy remains enhanced \nsecurity. We continually analyze \nsecurity technology and process \ncontrols to limit fraud for the \ncustomer and the Bank. Additionally, \nwe conduct cyber breach desktop \nexercises to simulate multiphase, \nreal-world attacks to identify any \npotential vulnerabilities in the Bank’s \ndigital environment.\nThe end goal is to make a simply \nbetter and safe banking experience for \nour customers by delivering a secure \ndigital journey free of roadblocks.\nRevitalizing and repurposing while \ncreating efficiencies.\nIn 2022, we continued to evolve our \ncloud-based enterprise dashboard \nand analytics platform that combines \nhigh-value, actionable data from our \ncore operating systems into a user-\nfriendly, dynamic, and analytical \ntool to enhance management \nreporting, and provide insights that \nwill drive profitability, efficiency, and \nproductivity. \nWe also made enhancements \nto our existing online banking \nplatforms, with the integration of \nour commercial lending origination \nplatform, while looking to utilize \nartificial intelligence and robotics to \nstreamline workflows.\nManagement continually evaluates \nand employs assets to maximize their \nutility and benefits to the Bank, while \ncreating efficiencies and reducing \ncosts. In early 2022, the Bank’s \nWheeler Avenue community office \nwas consolidated into its Dunmore \nMain community office. The Wheeler \nAvenue location will be utilized as a \ntemporary training facility until the \nexpiration of the lease in December \n2024.  Also in 2022, the additional \noffice space at FNCB’s community \noffice, located in Exeter, Luzerne \nCounty, Pennsylvania was renovated \nand repurposed to house the 1st \nEquipment Finance and 1st Investment \nServices teams.\nIn September 2022, the Bank \npurchased a property located at \n2039 Delaware Street, Dunmore, \nLackawanna County, Pennsylvania. \nThe property, which is situated \nbetween the FNCB’s Main Office and \nCorporate Center, was purchased as \npart of FNCB’s Simply Green initiative. \nFNCB plans to raze the building \nto provide green space for the \ncommunity.\nMeaningful community outreach \nand support.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, \nFNCB committed to a total equity \ninvestment of $11.0 million in a \nsenior low-income housing tax \ncredit (“LIHTC”) partnership for the \nScranton Square Apartments through \nthe Pennsylvania Housing Finance \nAgency (PHFA).

Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must \nremain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of deposit accounts, management \nconsiders the interest rates offered by its competitors, the interest rates available on Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") of \nPittsburgh advances and other wholesale funding, its liquidity needs and customer preferences.

FNCB faces direct competition in originating loans and \nin attracting deposits from a significant number of financial institutions operating in its market area, many with a statewide \nor regional presence, and in some cases, a national presence, as well as other financial and non-financial institutions outside \nof its market area through online loan and deposit product offerings. Competition comes principally from other banks, savings \ninstitutions, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, internet-based financial technology (“FinTech”) companies and, \nwith respect to deposits, institutions offering investment alternatives, including money market funds and online deposit \naccounts. The increased competition has resulted from changes in the legal and regulatory guidelines, as well as from \neconomic conditions. The cost of regulatory compliance remains high for community banks as compared to their larger \ncompetitors that are able to achieve economies of scale.  \n  \nAs a result of consolidation in the banking industry, some of the Bank’s competitors and their respective affiliates are larger \nand may enjoy advantages such as greater financial resources, a wider geographic presence, a wider array of services, or \nmore favorable pricing alternatives and lower origination and operating costs. FNCB considers its major competitors to be \nlocal commercial banks as well as other commercial banks with branches in its market area. Competitors may offer deposits \nat higher rates and loans with lower fixed rates, more attractive terms and less stringent credit structures than FNCB has been \nable to offer. The growth and profitability of FNCB depends on its continued ability to successfully compete. Management \nbelieves interest rates on deposits, especially money market and time deposits, and interest rates and fees charged on loans \nwithin FNCB’s market area to be very competitive. \n  \nSupervision and Regulation \n  \nFNCB and the Bank operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a variety of statutes, regulations, and policies, \nas well as ongoing regulatory supervision and review. Federal statutes that apply to FNCB and the Bank include the Gramm \nLeach Bliley Act (“GLB Act”), the Bank Holding Company Act (“BHCA”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the USA Patriot Act, the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Act. The Bank is subject primarily to the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and, as a state-chartered \nfinancial institution, to the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965. In general, these statutes, regulations promulgated in \naccordance with these statutes, and interpretations of the statutes and regulations by the banking regulatory agencies establish \nthe eligible business activities of FNCB and the Bank, certain acquisition and merger restrictions, limitations on intercompany \ntransactions, such as loans and dividends, and capital adequacy requirements, among other things. These laws, regulations \nand policies are subject to frequent change and FNCB takes measures to comply with applicable requirements. The following \nsummarizes some of the more significant provisions of these laws as they relate to FNCB and the Bank. \n  \nFNCB \n  \nFNCB is a bank holding company within the meaning of the BHCA and is registered with, and subject to regulation and \nexamination by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”). FNCB is required to file annual and \nquarterly reports with the FRB and to provide the FRB with such additional information that they may require. BHCA and \nother federal laws subject bank holding companies to restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to \na range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and \nregulations and unsafe and unsound banking practices. \n  \nThe BHCA requires approval of the FRB for, among other things, the acquisition of direct or indirect ownership or control \nof more than five percent (5%) of the voting securities or substantially all the assets of any bank or bank holding company, \nor before the merger or consolidation with another bank holding company.  \n   \nWith certain limited exceptions, a bank holding company is prohibited from acquiring control of any voting shares of any \ncompany which is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in any activity other than \nbanking or managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing services for its authorized subsidiaries.  A \nbank holding company may, however, engage in, or acquire an interest in a company that engages in, activities that the FRB \nhas determined by order or regulation to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly \nincidental thereto.  In making such a determination, the FRB is required to consider whether the performance of such activities \ncan reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as convenience, increased competition, or gains in \nefficiency, which outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair"

The FRB is also empowered to differentiate between activities \ncommenced de novo and activities commenced by the acquisition, in whole or in part, of a going concern.  Some of the \nactivities that the FRB has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking include making or servicing loans, \nperforming certain data processing services, acting as a fiduciary or investment or financial advisor, and making investments \nin corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare. \n  \nSubsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on any \nextensions of credit to the bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, or investments in the stock or other \nsecurities thereof, and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower.  Further, a holding \ncompany and any subsidiary bank are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with the \nextension of credit.  \n  \nThe GLB Act allows a bank holding company or other company to certify status as a financial holding company, which \nallows such company to engage in activities that are financial in nature, that are incidental to such activities, or are \ncomplementary to such activities without further approval. The GLB Act enumerates certain activities that are deemed \nfinancial in nature, such as underwriting insurance or acting as an insurance principal, agent or broker, underwriting, dealing \nin or making markets in securities, and engaging in merchant banking under certain restrictions. The GLB Act also authorizes \nthe FRB to determine by regulation what other activities are financial in nature, or incidental or complementary thereto. \nFNCB has not elected to be treated as a financial holding company. \n  \nFNCB also is subject to the periodic reporting requirements and anti-fraud regulations of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission (“SEC”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\") and, in connection with \nthe offer and sale of securities, including FNCB's securities, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. \n  \nFNCB’s shares of common stock are listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol \"FNCB.\" Accordingly, FNCB is \nsubject to certain financial, liquidity and corporate governance requirements imposed by Nasdaq. Non-compliance of these \nrequirements could subject FNCB to potential denial of listing, or additional conditions, as necessary, to protect investors \nand the public interest.  \n  \nThe Bank \n  \nEffective June 30, 2016, upon its conversion to a state charter, the Bank is regulated by the Pennsylvania Department of \nBanking and Securities (“PADOBS”). The Bank’s deposit accounts are insured up to the maximum legal limit by the Deposit \nInsurance Fund of the FDIC and accordingly, the Bank is also regulated by the FDIC. The regulations of the PADOBS and \nthe FDIC govern most aspects of the Bank’s business, including required reserves against deposits, loans, investments, \nmergers and acquisitions, borrowings, dividends and location and number of branch offices. The laws and regulations \ngoverning the Bank generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund, and not to \nprotect shareholders. \n  \nBranching and Interstate Banking. The federal banking agencies are generally authorized to approve interstate bank merger \ntransactions. \n  \nThe Dodd-Frank Act amended federal banking law to permit banks to establish de novo branches in other states to the same \nextent as a bank chartered by that state would be so permitted. The interstate banking and branching provisions of the federal \nbanking laws would permit the Bank to merge with banks in other states and branch into other states and would also permit \nbanks from other states to acquire banks in the Bank's market area and to establish de novo branches in the Bank’s market \narea. \n  \nUSA Patriot Act and the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”). Under the BSA, a financial institution is required to have systems in \nplace to detect certain transactions, based on the size and nature of the transaction. Financial institutions are generally required \nto report cash transactions involving more than $10,000 to the United States Treasury. In addition, financial institutions are \nrequired to file suspicious activity reports for transactions that involve more than $5,000 and that the financial institution \nknows, suspects or has reason to suspect, involve illegal funds, are designed to evade the requirements of the BSA or have \nno lawful purpose. Under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and \nObstruct Terrorism Act, commonly referred to as the “USA Patriot Act” or the “Patriot Act,” financial institutions are subject \nto prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence standards \nintended to detect, and prevent, the use of the United States financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing \nactivities. The Patriot Act requires financial institutions, including banks, to establish anti-money laundering programs, \nincluding employee training and independent audit requirements, meet minimum specified standards, follow minimum"

Federal banking agencies have adopted risk-based capital adequacy and leverage capital \nadequacy requirements pursuant to which they assess the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising banks and bank \nholding companies and in analyzing bank regulatory applications. Risk-based capital requirements determine the adequacy \nof capital based on the risk inherent in various classes of assets and off-balance sheet items. \n  \nFinancial institutions are subject to extensive and detailed capital requirements, which generally follow a framework of rules \nadopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision commonly referred to as Basel III. Basel III calls for the following \ncapital requirements: \n  \n  \n● \nA minimum ratio of common equity tier I (“CET I”) capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%. \n  \n● \nA minimum ratio of tier I capital to risk-weighted assets of 6%. \n  \n● \nA minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%. \n  \n● \nA minimum leverage ratio of 4%. \n  \nBasel III provides for a \"capital conservation buffer\" of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum capital requirements for each \nof the CET I, tier I capital, and total capital ratios. The buffer must consist entirely of CET I capital. As a result, if a banking \norganization does not have a CET I, Tier I capital, and total capital ratios of at least 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively, its \nability to make or commit to discretionary dividends and discretionary bonus payments to \"executive officers\" or engage in \nshare repurchases or redemptions generally will be restricted in accordance with a pre-determined \"maximum payout \nratio.\"  Under the maximum payout ratio formula, a banking organization with a capital conservation buffer of less than 2.5% \nof risk-weighted assets would become subject to increasingly restrictive limitations on covered distributions (as a percentage \nof eligible retained income) as the capital conservation buffer decreases. \n   \nBasel III provides for new deductions from and adjustments to CET I. These include, for example, under current rules, the \nrequirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant \ninvestments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET I to the extent that any one such category exceeds \n25.00% of CET I. \n  \nBasel III also imposed changes to methodologies for determining risk weighted assets, including revisions to recognition of \ncredit risk mitigation, such as a greater recognition of financial collateral and a wider range of eligible guarantors, the risk \nweighting of equity exposures and past due loans, and higher (greater than 100%) risk weighting for certain commercial real \nestate exposures that have higher credit risk profiles, including higher loan to value and equity components. \n  \nDuring 2018, the FRB raised the threshold of its \"Small Bank Holding Company\" exemption to the application of \nconsolidated capital requirements for qualifying small bank holding companies from $1 billion to $3 billion of consolidated \nassets. Consequently, qualifying bank holding companies having less than $3 billion of consolidated assets are not subject to \nthe consolidated capital requirements unless otherwise directed by the FRB. As of December 31, 2022, FNCB qualifies as a \nsmall bank holding company and is therefore not subject to the consolidated capital requirements. \n  \nUnder the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act enacted in May 2018, federal banking \nagencies adopted the community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) framework available to depository institutions having less \nthan $10 billion in total assets and meeting certain other qualifying criteria. The CBLR rules provide that qualifying \ncommunity banking organizations that adopt the CBLR framework and that maintain a CBLR in excess of 9% will be \nconsidered to have met the generally applicable leverage and risk-based capital requirements under the banking agencies’ \ncapital rules and the capital ratio requirements necessary to be considered “well capitalized.” FNCB has not elected to use \nthe CBLR framework at this time. \n  \nPrompt Corrective Action. Under Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (\"FDIA\"), each federal banking agency is \nrequired to implement a system of prompt corrective action for an insured institution which it regulates. The federal banking \nagencies have promulgated substantially similar regulations, which integrate Basel III capital requirements, to implement the \nsystem of prompt corrective action established by Section 38 of the FDIA."

Federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators. \nThis enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist \nor removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. In general, \nthese enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other \nactions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with \nregulatory authorities. \n  \nThe Bank and its “institution-affiliated parties,” including its management, employees, agents, independent contractors, \nconsultants such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the financial institution’s affairs, \nare subject to potential civil and criminal penalties for violations of law, regulations or written orders of a governmental \nagency. In addition, regulators are provided with greater flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and \ninstitution-affiliated parties. Possible enforcement actions include the termination of deposit insurance and cease-and-desist \norders. Such orders may, among other things, require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or \npractice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnifications or guarantees against loss. A financial institution may also \nbe ordered to restrict its growth, dispose of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts, or take other actions as determined \nby the ordering agency to be appropriate. \n  \nUnder provisions of the federal securities laws, a determination by a court or regulatory agency that certain violations have \noccurred at a company, or its affiliates can result in fines, restitution, a limitation of permitted activities, disqualification to \ncontinue to conduct certain activities and an inability to rely on certain favorable exemptions. Certain types of infractions \nand violations can also affect a public company in its timing and ability to expeditiously issue new securities into the capital \nmarkets. \n  \nThe regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and \nenforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the \nestablishment of adequate loan loss allowances for regulatory purposes."

      "text": "10 \nThe Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act made significant changes to the bank regulatory structure and affects the lending, \ndeposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. To date, the \nfollowing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are considered to be of the greatest significance to FNCB: \n  \n  \n● \nexpands the authority of the FRB to examine bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, including insured \ndepository institutions; \n  \n● \nrequires a bank holding company to be well capitalized and well managed to receive approval of an interstate bank \nacquisition; \n  \n● \nprovides mortgage reform provisions regarding a customer’s ability to pay and making more loans subject to \nprovisions for higher-cost loans and new disclosures; \n  \n● \ncreated the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) that has rulemaking authority for a wide range of \nconsumer protection laws that apply to all banks and has broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection \nlaws; \n  \n● \nmade permanent the $250 thousand limit for federal deposit insurance at all insured depository institutions; \n  \n● \nincludes additional corporate governance and executive compensation requirements on companies subject to the \nExchange Act; \n  \n● \npermits FDIC-insured banks to pay interest on business demand deposits; \n  \n● \nrequires that holding companies and other companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository \ninstitution serve as a source of financial strength; \n  \n● \ncreated the Financial Stability Oversight Council with authority to identify institutions and practices that might pose \na systemic risk; and \n  \n● \npermits national and state banks to establish interstate branches to the same extent as the branch host state allows \nestablishment of in-state branches. \n  \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau and Consumer Lending Regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, which \nis granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, \nincluding the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act \n(“RESPA”), Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the \nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with \nrespect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by \nthe CFPB but continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. \nThe CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer \nfinancial products. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the \norigination of residential mortgages including, in certain circumstances, a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. \nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act allows certain borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan \nother than a “qualified mortgage” as defined by the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection \nlaws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state \nattorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. \n  \nThe CFPB’s rulemaking, examination and enforcement authority has and will continue to significantly affect financial \ninstitutions offering consumer financial products and services, including FNCB and the Bank. These regulatory activities \nmay limit the types of financial services and products the Bank may offer, which in turn may reduce FNCB’s revenues. \n  \nFDIC Insurance Premiums. Under the FDIC's risk-based assessment system, deposit insurance assessments are based on \neach insured institution's total assets less tangible equity, thereby basing deposit insurance assessments on an institution’s \ntotal liabilities, not only insured deposits. A bank’s assessment is calculated by multiplying its individual assessment rate by \nits assessment base (average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity), determined quarterly. Banks with assets \nless than $10 billion, such as the Bank, are assigned an individual rate based on a formula using financial data and the bank’s \nCAMELS (capital adequacy, assets, management capability, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity) ratings. \n  \nAt December 31, 2022, the Bank was considered in the lowest risk category, for deposit insurance assessments and paid an \nannual assessment rate ranging from 0.0003 basis points to 0.0006 basis points on the assessment base of average \nconsolidated total assets less the average tangible equity during the assessment period."

FNCB’s revenues (on a parent company only basis) and its ability \nto pay dividends to its shareholders, or repurchase shares from its shareholders, are almost entirely dependent upon the receipt \nof dividends from the Bank. The right of FNCB, and consequently the rights of its creditors and shareholders to participate \nin any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary through the payment of such dividends or otherwise is \nnecessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiary (including depositors) except to the extent that claims of \nFNCB, in its capacity as a creditor, may be recognized.

      "text": "12 \nItem 1A.  \nRisk Factors \n  \nThe operations and financial results of FNCB are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below. \nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones FNCB faces. Additional risks and uncertainties FNCB is \nunaware of, or currently believes are not material, may also become important factors affecting FNCB. If any of the following \nrisks occur, FNCB’s business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely \naffected. In that event, the price of the FNCB’s common stock could decline. \n  \nRisks Related to FNCB’s Business \n  \nWeakness in the economic environment, in general, and within FNCB’s market area could pose significant challenges \nfor FNCB and could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. \n  \nFNCB’s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the \nspecific local markets in which it operates. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically \ndiversified, FNCB provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in the Lackawanna, Luzerne, and Wayne \nCounty markets. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for FNCB’s products \nand services as well as the ability of customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans, and the stability of \ndeposit funding sources. A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of \nterrorism, severe weather or natural disasters, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences, \nunemployment, changes in securities markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have \na material adverse effect on FNCB’s financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, weakness in economic \nconditions could result in one or more of the following: \n  \n  \n● \nA decrease in the demand for FNCB's loans and other products and services; \n  \n● \nA decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for FNCB's savings and other deposit products; and \n  \n● \nAn increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under\nbankruptcy laws, or default on their loans or other obligations. \n  \nAn increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or defaults could result in a higher level of non-performing assets, \nnet charge-offs, and provision for loan and lease losses. The markets FNCB serves are dependent on retail and service-related \nbusinesses and, thus, are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectors. \n  \nTo the extent that economic conditions deteriorate, business and individual borrowers may be less able to meet their \nobligations to the Bank in full, in a timely manner, resulting in decreased earnings or losses to the Bank. To the extent that \nloans are secured by real estate, adverse conditions in the real estate market may reduce the ability of the borrowers to generate \nthe necessary cash flow for repayment of the loan and reduce the ability to collect the full amount of the loan upon a default. \nTo the extent that the Bank makes fixed-rate loans, general increases in interest rates will tend to reduce its spread as the \ninterest rates FNCB must pay for deposits would increase while interest income is flat. Economic conditions and interest \nrates may also adversely affect the value of property pledged as security for loans. \n  \nFNCB is subject to credit risk, and FNCB's financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted by \nchanges in economic and market conditions and other factors that adversely affect FNCB's borrowers. \n  \nFNCB’s business depends on its ability to successfully measure and manage credit risk. As a lender, FNCB is exposed to the \nrisk that the principal of, or interest on, a loan will not be paid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting a \nloan will be insufficient to cover FNCB’s outstanding exposure. In addition, FNCB is exposed to risks with respect to the \nperiod of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic \nand industry conditions, and risks inherent in dealing with individual loans and borrowers. The creditworthiness of a borrower \nis affected by many factors including local market conditions and general economic conditions. If the overall economic \nclimate in the United States generally, or in the market areas in which FNCB operates specifically, experiences material \ndisruption, FNCB’s borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans, the collateral FNCB holds may decrease \nin value or become illiquid, and FNCB’s level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require \nsignificant additional provisions for loan and lease losses."

These \nbusinesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital and borrowing capacity than larger entities and may \nhave a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions and be less able to withstand competitive, economic and financial \npressures. Changes in general economic conditions in the market area in which FNCB operates mat negatively impact this \nimportant customer sector. Additionally, FNCB may have significant exposure if any of these borrowers becomes unable to \npay their loan obligations as a result of personal circumstances, such as divorce, unemployment or death. Consequently, \nFNCB's financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. A failure to effectively measure and limit \nthe credit risk associated with FNCB’s loan portfolio may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs, and \nmay necessitate that FNCB significantly increase its allowance for loan losses, each of which could adversely affect FNCB’s \nnet income and profitability. As a result, FNCB’s inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse \neffect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. \n  \nFNCB’s commercial lending activities, including loans to insiders and their related parties, generally have relatively \nlarger balances and are concentrated within the Northeastern Pennsylvania market, which may present great risks than \nother types of loans.  \n  \nCommercial real estate, commercial and industrial and construction, land acquisition and development loans tend to have \nlarger balances than single family mortgage loans and other consumer loans. Because FNCB’s loan portfolio contains a \nsignificant number of commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans and construction, land acquisition and \ndevelopment loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant \nincrease in non-performing assets. All non-performing loans totaled $2.8 million, or 0.25% of total gross loans, as of \nDecember 31, 2022, and $3.9 million, or 0.39%, of total gross loans at December 31, 2021. Specifically, commercial real \nestate loans that were non-performing totaled $1.5 million, or 0.14%, of total gross loans at December 31, 2022 and $2.5 \nmillion, or 0.25%, of total gross loans at December 31, 2021. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a loss of \nearnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, which \ncould have an adverse impact on FNCB’s results of operations and financial condition. \n  \nA substantial portion of FNCB’s loans are secured by real estate in the Northeastern Pennsylvania market, and substantially \nall of its loans are to borrowers in that area. FNCB also has a significant amount of commercial real estate, commercial and \nindustrial, construction, land acquisition and development loans and land-related loans for residential and commercial \ndevelopments. At December 31, 2022, $693.8 million, or 61.8%, of gross loans were secured by real estate, primarily \ncommercial real estate, in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Management has taken steps to mitigate commercial real estate \nconcentration risk by diversification among the types and characteristics of real estate collateral properties, sound \nunderwriting practices, and ongoing portfolio monitoring and market analysis. Of total gross loans, $66.6 million, or 5.9%, \nwere construction, land acquisition and development loans. Construction, land acquisition and development loans have the \nhighest risk of not being collected. An additional $272.0 million, or 24.2%, of portfolio loans were commercial and industrial \nloans not secured by real estate. Historically, commercial and industrial loans generally have had a higher risk of default than \nother categories of loans, such as single-family residential mortgage loans. The repayment of these loans often depends on \nthe successful operation of a business and are more likely to be adversely affected by adverse economic conditions. While \nmanagement believes that the loan portfolio is well diversified in terms of borrowers and industries, these concentrations \nexpose FNCB to the risk that adverse developments in the real estate market, or in the general economic conditions in its \nmarket area, could adversely affect the quality and collectability of its loans and could increase the level of non-performing \nloans. An increase in non-performing loans could result in s loss of earnings from these loans and increases in loan charge-\noffs and the provision for loan and lease losses, all of which could have a material adverse effect on FNCB's financial \ncondition and results of operations. Additionally, if, for any reason, economic conditions in its market area deteriorate, or \nthere is significant volatility or weakness in the economy or any significant sector of the area’s economy, FNCB’s ability to \ndevelop business relationships may be diminished, loan demand may be reduced and collateral values supporting loans may \ndecline, which could also adversely affect FNCB's financial condition and results of operations.  \n  \nGuidance adopted by federal banking regulators provides that banks having concentrations in construction, land development \nor commercial real estate loans are expected to have and maintain higher levels of risk management and, potentially, higher \nlevels of capital, which may adversely affect shareholder returns, or require FNCB to obtain additional capital sooner than it \notherwise would. Excluded from the scope of this guidance are loans secured by non-farm nonresidential properties where \nthe primary source of repayment is the cash flow from the ongoing operations and activities conducted by the party, or \naffiliate of the party, who owns the property."

      "text": "14 \nOutstanding loans and line of credit balances to directors, officers and their related parties totaled $79.1 million as of \nDecember 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, there were no loans to directors, officers and their related parties that were \ncategorized as criticized loans within the Bank’s risk rating system, meaning they are not considered to present a higher risk \nof collection than other loans. See Note 12, “Related Party Transactions” of the notes to consolidated financial statements \nincluded in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Item 13, “Certain Relationships and Related \nTransactions, and Director Independence” to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding loans to \nofficers and directors and/or their related parties. \n  \nThe appraisals and other valuation techniques FNCB uses in evaluating and monitoring loans secured by real property \nand other real estate owned may not accurately reflect the net value of the asset. \n  \nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, FNCB generally requires an appraisal of the property. \nHowever, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made, and, as real estate \nvalues may change significantly in relatively short periods of time (especially in periods of heightened economic uncertainty), \nthis estimate may not accurately reflect the net value of the collateral after the loan is made. As a result, FNCB may not be \nable to realize the full amount of any remaining indebtedness when FNCB forecloses on and sells the relevant property. In \naddition, FNCB relies on appraisals and other valuation techniques to establish the value of other real estate owned \n(“OREO”), that FNCB acquires through foreclosure proceedings and to determine loan impairments. If any of these \nvaluations are inaccurate, FNCB’s financial statements may not reflect the correct value of FNCB’s OREO, if any, and \nFNCB’s allowance for loan and lease losses may not reflect accurate loan impairments. Inaccurate valuation of OREO or \ninaccurate provisioning for loan and lease losses could have a material adverse effect on FNCB’s business, financial condition \nand results of operations. \n   \nFNCB’s financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected if the ALLL is not sufficient to absorb \nactual losses or if increases to the ALLL were required. \n  \nThe lending activities in which the Bank engages carry the risk that the borrowers will be unable to perform on their \nobligations, and that the collateral securing the payment of their obligations may be insufficient to assure repayment. FNCB \nmay experience significant credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results. Management \nmakes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of FNCB’s loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness \nof its borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of its loans, \nwhich it uses as a basis to estimate and establish its reserves for losses. In determining the amount of the ALLL, management \nreviews loans, loss and delinquency experience, and evaluates current economic conditions. If these assumptions prove to be \nincorrect, the ALLL may not cover inherent losses in FNCB’s loan portfolio at the date of its financial statements. Material \nadditions to FNCB’s allowance or extensive charge-offs would materially decrease its net income. At December 31, 2022, \nthe ALLL totaled $14.2 million, representing 1.26% of loans, net of unearned income and net deferred loan origination fees. \n  \nAlthough management believes FNCB’s underwriting standards are adequate to manage normal lending risks, it is difficult \nto assess the future performance of its loan portfolio due to the ongoing economic environment and the state of the real estate \nmarket. The assessment of future performance of the loan portfolio is inherently uncertain. FNCB can give no assurance that \nnon-performing loans will not increase or that non-performing or delinquent loans will not adversely affect its future \nperformance. \n  \nIn addition, federal and state regulators periodically review the ALLL and may require increases to the ALLL or further loan \ncharge-offs. Any increase in ALLL or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse \neffect on FNCB’s results of operations and financial condition. \n  \nIf management concludes that the decline in value of any of FNCB’s investment securities is other-than-temporary, FNCB \nis required to write down the security to reflect credit-related impairments through a charge to earnings. \n  \nManagement reviews FNCB’s investment securities portfolio at each quarter-end reporting period to determine whether the \nfair value is below the current carrying value. When the fair value of any of FNCB’s debt investment securities has declined \nbelow its carrying value, management is required to assess whether the decline represents an other than temporary \nimpairment. If management concludes that the decline is other-than-temporary, it is required to write down the value of that \nsecurity to reflect the credit-related impairments through a charge to earnings. Changes in the expected cash flows of \nsecurities in FNCB’s portfolio and/or prolonged price declines in future periods may result in OTTI, which would require a \ncharge to earnings. Due to the complexity of the calculations and assumptions used in determining whether an asset is \nimpaired, any impairment disclosed may not accurately reflect the actual impairment in the future.

FNCB’s risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and may not adequately \nmitigate any risk or loss to FNCB. If FNCB’s risk management framework is not effective, FNCB could suffer unexpected \nlosses and its business, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects could be materially and adversely \naffected. FNCB may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences. \n  \nFNCB is subject to interest rate risk, changes in interest rates could reduce income, cash flows and asset values, which \ncould adversely affect its profitability. \n  \nFNCB’s earnings and cash flows, like that of most financial institutions, depends to a large extent on its net interest income, \nwhich is the difference between its interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and its \ninterest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. \n  \nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond FNCB’s control, including general economic conditions \nand policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve System, or the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not \nonly the interest FNCB receives on loans and securities and the interest FNCB pays on deposits and borrowings, but such \nchanges could affect FNCB’s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, the fair value of FNCB’s financial assets and \nliabilities, and the average duration of FNCB’s assets. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at \na faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, FNCB’s net interest income, and therefore \nearnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and \nother investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Any substantial, unexpected \nor prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on FNCB’s business, financial condition \nand results of operations. \n  \nFNCB uses simulation analysis to model net interest income for various interest rate scenarios over a five-year time horizon. \nBased on the simulation analysis, FNCB’s interest sensitivity profile at December 31, 2022 was characterized by maturities \nor repricing of assets and liabilities that were liability sensitive over the next 18 to 24 months, moving to an asset sensitivity \nposition in subsequent years of the model. These simulations are based on numerous assumptions, including but not limited \nto: the nature and timing of interest rate levels, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on \nloans and deposits, reinvestment of asset and liability cash flows, customer behavior in a rising rate environment and other \nfactors. When short-term interest rates rise, the rate of interest FNCB pays on its interest-bearing liabilities may rise more \nquickly than the rate of interest that FNCB receives on its interest-earning assets, which may cause FNCB’s net interest \nincome to decrease. \n   \nAdditionally, a shrinking yield premium, or negative spread, between short-term and long-term market interest rates, a pattern \nusually indicative of investors' waning expectations of future growth and inflation, commonly referred to as a flattening of \nthe yield curve, or inversion of the yield curve, typically reduces FNCB’s profit margin as FNCB borrows at shorter terms \nthan the terms at which FNCB lends and invests. \n  \nIn addition, an increase in interest rates could also have a negative impact on FNCB’s results of operations by reducing the \nability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations. These circumstances could not only result in increased loan \ndefaults, foreclosures and charge-offs, but also reduce collateral values and necessitate further increases to the allowance for \nloan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on FNCB’s business, financial condition and results of operations. \n  \nUncertainty relating to the expected phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) may adversely affect \nFNCB. \n  \nThe United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and the administrator of LIBOR have announced that the publication of \nthe most commonly used U.S. dollar LIBOR settings will cease to be published or cease to be representative after June 30, \n2023. The publication of all other LIBOR settings ceased to be published as of December 31, 2021.

Therefore, the agencies encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that use LIBOR \nas a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. \n  \nThe U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised \nof large U.S. financial institutions, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"), a new index calculated \nby short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR however, \nother market alternatives have been developed. While SOFR has been adopted in select product areas it has not achieved full \nimplementation as an alternative reference rate. At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to \nalternative reference rates as markets continue to transition away from LIBOR.  \n  \nFurthermore, because of the complexity of the transition from LIBOR, at this time, it is not possible to predict what rate or \nrates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on \nthe value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, subordinated debentures, or other securities or financial \narrangements. \n  \nFNCB has significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that \nare either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. FNCB has established a committee to guide the transition from LIBOR \nand has identified products that utilize LIBOR and are revising fallback language to facilitate the transition to alternative \nreference rates. Effective December 31, 2021, FNCB has discontinued originating LIBOR-based loans, and has moved to \nnegotiating loans using the Term SOFR. As of December 31, 2022, FNCB had approximately $65.8 million of loans, $26.6 \nmillion in investments and $10.3 million in subordinated debt, as well as certain derivative contracts, borrowings and other \nfinancial instruments that have attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. Failure to adequately \nmanage the transition could have a material adverse effect on FNCB's business, financial condition and results of operations. \n  \nFNCB may not be able to successfully compete with others for business. \n  \nFNCB competes for loans, deposits and investment dollars with numerous regional and national banks and other community \nbanking institutions, online divisions of banks located in other markets as well as other kinds of financial institutions and \nenterprises, such as securities firms, insurance companies, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage brokers, private \nlenders and Fintech companies. There is also competition for banking business from competitors outside of its market area. \nAs noted above, FNCB and the Bank are subject to extensive regulations and supervision, including, in many cases, \nregulations that limit the type and scope of activities. Many competitors have substantially greater resources and may offer \ncertain services that FNCB and the Bank does not provide, and operate under less stringent regulatory environments. The \ndifferences in available resources and applicable regulations may make it harder for FNCB to compete profitably, reduce the \nrates that it can earn on loans and investments, increase the rates it must offer on deposits and other funds, and adversely \naffect its overall financial condition and earnings. Refer to the section entitled “Competition” included in Item 1, \"Business\" \nto this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an additional discussion of FNCB's competitive environment. \n  \nFNCB could be subject credit risk related to derivative obligations. \n  \nFNCB has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if FNCB defaults or is capable \nof being declared in default on any of its indebtedness, then it could also be declared in its derivative obligations.  FNCB has \nagreements with certain of its derivatives counterparties that contain a provision where if it fails to maintain its status as a \nwell-capitalized institution, then it could be required to post additional collateral. \n  \nFNCB has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties for derivatives in a net liability \nposition. As of December 31, 2022, FNCB had no derivatives in a net liability position and accordingly did not have to post \nany collateral, however this could change in the future.  \n  \nFNCB may not be able to retain or grow its core deposit base, which could adversely impact its funding costs. \n  \nLike many financial institutions, FNCB relies on customer deposits as its primary source of funding for its lending activities, \nand FNCB continues to seek customer deposits to maintain this funding base. FNCB’s future growth will largely depend on \nits ability to retain and grow its deposit base. As of December 31, 2022, FNCB had $1.421 billion in deposits. FNCB’s \ndeposits are subject to potentially dramatic fluctuations in availability or price due to certain factors outside of its control, \nsuch as increasing competitive pressures for deposits, changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes, \ncustomer perceptions of its financial health and general reputation, and a loss of confidence by customers in FNCB or the \nbanking sector generally, which could result in significant outflows of deposits within short periods of time or significant"

The availability of deposits \ncan also be impacted by regulatory changes (e.g., changes in FDIC insurance, the liquidity coverage ratio, etc.), changes in \nthe financial condition of FNCB, or the banking industry in general, and other events which can impact the perceived safety \nand soundness or economic benefits of bank deposits. Any loss by FNCB of its deposit base could limit its lending ability \nresulting in lower loan originations, which could have a material adverse effect on FNCB’s business, financial condition and \nresults of operations. \n   \nFNCB is a bank holding company and depends on dividends from its subsidiary, FNCB Bank, to operate.  \n  \nFNCB is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Bank conducts most of FNCB’s operations and FNCB depends \nupon dividends from the Bank to service its debt, pay its expenses, to repurchase shares of FNCB stock and to pay dividends \nto FNCB's shareholders. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is \npossible, depending upon the financial condition including liquidity and capital adequacy of the Bank and other factors, that \nthe Bank’s regulators could limit the payment of dividends or other payments to FNCB by the Bank. In the event that the \nBank was unable to pay dividends and would be unable to repurchase its shares, FNCB in turn would likely have to reduce \nor stop paying dividends to its shareholders. Failure to pay dividends to FNCB shareholders could have a material adverse \neffect on the market price of FNCB’s Common Stock. For additional information regarding dividend restrictions, refer to the \nsection entitled “Regulatory Matters” included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n  \nIf FNCB loses access to wholesale funding sources, it may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of its depositors, \ncreditors, and borrowers, or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities. \n  \nWholesale funding sources include brokered deposits, one-way CDARS and ICS deposits, federal funds lines of credit, \nsecurities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and long-term debt. The Bank is also a member of the Federal \nHome Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") of Pittsburgh, which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized with \ncertain qualifying assets within the Bank’s loan portfolio. In addition, FNCB’s available-for-sale securities provide an \nadditional source of liquidity. Disruptions in availability of wholesale funding can directly impact the liquidity of FNCB and \nthe Bank. The inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact FNCB’s financial \ncondition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital.  \n  \nFNCB held approximately $8.5 million in capital stock of the FHLB of Pittsburgh as of December 31, 2022. FNCB must \nown such capital stock to qualify for membership in the FHLB of Pittsburgh which enables it to borrow funds under the \nFHLB of Pittsburgh advance program. If the FHLB of Pittsburgh were to cease operations, FNCB’s business, financial \ncondition, liquidity, capital and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. \n  \nInterruptions or security breaches of FNCB’s information systems could negatively affect its financial performance or \nreputation. \n  \nIn conducting its business, FNCB relies heavily on its information systems. FNCB collects and stores sensitive data, including \nproprietary business information and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees, in its data centers \nand on its networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to FNCB’s operations \nand business strategy. Maintaining and protecting those systems is difficult and expensive, as is dealing with any failure, \ninterruption or breach of those systems. Despite security measures, FNCB’s information technology and infrastructure may \nbe vulnerable to security breaches, cyber-attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other \ndisruptions. Any damage, failure or breach could cause an interruption in operations. Computer break-ins, phishing and other \ndisruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through FNCB’s computer systems \nand network infrastructure. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or breaches could damage FNCB’s reputation, \ndisrupt operations and the services provided to customers, cause a loss of confidence in the products and the services provided, \ncause FNCB to incur additional expenses, result in a loss of customer business and data, result in legal claims or proceedings, \nresult in liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, result in regulatory penalties, or expose FNCB \nto other liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of \noperations and competitive position. \n  \nFNCB depends on information technology and telecommunications systems of third parties, and any systems failures or \ninterruptions could adversely affect FNCB’s operations and financial condition. \n  \nFNCB’s business depends on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of its information technology and \ntelecommunications systems. FNCB outsources many of its major systems, such as data processing, deposit processing, loan \norigination, email and anti-money laundering monitoring systems.

In many cases, FNCB’s operations rely heavily \non secured processing, storage and transmission of information and the monitoring of a large number of transactions on a \nminute-by-minute basis, and even a short interruption in service could have significant consequences. Because FNCB’s \ninformation technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems, FNCB could \nexperience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity, or such third-party systems fail or experience \ninterruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise FNCB’s ability to \noperate effectively, damage FNCB’s reputation, result in a loss of customer business and subject FNCB to additional \nregulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on FNCB’s business, \nfinancial condition and results of operations. In addition, failure of third parties to comply with applicable laws and \nregulations, or fraud or misconduct on the part of employees of any of these third parties, could disrupt FNCB’s operations \nor adversely affect FNCB’s reputation.  \n  \nFNCB is subject to cybersecurity risks and security breaches and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those \nrisks and to respond to cyber incidents, and FNCB may experience harm to its reputation and liability exposure from \nsecurity breaches. \n  \nFNCB’s business involves the storage and transmission of customers' proprietary information and security breaches could \nexpose FNCB to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. While FNCB has not incurred \na material cyber-attack or security breach to date, a number of other financial services and other companies have disclosed \ncyber-attacks and security breaches, some of which have involved intentional attacks. Attacks may be targeted at FNCB, its \ncustomers or both. Although FNCB devotes significant resources to maintain, regularly update and backup its systems and \nprocesses that are designed to protect the security of FNCB’s computer systems, software, networks and other technology \nassets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to FNCB or its customers, its security \nmeasures may not be effective against all potential cyber-attacks or security breaches. Despite FNCB’s efforts to ensure the \nintegrity of its systems, it is possible that FNCB may not be able to anticipate, or implement effective preventive measures \nagainst, all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized \nuntil launched, and because cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including persons who are involved \nwith organized crime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile \nforeign governments. These risks may increase in the future as FNCB continues to increase FNCB’s internet-based product \nofferings and expand its internal usage of web-based products and applications. If an actual or perceived security breach \noccurs, customer perception of the effectiveness of FNCB’s security measures could be harmed and could result in the loss \nof customers. \n  \nA successful penetration or circumvention of the security of FNCB’s systems, including those of third party providers or \nother financial institutions, or the failure to meet regulatory requirements for security of its systems, could cause serious \nnegative consequences, including significant disruption of FNCB’s operations, misappropriation of FNCB’s confidential \ninformation or that of FNCB’s customers, or damage to FNCB’s computers or systems or those of FNCB’s customers or \ncounterparties, significant increases in compliance costs (such as repairing systems or adding new personnel or protection \ntechnologies), and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to FNCB or to its customers, \nloss of confidence in its security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation and regulatory exposure, and harm \nto FNCB’s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on FNCB’s business, financial condition and results \nof operations. \n  \nIf FNCB’s information technology is unable to keep pace with growth or industry developments or if technological \ndevelopments result in higher costs or less advantageous pricing, financial performance may suffer. \n  \nEffective and competitive delivery of FNCB’s products and services increasingly depends on information technology \nresources and processes, both those provided internally as well as those provided through third party vendors. In addition to \nbetter serving customers, the effective use of technology can improve efficiency and help reduce costs. FNCB’s future success \nwill depend, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services \nto enhance customer convenience, as well as to create efficiencies in its operations. There is increasing pressure to provide \nproducts and services at lower prices. This can reduce net interest income and non-interest income from fee-based products \nand services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies could require FNCB to make substantial capital \nexpenditures to modify or adapt existing products and services or develop new products and services. FNCB may not be \nsuccessful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or developments in technology, or those \nnew products may not achieve market acceptance. Many of FNCB’s competitors have greater resources to invest in \ntechnological improvements. Additionally, as technology in the financial services industry changes and evolves, keeping \npace becomes increasingly complex and expensive.

The unexpected loss of \nservices of one or more of FNCB’s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on its business due to the loss of their \nskills, knowledge of its market, years of industry experience and to the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement \npersonnel. \n  \nNew lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may subject FNCB to additional risk. \n  \nFrom time to time, FNCB may implement new lines of business or offer new products and product enhancements as well as \nnew services within FNCB’s existing lines of business.  There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these \nefforts.  In developing, implementing or marketing new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services, FNCB \nmay invest significant time and resources.  FNCB may underestimate the appropriate level of resources or expertise necessary \nto make new lines of business or products successful to realize their expected benefits.  FNCB may not achieve the milestones \nset in initial timetables for the development and introduction of new lines of business, products, product enhancements or \nservices, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible.  External factors, such as compliance with regulations, \ncompetitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the ultimate implementation of a new line of \nbusiness or offering of new products, product enhancements or services. Any new line of business, product, product \nenhancement or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of FNCB’s system of internal controls.  FNCB \nmay also decide to discontinue business or products, due to lack of customer acceptance or unprofitability.  Failure to \nsuccessfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or offerings of new products, \nproduct enhancements or services could have a material adverse effect on FNCB’s business, financial condition and results \nof operations. \n  \nFNCB may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions. \n  \nFNCB’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial \nsoundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, \ncounterparty and other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services \ncompanies, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults \nby FNCB or other institutions. These losses could have a material adverse effect on FNCB’s business, financial condition \nand results of operations. \n  \nDamage to FNCB’s reputation could significantly harm its businesses, competitive position and prospects for growth.  \n  \nFNCB’s ability to attract and retain investors, customers, clients, and employees could be adversely affected by damage to \nits reputation resulting from various sources, including environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") related issues, \nemployee misconduct, litigation, or regulatory outcomes; failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality; \ncompliance failures; unethical behavior; unintended breach of confidential information; and the activities of FNCB’s clients, \ncustomers, or counterparties. Actions by the financial services industry in general, or by certain entities or individuals within \nit, also could have a significantly adverse impact on FNCB’s reputation. \n  \nFNCB’s actual or perceived failure to identify and address various issues, including failure to properly address operational \nand ESG risks, could also give rise to reputation risk that could negatively impact business prospects. These issues include, \namong others, legal and regulatory requirements; consumer protection, fair lending, and privacy issues; properly maintaining \ncustomer and associated personal information; record keeping; protecting against money laundering; sales and trading \npractices; and ethical issues."

      "text": "20 \nFNCB may be a defendant from time to time in a variety of litigation and other actions, which could have a material \nadverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n  \nFNCB has been and may continue to be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation matters arising out of its business. \nAn increased number of lawsuits, including purported class action lawsuits and other consumer driven litigation, have been \nfiled and will likely continue to be filed against financial institutions, which may involve substantial compensatory and/or \npunitive damages. Management believes the risk of litigation generally increases during downturns in the national and local \neconomies. FNCB’s insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it, and any claims asserted against it, \nregardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm its reputation and may cause it to incur significant expense. Should the \nultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on \nits financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, FNCB may not be able to obtain appropriate types \nor levels of insurance in the future, nor may it be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms, if at all. \nRefer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an additional discussion of FNCB's current \nmaterial legal matters. \n  \nFNCB may face risks with respect to future expansion or acquisition activity. \n  \nFNCB may selectively seek to expand its banking operations through limited de novo branching or opportunistic acquisition \nactivities. FNCB cannot be certain that any expansion activity, through de novo branching, acquisition of branches of another \nfinancial institution or a whole institution, or the establishment or acquisition of nonbanking financial service companies, \nwill prove profitable or will increase shareholder value. The success of any acquisition will depend, in part, on FNCB’s \nability to realize the estimated cost savings and revenue enhancements from combining its business and that of the target \ncompany. FNCB’s ability to realize increases in revenue will depend, in part, on its ability to retain customers and employees, \nand to capitalize on existing relationships for the provision of additional products and services. If FNCB estimates turn out \nto be incorrect or FNCB is not able to successfully combine companies, the anticipated cost savings and increased revenues \nmay not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. It is possible that the integration process could \nresult in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company’s ongoing business, diversion of management attention, \nor inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect FNCB’s ability to maintain \nrelationships with clients and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. As with any combination of \nbanking institutions, there also may be disruptions that cause FNCB to lose customers or cause customers to withdraw their \ndeposits. Customers may not readily accept changes to their banking arrangements that FNCB makes as part of, or following, \nan acquisition. Additionally, the value of an acquisition to FNCB is dependent on its ability to successfully identify and \nestimate the magnitude of any asset quality issues of acquired companies. \n  \nFNCB may not be successful in overcoming these risks or other problems encountered in connection with potential \nacquisitions or other expansion activity. FNCB’s inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on FNCB’s \nability to implement its business strategy and enhance shareholder value, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect \non FNCB’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, if FNCB records goodwill in connection with \nany acquisition, FNCB’s financial condition and results of operation may be adversely affected if that goodwill is determined \nto be impaired, which would require FNCB to take an impairment charge. \n  \nRisks Related to FNCB’s Industry \n  \nFNCB may be required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for the Bank in times of stress. \n  \nFNCB, as a bank holding company, is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank and to \ncommit resources to support the Bank if necessary. FNCB may be required to commit additional resources to the Bank at \ntimes when FNCB may not be in a financial position to provide such resources or when it may not be in FNCB’s, or its \nshareholders’ or creditors’, best interests to do so. A requirement to provide such support is more likely during times of \nfinancial stress for FNCB and the Bank, which may make any capital FNCB is required to raise to provide such support more \nexpensive than it might otherwise be. In addition, any capital loans FNCB makes to the Bank are subordinate in right of \nrepayment to deposit liabilities of the Bank."

      "text": "21 \nFNCB is subject to extensive government regulation, supervision and possible regulatory enforcement actions, as well as \n\"fair and responsible banking'' laws designed to protect consumers, which may subject it to higher costs and lower \nshareholder returns. \n  \nThe banking industry is subject to extensive regulation and supervision that govern almost all aspects of its operations. The \nextensive regulatory framework is primarily intended to protect the federal deposit insurance fund and depositors, not \nshareholders. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations can be difficult and costly and, in some instances, may put \nbanks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors such as finance companies, mortgage banking \ncompanies, leasing companies and internet-based Fintech companies. FNCB’s regulatory authorities have extensive \ndiscretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including with respect to the imposition of restrictions on the \noperation of a bank or a bank holding company, the imposition of significant fines, the ability to delay or deny merger or \nother regulatory applications, the classification of assets by a bank, and the adequacy of a bank’s allowance for loan losses, \namong other matters. If they deem FNCB to be operating in a manner inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices, \nthese regulatory authorities can require the entry into informal and formal supervisory agreements, including board \nresolutions, memorandum of understanding, settlement agreements and consent or cease and desist orders, pursuant to which \nFNCB would be required to implement identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and/or to refrain from taking \ncertain actions in the form of injunctive relief. In recent years, the banking industry has faced increased regulation and \nscrutiny; for instance, areas such as BSA compliance (including BSA and related anti-money laundering regulations) and \nreal estate-secured consumer lending (such as Truth-in-Lending regulations, changes in Real Estate Settlement Procedures \nAct regulations, implementation of licensing and registration requirements for mortgage originators and more recently, \nheightened regulatory attention to mortgage and foreclosure-related activities and exposures) are being confronted with \nescalating regulatory expectations and scrutiny. In addition, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity \nAct, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations, including state laws and regulations, prohibit \ndiscriminatory lending practices by financial institutions. The Federal Trade Commission Act and the Dodd-Frank Act \nprohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices by financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, \nfederal banking agencies, and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these fair and responsible banking \nlaws and regulations. A challenge to an institution’s compliance with fair and responsible banking laws and regulations could \nresult in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers \nand acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also \nhave the ability to challenge an institution’s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions \ncould have a material adverse effect on FNCB’s reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. \n   \nNon-compliance with laws and regulations such as these, even in cases of inadvertent non-compliance, could result in \nlitigation, significant fines and/or sanctions. Any failure to comply with, or any change in, any applicable regulation and \nsupervisory requirement, or change in regulation or enforcement by such authorities, whether in the form of policies, \nregulations, legislation, rules, orders, enforcement actions, or decisions, could have a material impact on FNCB, the Bank \nand other affiliates, and its operations. Federal economic and monetary policy may also affect FNCB’s ability to attract \ndeposits and other funding sources, make loans and investments, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads. Any failure to \ncomply with such regulation or supervision could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or \nreputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on FNCB’s business, financial condition and results of \noperations. In addition, compliance with any such action could distract management’s attention from FNCB’s operations, \ncause it to incur significant expenses, restrict it from engaging in potentially profitable activities and limit its ability to raise \ncapital. \n  \nNew or changed legislation or regulation, updated guidance regarding current regulation and regulatory initiatives could \nadversely affect FNCB through increased regulation and increased costs of doing business. \n  \nChanges in federal and state legislation and regulation may affect FNCB’s operations. Laws and regulations, such as the \nDodd-Frank Act and Basel III, may have unforeseen or unintended consequences on the banking industry. The Dodd-Frank \nAct has implemented significant changes to the U.S. financial system, including the creation of new regulatory agencies (such \nas the Financial Stability Oversight Council to oversee systemic risk and the CFPB to develop and enforce rules for consumer \nfinancial products), changes in retail banking regulations, and changes to deposit insurance assessments. For example, the \nDodd-Frank Act has implemented new requirements with respect to “qualified mortgages” and new mortgage servicing \nstandards have, and may continue to, increase costs associated with this business. Refer to the section entitled “Business – \nThe Bank – Consumer Financial Protection Bureau” included in Item 1, \"Business\" to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for \na more detailed description of new or changed legislation or regulation and regulatory initiatives."

      "text": "22 \nOne example of updated guidance regarding legislation is that on October 26, 2022, the CFPB issued supervisory \nguidance which warned financial institutions that levying overdraft fees to consumers who would not reasonably anticipate \nthe fees may constitute an unfair act or practice under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (\"CFPA\"). In addition, \nthe CFPB issued a compliance bulletin warning that certain depositor fees may similarly violate the CFPA. This guidance \ncomes as a next step in the CFPB’s “junk fee” initiative, launched in January 2022, through which the CFPB has endeavored \nto identify and take certain steps to curb potentially exploitative fees charged by banks and other financial \ninstitutions. While management does not believe that FNCB's overdraft fees are in violation of the CFPA, many larger \nfinancial institutions have eliminated overdraft charges on consumer accounts and the banking industry has recently \nannounced a significant decrease in overdraft fee income in 2022. Competition from large banks and the imposition \nof restrictions on overdraft fees by the federal government, may result in FNCB having to change its overdraft fee structure, \nwhich could negatively impact future non-interest income run rates.  \n  \nExternal events, including natural disasters, national or global health emergencies, and events of armed conflict in other \ncountries, and terrorist threats could impact FNCB's ability to do business or otherwise adversely affect FNCB's business, \noperations or financial condition. \n  \nFinancial institutions, like other businesses, are susceptible to the effects of external events that can compromise operating \nand communications systems and otherwise have adverse effects.  Such events, should they occur, can cause significant \ndamage, impact the stability of FNCB's operations or facilities, result in additional expense, or impair the ability of FNCB's \nborrowers to repay their loans. Although we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence \nof any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial condition. In addition, other \nexternal events, including natural disasters, health emergencies and epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 \npandemic, and events of armed conflict in other parts of the world, such as the present armed conflict involving Ukraine and \nRussia, could adversely affect the global or regional economies resulting in unfavorable economic conditions in the United \nStates. Any such development could have an adverse effect on FNCB's business, operations or financial condition. \n  \nRisks Related to FNCB’s Common Stock \n  \nFNCB may need to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed and on \nterms favorable to current shareholders. \n  \nLaws, regulations and banking regulators require FNCB and the Bank to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their \noperations. In addition, capital levels are determined by FNCB’s management and Board of Directors based on capital levels \nthat they believe are necessary to support business operations. Management regularly evaluates its present and future capital \nrequirements and needs and analyzes capital raising alternatives and options. Although FNCB succeeded in meeting its \ncurrent regulatory capital requirements, it may need to raise additional capital in the future to support growth, possible loan \nlosses or potential OTTI during future periods, to meet future regulatory capital requirements or for other reasons. \n   \nThe Board of Directors may determine from time to time that FNCB needs to raise additional capital by issuing additional \nshares of common stock or other securities. FNCB is not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock, including \nsecurities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. Because FNCB’s \ndecision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond its control, \nFNCB cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future offerings, or the prices at which such offerings \nmay be affected. Such offerings will likely be dilutive to common shareholders from ownership, earnings and book value \nperspectives. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to, and that adversely affect, its \nthen current common shareholders. Additionally, if FNCB raises additional capital by making additional offerings of debt or \npreferred equity securities, upon liquidation, holders of its debt securities and shares of preferred shares, and lenders with \nrespect to other borrowings, will receive distributions of available assets prior to the holders of common stock. Additional \nequity offerings may dilute the holdings of existing shareholders or reduce the market price of FNCB’s common stock, or \nboth. Holders of FNCB’s common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution. \n  \nFNCB cannot provide any assurance that additional capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence \nthat may limit access to the capital markets may adversely affect FNCB’s capital costs and its ability to raise capital and, in \nturn, its liquidity. Moreover, if FNCB needs to raise capital, it may have to do so when many other financial institutions are \nalso seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional \ncapital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on FNCB’s business, financial condition and \nresults of operations."

      "text": "23 \nAn investment in FNCB’s common stock is not an insured deposit. \n  \nFNCB’s common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit \ninsurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in FNCB’s common stock is inherently risky for the \nreasons described in this “Risk Factors” section, and elsewhere in FNCB’s reports filed with the SEC, including under \nheading “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or any subsequent report filed by FNCB. Investment in FNCB’s \ncommon stock is also subject to the market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, \nshareholders may lose some or all of their investment in FNCB’s common stock. \n  \nShareholders may not receive dividends on FNCB’s common stock or have their shares repurchased by FNCB. \n  \nAlthough FNCB has historically declared quarterly cash dividends on its common stock, and adopted a share repurchase \nprogram for the repurchase of shares of its common stock, FNCB is not required to do so and may reduce or cease to pay \ncommon stock dividends, or repurchase shares, in the future. If FNCB reduces or ceases to pay common stock dividends, or \nterminates its stock repurchase program, the market price of its common stock could be adversely affected. \n  \nThe principal source of funds from which FNCB pays cash dividends, and repurchase shares, are the dividends received from \nthe Bank. Banking laws and regulations of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania restrict the amount of dividends and loans a \nbank may make to its parent company. In addition, under The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of \n1991, banks may not pay a dividend, or repurchase shares if, after paying the dividend, or repurchasing such shares, the bank \nwould be undercapitalized. \n  \nIf FNCB fails to pay dividends, capital appreciation, if any, of its common stock may be the sole opportunity for gains on an \ninvestment in its common stock. In addition, in the event the Bank becomes unable to pay dividends to FNCB, FNCB may \nnot be able to service its debt or pay its other obligations, pay dividends on, or repurchase shares of, its common stock and \npreferred stock. Accordingly, FNCB’s inability to receive dividends from the Bank could also have a material adverse effect \non its business, financial condition and results of operations and the value of a shareholder’s investment in FNCB’s common \nstock. \n  \nAn entity holding as little as a 5% interest in FNCB’s outstanding securities could, under certain circumstances, be subject \nto regulation as a “bank holding company.” \n  \nAny entity, including a “group” composed of natural persons, owning or controlling with the power to vote 25% or more of \nFNCB’s outstanding securities, or 5% or more if the holder otherwise exercises a “controlling influence” over FNCB, may \nbe subject to regulation as a “bank holding company” in accordance with the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as \namended, or the BHC Act. In addition, (a) any bank holding company or foreign bank with a U.S. presence may be required \nto obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act to acquire or retain 5% or more of FNCB’s outstanding \nsecurities and (b) any person not otherwise defined as a company by the BHC Act and its implementing regulations may be \nrequired to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the Change in Bank Control Act to acquire or retain 10% or \nmore of FNCB’s outstanding securities. Becoming a bank holding company imposes statutory and regulatory restrictions and \nobligations, such as providing managerial and financial strength for its bank subsidiaries. Regulation as a bank holding \ncompany could require the holder to divest all or a portion of the holder’s investment in FNCB’s securities or those \nnonbanking investments that may be deemed impermissible or incompatible with bank holding company status, such as a \nmaterial investment in a company unrelated to banking. \n  \nAny deficiencies in FNCB’s financial reporting or internal controls could materially and adversely affect its business and \nthe market price of FNCB’s common stock. \n  \nDuring the course of FNCB’s testing it may identify deficiencies that would have to be remediated to satisfy the SEC rules \nfor certification of FNCB’s internal control over financial reporting. These controls may not achieve their intended \nobjectives.  Control processes that involve human diligence and compliance, such as its disclosure controls and procedures \nand internal controls over financial reporting, are subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. \nControls can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there are \nrisks that material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected and that information may not be \nreported on a timely basis.  Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary to produce reliable financial reports and to \nprevent fraud. If FNCB has deficiencies in its disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting, \nit may materially and adversely affect FNCB."

      "text": "24 \nA material weakness is defined by the standards issued by the PCAOB as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in \ninternal control over financial reporting that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of FNCB’s annual \nor interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a consequence, FNCB would have to \ndisclose in periodic reports it files with the SEC any material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. The \nexistence of a material weakness would preclude management from concluding that FNCB’s internal control over financial \nreporting is effective and would preclude its independent auditors from expressing an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness \nof its internal control over financial reporting. In addition, disclosures of deficiencies of this type in FNCB’s SEC reports \ncould cause investors to lose confidence in its financial reporting and may negatively affect the market price of its common \nstock and could result in the delisting of its securities from the securities exchanges on which they trade.  \n  \nChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings.  \n  \nFrom time to time there are changes in the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of \nfinancial statements. These changes can materially impact how FNCB records and reports its financial condition and results \nof operations. In some instances, FNCB could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the \nrestatement of prior period financial statements. \n  \nChanges which have been approved for future implementation include the calculation of the allowance for loan and leases \nlosses on the basis of the current expected credit losses over the lifetime of our loans, referred to as the CECL model, became \napplicable to us on January 1, 2023. The change in this calculation could adversely affect our capital, regulatory capital \nratios, ability to make larger loans, earnings and performance metrics. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect \non our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n  \nUnder the CECL model, banks will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans \nheld for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of \nexpected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, \nand reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take \nplace at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly \nfrom the \"incurred loss\" model required under current GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been \nincurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our \nallowance for loan losses, and could require us to significantly increase our allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may \ncreate more volatility in the level of the allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase the level of the \nallowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results \nof operations. FNCB has evaluated the impact the CECL accounting model will have on FNCB's accounting, and expects to \nrecognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to reduce the allowance for loan losses as of the beginning of the first \nreporting period in which the new standard is effective. FNCB will recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening \nretained earnings as of the adoption date. Management currently estimates the allowance for credit losses will be in a range \nof $11.5 million to $11.8 million, decreasing the allowance by approximately $2.4 million to $2.6 million. The estimated \nincrease to equity, net of tax, will range from $1.9 million to $2.1 million. The actual impact will depend on a number of \ninternal and external factors including: outstanding loan balances, characteristics of FNCB's loan and securities portfolios, \nmacroeconomic conditions, forecast information and management's judgement. \n  \nAnti-takeover provisions in FNCB’s charter documents could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control \nof FNCB’s company and diminish the value of FNCB’s common stock. \n  \nSome of the provisions of FNCB’s amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated \nbylaws, as amended, could make it difficult for its shareholders to change the composition of its board of directors, \npreventing them from changing the composition of management. In addition, the same provisions may discourage, delay or \nprevent a merger or acquisition that FNCB’s shareholders may consider favorable. These provisions include: \n  \n  \n● \nclassifying FNCB’s board of directors into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms; \n  \n● \nauthorizing FNCB’s board of directors to issue preferred shares without shareholder approval; \n  \n● \nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors; \n  \n● \nrequiring the approval of 75% of FNCB’s shareholders to approve any merger or sale of all, or substantially all, \nunless approval of such proposed transaction is recommended by at least a majority of FNCB’s entire board of \ndirectors; \n  \n● \nauthorizing FNCB’s board of directors to, if it deems advisable, oppose a tender or other offer for FNCB’s securities; \nand \n  \n● \nrequiring the approval of 75% of FNCB’s shareholders to amend certain provisions relating to business \ncombinations not approved by the board of directors."

FNCB and the Bank have an ongoing \ncomprehensive branch network improvement program that focuses on strengthening, better positioning and expanding its \nmarket coverage by developing new state-of-the-art customer facilities, as well as relocating and consolidating select \nlocations. Initiatives FNCB executed under the branch network improvement program during the years ended December 31, \n2022 and 2021 include: \n  \n  \n● \nOffice space at FNCB's community office, located in Exeter, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania was renovated to house \nthe 1st Equipment Finance and 1st Financial Services teams; \n  \n  \n● \nThe Bank's Wheeler Avenue Community Office was consolidated into its Main Office, in early 2022.  The branch \nwill be utilized as a temporary training facility until expiration of the lease in December 2024; and \n  \n  \n● \nOn September 23, 2022, the Bank purchased a property located at 2039 Delaware Street, Dunmore, Lackawanna \nCounty, Pennsylvania. The property, which is situated between the FNCB's Main Office and Corporate center, was \npurchased as part of FNCB's Simply Green initiative. FNCB plans to raze the building to provide green space for \nthe community."

The ALLL is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings \nand is maintained at a level management considers adequate to absorb estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio \nas of the evaluation date. Loans, or portions of loans, determined by management to be uncollectible are charged off against \nthe ALLL, while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the ALLL.  \n  \nDetermining the amount of the ALLL is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment \nand the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses \non pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, qualitative factors, and consideration of current economic \ntrends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. Banking regulators, as an integral part of their \nexamination of FNCB, also review the ALLL, and may require, based on their judgments about information available to them \nat the time of their examination, that certain loan balances be charged off or require that adjustments be made to the ALLL. \nAdditionally, the ALLL is determined, in part, by the composition and size of the loan portfolio. \n   \nThe ALLL consists primarily of two components, a specific component and a general component. The specific component \nrelates to loans that are classified as impaired. For such loans, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, \ncollateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general \ncomponent covers all other loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted by qualitative factors. The general reserve \ncomponent of the ALLL is based on pools of unimpaired loans segregated by loan segment and risk rating categories of \n“Pass”, “Special Mention” or “Substandard and Accruing.” Historical loss factors and various qualitative factors are applied \nbased on the risk profile in each risk rating category to determine the appropriate reserve related to those loans. Substandard \nloans on non-accrual status above the $100 thousand loan relationship threshold and all loans considered troubled debt \nrestructurings (“TDRs”) are classified as impaired. Based on its evaluations, management may establish an unallocated \ncomponent that is used to cover any inherent losses that exist as of the evaluation date, but which may not have been identified \nunder the methodology. \n  \nSee Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 4, “Loans” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial \nStatements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for \nadditional information about the ALLL. \n  \nSecurities Valuation and Evaluation for Impairment \n  \nManagement utilizes various inputs to determine the fair value of its investment portfolio. To the extent they exist, unadjusted \nquoted market prices in active markets (Level 1) or quoted prices for similar assets or models using inputs that are observable, \neither directly or indirectly (Level 2) are utilized to determine the fair value of each investment in the portfolio. In the absence \nof observable inputs or if markets are illiquid, valuation techniques are used to determine fair value of any investments that \nrequire inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement (Level 3). For Level 3 inputs, valuation \ntechniques are based on various assumptions, including, but not limited to, cash flows, discount rates, adjustments for \nnonperformance and liquidity, and liquidation values. A significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing investments \nusing Level 3 inputs. The use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on FNCB’s financial condition \nor results of operations. See Note 3, “Securities” and Note 15, “Fair Value Measurements” of the notes to consolidated \nfinancial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” to this Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for additional information about FNCB’s securities valuation techniques. \n  \nOn a quarterly basis, management evaluates individual investment securities in an unrealized loss position for other than \ntemporary impairment (“OTTI”). The evaluation for OTTI requires the use of various assumptions, including but not limited \nto, the length of time an investment’s fair value is less than book value, the severity of the investment’s decline, any credit \ndeterioration of the issuer, whether management intends to sell the security, and whether it is more-likely-than-not that FNCB \nwill be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. Debt investment securities deemed to have \nOTTI are written down by the impairment related to the estimated credit loss, and the non-credit related impairment loss is \nrecognized in other comprehensive income. FNCB did not recognize any OTTI charges on investment securities for years \nended December 31, 2022 and 2021 within the consolidated statements of income."

Judgement is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been \nrecognized in FNCB’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax \nconsequences could impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. \n  \nFNCB records an income tax provision or benefit based on the amount of tax currently payable or receivable and the change \nin deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the \ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. Management conducts quarterly \nassessments of all available positive and negative evidence to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that will more \nlikely than not be realized. FNCB establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and records a charge to income if \nmanagement determines, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not \nthat some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, \nmanagement considers past operating results, estimates of future taxable income based on approved business plans, future \ncapital requirements and ongoing tax planning strategies. This evaluation process involves significant management \njudgement about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period depending on the related circumstances. The \nrecognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant assumptions and judgements about future \nearnings, the periods in which items will impact taxable income, future corporate tax rates, and the application of inherently \ncomplex tax laws. The use of different estimates can result in changes in the amounts of deferred tax items recognized, which \nmay result in equity and earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. Management’s \nevaluation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 concluded that no valuation allowance was necessary for net deferred tax \nassets. \n  \nIn connection with determining the income tax provision or benefit, management considers maintaining liabilities for \nuncertain tax positions and tax strategies that it believes contain an element of uncertainty. Periodically, management \nevaluates each of FNCB’s tax positions and strategies to determine whether a liability for uncertain tax benefits is required. \nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, management determined that FNCB did not have any uncertain tax positions or tax \nstrategies and that no liability was required to be recorded.  \n  \nSee Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 11, “Income Taxes” of the Notes to Consolidated \nFinancial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” to this Annual Report on Form  \n10-K for additional information about the accounting for income taxes. \n   \nNew Authoritative Accounting Guidance and Accounting Guidance to be Adopted in Future Periods \n  \nFor information regarding new authoritative accounting guidance adopted by FNCB during the year ended December 31, \n2022 and accounting guidance that FNCB will adopt in future periods, see Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting \nPolicies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” \nto this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  \n  \nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW \n  \nThe following overview should be read in conjunction with this MD&A in its entirety. \n  \nResults of Operations \n \nNet income in 2022 amounted to $20.4 million, or $1.03 per diluted common share, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 4.4%, \ncompared to $21.4 million, or $1.06 per diluted common share, in 2021. The decrease in 2022 net income compared to \n2021 was primarily due to increases in non-interest expense and an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses, \nwhich were partially offset by an increase in net interest income. Non-interest expense was $35.5 million in 2022, an increase \nof $4.4 million, or 14.2%, from $31.1 million in 2021, which reflected a $2.6 million, or 15.5%, increase in salaries and \nemployee benefits. The provision for loan and lease losses increased $1.8 million to $2.0 million in 2022, from $166 \nthousand in 2021, due primarily to higher loan volume.

Income tax expense decreased $512 thousand, or \n11.0%, to $4.1 million in 2022 as compared to $4.7 million in 2021.    \n  \nReturn on average assets and return on average shareholders’ equity equaled 1.21% and 15.55%, respectively, in 2022, \ncompared to 1.36% and 13.46%, respectively, in 2021.  FNCB paid dividends to holders of common stock of $0.33 per share \nin 2022, an increase of $0.06 per share, or 22.2%, compared to $0.27 per share in 2021. Total dividends declared and paid in \n2022 equated to a dividend yield of approximately 4.0% based on the closing stock price of $8.21 per share on December 31, \n2022. The dividend payout ratio was 31.9% in 2022 compared to 25.4% in 2021. \n  \nBalance Sheet Profile \n  \nTotal assets increased $81.2 million, or 4.9%, to $1.746 billion at December 31, 2022 from $1.664 billion at December 31, \n2021. The balance sheet expansion primarily reflected substantial increases in loans and leases, net of allowance for loan and \nlease losses (\"ALLL\"), partially offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities. Loans \nand leases, net of ALLL, increased $143.1 million, or 14.8%, to $1.110 billion at December 31, 2022 from $967.0 million at \nDecember 31, 2021. Meanwhile, available-for-sale debt securities decreased $46.5 million, or 8.9%, to $476.1 million at \nDecember 31, 2022 from $522.6 million at December 31, 2021, which was caused largely by a decline in the fair value of \nthese securities due to rising interest rates. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $57.1 million, or 57.8%, to $41.9 million at \nDecember 31, 2022 from $99.0 million at December 31, 2021. Total deposits decreased $34.8 million, or 2.4%, to $1.421 \nbillion at December 31, 2022 from $1.455 billion at December 31, 2021, which reflected the return of municipal deposit \nseasonality and the outflow of excess COVID-19 deposits.  Borrowed funds increased $152.1 million to $182.4 million at \nDecember 31, 2022, compared to $30.3 million at December 31, 2021, as FNCB became more reliant on wholesale funding.   \n  \nTotal shareholders’ equity decreased $43.5 million, or 26.8%, to $118.9 million at December 31, 2022 from $162.5 million \nat December 31, 2021. Tangible book value decreased $2.09 per share, or 25.6%, to $6.04 per share at December 31, 2022 \nfrom $8.13 per share at December 31, 2021. The decreases in capital and tangible book value were primarily due to an \naccumulated other comprehensive loss of $48.0 million at December 31, 2022, compared to accumulated other \ncomprehensive income of $6.4 million at December 31, 2021. The negative change of $54.4 million was related primarily to \nthe depreciation in the fair value of FNCB's available-for-sale debt securities, net of deferred taxes, due to the dramatic \nincrease in market interest rates. Also impacting capital in 2022 was net income of $20.4 million partially offset by a $3.6 \nmillion utilized for the repurchase of common shares under a stock repurchase program authorized by FNCB's Board of \nDirectors and dividends declared and paid of $6.5 million. At December 31, 2022, FNCB Bank’s total risk-based capital ratio \nand the Tier 1 leverage ratio were 13.10% and 8.77%, respectively, which exceeded the 10.00% and 5.00% thresholds \nrequired to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Basel III capital framework for U.S. \nbanking organizations.  \n  \nManagement’s Focus in 2022 \n  \nManagement continued to navigate through the lingering challenges of the pandemic and manage the rising rate environment, \nduring 2022, while staying focused on several key strategic initiatives which included: strong organic loan growth, new \nproduct offerings and effectively managing funding costs. FNCB is always looking to improve the customer experience by \nfurther expanding and enhancing FNCB's digital and traditional product and service offerings; while continuing to create \nefficiency within FNCB's branch network and delivery channels; and investing in strategic business alliances and \nopportunities to advance financial performance over the long-term.  \n  \nIn 2022, FNCB's new commercial equipment financing and leasing product offerings, operating under 1st Equipment \nFinance were fully integrated and have exceeded management's expectations. This along with the purchase of several third-\nparty originated loan pools, allowed us to diversify FNCB's loan portfolio, reduce risk and enhance net interest income run \nrates going forward.  \n  \nIn addition, during 2022, FNCB acquired Chiaro Investment Services, LLC which was combined with FNCB's Wealth \nManagement team, and is now operating under a new brand, 1st Investment Service, out of FNCB Bank's Exeter Community \nOffice, in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.

The project will consist of 36 newly constructed senior housing units, located on Dickson Ave, in the Green Ridge \nsection of Scranton, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania. This project is expected to provide much needed housing for low-\nincome senior citizens, while revitalizing a large vacant lot in the city and is in line with FNCB's larger Community Caring \ninitiative. One hundred percent (100.0%) of the rental units will qualify for Federal Low-Housing Tax credits (\"LIHTCs\") as \nprovided for in Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. FNCB made an initial contribution of $2.2 \nmillion in the fourth quarter of 2022, upon closing the partnership agreement. The remaining obligation of $8.8 million, \nwhich is included on other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2022, will be \ncontributed over a series of draws over the following 18-month period according to the construction schedule. \n   \nFocus for 2023 \n  \nLooking ahead to 2023, with increased market rates, management will focus on balance sheet management, managing interest \nrate risk, controlling funding costs and continuing to evaluate opportunities to enhance net interest income and non-interest \nincome run rates going forward. FNCB will continue to expand its comprehensive digital strategy to respond to evolving \ncustomer demands and create operational and delivery channel efficiencies. Specific initiatives include enhancement to the \nexisting online banking platforms, continued utilization of our retail and commercial lending origination platforms and \nutilizing artificial intelligence and robotics to streamline workflows. Additional areas of focus for 2023 include: acquisition \nand retainage of qualified staff, building and strengthening our core customer base including increasing existing customer \nwallet share and organic loan growth. \n  \nStock Repurchase Program/Subsequent Event \n  \nOn January 25, 2023, FNCB's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which up to 750,000 shares \nof FNCB's outstanding common stock may be acquired in the open market commencing no earlier than March 3, 2023 and \nexpiring December 31, 2023 pursuant to a trading plan that was adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange \nAct. In 2022 and 2021, the Board of Directors had authorized similar programs under which 384,830 and 330,759 common \nshares were repurchased, respectively. The 2022 plan expired on December 31, 2022. The repurchase of shares under the \nprograms are administered through an independent broker. Repurchases may occur from time to time at prevailing market \nprices, through open market transactions depending upon market conditions, and are subject to SEC regulations as well as \ncertain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the trading plan. Under the program, the purchases will be \nfunded from working capital presently available to FNCB, and the repurchased shares will be returned to the status of \nauthorized but unissued shares of Common Stock. There is not a guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be \nrepurchased by FNCB, and FNCB may discontinue purchases at any time that management determines additional repurchases \nare no longer warranted. As of December 31, 2022, FNCB had approximately 19.7 million shares outstanding. \n  \nSUMMARY OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE \n  \nNet Interest Income \n  \nNet interest income is the difference between (i) interest income, interest and fees on interest-earning assets, and (ii) interest \nexpense, interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income represents the largest component of FNCB’s \noperating income and, as such, is the primary determinant of profitability. Net interest income is impacted by variations in \nthe volume, rate and composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in general market interest rates \nand the level of non-performing assets. Interest income is shown on a fully tax-equivalent basis using the corporate statutory \ntax rate of 21.0% in 2022, 2021 and 2020.  \n  \nIn response to the economic uncertainty from the global COVID-19 pandemic, the FOMC lowered the federal funds rate 150 \nbasis points in two emergency actions in March 2020. As a result, the target range for federal funds fell from 1.50%-1.75% \nat December 31, 2019 to 0.00%-0.25% at March 31, 2022 and had remained at these historically low levels through March \n15, 2022. Supply chain constraints, the war in Ukraine and lingering effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, among other \nthings, have resulted in rapid rise in price inflation. As a result, the FOMC, in an effort to lower inflation to its 2.0% objective, \nbegan tightening U.S. monetary policy in 2022.  Specifically, the FOMC increased the target range for the federal funds rate \nseven times for a total of 425 basis points during 2022, which included additional upward movements in the fourth quarter \nof 75 basis points on November 2, 2022 and 50 basis points on December 14, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the federal funds \ntarget range was 4.25%-4.50% compared to 0.00%-0.25% at December 31, 2021. The increase in the federal funds target rate \nresulted in a corresponding increase of 425 basis points in the national prime rate to 7.50% at December 31, 2022 compared \nto 3.25% at December 31, 2021. In addition to these actions by the FOMC in 2022, on February 1, 2023, the FOMC raised"

This dramatic shift to tighten monetary policy has resulted in a rapid \nrise in general market interest rates. Competition for deposits within FNCB's market area has intensified reflective of \nindustrywide liquidity pressures and rate-sensitivity of depositors. Higher interest rates, coupled with the increased \ncompetition, has resulted in significant increases in deposit and wholesale funding costs that have surpassed increases in \nearning asset yields, which has caused interest margin and rate spread compression. Management anticipates that additional \ntightening actions by the FOMC in 2023, could result in further contraction of FNCB's tax-equivalent net interest margin and \nrate spread.  \n  \nAdditionally, net interest income, earning assets yields and the net interest margin for the period ending December 31, 2022 \nand 2021 were impacted by the activity related to PPP loans, including the timing of forgiveness and recognition of net loan \norigination fees. \n   \nTax-equivalent net interest income increased $5.3 million, or 10.5%, to $55.2 million in 2022 compared to $49.9 million in \n2021. The increase in tax-equivalent net interest income was due to an increase in tax-equivalent interest income \nreflecting higher earning asset volumes and yields, partially offset by an increase in interest expense which resulted primarily \nfrom increased utilization of wholesale funding costs and higher funding costs. Tax-equivalent net interest margin, a key \nmeasurement used in the banking industry to measure income from earning assets relative to the cost to fund those assets, is \ncalculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest income by average interest-earning assets. FNCB's tax-equivalent net \ninterest margin declined 7 basis points to 3.38% in 2022 compared to 3.45% in 2021, which was largely caused by an increase \nin average earning assets, coupled with higher funding costs. Additionally, the magnitude and velocity of the rate increases \nin 2022 has led to a decrease in FNCB's rate spread, the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets shown \non a fully tax-equivalent basis and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, as funding costs increased to a greater extent \nthan asset yields. FNCB's rate spread was 3.24% in 2022, a decrease of 14 basis points as compared to 3.38% in 2021.  \n  \nTax-equivalent interest income increased $9.3 million, or 17.6%, to $61.9 million in 2022 from $52.6 million in 2021, which \nwas largely caused by significant growth in average earning assets, coupled with an increase in the tax-equivalent yield on \naverage earning assets. Average earning assets increased $183.5 million, or 12.7%, to $1.633 billion in 2022 from $1.449 \nbillion in 2021, resulting in a corresponding increase to tax-equivalent interest income of $8.4 million. Specifically, average \nloans and leases increased $123.9 million, or 13.0%, to $1.074 billion in 2022 from $950.5 million in 2021, which reflected \nnew product offerings, strong organic loan demand and the purchase of loan pools from third party originators. Investment \nsecurities averaged $550.1 million in 2022, an increase of $120.4 million, or 28.0%, compared to $429.6 million in 2021, \nwhich contributed $3.1 million to tax-equivalent interest income.  The tax-equivalent yield on earning assets increased 16 \nbasis points to 3.79% in 2022 from 3.63%, which resulted in a corresponding increase in tax-equivalent interest income of \n$0.8 million. Specifically, FNCB's tax-equivalent yield on loans and leases increased 7 basis points to 4.43% in \n2022 compared to 4.36% in 2021, resulting in a corresponding increase in tax-equivalent interest income of $0.7 million. \nMeanwhile, the tax-equivalent yield on investment securities decreased 1 basis points to 2.58% in 2022 from 2.59% in \n2021 and caused a corresponding decrease to tax-equivalent interest income of $44 thousand.  \n  \nInterest expense increased $4.0 million, or 148.9%, to $6.7 million in 2022 from $2.7 million in 2021, which primarily from \nan increase in averaged borrowed funds, coupled with an increase in funding costs. Similar to the banking industry in general, \nFNCB was more reliant on wholesale funding in 2022.  As a result, average borrowed funds, which is largely comprised of \nFHLB of Pittsburgh advances, averaged $109.5 million for 2022, an increase of $97.3 million from just $12.2 million for \n2021. Higher volumes of average borrowed funds resulted in a corresponding increase in interest expense of $2.4 \nmillion. Total interest-bearing deposits increased $51.8 million, or 4.9%, to $1.118 billion for 2022, compared to $1.066 \nbillion for 2021, which had little impact on interest expense as increases in lower-costing interest-bearing demand and savings \nvolumes were offset by a reduction in higher-costing time deposit volumes. Specifically, average interest-bearing demand \ndeposits, increased $50.8 million, or 6.6%, to $815.6 million in 2022, compared to $764.8 million in 2021.  Savings deposits \naveraged $144.3 million in 2022, an increase of $19.3 million, or 15.5%, from $125.0 million in 2021. Conversely, average \ntime deposits decreased $18.3 million, or 10.4%, to $158.0 million in 2022 from $176.3 million in 2021. In the first half of \n2022, management was successful in delaying deposit rate increases, however, in the latter half of 2022, following the rapid \nrise in market interest rates and change in overall market liquidity, competition for deposits intensified and depositors have \nbecome increasingly rate sensitive. Due to increased competitive pressures, FNCB responded with increases in deposit \nrates. As a result, FNCB experienced an increase interest expense due to an increase in funding costs. For the year-ended \nDecember 31, 2022, FNCB's cost of funds increased 30 basis points to 0.55% from 0.25% for the year ended December 31, \n2021, which resulted in a corresponding increase in tax-equivalent interest expense of $1.6 million."

Despite continued economic uncertainty and inflationary \npressures due to remnants of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain constraints and other factors such as the war in Ukraine, \nwhich have resulted in monetary policy tightening, FNCB's asset quality metrics have remained mostly favorable throughout \n2022 and 2021.  \n   \nNon-Interest Income \n  \nThe following table presents the components of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:  \n  \nComponents of Non-Interest Income \n  \n  \n  \nYear Ended December 31, \n  \n  \n    \n  \n      \n  \n    \nChange \n  \n(in thousands) \n  \n2022 \n    \n2021 \n    \n$ \n    \n% \n  \nDeposit service charges ................................................................  $\n4,415    $ \n3,877    $\n538      \n13.9% \nNet (loss) gain on the sale of available-for-sale debt securities ...    \n(223)     \n213      \n(436)     \n(204.7) \nNet (loss) gain on equity securities ..............................................    \n(34)     \n701      \n(735)     \n(104.9) \nNet gain on the sale of mortgage loans held for sale ....................    \n205      \n352      \n(147)     \n(41.8) \nNet gain on the sale of other real estate owned ............................    \n-      \n11      \n(11)     \n(100.0) \nLoan-related fees ..........................................................................    \n243      \n390      \n(147)     \n(37.7) \nIncome from bank-owned life insurance ......................................    \n710      \n541      \n169      \n31.2  \nBank-owned life insurance settlement .........................................    \n273      \n426      \n(153)     \n(35.9) \nLoan referral fees .........................................................................    \n191      \n72      \n119      \n164.8  \nMerchant services revenue ...........................................................    \n712      \n593      \n119      \n20.1  \nWealth management services revenue .........................................    \n563      \n543      \n20      \n3.7  \nOther.............................................................................................    \n926      \n560      \n366      \n65.4  \nTotal non-interest income .....................................................  $\n7,981    $ \n8,268    $\n(287)     \n(3.5)% \n  \nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, non-interest income decreased $287 thousand, or 3.5%, to $8.0 million compared to \n$8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 3.5% decrease in non-interest income primarily from an unfavorable \nchange in market value of equity securities and a net loss on the sale of available-for-sale debt securities, coupled with \nreductions in net gains on the sale of mortgages held for sale, and loan-related fees. Stock market volatility resulted in FNCB \nrecoding a net loss on equity securities of $34 thousand in 2022, compared to a net gain of $735 thousand recorded in 2021. \nAdditionally, FNCB recorded a net loss on the sale of available-for sale debt securities of $223 thousand in 2022, compared \nto a net gain of $213 thousand in 2021, a decrease of $436 thousand, or 204.7%. Net gains on the sale of mortgages held for \nsale decreased $147 thousand, or 41.8%, to $205 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $352 \nthousand for the year ended December 31, 2021, as pricing margins on loans and the volume of loan sales decreased due to \nthe rapid rise in market interest rates. Loan-related fees decreased $147 thousand, or 37.7%, to $243 thousand in 2022 from \n$390 thousand in 2021, which was largely due to a reduction in loan servicing and letter of credit fees. Additionally, FNCB \nrecorded income associated with BOLI death benefit claims of $273 thousand in 2022 and $426 thousand in 2021, a \ndecrease of $153 thousand, or 35.9%.  \n \nPartially offsetting these decreases in non-interest income, were increases in deposit service charges, BOLI income, loan \nreferral fees, merchant services revenue and other income. Loan referral fees, which include fees received from third-party \ncounterparties related to various commercial loan interest rate swap transactions and fees received for the referral of FHA \nresidential mortgage loans to a third-party broker, increased $119 thousand. The decrease in these fees reflected a reduction \nin the number and volume of such transactions in 2022 as compared to 2021. Deposit service charges increased $538 \nthousand, or 13.9%, to $4.4 million in 2022, compared to $3.9 million in 2021, which was primarily due to increases in \ntransactional-related charges, check card fees and wire transfer fees. During 2022, FNCB purchased $3.0 million in \nadditional BOLI policies, which was the primary factor for the $169 thousand, or 31.2%, increase in BOLI income. \nComparing 2022 and 2021, loan referral fees and merchant services revenue each increased by $119 thousand. Loan referral \nfees include fees received from third-party counterparties to commercial loan interest rate swap transactions and fees \nreceived for the referral of FHA residential mortgage loans to a third-party broker. The 164.8% increase in loan referral \nfees largely reflected an increase in the number and volume of such transaction due to changing market conditions, while \nthe 20.1% increase in revenue from merchant services resulted primarily from an increase in card processing revenue due to \nthe continued shift to e-commerce. The $366 thousand, or 35.0%, increase in other income was due primarily to an increase \nin commissions received from FNCB's third-party credit card and purchasing card provider."

      "text": "36 \nAs previously mentioned, on September 30, 2022 FNCB announced that the Bank had entered into an asset purchase \nagreement with Chiaro Investment Services, LLC, which was combined into the Bank's investment arm and now operates \nunder the new brand as 1st Investment Services. As a result of this transaction, FNCB anticipates an increase in income from \nwealth management services in 2023. \n  \nOn October 26, 2022, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (\"CFPB\") issued supervisory guidance which warned \nfinancial institutions that levying overdraft fees to consumers who would not reasonably anticipate the fees may constitute \nan unfair act or practice under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (\"CFPA\"). In addition, the CFPB issued a \ncompliance bulletin warning that certain depositor fees may similarly violate the CFPA. This guidance comes as a next step \nin the CFPB’s “junk fee” initiative, launched in January 2022, through which the CFPB has endeavored to identify and take \ncertain steps to curb potentially exploitative fees charged by banks and other financial institutions. While management does \nnot believe that FNCB's overdraft fees are in violation of the CFPA, the banking industry, in general, experienced a significant \nreduction in overdraft fee income in 2022, as many larger financial institutions have eliminated overdraft charges on \nconsumer checking accounts. Competition from large banks and the imposition of restrictions on overdraft fees by the federal \ngovernment may result in FNCB having to change its overdraft fee structure, which could negatively impact future non-\ninterest income run rates.   \n   \nNon-Interest Expense \n  \nThe following table presents the major components of non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n  \nComponents of Non-Interest Expense \n  \n  \n  \nYear Ended December 31, \n  \n  \n    \n  \n      \n  \n    \nChange \n  \n(in thousands) \n  \n2022 \n    \n2021 \n    \n$ \n    \n% \n  \nSalaries and employee benefits ....................................................   $\n19,283    $\n16,697    $\n2,586      \n15.5%\nOccupancy expense ......................................................................     \n2,093      \n2,039      \n54      \n2.6  \nEquipment expense ......................................................................     \n1,295      \n1,338      \n(43)     \n(3.2) \nAdvertising expense .....................................................................     \n801      \n712      \n89      \n12.5  \nData processing expense ..............................................................     \n4,027      \n3,689      \n338      \n9.2  \nRegulatory assessments ................................................................     \n811      \n609      \n202      \n33.2  \nBank shares tax ............................................................................     \n915      \n975      \n(60)     \n(6.2) \nProfessional fees ...........................................................................     \n1,273      \n674      \n599      \n88.9  \nOther operating expenses .............................................................     \n4,976      \n4,336      \n640      \n14.8  \nTotal non-interest expense ....................................................   $\n35,474    $\n31,069    $\n4,405      \n14.2%\n  \nNon-interest expense totaled $35.5 million in 2022, an increase of $4.4 million, or 14.2%, from $31.1 million in 2021. \nThe increase resulted primarily from increases in salaries and employee benefits, professional fees, data processing expenses, \nregulatory assessments and other operating expenses. \n  \nSalaries and employee benefits increased $2.6 million, or 15.5%, to $19.3 million in 2022 from $16.7 million in 2021. The \nincrease in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to higher full-time salaries, payroll taxes and benefits associated \nwith staff additions. Also factoring into the increase in salaries and employee benefits were increases in employment \nretirement plan contributions and incentive pay. Recognizing the impact of inflation on employees, at the end of 2022, FNCB \nawarded each employee a one-time employee appreciation bonus to alleviate some of the pressure, the aggregate cost of this \none-time award was $393 thousand.  \n  \nAt the end of 2022, management engaged a third-party consultant to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of FNCB's salary \nand benefit structure and industry comparison. As a result of this study, FNCB has increased the minimum starting salary for \nnew employees and will be adjusting salary ranges to be competitive as appropriate. Additionally, FNCB increased the 2023 \nannual cost of living/merit increase for employees. As a result of these changes, management anticipates FNCB's personnel-\nrelated costs will continue to increase in 2023.  \n  \nProfessional fees increased $599 thousand, or 88.9%, to $1.3 million in 2022, compared to $674 thousand in 2021, while data \nprocessing expenses increased $338 thousand, or 9.2%, to $4.0 million in 2022, compared to $3.7 million in 2021. These \nincreases were primarily due to additional costs associated with the new retail mortgage and commercial lending platforms, \ncoupled with consulting and validation services associated with implementation of CECL. Additionally, comparing 2022 and \n2021, regulatory assessments increased $202 thousand, or 33.2%, due largely to balance sheet growth, while other operating"

The decrease in income tax expense was due to lower taxable income in 2022 as compared to 2021. FNCB's effective \ntax rate decreased to 16.85% at December 31, 2022, compared to 17.89% at December 31, 2021, which resulted primarily \nfrom an increase in tax-exempt income. \n   \nManagement evaluates the carrying amount of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, or more frequently, as necessary, \nin accordance with guidance set forth in ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes,” and applies the criteria in the guidance to determine \nwhether it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within its life cycle, \nbased on the weight of available evidence. If management determines based on available evidence, both positive and negative, \nthat it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in future periods, a valuation \nallowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and depend upon management’s \nestimates and judgments used in their evaluation of both positive and negative evidence. \n  \nIn evaluating available evidence, management considers, among other factors, historical financial performance, expectation \nof future earnings, the ability to carry back losses to recoup taxes previously paid, length of statutory carry forward periods, \nexperience with operating loss and tax credit carry forwards not expiring unused, tax planning strategies and timing of \nreversals of temporary differences. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management carefully weighs both \npositive and negative evidence currently available. \n  \nManagement performed an evaluation of FNCB’s deferred tax assets at December 31, 2022 taking into consideration both \npositive and negative evidence as of that date.  Based on this evaluation, management believes that FNCB's future taxable \nincome will be sufficient to utilize deferred tax assets.  Accordingly, management concluded that no valuation allowance for \ndeferred tax assets was required at December 31, 2022 or 2021.  \n \nFINANCIAL CONDITION \n  \nTotal assets increased $81.2 million, or 4.9%, to $1.746 billion at December 31, 2022 from $1.664 billion at December 31, \n2021. The balance sheet expansion primarily reflected substantial increases in loans and leases, net of ALLL, partially offset \nby decreases in cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities. Loans and leases, net of ALLL, increased \n$143.1 million, or 14.8%, to $1.110 billion at December 31, 2022 from $967.0 million at December 31, 2021. Available-for-\nsale debt securities decreased $46.5 million, or 8.9%, to $476.1 million at December 31, 2022 from $522.6 million at \nDecember 31, 2021, which was caused largely by a decline in the fair value of these securities due to rising interest rates. \nCash and cash equivalents decreased $57.1 million, or 57.8%, to $41.9 million at December 31, 2022 from $99.0 million at \nDecember 31, 2021. Total deposits decreased $34.8 million, or 2.4%, to $1.421 billion at December 31, 2022 from \n$1.455 billion at December 31, 2021, which reflected the return municipal deposit seasonality and the outflow of excess \nCOVID-19 deposits. FNCB increased its utilization of wholesale funding, specifically advances through the FHLB of \nPittsburgh, to fund loan growth. As a result, borrowed funds increased $152.1 million, or 501.6%, to $182.4 million at \nDecember 31, 2022, compared to $30.3 million at December 31, 2021.  \n  \nTotal shareholders’ equity decreased $43.5 million, or 26.8%, to $118.9 million at December 31, 2022 from $162.5 million \nat December 31, 2021. The decrease in capital was primarily due to an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $48.0 million \nat December 31, 2022, compared to accumulated other comprehensive income of $6.4 million at December 31, 2021. The \nnegative change of $54.4 million was related primarily to the depreciation in the fair value of FNCB's available-for-sale debt \nsecurities, net of deferred taxes, and was the main factor contributing to a $2.09 per share, or 25.6% decrease in tangible book \nvalue to $6.04 per share at December 31, 2022 from $8.13 per share at December 31, 2021. Also impacting capital in 2022 \nwas net income of $20.4 million partially offset by a $3.6 million utilized for the repurchase of common shares under a stock \nrepurchase program authorized by FNCB's Board of Directors and dividends declared and paid of $6.5 million. At December \n31, 2022, FNCB Bank’s total risk-based capital ratio and the Tier 1 leverage ratio were 13.11% and 8.77%, respectively, \nwhich exceeded the thresholds of 10.00% and 5.00% required to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action \nprovisions of the Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations."

      "text": "38 \nCash and Cash Equivalents \n  \nCash and cash equivalents decreased $57.1 million, or 57.8%, to $ 41.9 million at December 31, 2022, from $99.0 million at \nDecember 31, 2021.  The decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from cash used to fund earning asset \ngrowth. Additionally, FNCB paid cash dividends totaling $6.5 million, or $0.330 per share in 2022 compared to $5.4 million, \nor $0.27 per share, in 2021, while purchase of common shares under the repurchase program amounted to $3.6 million in \n2022 compared to $2.4 million in 2021. \n  \nSecurities \n  \nFNCB’s investment securities portfolio provides a source of liquidity needed to meet expected loan demand and interest \nincome to increase profitability. Additionally, the investment securities portfolio is used to meet pledging requirements to \nsecure public deposits and for other purposes. Debt securities are classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at \nthe time of purchase based on management's intent. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized \nholding gains and losses reported as a component of shareholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), \nnet of tax, while held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, all debt securities \nwere classified as available-for-sale. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are carried at fair value, with \ngains and losses due to fluctuations in market value included in the consolidated statements of income. Securities with limited \nmarketability and/or restrictions, such as FHLB of Pittsburgh stock, are carried at cost. Decisions to purchase or sell \ninvestment securities are based upon management’s current assessment of long- and short-term economic and financial \nconditions, including the interest rate environment and asset/liability management, liquidity and tax-planning strategies.  \n   \nAt December 31, 2022, the investment portfolio was comprised principally of available-for-sale debt securities including, \nfixed-rate, taxable and tax-exempt obligations of state and political subdivisions and fixed-rate and floating-rate securities \nissued by U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored agencies, which include mortgage-backed securities and \nresidential and commercial collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMOs\"). FNCB also holds investments, to a lesser extent, \nin private CMO's, corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities and U.S. Treasury securities. Additionally, FNCB holds \nequity investments in the common and preferred stock of certain publicly traded bank holding companies. Except for U.S. \ngovernment and government-sponsored agencies, there were no securities of any individual issuer that exceeded 10.0% of \nshareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2022.  \n  \nThe majority of FNCB's debt securities are fixed-rate instruments and inherently subject to interest rate risk, as the value of \nfixed-rate securities fluctuate with changes in interest rates.  U.S. Treasury rates increased dramatically in 2022 as the FOMC \ncontinued to tighten monetary policy. Additionally, as short-term interest rates moved up sharply, the yield curve was inverted \nat December 31, 2022, causing spreads between the 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury rates to go negative. The 10-year \nTreasury rate, which was 1.52% at December 31, 2021, increased 236 basis points to 3.88% at December 31, 2022, while the \n2-year Treasury rate, which was 0.73% at December 31, 2021, increased 368 basis point to 4.41% at December 31, 2022. \nThese movements resulted in a negative spread of 53-basis points between the 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury, compared \nto a positive spread of 0.79% at December 31, 2021. Generally, a security's value reacts inversely with changes in interest \nrates. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses reported in the accumulated other \ncomprehensive income or loss component of shareholder's equity net of deferred income taxes. At December 31, 2022, FNCB \nreported a net unrealized loss, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, of $48.8 million, net of deferred income \ntaxes of $13.0 million, a decrease of $55.0 million compared to the net unrealized holding gain of $6.1 million, net of deferred \nincome taxes of $1.6 million, at December 31, 2021. Any further increase in interest rates could result in further depreciation \nin the fair value of FNCB’s securities portfolio and capital position. However, accumulated other comprehensive income and \nloss related to available-for-sale debt securities is excluded from regulatory capital and does not have an impact on FNCB's \nregulatory capital ratios."

Semiannually, \nmanagement engages a third-party consultant to review the municipal portfolio to determine if there is any undue credit risk \nwithin the portfolio. As part of the independent review, each municipal security is compared to their Portfolio Credit \nBenchmark to identify which securities may contain more than a minimal risk of payment default.  As of December 31, \n2022, the third-party report concluded that each municipal security held within the portfolio met or exceeded the benchmark \nand that none of the securities required further review. The next third-party review is scheduled for June 30, 2023.  \nManagement also monitors municipal securities monthly using a third-party surveillance report that identifies events related \nto the issuer that may indicate a deterioration in credit quality. Management noted no such events during 2022."

The growth in the loan and lease portfolio reflected increases in all major loan categories, \nwhich was primarily due to strong organic demand and the new commercial equipment financing product line.  In addition, \nFNCB purchased individual loans and loan pools originated by third-party originators to enhance interest income revenue \nstreams and diversify the loan portfolio. Loan purchases through 2022 included commercial equipment financing, residential \nmortgages loans and secured and unsecured consumer installment loans. FNCB expanded its commercial credit product \nofferings to include commercial equipment financing, including simple interest loans and direct finance and municipal leases, \nthrough its brand 1st Equipment Finance. The majority of equipment financing is originated through indirect, third-party \ndealers. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, simple interest loans outstanding under this initiative totaled $78.4 million and \n$7.9 million, respectively, and are included with commercial and industrial loans. Also included with commercial and \nindustrial loans and originated under this initiative are direct finance leases, which totaled $0.9 million at December 31, 2022. \nThere were no direct leases outstanding at December 31, 2021. Municipal leases originated under this initiative were $4.4 \nmillion and $2.4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022 and 2021 and are included in state and municipal subdivision \nloans and leases."

      "text": "41 \nAlso included in commercial and industrial loans and leases at December 31, 2022 and 2021, were $1.3 million and $21.9 \nmillion, respectively, in outstanding balances of PPP loans, which are 100.0% guaranteed by the SBA. Accordingly, \nmanagement excluded PPP loans in its evaluations of the ALLL and there was no ALLL established for PPP loans at \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. \n  \nFrom a collateral standpoint, a majority of FNCB’s loan portfolio consists of loans secured by real estate. Real estate secured \nloans, which include commercial real estate, construction, land acquisition and development, and residential real estate \nloans increased by $52.1 million, or 8.1%, to $693.8 million at December 31, 2022 from $641.7 million at December 31, \n2021. However, the percentage of real estate secured loans to total loans and leases decreased to 61.8% at December 31, 2022 \nfrom 65.4% at December 31, 2021, which primarily reflected the originations through 1st Equipment Finance.  \n  \nCommercial real estate loans, which include long-term commercial mortgage financing and are primarily secured by first or \nsecond lien mortgages, increased $11.0 million, or 3.0%, to $377.0 million at December 31, 2022, from $366.0 million at \nDecember 31, 2021. Commercial and industrial loans consist primarily of equipment loans and leases, including purchased \ncommercial equipment loans, working capital financing, revolving lines of credit and loans secured by cash and marketable \nsecurities and remaining PPP loans.  Commercial and industrial loans increased $78.9 million, or 40.9%, during the year to \n$272.0 million at December 31, 2022 from $193.1 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to \nequipment loan and lease origination through 1st Equipment Finance and the purchase of loan pools through third-party \noriginators, which was partially offset by forgiveness of PPP loans. Construction, land acquisition and development loans \nincreased $25.0 million, or 60.1%, to $66.6 million at December 31, 2022 from $41.6 million at December 31, 2021. \n   \nResidential real estate loans include fixed-rate and variable-rate, amortizing mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit \n(\"HELOCs\") and HELCOs with a carve out feature. FNCB primarily underwrites fixed-rate purchase and refinance of \nresidential mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market to reduce interest rate risk and provide funding for additional \nloans. Additionally, FNCB offers a propriety non-saleable mortgage product branded as the WOW mortgage. The WOW \nmortgage has maturity terms of 10 to 19.5 years and offers customers an attractive fixed interest rate and low closing \ncosts. Residential real estate loans totaled $250.2 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of $16.1 million, or 6.9%, from \n$234.1 million at December 31, 2021.  \n  \nConsumer loans totaled $92.6 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of $7.1 million, or 8.3%, from $85.5 million at \nDecember 31, 2021. The increase in consumer loans was largely due to the purchase of individual and loans and pools of \npersonal installment loans from third-party originators including unsecured loans and loans secured by chattel paper. Loans \nto state and municipal governments increased $3.8 million, or 6.2%, to $64.9 million at December 31, 2022 from $61.1 \nmillion at December 31, 2021.  \n  \nThe following table presents loans and leases receivable, net by major category at December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n  \nLoan and Lease Portfolio Detail \n  \n  \n  \nDecember 31, \n  \n  \n  \n2022 \n    \n2021 \n  \n  \n    \n  \n    % of Total       \n  \n    % of Total   \n(in thousands) \n  Amount     \nLoans, \nGross \n    Amount     \nLoans, \nGross \n  \nResidential real estate ...................................................................  $\n250,221      \n22.28%  $\n234,113      \n23.86%\nCommercial real estate .................................................................    \n376,976      \n33.56      \n366,009      \n37.29  \nConstruction, land acquisition and development ..........................    \n66,555      \n5.92      \n41,646      \n4.24  \nCommercial and industrial ...........................................................    \n272,024      \n24.22      \n193,086      \n19.67  \nConsumer .....................................................................................    \n92,612      \n8.24      \n85,522      \n8.72  \nState and political subdivisions ....................................................    \n64,955      \n5.78      \n61,071      \n6.22  \nTotal loans, gross ..................................................................    1,123,343      \n100.00%    \n981,447      \n100.00%\nUnearned income .........................................................................    \n(810)     \n       \n(1,442)     \n   \nNet deferred loan and lease fees ...................................................    \n1,784      \n       \n(566)     \n   \nAllowance for loan and lease losses .............................................    \n(14,193)     \n       \n(12,416)     \n   \nLoans and leases, net .............................................................  $ 1,110,124      \n     $\n967,023"

The ALLL \nis established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to earnings. \n  \nFNCB has established and consistently applies loan policies and procedures designed to foster sound underwriting and credit \nmonitoring practices. Credit risk is managed through the efforts of loan officers, the Chief Credit Officer, the loan review \nfunction, and the Credit Risk Management and the ALLL committees, as well as oversight from the Board of Directors, \nincluding the Director's Loan Committee. Management continually evaluates its credit risk management practices to \nensure problems in the loan portfolio are addressed in a timely manner, although, as is the case with any financial institution, \na certain degree of credit risk is dependent in part on local and general economic conditions that are beyond management’s \ncontrol. \n  \nUnder FNCB’s risk rating system, loans that are rated pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss are reviewed \nregularly as part of the risk management practices. The Credit Risk Management Committee, which consists of key members \nof management from the finance, legal, retail lending and credit administration units, meets monthly, or more often as \nnecessary, to review individual problem credits and workout strategies and provides monthly reports to the Director's Loan \nCommittee and full Board of Directors. \n  \nA loan is considered impaired when it is probable that FNCB will be unable to collect all amounts due (including principal \nand interest) according to the contractual terms of the note and loan agreement. For purposes of the analysis, all TDRs, loan \nrelationships with an aggregate outstanding balance greater than $100 thousand rated substandard and non-accrual, and loans \nthat are identified as doubtful or loss are considered impaired. Impaired loans are analyzed individually to determine the \namount of impairment. For collateral-dependent loans, impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral \nsupporting the loans. A loan is determined to be collateral dependent when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided \nthrough the operation or liquidation of the collateral held. For impaired loans that are secured by real estate, management \nobtains external appraisals annually, or more frequently as warranted, to ascertain a fair value so that the impairment analysis \ncan be updated. Should a current appraisal not be available at the time of impairment analysis, management may use other \nvaluations sources, including current letters of intent, broker price opinions or executed agreements of sale. Under the fair \nvalue of collateral method, the impaired amount of the loan is deemed to be the difference between the loan amount and the \nfair value of the collateral, less the estimated costs to sell. For real estate secured loans, management generally estimates \nselling costs using a factor of 10%, which is based on typical cost factors, such as a 6% broker commission, 1% transfer \ntaxes, and 3% various other miscellaneous costs associated with the sales process. If the valuation indicates that the fair value \nhas deteriorated below the carrying value of the loan, the difference between the fair value and the principal balance is either \ncharged off or a specific reserve is established. For impaired loans for which the value of the collateral less estimated costs \nto sell exceeds the loan value, the impairment is determined to be zero. For non-collateral-dependent loans, impairment is \nmeasured based on the present value of expected future cash flows, net of any deferred fees and costs, discounted at the loan’s \noriginal effective interest rate.  \n  \nLoans to borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty that are modified and result in the granting of concessions to the \nborrowers are classified as TDRs and are considered to be impaired. Such concessions generally involve an extension of a \nloan’s stated maturity date, a reduction of the stated interest rate, payment modifications, capitalization of property taxes with \nrespect to mortgage loans or a combination of these modifications. Non-accrual TDRs are returned to accrual status if \nprincipal and interest payments, under the modified terms, are brought current, are performing under the modified terms for \nsix consecutive months, and management believes that collection of the remaining interest and principal is probable."

Additionally, work-out for \nnon-performing loans and OREO are actively monitored through the Credit Risk Management Committee. A potential loss \non a non-performing asset is generally determined by comparing the outstanding loan balance to the fair market value of the \npledged collateral, less estimated cost to sell. \n   \nLoans are placed on non-accrual when a loan is specifically determined to be impaired or when management believes that \nthe collection of interest or principal is doubtful. This generally occurs when a default of interest or principal has existed for \n90 days or more, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection, or when management becomes aware of \nfacts or circumstances that the loan would default before 90 days. FNCB determines delinquency status based on the number \nof days since the date of the borrower’s last required contractual loan payment. When the interest accrual is discontinued, all \nunpaid interest income is reversed and charged back against current earnings. Any subsequent cash payments received are \napplied, first to the outstanding loan amounts, then to the recovery of any charged-off loan amounts, with any excess treated \nas a recovery of lost interest. A non-accrual loan is returned to accrual status when the loan is current as to principal and \ninterest payments, is performing according to contractual terms for six consecutive months and future payments are \nreasonably assured.  \n  \nManagement actively manages impaired loans in an effort to mitigate loss to FNCB by working with customers to develop \nstrategies to resolve borrower difficulties, through sale or liquidation of collateral, foreclosure, and other appropriate means, \nIn addition, management monitors employment and economic conditions within FNCB's market area, as weakening of \nconditions could result in real estate devaluations and an increase in loan delinquencies, which could negatively impact asset \nquality and cause an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses. \n  \nThe following table presents information about non-performing assets and accruing TDRs as of December 31, for each of the \nlast five years: \n  \nNon-performing Assets and Accruing TDRs \n  \n  \n  \nDecember 31, \n  \n(dollars in thousands) \n  \n2022 \n    \n2021 \n    \n2020 \n    \n2019 \n    \n2018 \n  \nNon-accrual loans, including non-accrual TDRs .  $\n2,763    $ \n3,863    $ \n5,581    $\n9,084    $ \n4,696  \nLoans past due 90 days or more and still \naccruing ............................................................   \n79     \n-     \n-     \n-     \n-  \nTotal non-performing loans ..............................   \n2,842     \n3,863     \n5,581     \n9,084     \n4,696  \nOther real estate owned ........................................   \n-     \n920     \n58     \n289     \n919  \nOther non-performing assets ................................   \n1,773     \n1,773     \n1,900     \n1,900     \n1,900  \nTotal non-performing assets ..........................  $\n4,615    $ \n6,556    $ \n7,539    $\n11,273    $ \n7,515  \n  \n     \n       \n       \n       \n       \n  \nAccruing TDRs ....................................................  $\n5,554    $ \n6,666    $ \n6,975    $\n7,745    $ \n8,457  \nNon-performing loans as a percentage of total \nloans, gross .......................................................   \n0.25%   \n0.39%   \n0.62%   \n1.10%   \n0.56%\n  \nFNCB's asset quality remained favorable throughout 2022.

The sale was to another commercial bank \nwith no gain or loss realized on the sale. The $0.9 million decrease in OREO resulted from the sale of one bank-owned \nproperty that was held in OREO during the first quarter of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, leasehold improvements of a \nformer branch office that was held in OREO was transferred out and returned to premises and equipment and now serves as \nan off-site training facility. FNCB’s ratio of non-performing loans to total gross loans decreased to 0.25% at December 31, \n2022 from 0.39% at December 31, 2021. Similarly, FNCB’s ratio of non-performing assets as a percentage of shareholders’ \nequity decreased to 3.9% at December 31, 2022 from 4.0% at December 31, 2021.  \n  \nOther non-performing assets was comprised solely of a classified account receivable, the balance of which was $1.8 million \nat both December 31, 2022 and 2021. The receivable is secured by an evergreen letter of credit that was received in 2011 as \npart of a settlement agreement for a large construction, land acquisition and development loan for a residential development \nproject in the Pocono region of Monroe County, Pennsylvania. The agreement provides for payment to FNCB as real estate \nbuilding lots are sold. The project was stalled due to a decline in real estate values in this area following the financial crisis"

The ALLL is analyzed \nin accordance with GAAP and is maintained at a level that is based on management’s evaluation of the adequacy of the ALLL \nin relation to the risks inherent in the loan portfolio.  \n  \nAs part of its evaluation, management considers qualitative and environmental factors, including, but not limited to: \n  \n  \n● \nchanges in national, local, and business economic conditions and developments, including the condition of various \nmarket segments; \n  \n● \nchanges in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio; \n  \n● \nchanges in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards, collection, charge-off and recovery \npractices and results; \n  \n● \nchanges in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff; \n  \n● \nchanges in the quality of the loan review system and the degree of oversight by the Board of Directors; \n  \n● \nchanges in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans, including trends in the volume of \nnon-accrual loans, TDRs and other loan modifications; \n  \n● \nthe existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations; \n  \n● \nthe effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated \ncredit losses in the current loan portfolio; and \n  \n● \nanalysis of customers’ credit quality, including knowledge of their operating environment and financial condition.  \n  \nEvaluations are intrinsically subjective, as the results are estimated based on management knowledge and experience and are \nsubject to interpretation and modification as information becomes available or as future events occur. Management monitors \nthe loan portfolio on an ongoing basis with emphasis on weakness in both the real estate market and the economy in general \nand its effect on repayment. Adjustments to the ALLL are made based on management’s assessment of the factors noted \nabove. \n  \nFor purposes of management’s analysis of the ALLL, all loan relationships with an aggregate balance greater than $100 \nthousand that are rated substandard and non-accrual, identified as doubtful or loss, and all TDRs are considered impaired and \nare analyzed individually to determine the amount of impairment. Circumstances such as construction delays, declining real \nestate values, and the inability of the borrowers to make scheduled payments have resulted in these loan relationships being \nclassified as impaired. FNCB utilizes the fair value of collateral method for collateral-dependent loans and TDRs for which \nrepayment depends on the sale of collateral. For non-collateral-dependent loans and TDRs, FNCB measures impairment \nbased on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. With regard \nto collateral-dependent loans, appraisals are received at least annually to ensure that impairment measurements reflect current \nmarket conditions. Should a current appraisal not be available at the time of impairment analysis, other valuation sources \nincluding current letters of intent, broker price opinions or executed agreements of sale may be used. Only downward \nadjustments are made based on these supporting values. Included in all impairment calculations is a cost to sell adjustment \nof approximately 10%, which is based on typical cost factors, including a 6% broker commission, 1% transfer taxes and 3% \nvarious other miscellaneous costs associated with the sales process. Sales costs are periodically reviewed and revised based"

The ALLL analysis is adjusted for subsequent events that may arise after the end of the reporting period \nbut before the financial reports are filed. \n  \nThe ALLL equaled $14.2 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of $1.8 million, or 14.3%, from $12.4 million at \nDecember 31, 2021. The increase resulted from a provision for loan and lease losses of $2.0 million offset by net charge-\noffs of $185 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in credit provisioning in 2022 was largely due to \nthe increase in loan volumes as FNCB's assets quality metrics were favorable throughout the year. \n \nThe ALLL consists of both specific and general components. The component of the ALLL that is related to impaired loans \nthat are individually evaluated for impairment, the guidance for which is provided by ASC 310 “Impairment of a \nLoan” (“ASC 310”), was $34 thousand, or 0.2%, of the total ALLL at December 31, 2022, compared to $26 thousand, or \n0.2%, of the total ALLL at December 31, 2021. A general reserve of $14.2 million was established for loans analyzed \ncollectively under ASC 450 “Contingencies” (“ASC 450”), which represented 99.8% of the total ALLL of $14.2 million \nat December 31, 2022. Included in the general component of the ALLL were unallocated reserves of $1.1 million, for both \nyears ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Based on its evaluations, management may establish an unallocated component \nto cover any inherent losses that exist as of the evaluation date, but which may not have been identified under the \nmethodology. In 2020, management established an unallocated reserve for the potential effect of economic uncertainty \nrelated to the pandemic. Management believes the level of the unallocated reserve continues to be appropriate at December \n31, 2022 due to continued economic uncertainty related to global supply-chain issues, the war in Ukraine, current inflation \nlevels, monetary policy tightening, among other factors. At December 31, 2022, management is not aware of any asset \nquality deterioration and FNCB has not experienced an increase in credit losses related to these factors. The ratio of the \nALLL to total loans, net of net deferred loan origination fees and unearned income at December 31, 2022 and December 31, \n2021 was 1.26% and 1.27%, respectively.  \n  \nSee Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \nItem 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about \nFNCB's adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): \n\"Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\" \n  \nThe following table presents an allocation of the ALLL by major loan category and percent of loans in each category to total \nloans at December 31, for each of the last five years: \n  \nAllocation of the ALLL \n  \n  \n  \nDecember 31, \n  \n  \n  \n2022 \n    \n2021 \n    \n2020 \n    \n2019 \n    \n2018 \n  \n(dollars in \nthousands)   Allowance     \nPercentage \nof Loans \nin Each \nCategory \nto Total \nLoans \n    Allowance     \nPercentage \nof Loans \nin Each \nCategory \nto Total \nLoans \n    Allowance     \nPercentage \nof Loans \nin Each \nCategory \nto Total \nLoans \n    Allowance     \nPercentage \nof Loans \nin Each \nCategory \nto Total \nLoans \n    Allowance     \nPercentage \nof Loans in \nEach \nCategory to \nTotal Loans   \nResidential \nreal estate .....   $ \n2,215       \n22.28 %   $ \n2,081       \n23.86 %   $ \n1,715       \n21.73 %   $ \n1,147       \n22.73 %   $ \n1,175       \n22.09 % \nCommercial \nreal estate .....     \n4,193       \n33.56       \n4,530       \n37.29       \n4,268       \n30.32       \n3,198       \n33.69       \n3,107       \n31.46   \nConstruction, \nland \nacquisition \nand \ndevelopment      \n747       \n5.92       \n392       \n4.24       \n538       \n6.62       \n271       \n5.75       \n188       \n2.49   \nCommercial \nand \nindustrial ......     \n4,099       \n24.22       \n2,670       \n19.67       \n2,619       \n26.39       \n1,997       \n17.86       \n2,552       \n18.08   \nConsumer ....     \n1,307       \n8.25       \n1,159       \n8.72       \n1,319       \n9.51       \n1,658       \n14.66       \n2,051       \n18.81   \nState and \npolitical \nsubdivisions .     \n503       \n5.78       \n455       \n6.22       \n405       \n5.43       \n253       \n5.31       \n417       \n7.07   \nUnallocated..     \n1,129       \n-       \n1,129       \n-       \n1,086       \n-       \n426       \n-       \n29       \n-   \nTotal ........   $ \n14,193       \n100.00 %   $ \n12,416       \n100.00 %   $ \n11,950       \n100.00 %   $ \n8,950       \n100.00 %   $ \n9,519       \n100.00 %"

Rates on interest-bearing demand and savings deposits increased by 23 basis \npoints and 5 basis points, respectively, while time deposit rates decreased by 29 basis points, comparing 2022 and 2021. \nGiven the rising interest rate environments and increasing competition for deposits, management anticipates FNCB's deposit \ncosts will continue to increase in 2023. \n  \nThe average balance of, and the rate paid on, the major classifications of deposits for the past three years are summarized in \nthe following table: \n  \nDeposit Distribution \n  \n  \n  \nFor the Year Ended December 31, \n  \n  \n  \n2022 \n    \n2021 \n    \n2020 \n  \n  \n  Average       \n  \n    Average       \n  \n    Average       \n  \n  \n(dollars in thousands) \n  Balance     \nRate \n    Balance     \nRate \n    Balance     \nRate \n  \nInterest-bearing deposits: \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n  \nDemand ........................................   $ \n815,579      \n0.39%  $\n764,798      \n0.16%  $\n611,511      \n0.48%\nSavings .........................................     \n144,343      \n0.12      \n125,022      \n0.07      \n101,847      \n0.10  \nTime .............................................     \n157,991      \n0.37      \n176,245      \n0.66      \n195,140      \n1.22  \nTotal interest-bearing deposits ..     1,117,913      \n0.36%    1,066,065      \n0.24%    \n908,498      \n0.59%\n  \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n  \nNon-interest-bearing deposits ......     \n314,105      \n       \n315,181      \n       \n242,017      \n   \n  \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n  \nTotal deposits ........................   $ 1,432,018      \n     $ 1,381,246      \n     $ 1,150,515      \n   \n  \nThe following table presents the maturity distribution of time deposits in excess of insurance limit at December 31, 2022 and \n2021: \n  \nMaturity Distribution of Time Deposits $250,000 or More \n  \n  \n  \nDecember 31, \n  \n(in thousands) \n  \n2022 \n    \n2021 \n  \n3 months or less ................................................................................................................  $\n10,009    $\n10,740  \nOver 3 through 6 months ..................................................................................................    \n4,524      \n5,354  \nOver 6 through 12 months ................................................................................................    \n7,362      \n8,431  \nOver 12 months ................................................................................................................    \n3,007      \n2,006  \nTotal ..............................................................................................................................  $\n24,902    $\n26,531"

In \naddition to pledging loans, FNCB is required to purchase FHLB of Pittsburgh stock based upon the amount of credit extended. \nLoans that were pledged to collateralize borrowings under this agreement were $482.1 million at December 31, 2022 and \n$478.3 million at December 31, 2021. FNCB’s maximum borrowing capacity was $394.7 million at December 31, 2022. \nThere was $47.5 million in letters of credit to secure municipal deposits outstanding at December 31, 2022 under this \nagreement. There were $139.4 million in overnight advances and $32.7 million in term advances, that were hedged under \ninterest-rate swaps through the FHLB of Pittsburgh outstanding at December 31, 2022.  \n  \nAdvances through the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window generally include short-term advances which are fully \ncollateralized by certain pledged loans of $25.8 million under the Federal Reserve Bank’s Borrower-in-Custody (“BIC”) \nprogram. There were no advances under the BIC program outstanding at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. FNCB \nhad available borrowing capacity of $19.0 million under this program at December 31, 2022. \n  \nFNCB also had $10.3 million of junior subordinated debentures outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The interest \nrate on these debentures resets quarterly at a spread of 1.67% above the current 3-month LIBOR rate. Upon the expected \nphase-out of LIBOR on June 30, 2023, the interest rate on the debentures will reset quarterly at a spread of 1.67% above 3-\nmonth CME Term SOFR plus 0.26161%. CME Term SOFR are administered by CME Group Benchmark Administration \nLimited (CBA) which is registered under Benchmarks (Amendment and Transitional Provision) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 \n(SI 2019/657) is authorized and supervised by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and is aligned to the IOSCO \nPrinciples for Financial Benchmarks. The average interest rate paid on the junior subordinated debentures in 2022 was 3.47%, \ncompared to 1.85% in 2021.  \n  \nAverage borrowed funds increased $97.3 million to $109.5 million in 2022 from $12.2 million in 2021. The average rate paid \non borrowed funds increased 91 basis points to 2.52% in 2022 from 1.61% in 2021. The increase in rate on borrowed funds \nreflected higher average volumes of overnight and short-term borrowings through the FHLB of Pittsburgh in 2022 as \ncompared to 2021, as short-term borrowing rates were at historical lows. Average borrowed funds in 2022 was comprised \nmainly of overnight advances through the FHLB of Pittsburgh.  \n  \nSee Note 8, “Borrowed Funds” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements \nand Supplementary Data\" to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about FNCB's borrowed funds. \n  \nLiquidity \n  \nThe term liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient amounts of cash to meet cash flow needs.  Liquidity is required \nto fulfill the borrowing needs of FNCB’s credit customers and the withdrawal and maturity requirements of its deposit \ncustomers, as well as to meet other financial commitments. FNCB’s liquidity position is impacted by several factors, which \ninclude, among others, loan and lease origination volumes, loan, lease and investment maturity structure and cash flows, \ndeposit demand and time deposit maturity structure and retention. FNCB has liquidity and contingent funding policies in \nplace that are designed with controls in place to provide advanced detection of potentially significant funding shortfalls, \nestablish methods for assessing and monitoring risk levels, and institute prompt responses that may alleviate a potential \nliquidity crisis. Management monitors fluctuations in FNCB’s liquidity position daily and forecasts future liquidity needs. \nAdditionally, management performs periodic stress tests on FNCB's liquidity position that attempt to model in varying \ndegrees of stress in order to proactively develop strategies to ensure adequate liquidity at all times. Additionally, management \nregularly monitors FNCB's wholesale funding sources taking into consideration the cost of funds, diversification between \nfunding sources and asset/liability management strategies. FNCB utilizes brokered deposits, including one-way purchases \nthrough the IntraFiSM Network, deposits acquired through a national listing service, as well as overnight and term advances \nthrough the FHLB of Pittsburgh as wholesale sources of funds to supplement its deposit gathering initiatives.  \n  \nThe statements of cash flows present the change in cash and cash equivalents from operating, investing and financing \nactivities. Cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits in other banks, which comprise cash and cash \nequivalents, are FNCB’s most liquid assets. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $41.9 million at December 31, 2022, a decrease \nof $57.1 million, or 57.7%, from $99.0 million at December 31, 2021, as net cash outflows for investing activities more than \noffset net cash inflows from operating and financing activities."

      "text": "51 \nNet cash outflows from investing activities used $184.6 million of cash and cash equivalents during the year ended December \n31, 2022. Accounting for the majority of the net cash outflow was a net increase in loans and leases of $144.5 million, which \nreflected increased demand, ALCO initiatives to hold in portfolio saleable 1-4 family residential mortgages, and the purchase \nof individual loans and loan pools from third-party originators. Additionally, cash outflows for purchases of available-for-\nsale debt securities, net of inflows for sales, maturities, calls and repayments, were $26.2 million in 2022. Also contributing \nto the net cash outflow for investing activities were purchases of $6.6 million in restricted stock, $3.2 million in equity \nsecurities, $3.0 million in new BOLI policies and $2.2 million for the initial investment in a LIHTC program. \n \nFinancing activities provided $107.5 million in net cash, which resulted primarily from the proceeds from overnight and net \nterm advances through the FHLB of Pittsburgh, of $139.4 million and $12.7 million, respectively. These inflows were \nslightly offset by the $34.4 million decrease in deposits, net cash used to pay dividends to shareholder dividends of $6.5 \nmillion and to repurchase shares of common stock totaling $3.6 million. Operating activities include net income, adjusted for \nthe effects of non-cash transactions including, among others, depreciation and amortization and the provision for loan and \nlease losses, and is the primary source of cash flows from operations. In 2022, operating activities provided FNCB with $20.0 \nmillion in net cash, which reflected net income of $20.4 million, net of a reduction for non-cash negative adjustments of $475 \nthousand.  \n   \nManagement is actively monitoring FNCB's liquidity position and capital adequacy in light of the changing circumstances \nrelated to economic uncertainty, liquidity constraints, current inflation levels, rising interest rates and increased competition. \nManagement believes that FNCB’s current liquidity position is sufficient to meet its cash flow needs as of December 31, \n2022. In addition to cash and cash equivalents of $41.9 million at December 31, 2022, FNCB had ample sources of additional \nliquidity including approximately $394.5 million in available borrowing capacity with the FHLB of Pittsburgh, and available \nborrowing capacity through The Federal Reserve Discount Window of $19.0 million under the BIC program. In addition, \nFNCB had $75.0 million in federal fund lines of credit available through correspondent banks at December 31, 2022, as well \nas access to wholesale deposit markets. While management believes FNCB has adequate liquidity to meet its cash flow needs, \nthey are keenly aware that changes in general economic conditions, including inflation, further increases in interest rates and \ncompetition, among other factors, could pose potential stress on liquidity should deposits begin exiting the Bank and/or \nFNCB's asset quality deteriorates. Additionally, FNCB could experience an increase in the utilization of existing lines of \ncredit as customers manage their own liquidity needs during this time of economic uncertainty. Management continually \nmonitors FNCB's liquidity positions and sources of available liquidity in relation to funding and cash flow need and evaluates \npotential sources of additional liquidity.  Management is currently evaluating FNCB's ability to pledge equipment loans \noriginated under 1st Equipment Finance and increase borrowing capacity through the Federal Reserve Discount Window \nunder the BIC program."

The Bank’s risk-based capital ratios exceeded the minimum regulatory capital ratios required for \nadequately capitalized institutions. Based on the most recent notification from its primary regulators, the Bank was \ncategorized as well capitalized at December 31, 2022 and 2021. There are no conditions or events since this notification \nthat management believes have changed this category. \n  \nAs of December 31, 2022, FNCB had 30,132,391 shares of common stock available for future sale or share dividends. \nQuarterly market highs and lows, dividends paid and known market makers are highlighted in Part I, Item 5, “Market for \nRegistrant’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” of this Annual Report \non Form 10-K. For further discussion of FNCB’s capital requirements and dividend limitations, refer to Note 15, “Regulatory \nMatters,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary \nData” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  \n  \nAdditionally, FNCB has available 20,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock. There were no preferred shares issued \nand outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n  \nOn January 25, 2023, FNCB's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 750,000 shares of FNCB's outstanding \ncommon stock may be acquired in the open market commencing no earlier than March 3, 2023 and expiring on December \n31, 2023 pursuant to a trading plan that was adopted in accordance with rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. Repurchases under \nthis program are administered through an independent broker and are subjected to SEC regulations as well as certain price, \nmarket volume and timing constraints specified in the trading plan. In 2022 and 2021, the Board of Directors had authorized \na similar program under which 384,830 and 330,759 common shares were repurchased, respectively. \n  \nFNCB’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is largely dependent on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends to FNCB. \nBank regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the Bank’s regulatory agency. \nCash dividends declared and paid by FNCB during 2022 and 2021 were $0.33 per share and $0.27per share, respectively. \nFNCB offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase plan (\"DRP\") to its shareholders. For the years ended December \n31, 2022 and 2021 dividend reinvestment shares were purchased in open market transactions, while shares under the optional \ncash purchase feature of the DRP were issued from authorized but unissued common shares. Shares of common stock issued \nunder the DRP totaled 5,089 and 12,189 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Subsequent to \nDecember 31, 2022, on January 25, 2023, FNCB declared a $0.090 per share dividend payable on March 15, 2023 to \nshareholders of record on March 1, 2023. \n  \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n  \nIn the ordinary course of operations, FNCB engages in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with GAAP, are \nnot recorded in our consolidated financial statements or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts. These \ntransactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions may be used for \ngeneral corporate purposes or for customer needs. Corporate purpose transactions would be used to help manage credit, \ninterest rate and liquidity risk or to optimize capital. Customer transactions are used to manage customers' requests for \nfunding. \n  \nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, FNCB did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions that would have or would \nbe reasonably likely to have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition. For a further discussion of FNCB’s off-\nbalance sheet arrangements, refer to Note 13, “Commitments, Contingencies, and Concentrations” to the Notes to \nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report \non Form 10-K."

Changes in the relative value of money due to inflation \nor recession are generally not considered. The primary effect of inflation on FNCB's operations is primarily related to \nincreases in operating expenses. Management considers changes in interest rates to impact our financial condition and results \nof operations to a far greater degree than changes in prices due to inflation. Although interest rates are greatly influenced by \nchanges in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. \nFNCB manages interest rate risk in several ways. Refer to “Interest Rate Risk” in Item 7A for further discussion. There can \nbe no assurance that FNCB will not be materially adversely affected by future changes in interest rates, as interest rates are \nhighly sensitive to many factors that are beyond its control. Additionally, inflation may adversely impact the financial \ncondition of FNCB's borrowers and could impact their ability to repay their loans, which could negatively affect FNCB's \nasset quality through higher delinquency rates and increased charge-offs. Management will carefully consider the impact of \ninflation and rising interest rates on FNCB borrowers in managing credit risk related to the loan and lease portfolio.   \n   \nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. \n  \nInterest Rate Risk \n  \nInterest Rate Sensitivity \n  \nMarket risk is the risk to earnings and/or financial position resulting from adverse changes in market rates or prices, such as \ninterest rates, foreign exchange rates or equity prices. FNCB’s exposure to market risk is primarily interest rate risk associated \nwith our lending, investing and deposit gathering activities, all of which are other than trading. Changes in interest rates affect \nearnings by changing net interest income and the level of other interest-sensitive income and operating expenses. In addition, \nvariations in interest rates affect the underlying economic value of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items.  \n  \nLIBOR Replacement \n  \nThe Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\") had proposed that the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\"SOFR\") \nreplace USD-LIBOR, with the transition to SOFR from USD-LIBOR to take place by the end of 2021. FNCB has various \nloans, investments, borrowings and interest rate swap contracts that are indexed to USD-LIBOR. On November 30, 2020, \nthe ICE Benchmark Administration (\"IBA\"), which complies and oversees LIBOR, announced its intention to extend most \nof the USD-LIBOR tenors to June 30, 2023, with U.S. banking regulators supporting the extension. As of December 31, \n2021, most LIBOR tenors, with the exception of the overnight, 1-,3-, 6- and 12-month LIBOR tenors which have been \nextended through June 30, 2023, ceased to be published. Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, no new financial instruments \ncould be written with terms tied to LIBOR. Accordingly, FNCB has not written any loans with terms tied to LIBOR during \nthe year ended December 31, 2022. FNCB has various loans, investments, borrowings and interest rate swap contracts that \nare indexed to USD-LIBOR, and management is actively monitoring its LIBOR exposures, evaluating any risks involved \nand has amended loan documents as necessary."

In addition, ALCO has established policy tolerance limits for acceptable negative changes in net interest \nincome. Furthermore, as part of its ongoing monitoring, ALCO requires quarterly back testing of modeling results, which \ninvolves after-the-fact comparisons of projections with FNCB’s actual performance to measure the validity of assumptions \nused in the modeling techniques.  \n  \nEarnings at Risk and Economic Value at Risk Simulations: \n  \nEarnings at Risk \n  \nEarnings-at-risk simulation measures the change in net interest income and net income under various interest rate \nscenarios. Specifically, given the current market rates, ALCO looks at “earnings at risk” to determine anticipated changes in \nnet interest income from a base case scenario with scenarios of + 200, +400 and -100 basis points for simulation purposes. \nThe simulation takes into consideration that not all assets and liabilities re-price equally and simultaneously with market rates \n(i.e., savings rate).  \n  \nEconomic Value at Risk \n  \nWhile earnings-at-risk simulation measures the short-term risk in the balance sheet, economic value (or portfolio equity) at \nrisk measures the long-term risk by finding the net present value of the future cash flows from FNCB’s existing assets and \nliabilities. ALCO examines this ratio regularly, and given the current rate environment, has utilized rate shocks of +200, +400 \nand -100 basis points for simulation purposes. Management recognizes that, in some instances, this ratio may contradict the \n“earnings at risk” ratio. \n  \nWhile ALCO regularly performs a wide variety of simulations under various strategic balance sheet and treasury yield curve \nscenarios, the following results reflect FNCB’s sensitivity over the subsequent twelve months based on the following \nassumptions: \n  \n  \n● \nasset and liability levels as of December 31, 2022 as a starting point; \n  \n● \ncash flows are based on contractual maturity and amortization schedules with applicable prepayments derived from\ninternal historical data and external sources; and \n  \n● \ncash flows are reinvested into similar instruments to keep interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability levels \nconstant."

At December 31, 2022, the model indicated that FNCB’s net interest income is expected to decrease 14.2% \nunder a +200-basis point interest rate shock, as compared to the base case, caused by spread compression due to increased \nwholesale funding and deposit migration into higher-yielding alternatives and certificate of deposit specials. Under this \nscenario, projected net interest income is expected to improve in years 3 through 5 of the 5-year simulation driven by asset \ncashflows replaced into higher assumed replacement rates outpacing the increase in funding costs from certificate of deposit \nmaturities rolling into higher-costing specials. The percentage change in net interest income in under the +200 and +400-\nbasis point shock scenarios exceed policy guidelines at December 31, 2022. As part of its ALCO initiatives, management is \ncurrently evaluating various strategies to reduce FNCB's liability sensitivity and will execute such strategies as appropriate. \nModel results also indicate a 4.0% increase to net interest income from the base case over the next 12 months under a rate \nshock of -100 basis points, as asset yields less of a decline as compared to overnight funding costs. Additionally, with respect \nto FNCB's EVE, all modeled exposures are within policy guidelines.  \n  \nThis analysis does not represent a forecast for FNCB and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating \nresults. These simulations are based on numerous assumptions, including but not limited to, the nature and timing of interest \nrate levels, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, \nreinvestment/replacements of asset and liability cash flows, and other factors. While assumptions reflect current economic \nand local market conditions, FNCB cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions, including \nchanges in interest rates, customer preferences, competition and liquidity needs, or what actions ALCO might take in \nresponding to these changes.  \n  \nAs previously mentioned, as part of its ongoing monitoring, ALCO requires quarterly back testing of modeling results, which \ninvolves after-the-fact comparisons of projections with FNCB’s actual performance to measure the validity of assumptions \nused in the modeling techniques. As part of its quarterly review, management compared tax-equivalent net interest income \nrecorded for the three months ended December 31, 2022 with tax-equivalent net interest income that was projected for \nthe period. There was a positive variance between actual and projected tax-equivalent net interest income for the three \nmonths ended December 31, 2022 of approximately $0.8 million, or 5.96%. The variance primarily reflected a difference in \nthe assumption for the pricing of wholesale borrowing due to additional rate increases.  ALCO performs a detailed \nrate/volume analysis between actual and projected results to continue to improve the accuracy of its simulation models."

In our opinion, the \nconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as \nof December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in \nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n  \nBasis for Opinion \n  \nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our \nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. \nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \nStates) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. \nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and \nthe PCAOB. \n  \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan \nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are \nfree of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we \nengaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required \nto obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an \nopinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express \nno such opinion. \n  \nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated \nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such \nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the \nconsolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and \nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated \nfinancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n  \nCritical Audit Matter \n  \nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the \nconsolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit \ncommittee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial \nstatements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication \nof the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken \nas a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the \ncritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates."

      "text": "58 \nAllowance for Loan Losses – Qualitative Factor Adjustments \n  \nCritical Audit Matter Description \n  \nAs described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loan losses is \nestablished through a provision for loan losses and represents an amount, which, in management’s judgment \nwill be adequate to absorb losses in the loan portfolio.  \n  \nIn calculating the general reserve component, management considered historical loss experience by segment \nand qualitative factor adjustments for changes not reflected in the historical loss experience. The general \nreserve component of the Company’s allowance for loan losses involved consideration of national and local \neconomic conditions, levels of and trends in classified loans, delinquency rates and non-accrual loans, trends in \nvolumes and terms of loans, changes in lending policies, lending personnel, and collateral, as well as \nconcentrations in loan types, industry, and geography. The adjustments for qualitative factors require a \nsignificant amount of judgment by management and involve a high degree of estimation uncertainty.  \n  \nWe identified the qualitative factor component of the allowance for loan losses as a critical audit matter as \nauditing the underlying qualitative factors required significant auditor judgment as amounts determined by \nmanagement rely on analysis that is highly subjective and includes significant estimation uncertainty. \n  \nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: \n  \n  \n● \nObtaining an understanding of the relevant controls related to the allowance for loan losses and \ntested such controls for design and operating effectiveness, including controls related to \nmanagement's establishment, review, and approval of the qualitative factors, and the \ncompleteness and accuracy of data used in determining qualitative factors.  \n  \n● \nEvaluation of the appropriateness of management's methodology for estimating the allowance for \nloan losses. \n  \n● \nTesting of the completeness and accuracy of data used by management in determining qualitative \nfactor adjustments by agreeing them to internal and external source data. \n  \n● \nTesting of management's conclusions regarding the appropriateness of the qualitative factor \nadjustments and agreement of any changes therein to the allowance for loan losses calculation.  \n  \n  \n \n  \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014. \n  \nBaker Tilly US, LLP  \nIselin, New Jersey \nMarch 10, 2023"

      "text": "64 \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n \nNote 1. ORGANIZATION \n  \nFNCB Bancorp, Inc. is a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, incorporated \nunder the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1997. It is the parent company of FNCB Bank (the “Bank”) and the \nBank’s wholly owned subsidiaries FNCB Realty Company, Inc., FNCB Realty Company I, LLC, and FNCB Realty Company \nII, LLC. Unless the context otherwise requires, the term “FNCB” is used to refer to FNCB Bancorp, Inc., and its subsidiaries. \nIn certain circumstances, however, the term “FNCB” refers to FNCB Bancorp, Inc., itself. \n  \nThe Bank provides customary retail and commercial banking services to individuals, businesses and local governments and \nmunicipalities through its 16 full-service branch locations, as of December 31, 2022, within its primary market area, \nNortheastern Pennsylvania. \n  \nFNCB Realty Company, Inc., FNCB Realty Company I, LLC, and FNCB Realty Company II, LLC, which were formed to \nhold real estate and/or operate businesses acquired in exchange for debt settlement or foreclosure, were inactive at December \n31, 2022 and 2021. \n  \nIn December 2006, First National Community Statutory Trust I (“Issuing Trust”), which is wholly owned by FNCB, was \nformed under Delaware law to provide FNCB with an additional funding source through the issuance of pooled trust preferred \nsecurities. FNCB has adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810-10, Consolidation, for the Issuing Trust. \nAccordingly, the Issuing Trust has not been consolidated with the accounts of FNCB, because FNCB is not the primary \nbeneficiary of the trust. \n  \n  \nNote 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n  \nBasis of Presentation \n  \nThe consolidated financial statements of FNCB are comprised of the accounts of FNCB Bancorp, Inc., and its wholly-owned \nsubsidiary, FNCB Bank, as well as the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have \nbeen eliminated in consolidation. The accounting and reporting policies of FNCB conform to accounting principles generally \naccepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), Regulation S-X and general practices within the banking industry. Prior \nperiod amounts have been reclassified when necessary to conform to the current year’s presentation. Such reclassifications \ndid not have a material impact on the operating results or financial position of FNCB. \n  \nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions \nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the \nconsolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual \nresults could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to change in the \nnear term are the allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”), the valuation and impairment evaluation of FNCB's \ninvestments, and income taxes. \n  \nCash Equivalents \n  \nFor purposes of reporting cash flows, cash equivalents include cash on hand and amounts due from banks. FNCB maintains \ncompensating balances at correspondent banks, most of which are not required, but are used to offset specific charges for \nservices. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of these balances were $2.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively. \n  \nSecurities \n  \nDebt Securities and Equity Securities with Readily Determinable Fair Values \n  \nFNCB classifies its investments in debt securities as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase. Debt \nsecurities that are classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses recognized \nas a component of shareholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax. Debt securities that \nare classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold \nthem to maturity. Premiums on callable debt securities are amortized to the earliest call date. Amortization of premiums and"

Realized gains and losses on sales of debt securities are based on amortized cost using the \nspecific identification method on the trade date. All of FNCB's debt securities were classified as available-for-sale at \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. \n  \nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values are reported at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses \nrecognized non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. \n  \nFair values for debt securities and equity securities with readily determinable fair values are based upon quoted market prices, \nwhere available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based upon quoted market prices of comparable \ninstruments, or a discounted cash flow model using market estimates of interest rates and volatility. \n  \nRestricted Stock \n  \nInvestments in restricted securities have limited marketability, are carried at cost and are evaluated for impairment based on \nFNCB’s determination of the ultimate recoverability of the par value of the stock. FNCB’s investment in restricted securities \nis comprised of stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") of Pittsburgh and Atlantic Community Bankers Bank \n(\"ACBB\").  \n   \nEquity Securities without Readily Determinable Fair Values \n  \nEquity securities without readily determinable fair values generally consist of common and/or preferred stock of privately \nheld financial institutions, which are carried at cost and included in other assets in the consolidated statements of financial \ncondition. On a quarterly basis, management performs a qualitative assessment to determine if the securities are impaired. If \nthe qualitative assessment indicates impairment, the security is written down to its fair value, with the charge for impairment \nincluded in net income. \n  \nEvaluation for Other Than Temporary Impairment \n  \nOn a quarterly basis, management evaluates all securities in an unrealized loss position for other than temporary impairment \n(“OTTI”). An individual security is considered impaired when its current fair value is less than its amortized cost basis. As \npart of its evaluation, management considers the following factors, among other things, in determining whether the security’s \nimpairment is other than temporary: \n  \n  \n● \nthe length of time and extent of the impairment; \n  \n● \nthe causes of the decline in fair value, such as credit deterioration, interest rate fluctuations, or market volatility; \n  \n● \nadverse industry or geographic conditions; \n  \n● \nhistorical implied volatility; \n  \n● \npayment structure of the security and whether FNCB expects to receive all contractual cash flows; \n  \n● \nfailure of the issuer to make contractual interest or principal payments in the past; and \n  \n● \nchanges in the security’s rating. \n  \nBased on current authoritative guidance, when a held-to-maturity or available-for-sale security is assessed for OTTI, \nmanagement must first consider (a) whether it intends to sell the security and (b) whether it is more likely than not the FNCB \nwill be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost. If one of these circumstances applies to a security, \nan OTTI loss is recognized in the statement of income equal to the full amount of the decline in fair value below amortized \ncost. If neither of these circumstances applies to a security, but FNCB does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost, \nan OTTI loss has occurred that must be separated into two categories: (a) the amount related to credit loss and (b) the amount \nrelated to other factors (such as market risk). In assessing the level of OTTI attributable to credit loss, management compares \nthe present value of cash flows expected to be collected with the amortized cost of the security. The portion of the total OTTI \nrelated to credit loss is identified as the amount of principal cash flows not expected to be received over the remaining term \nof the security as estimated based on cash flow projections discounted at the applicable original yield of the security, and is \nrecognized in earnings, while the amount related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. The total \nOTTI loss is presented in the statement of income less the portion recognized in other comprehensive income. When a debt \nsecurity becomes other-than-temporarily impaired, its amortized cost basis is reduced to reflect the portion of the total \nimpairment related to credit loss. The assessment of whether an OTTI decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity \nand judgment that is based on information available to management at a point in time."

      "text": "66 \nLoans and Leases \n  \nLoans and leases that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are \nstated at their outstanding unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized deferred loan fees and costs, any unearned income \nand partial charge-offs. Loans and leases receivable are presented net of the allowance for loan and lease losses in the \nconsolidated statements of financial condition. Interest income on all loans is recognized using the effective interest method. \nNonrefundable loan origination fees, as well as certain direct loan origination costs, are deferred and the net amount amortized \nover the contractual life of the related loan as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method. Amortization of \ndeferred loan fees or costs is discontinued when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. \n  \nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when a loan is specifically determined to be impaired or when management believes \nthat the collection of interest or principal is doubtful. This generally occurs when a default of interest or principal has existed \nfor 90 days or more, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection, or when management becomes aware of \nfacts or circumstances that the loan would default before 90 days. FNCB determines delinquency status based on the number \nof days since the date of the borrower’s last required contractual loan payment. When the interest accrual is discontinued, all \nunpaid interest income is reversed and charged back against current earnings. Any subsequent cash payments received are \napplied, first to the outstanding principal balance, then to the recovery of any previously charged-off principal, with any \nexcess treated as a recovery of lost interest. A non-accrual loan is returned to accrual status when the loan is current as to \nprincipal and interest payments, is performing according to contractual terms for six consecutive months and factors \nindicating reasonable doubt about the timely collection of payments no longer exist. \n  \nIn accordance with federal regulations, prior to making, extending, renewing or advancing additional funds in excess of $500 \nthousand on a loan secured by real estate, FNCB requires an appraisal of the property by an independent, state-certified or \nstate-licensed appraiser (depending upon collateral type and loan amount) that is approved by the Board of Directors. \nAppraisals are reviewed internally or by an independent third party engaged by FNCB. Generally, management obtains a \nnew appraisal when a loan is deemed impaired. These appraisals may be more limited in scope than those obtained at the \ninitial underwriting of the loan. \n   \nTroubled Debt Restructurings \n  \nFNCB considers a loan to be a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) when it grants a concession to the borrower for legal or \neconomic reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties that it would not otherwise consider. Such concessions \ngranted generally involve a reduction of the stated interest rate, an extension of a loan’s stated maturity date, a payment \nmodification under a forbearance agreement, a permanent reduction of the recorded investment in the loan, capitalization of \nreal estate taxes, or a combination of these modifications. Non-accrual TDRs are returned to accrual status if principal and \ninterest payments, under the modified terms, are brought current, are performing under the modified terms for six consecutive \nmonths, and management believes that collection of the remaining interest and principal is probable. \n  \nLoan Impairment \n  \nA loan is considered impaired when it is probable that FNCB will be unable to collect all amounts due (including principal \nand interest) according to the contractual terms of the note and loan agreement. For purposes of the analysis, all TDRs, loan \nrelationships with an aggregate outstanding balance greater than $100 thousand rated substandard and non-accrual, and loans \nthat are identified as doubtful or loss are considered impaired. Impaired loans are analyzed individually to determine the \namount of impairment. For collateral-dependent loans, impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral \nsupporting the loans. A loan is determined to be collateral dependent when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided \nthrough the operation or liquidation of the collateral held. For impaired loans that are secured by real estate, external appraisals \nare generally obtained annually, or more frequently as warranted, to ascertain a fair value so that the impairment analysis can \nbe updated. Should a current appraisal not be available at the time of impairment analysis, other sources of valuation may be \nused including current letters of intent, broker price opinions or executed agreements of sale. For non-collateral \ndependent loans, impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows, net of any deferred fees \nand costs, discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. \n  \nGenerally, all loans with balances of $100 thousand or less are considered within homogeneous pools and are not individually \nevaluated for impairment. However, individual loans with balances of $100 thousand or less are individually evaluated for \nimpairment if that loan is part of a larger impaired loan relationship or the loan is a TDR."

      "text": "67 \nImpaired loans, or portions thereof, are charged-off upon determination that all or a portion of the loan balance is uncollectible \nand exceeds the fair value of the collateral. A loan is considered uncollectible when the borrower is delinquent with respect \nto principal or interest repayment and it is unlikely that the borrower will have the ability to pay the debt in a timely manner, \ncollateral value is insufficient to cover the outstanding indebtedness and the guarantors (if applicable) do not provide adequate \nsupport for the loan. \n  \nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses \n  \nManagement evaluates the credit quality of FNCB’s loan portfolio on an ongoing basis and performs a formal review of the \nadequacy of the ALLL on a quarterly basis. The ALLL is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings \nand is maintained at a level that management considers adequate to absorb estimated probable losses inherent in the loan \nportfolio as of the evaluation date. Loans, or portions of loans, determined by management to be uncollectible are charged \noff against the ALLL, while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the ALLL. \n  \nDetermining the amount of the ALLL is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment \nand the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses \non pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, qualitative factors, and consideration of current economic \ntrends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. Banking regulators, as an integral part of their \nexamination of FNCB, also review the ALLL, and may require, based on their judgments about information available to them \nat the time of their examination, that certain loan balances be charged off or require that adjustments be made to the ALLL. \nAdditionally, the ALLL is determined, in part, by the composition and size of the loan portfolio. \n   \nFNCB's allowance methodology consists primarily of two components, a specific component and a general component. The \nspecific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For such loans, an allowance is established when the \ndiscounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of \nthat loan. The general component covers all other loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted by qualitative \nfactors. The general reserve component of the ALLL is based on pools of unimpaired loans segregated by loan segment and \nrisk rating categories of “Pass”, “Special Mention” or “Substandard and Accruing.” Historical loss factors and various \nqualitative factors are applied based on the risk profile in each risk rating category to determine the appropriate reserve related \nto those loans. Substandard loans on non-accrual status above the $100 thousand loan relationship threshold and all loans \nconsidered TDRs are classified as impaired. Based on its evaluation, management may establish an unallocated component \nthat is used to cover any inherent losses that exist as of the evaluation date, but which may not have been identified under the \nmethodology. \n  \nWhen establishing the ALLL, management categorizes loans into the following loan segments that are based generally on \nthe nature of the collateral and basis of repayment. The risk characteristics of FNCB’s loan segments are as follows: \n  \nConstruction, Land Acquisition and Development - These loans consist of loans secured by real estate, with the purpose of \nconstructing one- to four-family homes, residential developments and various commercial properties including shopping \ncenters, hotels, office complexes and single-purpose, owner-occupied structures. Additionally, loans in this category include \nloans for land acquisition, secured by raw land. FNCB’s construction program offers either short-term, interest-only loans \nthat require the borrower to pay only interest during the construction phase with a balloon payment of the principal \noutstanding at the end of the construction period or only interest during construction with a conversion to amortizing principal \nand interest when the construction is complete. Loans for undeveloped real estate are subject to a loan-to-value ratio not to \nexceed 65%. Construction loans are treated similarly to the developed real estate loans and are subject to a maximum loan to \nvalue ratio of 85% based upon an “as-completed” appraised value.  Construction loans generally yield a higher interest rate \nthan other mortgage loans but also carry more risk. \n  \nCommercial Real Estate - These loans represent the largest portion of FNCB’s total loan portfolio and loans in this portfolio \ngenerally carry larger loan balances. The commercial real estate mortgage loan portfolio consists of owner-occupied and non-\nowner-occupied properties that are secured by a broad range of real estate, including but not limited to, office complexes, \nshopping centers, hotels, warehouses, gas stations, convenience markets, residential care facilities, nursing care facilities, \nrestaurants and multifamily housing. FNCB offers commercial real estate loans at various rates and terms that do not exceed \n25 years. These types of loans are subject to specific loan-to-value guidelines prior to the time of closing. The policy limits \nfor developed real estate loans are subject to a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 85%. Commercial mortgage loans must also \nmeet specific criteria that include the capacity, capital, credit worthiness and cash flow of the borrower and the project being \nfinanced. Potential borrower(s) and guarantor(s) are required to provide FNCB with historical and current financial data. As \npart of the underwriting process for commercial real estate loans, management performs a review of the cash flow analysis"

The commercial loan portfolio includes revolving lines of credit, automobile floor plans, equipment loans, \nvehicle loans, improvement loans and term loans. These loans generally carry a higher risk than commercial real estate loans \nby the nature of the underlying collateral, which can be machinery and equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, vehicles \nor marketable securities. Generally, a collateral lien is placed on the collateral supporting the loan. To reduce the risk \nassociated with these loans, management may attempt to secure real estate as collateral and obtain personal guarantees of the \nborrower as deemed necessary. \n  \nState and Political Subdivision - FNCB originates general obligation notes, municipal leases and tax anticipation loans to \nstate and political subdivisions, which are primarily municipalities in FNCB’s market area. \n  \nResidential Real Estate - FNCB offers fixed-rate 1 - 4 family residential loans. Residential first lien mortgages are generally \nsubject to an 80% loan to value ratio based on the appraised value of the property. FNCB will generally require the mortgagee \nto purchase Private Mortgage Insurance if the amount of the loan exceeds the 80% loan to value ratio. Residential mortgage \nloans are generally smaller in size and are considered homogeneous as they exhibit similar characteristics. FNCB offers home \nequity loans and home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”) with a maximum combined loan-to-value ratio of 90% based on \nthe appraised value of the property. Home equity loans have fixed rates of interest and carry terms up to 15 years. HELOCs \nhave adjustable interest rates and are based upon the national prime interest rate. Residential mortgage loans, including home \nequity loans, are generally smaller in size and are considered homogeneous as they exhibit similar characteristics. \n  \nConsumer – FNCB offers both secured and unsecured installment loans, personal lines of credit and overdraft protection \nloans. FNCB is in the business of underwriting indirect auto loans which are originated through various auto dealers in \nnortheastern Pennsylvania and dealer floor plan loans. Consumer loans are generally smaller in size and exhibit homogeneous \ncharacteristics. \n  \nOff-Balance-Sheet Credit-Related Financial Instruments \n  \nFNCB is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing \nneed of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, unused portions of lines of credit, \nincluding revolving HELOCs, and letters of credit. FNCB’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the \nother party to the financial instrument is represented by the contractual notional amount of these instruments. FNCB uses the \nsame credit policies in making these commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. In order to provide for probable \nlosses inherent in these instruments, FNCB records a reserve for unfunded commitments, included in other liabilities on the \nconsolidated statements of financial condition, with the offsetting expense recorded in other operating expenses in the \nconsolidated statements of income. \n  \nMortgage Banking Activities, Loan Sales and Servicing \n  \nMortgage loans originated and held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value determined on an individual \nloan basis. Net unrealized losses are recorded as a valuation allowance and charged to earnings. Gains and losses on sales of \nmortgage loans are based on the difference between the selling price and the carrying value of the related loan sold and \ninclude the value assigned to the rights to service the loan. \n  \nFNCB may also elect to sell the guaranteed principal balance of loans that are guaranteed by the Small Business \nAdministration (“SBA”) and retain the servicing on those loans. \n  \nServicing rights are recorded at fair value upon sale of the loan and reported in other assets on the consolidated statements of \nfinancial condition. Servicing rights are amortized in proportion to and over the period during which estimated servicing \nincome will be received. \n  \nFair value is based on market prices for comparable servicing contracts, when available, or alternately, is based on a valuation \nmodel that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The valuation model incorporates \nassumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, such as the cost to service, the \ndiscount rate, the custodial earnings rate, an inflation rate, ancillary income, prepayment speeds and default rates and losses."

      "text": "69 \nServicing rights are evaluated for impairment at each reporting date based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to \namortized cost. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into tranches based on predominant risk characteristics, such \nas interest rate, loan type and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual tranche, \nto the extent that fair value is less than the capitalized amount for the tranche. If management later determines that all or a \nportion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular tranche, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase \nto income. \n  \nOther Real Estate Owned  \n  \nOREO consists of property acquired by foreclosure, abandonment or conveyance of deed in-lieu of foreclosure of a loan, and \nbank premises that are no longer used for operations or for future expansion. OREO is held for sale and is initially recorded \nat fair value less estimated costs to sell at the date of acquisition or transfer, which establishes a new cost basis. Upon \nacquisition of the property through foreclosure or deed in-lieu of foreclosure, any adjustment to fair value less estimated \nselling costs is recorded to the ALLL. The determination is made on an individual asset basis. Bank premises no longer used \nfor operations or future expansion are transferred to OREO at fair value less estimated selling costs with any related write-\ndown included in non-interest expense. Subsequent to acquisition, valuations are periodically performed, and the assets are \ncarried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell. Fair value is determined through external appraisals, \ncurrent letters of intent, broker price opinions or executed agreements of sale, unless management determines that conditions \nexist that warrant an adjustment to the value. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the OREO properties \nmay be capitalized; holding period costs and any subsequent changes to the valuation allowance are charged to expense as \nincurred. \n  \nBank Premises and Equipment \n  \nLand is stated at cost. Bank premises, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. \nCosts for routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, while significant expenditures for improvements are \ncapitalized. Depreciation expense is computed generally using the straight-line method over the following ranges of estimated \nuseful lives, or in the case of leasehold improvements, to the expected terms of the leases, if shorter: \n  \nBuildings and improvements (years) ................................................................................................................... \n5 to 40 \nFurniture, fixtures and equipment (years) ........................................................................................................... \n3 to 20 \nLeasehold improvements (years) ......................................................................................................................... \n3 to 35 \n   \nLong-lived Assets \n  \nIntangible assets and bank premises and equipment are reviewed by management at least annually for potential impairment \nand whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. \n  \nIncome Taxes \n  \nFNCB recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are \nrecognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of \nexisting assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax \nrates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or \nsettled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that \nincludes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, \nit is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. \n  \nFNCB files a consolidated federal income tax return. Under tax sharing agreements, each subsidiary provides for and settles \nincome taxes with FNCB as if it would have filed on a separate return basis. Interest and penalties, if any, as a result of a \ntaxing authority examination are recognized within non-interest expense. FNCB is not currently subject to an audit by any of \nits tax authorities and with limited exception is no longer subject to federal and state income tax examinations by taxing \nauthorities for years before 2019. \n  \nWhen tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing \nauthorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that \nwould be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during \nwhich, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained \nupon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or"

Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the \nlargest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing \nauthority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described \nabove is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with any associated interest and penalties that would be \npayable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Management determined that FNCB had no liabilities for uncertain tax \npositions at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n  \nEarnings per Share \n  \nEarnings per share is calculated on the basis of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. \nBasic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the \nweighted-average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect additional shares that \nwould have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued. Potential common shares that may be \nissued by FNCB relate to shares of unvested restricted stock for which the dilutive effect is calculated using the treasury stock \nmethod. \n  \nStock-Based Compensation \n  \nFNCB recognizes all share-based payments for compensation in the consolidated statements of income based on their fair \nvalues on the grant date. The fair value of shares of unrestricted and restricted stock and awarded under the Long Term \nIncentive Compensation Plan (“LTIP”) is determined using an average of the high and low prices for FNCB’s common stock \nfor the 10 days preceding the grant date. Stock-based compensation expense for unrestricted stock is recognized on the grant \ndate. For restricted stock, stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period, adjusted for \nforfeitures during the period in which they occur.  \n  \nBank-Owned Life Insurance \n  \nBank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) represents the cash surrender value of life insurance policies on certain current and \nformer directors and officers of FNCB. FNCB purchased the insurance as a tax-deferred investment and future source of \nfunding for liabilities, including the payment of employee benefits such as health care. BOLI is carried in the consolidated \nstatements of financial condition at its cash surrender value. Increases in the cash value of the policies, as well as proceeds \nreceived, are recorded in non-interest income. Under some of these policies, the beneficiaries receive a portion of the death \nbenefit. The net present value of the future death benefits scheduled to be paid to the beneficiaries was $101 thousand and \n$99 thousand at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is reflected in other liabilities on the consolidated statements \nof financial condition. \n   \nFair Value Measurement \n  \nFNCB uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial assets and liabilities and to determine \nfair value disclosures. Available-for-sale debt securities and derivative contracts are recorded at fair value on a recurring \nbasis. Additionally, from time to time, FNCB may be required to recognize adjustments to other assets at fair value on a \nnonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans, other securities, and OREO. \n  \nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous \nmarket in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. An orderly transaction is a transaction \nthat assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual \nand customary for transactions involving such assets or liabilities; it is not a forced transaction. \n  \nAccounting standards define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value, establish a three-level hierarchy for \ndisclosure of fair value measurement and provide disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. The valuation \nhierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date."
    },
    {
      "page_index": 78,
      "text": "71 \nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: \n  \n  \n● \nLevel 1 valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted market prices for identical instruments traded in active markets; \n  \n  \n● \nLevel 2 valuation is based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted market \nprices for identical or similar instruments traded in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques \nfor which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by market data; and \n  \n  \n● \nLevel 3 valuation is derived from other valuation methodologies including discounted cash flow models and similar \ntechniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect \nestimates of assumptions that market participants would use in determining fair value. \n  \nRevenue Recognition \n  \nFNCB records revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with ASC 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with \nCustomers.\" FNCB recognizes revenues as they are earned based on contractual terms, as transactions occur, or as services \nare provided and collectability is reasonably assured.  FNCB's primary source of revenue is interest income from the Bank's \nloans, investment securities and other financial instruments, which are not within the scope of ASC 606. FNCB has evaluated \nthe nature of its contracts with customers and determined that further disaggregation of revenue from contracts with \ncustomers into more granular categories beyond what is presented in the consolidated statements of income was not \nnecessary. In general, FNCB fully satisfies its performance obligations on its contracts with customers as services are \nrendered and the transaction prices are typically fixed and charged either on a periodic basis or based on activity. FNCB \nearns non-interest income from various banking services offered by the Bank and other transactions that are within the scope \nof ASC 606 as follows:  \n  \n  \n● \nDeposit service charges - include general service fees for monthly account maintenance, account analysis fees, non-\nsufficient funds fees, wire transfer fees and other deposit account related fees. Revenue is recognized when FNCB’s \nperformance obligation is completed which is generally monthly for account maintenance services or when a \ntransaction has been completed (such as a wire transfer). Payment for service charges on deposit accounts is received \nimmediately or in the following month through a direct charge to customers’ accounts. Also included in deposit \nservice charges is income from ATM surcharges and debit card services income. ATM surcharges are generated \nwhen an FNCB cardholder uses an ATM that is not within the AllPoint ATM network or a non-FNCB cardholder \nuses an FNCB ATM. Card services income is primarily comprised of interchange fees earned whenever a customer \nuses an FNCB debit card as payment for goods and/or services through a card payment network. FNCB’s \nperformance obligation is satisfied on a daily basis as transactions are processed. FNCB recognizes ATM surcharges \nand card services income as transactions with merchants are settled, generally on a daily basis. \n  \n● \nNet gains (losses) on the sale of available-for-sale debt securities - Gains or losses realized from the sale of \navailable-for-sale debt securities are recorded to non-interest income on the settlement date. \n  \n● \nNet gains (losses) on the sale of equity securities - Gains or losses realized from the sale of equity securities are \nrecorded to non-interest income on the settlement date. \n  \n● \nNet gains (losses) on the sale of mortgage loans held for sale - Gains or losses realized on the sale of mortgages \nheld for sale are recorded to non-interest income on the settlement date. \n  \n● \nLoan-related fees - include servicing fees received on loans sold for which FNCB has retained the servicing, net of \namortization for mortgage servicing rights.  \n  \n● \nMerchant services revenue - Merchant services fees represent interchange revenue generated from the processing \nof merchant card payments on behalf of certain business customers. Merchant services fee income is transactional \nin nature and is recognized in income monthly when FNCB’s performance obligation is complete, which is \ngenerally the time that payment is received. \n  \n● \nOther income – primarily includes wealth management fee income, interest rate swap revenue and title insurance \nrevenue. Wealth management fee income represents fees received from a third-party broker-dealer as part of a \nrevenue-sharing agreement for fees earned from customers that we refer to the third party.  Wealth management \nservices fee income is transactional in nature and is recognized in income monthly when FNCB’s performance \nobligation is complete, which is generally the time that payment is received. Interest rate swap revenue represents \nnet fees FNCB receives from a counterparty for completing loan swap transactions, which FNCB receives at the \ntime the loan closes. Interest rate swap revenue is non-refundable, is not tied to the loan and FNCB has no future \nobligation to the counterparty related to such fees. Accordingly, FNCB records interest rate swap revenue in non-\ninterest income upon receipt. With regard to title insurance revenue, FNCB is a member in a limited liability \ncompany that provides title insurance services to customers referred by member financial institutions. In accordance \nwith an operating agreement, the title insurance company makes quarterly discretionary distributions to member"

There \nare no future minimum referral quotas required under the operating agreement. FNCB records revenue from \nquarterly distributions at the time of receipt. \n  \nComprehensive (Loss) Income  \n  \nAccounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. \nAlthough certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, are \nreported as a separate component of the shareholders’ equity section of the statement of financial condition, such items, \nalong with net income, are components of comprehensive (loss) income. \n   \nNew Authoritative Accounting Guidance \n  \nAccounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): “Measurement of Credit \nLosses on Financial Instruments,” replaces the current loss impairment methodology under GAAP with a methodology that \nreflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to \nform credit loss estimates in an effort to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the \nexpected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit. ASU 2016-13 is commonly referred \nto as Current Expected Credit Losses (\"CECL\") and requires that a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured \nat amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The amendments in this update affect \nentities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income, \nincluding such financial assets as loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance-sheet credit \nexposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right \nto receive cash. On June 17, 2016, the four, federal financial institution regulatory agencies (the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration and the Office \nof the Comptroller of the Currency), issued a joint statement to provide information about ASU 2016-13 and the initial \nsupervisory views regarding the implementation of the new standard. The joint statement applies to all banks, savings \nassociations, credit unions and financial institution holding companies, regardless of asset size. The statement details the key \nelements of, and the steps necessary for, the successful transition to the new accounting standard. In addition, the statement \nnotifies financial institutions that because the appropriate allowance levels are institution-specific amounts, the agencies \nwill not establish benchmark targets or ranges for the change in institutions’ allowance levels upon adoption of the ASU, or \nfor allowance levels going forward. ASU 2016-13 was originally effective for public business entities that are registered with \nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, \nincluding smaller reporting companies, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within \nthose fiscal years. All entities may adopt the amendments in this ASU earlier as of the fiscal years beginning after December \n15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. On November 15, 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards \nBoard (\"FASB\") issued ASU 2019-10, \"Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic \n842): Effective Dates,\" which finalized various effective dates delay for private companies, not-for-profit organizations, and \ncertain smaller reporting companies. Specifically, under ASU 2019-10 the effective date for implementation of CECL for \nsmaller reporting companies, private companies and not-for-profits was extended to fiscal years, and interim periods within \nthose years, beginning after December 15, 2022. As a smaller reporting company, FNCB adopted this guidance on January \n1, 2023. In implementing this guidance, FNCB formed a CECL task group comprised of members of management for its \nfinance, credit administration, lending, internal audit, loan operations and information systems units. The CECL task \ngroup has evaluated the impact of the current expected loss methodology to identify the necessary modifications in \naccordance with this standard which will require a change in the processes and procedures to calculated the allowance for \nloan and lease losses, including changes in assumptions and estimates to consider expected credit losses over the life of the \nloan versus the current incurred loss methodology. FNCB also engaged a third-party consultant to assist and provide guidance \nin determining the appropriate methodology for each segment and evaluating qualitative factors and economic data to develop \nappropriate forecasts for integration into the model. Management has determined that peer loss experience provides the best \nbasis for its assessment of expected credit losses to determine FNCB's allowance and has run parallel model results in \npreparation for adopting the new guidance on January 1, 2023. FNCB engaged another third-party consultant that performed \nan independent validation of the model. Management continues to finalize documentation on the methodologies utilized as \nwell as the controls, processes, policies and disclosures. FNCB will recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening \nretained earnings as of the adoption date. Management currently estimates the allowance for credit losses will be in a range \nof $11.5 million to $11.8 million, decreasing the allowance by approximately $2.4 million to $2.6 million. The estimated \nincrease to equity, net of tax, will range from $1.9 million to $2.1 million. The actual impact will depend on a number of \ninternal and external factors including: outstanding loan balances, characteristics of FNCB's loan and securities portfolios, \nmacroeconomic conditions, forecast information and management's judgement.

Additionally, adoption of ASU 2016-13 could result in higher volatility in \nour quarterly credit loss provision than the current reserve process and could adversely impact FNCB's ongoing results of \noperations. \n  \nASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): \"Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures,\" \neliminates the TDR recognition and measurement guidance and, instead, requires that an entity evaluate (consistent with the \naccounting for other loan modifications) whether the modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. \nThe amendments also enhance existing disclosure requirements and introduce new requirements related to certain \nmodifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. For public business entities, these \namendments require that an entity disclose current-period gross charge-offs by year of origination for financing receivables \nand net investment in leases within the scope of Subtopic 326-20. Gross charge-off information must be included in the \nvintage disclosures required for public business entities in accordance with paragraph 326-20-50-6, which requires that an \nentity disclose the amortized cost basis of financing receivables by credit quality indicator and class of financing receivable \nby year of origination. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, \nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years. These amendments should be applied prospectively, except for the \ntransition method related to the recognition and measurement of TDRs, which an entity has the option to apply a modified \nretrospective transition method resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption. \nEarly adoption is permitted if an entity has adopted ASU No. 2016-13, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity \nelects to early adopt ASU No. 2022-02 in an interim period, the guidance should be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal \nyear that includes the interim period. An entity may elect to early adopt the amendments about TDRs and related disclosure \nenhancements separately from the amendments related to vintage disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2022-02 are effective \nupon FNCB's adoption of ASU 2016-13. \n  \nASU 2020-01 Investments - Investments-Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures \n(Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). The new guidance addresses accounting for the transition into and \nout of the equity method and measuring certain purchase options and forward contracts to acquire investments.  If a company \nis applying the measurement alternative for an equity investment under ASC 321 and must transition to the equity method, \nor if applying the equity method and must transition to ASC 321; because of an observable transaction, it will remeasure its \ninvestment immediately before transition.  If a company holds certain non-derivative forward contracts or purchased call \noptions to acquire equity securities, such instruments generally will be measured using the fair value principles of ASC 321 \nbefore settlement or exercise. ASU 2020-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal \nyears, beginning after December 15, 2020 for public business entities, and for fiscal years, and interim periods within those \nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 for all other entities. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this \nguidance on January 1, 2022 did not have a material effect on the operating results or financial position of FNCB. \n   \nASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): “Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial \nReporting,” provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or \nrecognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. It provides optional expedients and exceptions for \napplying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by \nreference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 were effective upon issuance. On January \n7, 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) that clarifies that certain optional expedients \nand exceptions provided for in ASU 2020-04 also apply to derivatives that do not reference a rate that is being discontinued \nbut otherwise are affected by reference rate reform. ASU 2021-01 clarifies that changes in the interest rates used for \nmargining, discounting, or contract price alignment for derivative instruments that are being implemented as part of the \nmarket-wide transition to new reference rates, commonly referred to as the \"discounting transition,\" are within the scope of \nTopic 848. ASU 2021-01 was effective upon issuance. As part of its overall evaluation of reference rate reform, management \nis still evaluating the impact that LIBOR replacement will have on FNCB's operating results and financial position. Any such \nimpacts will be prospective in nature and may affect net interest income and fair value estimates after the effective date of \nsuch rate replacement. The LIBOR replacement is not expected to have a material effect on the operating results or financial \nposition of FNCB."

As part of its evaluation, \nmanagement considers, among other things, the length of time a security’s fair value is less than its amortized cost, the \nseverity of decline, any credit deterioration of the issuer, whether or not management intends to sell the security, and whether \nit is more likely than not that FNCB will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost. \n  \nManagement performed a review of all securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2022 and determined that \nchanges in the fair values of the securities were consistent with movements in market interest rates and spreads or general \nmarket conditions. In addition, as part of its review, management noted that there was no material change in the credit quality \nof any of the issuers or any other event or circumstance that may cause a significant adverse effect on the fair value of these \nsecurities. Moreover, to date, FNCB has received all scheduled principal and interest payments and expects to fully collect \nall future contractual principal and interest payments on all securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2022. \nFNCB does not intend to sell the securities, nor is it more likely than not that it will be required to sell the securities, prior to \nrecovery of their amortized cost. Based on the results of its review and considering the attributes of these debt securities, \nmanagement concluded that the individual unrealized losses were temporary and OTTI did not exist at December 31, 2022.  \n  \nEquity Securities  \n  \nIncluded in equity securities with readily determinable fair values at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were \ninvestments in the common or preferred stock of publicly traded bank holding companies and an investment in a mutual fund \ncomprised of 1-4 family residential mortgage-backed security collateralized by properties within FNCB's market area.

      "text": "77 \nEquity Securities and Equity Securities without Readily Determinable Fair Value \n  \nAt December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, equity securities without readily determinable fair values consisted of a $500 \nthousand investment in a fixed-rate, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock of a privately-held bank holding company, \nwhich is included in other assets in the consolidated statement of financial condition. The preferred stock pays quarterly \ndividends at an annual rate of 8.25%, which commenced on March 30, 2021. The preferred stock of this bank holding \ncompany is not traded on any established market and is accounted for as an equity security without a determinable fair value. \nUnder GAAP, an equity security without a readily determinable fair value shall be written down to its fair values if a \nqualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, and the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying \nvalue. As part of its qualitative assessment, management engaged an independent third party to provide valuations of this \ninvestment as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, which indicated that the investment was not impaired.

      "text": "78 \nFNCB has granted loans, letters of credit and lines of credit to certain of its executive officers and directors as well as to \ncertain of their related parties. For more information about related party transactions, refer to Note 12, “Related Party \nTransactions” to these consolidated financial statements. \n  \nFor information about credit concentrations within FNCB’s loan portfolio, refer to Note 13, “Commitments, Contingencies \nand Concentrations” to these consolidated financial statements. \n  \nFNCB originates 1- 4 family residential mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market. The aggregate principal balance of \n1-4 family residential mortgages sold on the secondary market were $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and \n$9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net gains on the sale of residential mortgage loans were $205 thousand \nin 2022 and $352 thousand in 2021. FNCB retains servicing rights on mortgages sold in the secondary market. At December \n31, 2022, there were $60 thousand in 1-4 family residential mortgage loans held for sale. There were no 1-4 family residential \nmortgage loans held for sale at December 31, 2021.  \n  \nThe unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for others, including residential mortgages and SBA-guaranteed loans were \n$78.7 million and $77.2 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n  \nFNCB does not have any lending programs commonly referred to as \"subprime lending\". Subprime lending generally targets \nborrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, \njudgements, and bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high \ndebt-burden ratios. \n  \nFNCB provides for loan and lease losses based on the consistent application of its documented ALLL methodology. Loan \nand lease losses are charged to the ALLL and recoveries are credited to it. Additions to the ALLL are provided by charges \nagainst income based on various factors which, in management’s judgement, deserve current recognition of estimated \nprobable losses. Loan and lease losses are charged-off in the period the loans, or portions thereof, are deemed uncollectible. \nGenerally, FNCB will record a loan charge-off (including a partial charge-off) to reduce a loan to the estimated recoverable \namount based on its methodology detailed below. Management regularly reviews the loan portfolio and makes adjustments \nfor loan losses in order to maintain the ALLL in accordance with GAAP. The ALLL consists primarily of the following two \ncomponents:  \n  \n  \n(1) Specific allowances are established for impaired loans, which FNCB defines as all loan relationships with an \naggregate outstanding balance greater than $100 thousand rated substandard and on non-accrual, loans rated \ndoubtful or loss, and all TDRs. The amount of impairment provided for as an allowance is represented by the \ndeficiency, if any, between the carrying value of the loan and either (a) the present value of expected future cash \nflows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, (b) the loan’s observable market price, or (c) the fair value of \nthe underlying collateral, less estimated costs to sell, for collateral dependent loans. Impaired loans that have no \nimpairment losses are not considered in the establishment of general valuation allowances as described below. If \nmanagement determines that collection of the impairment amount is remote, a charge-off will be recorded for the \nimpairment amount. \n  \n  \n(2) General allowances are established for loan losses on a portfolio basis for loans that do not meet the definition of \nimpaired. FNCB divides its portfolio into loan segments for loans exhibiting similar characteristics. Loans rated \nspecial mention or substandard and accruing, which are embedded in these loan segments, are then separated from \nthese loan segments, as these loans are subject to an analysis that emphasizes the credit risk associated with these \nloans. An estimated loss rate is then applied to each loan segment, which are based on FNCB’s own historical loss \nexperience for each respective loan segment. In addition, management evaluates and applies to each loan segment \ncertain qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with FNCB’s \nexisting portfolio to differ from historical experience, which are discussed below. For loans that have an internal \ncredit rating of special mention or substandard, the qualitative and environmental factors are further adjusted for \nthe increased risk. \n  \nIn addition to the specific and general components, management may establish an unallocated allowance that is used to cover \nany inherent losses that exist as of the evaluation date, but which may have not been identified under the methodology."

This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that \nmay be susceptible to significant revisions based upon changes in economic and real estate market conditions. However, \nactual loan losses may be significantly more than the established ALLL, which could have a material negative effect on \nFNCB’s operating results or financial condition. While management uses the best information available to make its \nevaluations, future adjustments to the ALLL may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the information used \nin making the evaluations. Banking regulators, as an integral part of their examination of FNCB, also review the ALLL, and \nmay require, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, that certain loan \nbalances be charged off or require that adjustments be made to the ALLL."

FNCB maintains a formal, written loan \nclassification and credit grading system that includes a discussion of the factors used to assign appropriate classifications of \ncredit grades to loans. The risk grade groupings provide a mechanism to identify risk within the loan portfolio and provide \nmanagement and the board of directors with periodic reports by risk category. The process also identifies groups of loans that \nwarrant the special attention of management. Accurate and timely loan classification and credit grading is a critical component \nof loan portfolio management. Loan officers are required to review their loan portfolio risk ratings regularly for accuracy. In \naddition, the credit risk ratings play an important role in the loan review function, as well as the establishment and evaluation \nof the provision for loan and lease losses and the ALLL."

      "text": "82 \nThe loan review function uses the same risk rating system in the loan review process. Quarterly, FNCB engages an \nindependent third party to assess the quality of the loan portfolio and evaluate the accuracy of ratings with the loan officer’s \nand management’s assessment. \n  \nFNCB’s loan rating system assigns a degree of risk to commercial loans based on relevant information about the ability of \nborrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, \npublic information and current economic trends, among other factors. Management analyzes these non-homogeneous loans \nindividually by grading the loans as to credit risk and probability of collection for each type of loan. Commercial and industrial \nloans include commercial indirect auto loans which are not individually risk rated, and construction, land acquisition and \ndevelopment loans include residential construction loans which are also not individually risk rated. These loans are monitored \non a pool basis due to their homogeneous nature as described in “Credit Quality Indicators – Other Loans” below. FNCB risk \nrates certain residential real estate loans and consumer loans that are part of a larger commercial relationship using a credit \ngrading system as described in “Credit Quality Indicators – Commercial Loans.” The grading system contains the following \nbasic risk categories: \n  \n1. Minimal Risk \n2. Above Average Credit Quality \n3. Average Risk \n4. Acceptable Risk \n5. Pass - Watch \n6. Special Mention \n7. Substandard - Accruing \n8. Substandard - Non-Accrual \n9. Doubtful \n10. Loss \n  \nThis analysis is performed on a quarterly basis using the following definitions for risk ratings: \n  \nPass – Assets rated 1 through 5 are considered pass ratings. These assets show no current or potential problems and are \nconsidered fully collectible. All such loans are evaluated collectively for ALLL calculation purposes. However, accruing \nloans restructured under a TDR that have been performing for an extended period, do not represent a higher risk of loss, and \nhave been upgraded to a pass rating are evaluated individually for impairment. \n  \nSpecial Mention – Assets classified as special mention do not currently expose FNCB to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant \nan adverse classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving close attention.  Special mention \nassets have a potential weakness or pose an unwarranted financial risk which, if not corrected, could weaken the asset and \nincrease risk in the future. \n  \nSubstandard – Assets classified as substandard have well defined weaknesses based on objective evidence and are \ncharacterized by the distinct possibility that FNCB will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. \n  \nDoubtful – Assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added \ncharacteristic that such weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable based on current \ncircumstances. \n  \nLoss – Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets is \nnot warranted."

      "text": "84 \nIncluded in loans and leases receivable are loans for which the accrual of interest income has been discontinued due to \ndeterioration in the financial condition of the borrowers. The recorded investment in these non-accrual loans was $2.8 million \nat December 31, 2022 and $3.9 million at December 31, 2021. Generally, loans are placed on non-accrual status when they \nbecome 90 days or more delinquent. Once a loan is placed on non-accrual status it remains on non-accrual status until it has \nbeen brought current, has six months of performance under the loan terms, and factors indicating reasonable doubt about the \ntimely collection of payments no longer exists.

BORROWED FUNDS \n  \nShort-term borrowings available to FNCB include overnight advances through the FHLB of Pittsburgh advances, federal \nfunds lines of credit and the Federal Reserve Discount Window, which generally represent overnight or less than 30-day \nborrowings. FNCB's maximum borrowing capacity under federal funds lines of credit, which are unsecured, was $75.0 \nmillion at December 31, 2022 and $72.0 million at December 31, 2021. There were no amounts outstanding on federal funds \nlines of credit at December 31, 2022 or 2021. \n  \nFNCB has an agreement with the FHLB of Pittsburgh which allows for borrowings, either overnight or term, up to a maximum \nborrowing capacity based on a percentage of qualifying loans pledged under a blanket pledge agreement. In addition to \npledging loans, FNCB is required to purchase FHLB of Pittsburgh stock based upon the amount of credit extended. Loans \nthat were pledged to collateralize borrowings under this agreement were $482.1 million at December 31, 2022 and \n$478.3 million at December 31, 2021. FNCB’s maximum borrowing capacity was $394.5 million at December 31, 2022. At \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, there were $47.5 million and $7.5 million, respectively, in letters of credit to secure municipal \ndeposits outstanding under this agreement. There were $139.4 million in overnight advances and $32.7 million in term \nadvances through the FHLB of Pittsburgh outstanding at December 31, 2022. There were $20.0 million in term advances \nthrough the FHLB of Pittsburgh outstanding at December 31, 2021.  \n  \nAdvances through the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window generally include short-term advances which are fully \ncollateralized by certain pledged loans of $25.8 million under the Federal Reserve Bank’s Borrower-in-Custody (“BIC”) \nprogram.

FNCB owns 100.0% of the ownership interest in the \nIssuing Trust. The proceeds from the issue were invested in $10.3 million, 7.02% Junior Subordinated Debentures (the \n“Debentures”) issued by FNCB. The interest rate on the Trust Securities and the Debentures resets quarterly at a spread of \n1.67% above the current 3-month LIBOR rate. Upon the expected phase-out of LIBOR on June 30, 2023, the interest rate on \nthe debentures will reset quarterly at a spread of 1.67% above 3-month CME Term SOFR plus 0.26161%. The average interest \nrate paid on the Debentures was 3.47% in 2022 and 1.85% in 2021. The Debentures are unsecured and rank subordinate and \njunior in right to all indebtedness, liabilities and obligations of FNCB. The Debentures represent the sole assets of the Trust. \nInterest on the Trust Securities is deferrable until a period of twenty consecutive quarters has elapsed. FNCB has the option \nto prepay the Trust Securities beginning December 15, 2011. FNCB has, under the terms of the Debentures and the related \nIndenture, as well as the other operative corporate documents, agreed to irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee the Trust’s \nobligations under the Debentures. FNCB has reflected this investment on a deconsolidated basis. As a result, the Debentures \ntotaling $10.3 million, have been reflected in borrowed funds in the consolidated statements of financial condition at \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 under the caption “Junior Subordinated Debentures”.

DERIVATIVE AND HEDGING TRANSACTIONS \n  \nRisk Management Objective of Using Derivatives  \n  \nFNCB is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions.  It principally manages \nits exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. FNCB \nmanages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and \nduration of its assets and liabilities and the use of derivative financial instruments.  Specifically, FNCB enters into derivative \nfinancial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future \nunknown and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.  Derivative financial instruments \nare used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of known or expected cash payments primarily related to \nFNCB's borrowings. FNCB's existing credit derivatives result from loan participations arrangements, therefore, are not used \nto manage interest rate risk in FNCB's assets or liabilities. \n  \nCash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk \n  \nFNCB's objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to \ninterest rate movements.  To accomplish this objective, FNCB primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate \nrisk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a \ncounterparty in exchange for FNCB making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the \nunderlying notional amount, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with forecasted issuances \nof debt in 2022 and 2021. \n  \nFor derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is \nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period \nduring which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related \nto derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on FNCB's variable-rate debt.  During the \nnext twelve months, it is estimated that an additional $604 thousand will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense. \n  \nNon-designated Hedges \n  \nDerivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service FNCB provides to certain \ncustomers.  FNCB executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk \nmanagement strategies.  Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that FNCB \nexecutes with a third party, such that FNCB minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions.  As the interest \nrate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of \nboth the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. FNCB's existing credit derivatives \nresult from participations out of interest rate swaps provided to external lenders as part of loan participation arrangements, \ntherefor, are not used to manage interest rate risk in FNCB's assets or liabilities. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not \nspeculative and result from a service FNCB provides to certain lenders which participate in loans."

      "text": "97 \nCommitments \n  \nOn October 1, 2022, FNCB issued a signed letter of intent to make an equity investment of approximately $11.0 million in a \nlimited partnership interest, to build and operate a senior low-income housing development located in Scranton, Lackawanna \nCounty, Pennsylvania. One hundred percent (100.0%) of the rental units will qualify for Federal Low-Housing Tax credits \n(\"LIHTCs\") as provided for in Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. FNCB made an initial \ncontribution of $2.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, upon closing the partnership agreement. The remaining obligation \nof $8.8 million, which is included on other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, \n2022, will be contributed over a series of draws over the following 18-month period according to the construction schedule. \n  \nFinancial Instruments with off-balance sheet commitments \n  \nFNCB is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing \nneeds of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit that \ninvolve varying degrees of credit, interest rate or liquidity risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. \nFNCB’s exposure to credit loss from nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to \nextend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. \n  \nThe following table summarizes financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk at December 31, 2022 \nand 2021 : \n  \n  \n  \nDecember 31, \n  \n(in thousands) \n  \n2022 \n    \n2021 \n  \nCommitments to extend credit.............................................................................   $ \n301,300    $ \n273,883  \nStandby letters of credit .......................................................................................     \n17,923      \n17,179  \n  \nIn order to provide for probable losses inherent in these instruments, FNCB recorded reserves for unfunded commitments of \n$949 thousand and $583 thousand at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which were included in other liabilities on \nthe consolidated balance sheets.  \n  \nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers in accordance with contractual provisions. These \ncommitments usually are for specific periods or contain termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee. The total \namounts of unused commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, in that commitments often expire \nwithout being drawn upon. \n  \nLetters of credit and financial guarantees are agreements whereby FNCB guarantees the performance of a customer to a third \nparty. Collateral may be required to support letters of credit in accordance with management’s evaluation of the \ncreditworthiness of each customer. The credit exposure assumed in issuing letters of credit is essentially equal to that in other \nlending activities. \n  \nFederal Home Loan Bank — Mortgage Partnership Finance (“MPF”) Program \n  \nUnder a secondary market loan servicing program with the FHLB, FNCB, in exchange for a monthly fee, provides a credit \nenhancement guarantee to the FHLB for foreclosure losses in excess of a defined First Loss Account (“FLA”) balance, up to \nspecified amounts.  At December 31, 2022, FNCB serviced payments on $12.9 million of first lien residential loan principal \nunder these terms for the FHLB. At December 31, 2022, the maximum credit enhancement obligation for such guarantees by \nFNCB would be approximately $655 thousand if total foreclosure losses on the entire pool of loans exceed the FLA of \napproximately $65 thousand. There was no reserve established for this guarantee at December 31, 2022 and 2021.  \n  \nConcentrations of Credit Risk \n  \nCash Concentrations: The Bank maintains cash balances at several correspondent banks. FNCB engages in a primary \ncorrespondent banking relationship with PNC Bank.  At December 31, 2022 and 2021, FNCB had balances with PNC Bank \nof $1.7 million and $1.6 million, respectively. There were no other due from bank accounts in excess of the $250 thousand \nlimit covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) at December 31, 2022 and 2021."

REGULATORY MATTERS/SUBSEQUENT EVENTS \n  \nFNCB’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders, or repurchase shares of its common stock, is largely dependent on the \nBank’s ability to pay dividends to FNCB. Bank regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid, or shares that \nmay be repurchased, without prior approval of the Bank’s regulatory agency. Cash dividends declared and paid by FNCB \nduring 2022 and 2021 were $0.33 per share and $0.27 per share, respectively. FNCB offers a Dividend Reinvestment and \nStock Purchase plan (\"DRP\") to its shareholders. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 dividend reinvestment \nshares were purchased in open market transactions. However, shares under the optional cash purchase feature of the DRP \nwere issued from authorized but unissued common shares. Shares of common stock issued under the DRP totaled 5,089 and \n12,189 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, on January 25, \n2023, FNCB declared a $0.090 per share dividend payable on March 15, 2023 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2023. \n  \nOn January 26, 2022, FNCB's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which up to 750,000 shares \nof FNCB's outstanding common stock may be acquired in the open market which commenced on March 4, 2022 and expired \non December 31, 2022. On January 25, 2023, FNCB's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 750,000 shares \nof FNCB's outstanding common stock under a similar program, which is anticipated to commence on March 3, 2023. \nRepurchases under both programs are administered through an independent broker and are subjected to SEC regulations as \nwell as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the trading plan. In 2022, FNCB repurchased 384,830 \nshares at a weighted-average price per share of $9.45, or $3.6 million in aggregate. Repurchases are funded from available \nworking capital and the repurchased shares were returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. \n \nThe holding company is considered a small bank holding company and is exempt from risk-based capital and leverage rules, \nincluding Basel III. FNCB and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal \nbanking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional \ndiscretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on FNCB’s financial \nstatements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, FNCB and the \nBank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of FNCB's and the Bank's assets, liabilities, \nand certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. FNCB's and the Bank's capital \namounts, and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, \nand other factors. Management believes, as of December 31, 2022, that FNCB and the Bank meet all applicable capital \nadequacy requirements."

      "text": "101 \nNote 16. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \n  \nIn determining fair value, FNCB uses various valuation approaches, including market, income and cost approaches. \nAccounting standards establish a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs \nand minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs \nare inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, which are developed based on market data \nobtained from sources independent of FNCB. Unobservable inputs reflect FNCB’s knowledge about the assumptions the \nmarket participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, which are developed based on the best information available in \nthe circumstances. \n   \nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or \nliabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). A financial asset or \nliability’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value \nmeasurement. The fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows: \n  \n  \n● \nLevel 1 valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted market prices for identical instruments traded in active markets; \n  \n  \n● \nLevel 2 valuation is based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted market \nprices for identical or similar instruments traded in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques \nfor which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by market data; and \n  \n  \n● \nLevel 3 valuation is derived from other valuation methodologies including discounted cash flow models and similar \ntechniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect \nestimates of assumptions that market participants would use in determining fair value. \n  \nA description of the valuation methodologies used for assets recorded at fair value, and for estimating fair value of financial \ninstruments not recorded at fair value, is set forth below. \n  \nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities \n  \nThe estimated fair values for FNCB’s investments in obligations of the U.S. government, obligations of state and political \nsubdivisions, government-sponsored agency CMOs and mortgage-backed securities, private collateralized mortgage \nobligations, asset-backed securities, negotiable certificates of deposit and certain corporate debt securities are obtained by \nFNCB from a nationally-recognized pricing service. This pricing service develops estimated fair values by analyzing like \nsecurities and applying available market information through processes such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of like \nsecurities, sector groupings and matrix pricing (Level 2 inputs), to prepare valuations. Matrix pricing is a mathematical \ntechnique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific \nsecurities, but rather by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. The fair value \nmeasurements consider observable data that may include, among other things, dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the \nU.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information \nand the bond’s terms and conditions, and are based on market data obtained from sources independent from FNCB. The Level \n2 investments in FNCB’s portfolio are priced using those inputs that, based on the analysis prepared by the pricing service, \nreflect the assumptions that market participants would use to price the assets. Management has determined that the Level 2 \ndesignation is appropriate for these securities because, as with most fixed-income securities, those in FNCB’s portfolio are \nnot exchange-traded, and such non-exchange-traded fixed income securities are typically priced by correlation to observed \nmarket data. FNCB has reviewed the pricing service’s methodology to confirm its understanding that such methodology \nresults in a valuation based on quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted markets for \nidentical or similar instruments traded in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which the \nsignificant assumptions can be corroborated by market data as appropriate to a Level 2 designation. \n  \nFor those securities for which the inputs used by an independent pricing service were derived from unobservable market \ninformation, FNCB evaluated the appropriateness and quality of each price.  Management reviewed the volume and level of \nactivity for all classes of securities and attempted to identify transactions which may not be orderly or reflective of a \nsignificant level of activity and volume.  For securities meeting these criteria, the quoted prices received from either market \nparticipants or an independent pricing service may be adjusted, as necessary, to estimate fair value (fair values based on Level \n3 inputs).  If applicable, the adjustment to fair value was derived based on present value cash flow model projections obtained \nfrom third party providers using assumptions similar to those incorporated by market participants."

      "text": "102 \nAt December 31, 2022, FNCB owned 29 corporate debt securities with an aggregate amortized cost and fair value of \n$33.6 million and $30.7 million, respectively. The market for six of the 29 corporate debt securities at December 31, \n2022 was not active and markets for similar securities are also not active. FNCB obtained valuations for these securities from \na third-party service provider that prepared the valuations using a market approach that incorporates identifying a population \nof transactions for similar instruments and an evaluation to capture credit risk associated with these bonds.  Management \ntakes measures to validate the service provider’s analysis and is actively involved in the valuation process, including \nreviewing and verifying the population and evaluation of credit risk. Managment believes this approach to be a conservative \napproach as it takes into consideration securities that have longer maturities or longer call dates, issuers with smaller asset \nsizes, and securities with smaller issue amounts. These factors are typically considered to be factors that would add credit \nspread to a bond, thus resulting in a higher yield.  Management believes the valuation results from this market approach to \nbe consistent with pricing and data for similar deals at December 31, 2022. FNCB considers the inputs used in the market \napproach to be observable Level 3 inputs because, while inputs are based on actual transactions, the relative number of \ntransactions in the population is small and subjective assumptions are used in considering factors considered to incorporate \ncredit spreads into price determination. Management will continue to monitor the market for these securities to assess the \nmarket activity and the availability of observable inputs and will continue to apply these controls and procedures to the \nvaluations received from FNCB's third-party service provider. \n  \nEquity Securities \n  \nThe estimated fair values of equity securities are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized exchanges \n(Level 1 inputs). \n  \nDerivative Contracts \n  \nFNCB's derivative liabilities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. Values of these instruments are obtained \nthrough an independent pricing source utilizing information which may include market observed quotations for swaps, \nLIBOR rates, forward rates and rate volatility.  Derivative contracts create exposure to interest rate movements a swell as \nrisks from the potential of non-performance of the counterparty."

Controls and Procedures \n  \n FNCB’s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the \neffectiveness of the design and operation of FNCB’s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule \n13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of December 31, 2022.  \n  \nBased on that evaluation, FNCB’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded FNCB’s disclosure controls \nand procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022.  \n  \nThere were no changes made to FNCB’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal \nquarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, FNCB’s internal control over financial \nreporting. \n  \nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n  \nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for FNCB \nBancorp, Inc. (the “Company”). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable \nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in \naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and is not intended to provide absolute \nassurance that a misstatement of the Company’s financial statements would be prevented or detected. \n  \nInternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that \nin reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; provide \nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance \nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are only being made in \naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding \nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a \nmaterial effect on the financial statements. \n  \nAny control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that \nthe objectives of the control system are met. The design of a control system inherently has limitations and the benefits of \ncontrols must be weighed against their costs. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some \npersons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Therefore, no assessment of a cost-\neffective system of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, will \nbe detected. \n  \nAs of December 31, 2022, management of the Company conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s \ninternal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management’s assessment included \nextensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial \nreporting. \n  \nBased on this evaluation under the criteria in the Framework, management concluded that the Company’s system of internal \ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. \n  \n \n \nGerard A.
