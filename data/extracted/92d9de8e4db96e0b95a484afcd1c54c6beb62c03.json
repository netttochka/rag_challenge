DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.\nTHE COMPANY\nWestwater Resources, Inc., originally incorporated in 1977, is an energy technology company focused on developing battery-grade natural\ngraphite materials after its acquisition of Alabama Graphite in 2018. Alabama Graphite holds mineral rights to explore and potentially mine the Coosa\nGraphite Deposit. During 2022, AGP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Westwater Resources, continued construction activities related to Phase I of the\nKellyton Graphite Plant. In April of 2022, Alabama Graphite completed the initial drilling stage of its exploration program to further investigate the size\nand extent of graphite mineral concentrations at the Coosa Graphite Deposit.  The Coosa Graphite Deposit is located near Rockford Alabama at 32 ° 54’\n30” North and 86 ° 24’ 00” West.\nOUR STRATEGY\nOur strategy is to increase shareholder value by advancing our battery-grade graphite business. The acquisition of Alabama Graphite in 2018\nprovides the Company with the opportunity to provide critical raw materials utilized by the growing market for electric automobiles, trucks and buses,\nconsumer electronics, as well as grid-based storage devices. According to Benchmark Intelligence, in 2022, the global battery market demand for both\nnatural and synthetic graphite was estimated at 517,997 tonnes per annum (or tpa) and demand is projected to increase at a compounded annual growth\nrate (“CAGR”) of 17% over the next 10-year period.\nOur goal for the graphite business is to develop a battery-graphite manufacturing business in Alabama that produces low-cost, high-quality, and\nhigh-margin graphite products for battery manufacturers. In 2020, we began operation of a pilot program, designed both to manufacture battery-grade\ngraphite materials in quantities suitable for potential customer testing and to inform the DFS. Both the pilot program and DFS were completed during\nthe fourth quarter of 2021, and construction activities on Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant began in the fourth quarter of 2021. In response to\nincreasing customer demand and market conditions, the Company has completed an optimization of the original DFS to increase the expected\nproduction for Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant.  As a result of this optimization, the Company now expects production capacity for Phase I of the\nKellyton Graphite Plant of 16,000 mt per year, and expected CSPG production of 7,500 mt per year.  The Company now estimates the total costs for\nPhase I construction to be approximately $271 million compared to the original estimate of $202 million.  Further, the Company now expects to begin\ntesting and commissioning of Phase I in late 2023, and first production to occur in the first half of 2024, subject to securing the additional funding to\ncomplete construction.  Additionally, we expect to complete the Phase I optimization in the second half of 2024 to increase the expected production\ncapacity of Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant. For additional information regarding the Kellyton Graphite Plant see Item 2, Properties.\nWe continue to engage with potential customers across a number of markets including automotive companies and lithium-ion battery\nmanufacturers. Based on the positive feedback we have received to date from our potential customers, we continue to provide new or additional samples\nutilizing our pilot program. We believe that the Inflation Reduction Act, which sets a minimum domestic content threshold for the percentage of the\nvalue of applicable critical minerals contained in the battery of the electric vehicles, is beneficial to the domestic graphite industry and will provide\nadditional benefit to the Company as it continues to engage with potential customers. Since the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022,\nthe interest of potential customers has intensified as we move towards domestic production of battery-grade natural graphite materials.\nAdditionally, we hold mineral rights to 41,965 acres for future mining development. The graphite deposit at the Coosa Graphite Deposit is\nexpected to serve as future feedstock for the Kellyton Graphite Plant and provide in-house quality assurance and quality control (“QA/QC”) for raw-\nmaterial inputs. Subject to further exploration, its own definitive feasibility study, the availability of financing, and regulatory approvals, the Coosa\nGraphite Deposit and related mining operation is expected by the end of 2028. The Coosa Graphite Deposit also contains vanadium mineral\nconcentrations, which the Company plans to explore and evaluate the technical feasibility of extracting and processing in the future."

In 2022, the Company also began installing underground utilities, completed building foundations, and began erecting manufacturing\nbuildings of the Kellyton Graphite Plant. Construction activity during the year also included receipt of certain long-lead equipment items.  For full\ndetails regarding the Kellyton Graphite Plant see additional details below.\nCoosa Graphite Deposit Technical Report Summary\nThe mineral resource estimate for the Coosa Graphite Deposit, based on 205 drill holes totaling 39,434 ft., was completed by SLR on\nNovember 30, 2022 as an Initial Assessment in accordance with Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC (or S-K 1300).  For further\ninformation regarding this Technical Report Summary and the Coosa Graphite Deposit, refer to Item 2, Properties, below.\nOVERVIEW OF THE BATTERY GRAPHITE INDUSTRY\nGraphite is the name given to a common form of the element carbon. Occurring naturally as a mineral in deposits around the world, graphite is\nused in many industrial applications. These end uses take advantage of graphite’s natural characteristics, which include high lubricity, high resistance to\ncorrosion, the ability to withstand high temperatures while remaining highly stable, and excellent conductivity of heat and electricity.\nIn recent years, graphite has become an essential component in the production of all types of electrical storage batteries. Graphite’s role will\ncontinue to be important as demand for these batteries increases and with the world’s growing electric vehicle and energy-storage needs. Natural\nbattery-ready graphite products are derived from flake graphite that has been transformed through a series of specialty downstream processes into\nvarious battery graphite products. These processes include, but are not limited to:\n●\nMicronization (sizing)\n●\nPurification to battery-grade carbon with graphitic (Cg) content of ≥ 99.95%\n●\nSpheroidization (shaping) and classification (sorting); and\n●\nSurface treatment (carbon coating).\nNatural flake graphite is increasingly supplanting or supplementing the use of synthetic graphite in battery applications for cost and\nperformance reasons. Through a series of sophisticated and precise processing steps, flake-"

Coated spherical purified graphite is used as a graphite\nanode or anode active material in lithium-ion batteries.\nThe global battery market demand for natural graphite in 2022 was 221,636 tpa (Benchmark, 2022). The greatest share of this market is made\nup of four battery-market segments that require advanced battery-grade graphite products:\n●\nLithium-Ion batteries — these are the most technologically advanced batteries used in everything from mobile phones and hand tools to\nlaptop computers and electric vehicles, particularly because of the rechargeable nature of the batteries. Demand for lithium-ion batteries,\nrelated specifically to electric vehicles, accounted for 79% of natural graphite demand in 2022, and is projected to grow to 89% by 2032\n(Benchmark, 2022).\n●\nAlkaline batteries — these are the most popular consumer batteries in the world, with a global market size of approximately $7.8 billion\nin 2021 and a projected CAGR of 4.9% from 2022 through 2028 (Fortune Business Insights, 2022).\n●\nLead Acid batteries — these are the workhorse batteries used in automobiles, backup power supplies, and other energy-storage\napplications where weight is less important than capacity.  The global lead acid battery market was estimated at approximately $83.1\nbillion in 2021 and a projected CAGR of 2.6% from 2022 through 2030 (Global Market Insights, 2022).\n●\nPrimary Lithium batteries — these are non-rechargeable, lightweight lithium-based batteries, and are typically used in flashlights,\nsmoke detectors, and other small device applications where long life and lightweight matter most.\nGraphite is a critical, non-substitutable constituent in these listed battery segments.  According to Benchmark Intelligence, the need for graphite\nto support the battery market is expected to grow over the next decade.  Total graphite demand is expected to reach 2,924,411 tpa in 2032, of which over\n1,580,108 tpa are projected to be natural graphite.\nCompetition between natural and synthetic graphite is expected to continue in lithium-ion batteries with differentiation between the two based\non price, performance, and availability.  Common precursor materials in the production of synthetic graphite come from either petroleum needle coke, or\ncoal needle coke. However, synthetic graphite and natural graphite blends are becoming popular choices for electric vehicle applications to optimize\nperformance and cost by taking advantage of each graphite attribute, such as cycle life, energy density, and cost.  Synthetic graphite consumption by\nanode manufacturers is expected to grow because of the concentration of the graphite industry in China; however, natural flake graphite demand is\nforecasted to grow at a higher rate because of natural graphite’s performance and cost efficiencies.\nIn addition, natural graphite flake and purification costs in China have increased due to environmental factors (hydrofluoric acid handling cost)\nand China has become one of the major importers of natural graphite flake, relying upon less expensive African sources.  China also poses a geopolitical\nrisk, particularly to the EU and U.S. regions.\nOverall battery consumption is rising at an accelerated growth rate due to recent and robust developments in electric-automobile markets,\npersonal electronic devices, electrical grid storage, and is an enabling technology for wind and solar power installation. The global shift towards low-\nand zero-emissions vehicles and power sources is expected to drive increasing demand for graphite-battery materials for the foreseeable future. Recent\ndevelopments in this sector include:\n●\nThe United Kingdom and France have announced a prohibition on the sale of gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles by 2030 and 2040,\nrespectively. Electric vehicles using battery storage are currently the only viable technology that can satisfy the demands for new cars\nrequired by these nations."

Grid battery storage is increasing system\nreliability, and as a result of these catalysts, and according to Roskill, the lithium-ion battery market is expected to grow at a CAGR of\nover 20%.\nCurrently, the primary source of battery-grade graphite is from China, presenting the global battery industry with significant risks, including\nsupply chain management risks, economic risks, geopolitical risks, and environmental sustainability concerns. Also, critical domestic production is\nlacking in the United States. A Presidential Executive Order signed on September 30, 2020 includes graphite on a list of minerals critical to the safety\nand security of the United States. With limited current domestic natural graphite production of any kind, the United States is presently required to source\nmost of its battery graphite from China. On February 24, 2021, the President signed another Executive Order that seeks to promote more resilient supply\nchains, to revitalize and rebuild domestic manufacturing capacity, and maintain America’s competitive edge in research and development. The 2021\nExecutive Order tasked the Secretary of Energy, as part of a larger study involving several branches of the United States government, to submit a report\nidentifying risks to the supply chain for high-capacity batteries including those that power electric vehicles. On June 8, 2021, the White House released\na response to the findings of this study in support of securing an end-to-end domestic supply chain for advanced batteries, including investment in\ndomestic production and processing of critical minerals.  Key recommendations in the June 8, 2021 release include, among other things, providing\nfunding and financial incentives to encourage consumer adoption of electric vehicles, providing financing to support advanced battery production, and\ninvesting in the development of next-generation batteries.\nOn March 31, 2022, President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to encourage the domestic production of critical materials, including\ngraphite, for advanced batteries for electric vehicles and clean energy storage.  On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation\nReduction Act (“IRA”).  This legislation includes an investment of approximately $370 billion in climate programs.  The IRA provides a 10% tax credit\nfor the costs of producing certain critical minerals, including graphite and vanadium.  This credit is eligible for direct pay and is also transferable to\nunrelated taxpayers.  In addition, a key provision of the IRA that could indirectly benefit the Company is the Clean Vehicle credit.  The IRA eliminates\nthe previous limitation on the number of electric vehicles a manufacturer can sell before the Clean Vehicle credit is phased out or eliminated.  Further,\nthe IRA sets a minimum domestic content threshold for the percentage of the value of applicable critical minerals contained in the battery of the electric\nvehicles. Because Westwater intends to produce battery grade graphite for lithium-ion batteries to be used in electric vehicles in the United States,\nmanagement believes the domestic content requirement could provide indirect future benefit to the Company.\nThe State of Alabama and local municipalities have entered into incentive agreements with the Company for the siting of the Company’s\nproposed graphite processing plant in Coosa County, Alabama.  The incentive agreements provide certain tax credits and incentives under the Alabama\nJobs Act in connection with the construction of the Kellyton Graphite Plant.\nWestwater has developed graphite-purification technology and advanced product-development processes designed to meet the demands of\npotential customers for battery-grade graphite materials.

Approximately 75% of natural graphite global supply comes from China (Benchmark, 2022).\nWith respect to sales of graphite, the Company expects to compete primarily based on price. We intend to market graphite directly to users of\nthe product. We are in direct competition with supplies available from various sources worldwide. We compete with multiple graphite exploration,\ndevelopment and production companies.\nWESTWATER’S GRAPHITE BUSINESS\nKellyton Graphite Plant\nOn June 22, 2021, AGP entered into incentive agreements with the State of Alabama and local municipalities for the siting of the Kellyton\nGraphite Plant near Kellyton, Alabama. The incentive agreements provide certain tax credits and incentives under the Alabama Jobs Act in connection\nwith the construction of the Kellyton Graphite Plant.\nOn July 23, 2021, AGP executed a land lease with the Lake Martin Area Industrial Development Authority, providing AGP rights to\napproximately 70 acres to construct and operate the Kellyton Graphite Plant. The lease has a term of 10 years, a nominal lease payment, and transfer of\ntitle to AGP at the end of the lease term. Further, the lease provides AGP the option to purchase the land for a nominal amount during the term of the\nlease.\nOn October 13, 2021, AGP completed the purchase of two buildings that total approximately 90,000 sq. ft. to support the development of the\nKellyton Graphite Plant.  The build out of one of these building was completed in April of 2022 and is being used for administrative offices and will\ninclude a laboratory space as well. The other building is being used for the control room, the maintenance shop, shipping and receiving and as\nwarehousing space. Both buildings are adjacent to the Kellyton Graphite Plant. \nWestwater plans to develop the Kellyton Graphite Plant in two phases (Phases I and II).\nPhase I: Based upon the Company’s optimization plan, after testing and commissioning is completed, the Kellyton Graphite Plant is now\nexpected to have capacity to produce approximately 16,000 mt per year of two products, ULTRA-CSPG™ and SPG Fines.  After processing and\npurification, the plant is expected to have capacity to produce the two products in the following quantities:\n●\nULTRA-CSPG™:  \n7,500 mt per year\n●\nSPG Fines:\n8,500 mt per year\nPhase II: Upon completion of the Phase II expansion, the annual capacity of the Kellyton Graphite Plant is now expected to increase to\napproximately 86,500 mt of two products in the following quantities:\n●\nULTRA-CSPG™:  \n 40,500 mt per year\n●\nSPG Fines:\n  \n46,000 mt per year"

The Company \nexpects to begin testing and commissioning of Phase I in late 2023, and first production to occur in the first half of 2024, subject to securing the \nadditional funding to complete construction.  Additionally, we expect to complete the Phase I optimization in the second half of 2024 to increase the \nexpected production capacity of Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant. The Company intends to initiate a definitive feasibility study for Phase II upon,\nor before, the completion of Phase I.\nSpheroidization, Purification and Post-Processing Activities\nThe Company will process natural graphite concentrate at the Kellyton Graphite Plant through a combination of sizing, shaping,\nspheroidization, and classification.  Once completed, the purification is expected to be performed using a proprietary purification process that was\ndeveloped and tested during our pilot program by Dorfner Anzaplan and other engineering consultants. The process uses a combination of technologies\nincluding a caustic bake, acid leach and thermal finishing, a process that allows for a smaller and more sustainable environmental footprint than that of a\nhydrofluoric acid leaching system as used by other graphite processing companies.   Once the graphite is purified to a minimum graphite carbon content\nof 99.95%, we will then coat the SPG to manufacture the advanced graphite products we intend to sell. This unique application process developed by\nWestwater is the subject of a patent application that has been filed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\nWe currently purchase available graphite flake concentration from a qualified supplier to serve as plant feedstock for the Kellyton Graphite\nPlant while the Coosa Graphite Deposit is being evaluated, permitted, and developed for future mining operations. Development of a mine at the Coosa\nGraphite Deposit, expected by the end of 2028, is expected to serve as an in-house source of graphite feedstock and will provide in-house QA/QC for\nraw-material inputs.\nCoosa Graphite Deposit\nWestwater acquired Alabama Graphite in 2018 as part of a strategic decision to refocus the Company to supply battery manufacturers with low-\ncost, high-quality, and high-margin graphite products. As part of that transaction, Westwater became the owner of mineral lease rights over the Coosa\nGraphite Deposit, located near Rockford, Alabama, 50 miles southeast of Birmingham.  For further detail on the Coosa Graphite Deposit refer to Item 2,\nProperties, below.\nMining Method\nThe Coosa Graphite Deposit is expected to be mined by conventional small-scale open-pit mining methods.\nConcentrate Plant\nMineralized material from the Coosa Graphite Deposit is projected to have an average grade of approximately 3.04% Cg, and is expected to\ncontain impurities consisting of quartz, muscovite, iron oxides and calcite. Most of the impurities are present on the surfaces of the graphite flakes and\ncan be easily removed during a metallurgical process known as flotation. Flotation processing maximizes the removal of these impurities while avoiding\ndegradation of graphite flakes.\nFurther development work at the Coosa Graphite Deposit is expected to result in the design and construction of a milling and concentration\nplant.\nProducts and Business Development\nThe Company is working to develop products for potential major battery markets. Based on discussions with potential customers, Westwater\nwill focus on the production of ULTRA-CSPG™ and SPG fines during Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant and expects to evaluate the production of\nadditional products in Phase II, subject to market demand and customer interest."

The Company has ongoing discussions with multiple potential customers, including battery manufacturers, and\nautomobile manufacturers, with the goal of executing multi-year supply agreements. To date, the Company has executed Non-Disclosure Agreements\nwith potential customers and has executed five letters of intent across multiple product lines, which are subject to customary conditions and quality and\npackaging specifications to be included in future definitive agreements. The Company has also entered into an agreement with a Tier 1 battery\nmanufacturer for electric vehicles. Under the agreement, the parties will work together to ensure that the ULTRA-CSPG™ that is expected to be\nproduced at the Kellyton Graphite Processing Plant can be used as a high-performance anode material for the customer’s batteries.  Subject to those\nefforts, the parties expect to negotiate another agreement that will allow for the sale of potentially all graphite anode material from the Kellyton Graphite\nProcessing Plant for those batteries.\nRegulation\nGraphite extraction and processing is regulated by the federal and state governments. Compliance with such regulations has a material effect on\nthe economics of our operations and the timing of project development. Our primary regulatory costs have been, and are expected to relate to, obtaining\nlicenses and operating permits from federal and state agencies before the commencement of production activities, as well as the cost for continuing\ncompliance with licenses and permits once they have been issued. The current environmental and technical regulatory requirements for the graphite\nextraction and processing industry are well established.  However, the regulatory process can make permitting difficult and timing unpredictable.\nU.S. regulations pertaining to graphite extraction and processing may evolve in the U.S. However, at this time we do not anticipate any adverse\nimpact from these regulations that would be unique to our operations.\nKellyton Graphite Plant\nFor construction and operations of the Kellyton Graphite Plant, the Company is required to obtain permits related to air emissions, water\ndischarge, storm water drainage, and possibly other regulated waste.  On January 31, 2022, Westwater announced that it had received its National\nPollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) construction stormwater permit, which was required to commence site grading for the Kellyton\nGraphite Plant. The NPDES permit has been issued by the State of Alabama under NPDES to ensure Westwater’s construction efforts comply with the\nFederal Clean Water Act as it relates to regulated disturbances and any stormwater runoff from the Kellyton Graphite Plant site.\nIn June 2022 and August 2022, the Company received its air permit and its State Indirect Discharge (“SID”) permit for the treatment of\nwastewater from the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, respectively.  Consequently, the Company has all necessary permits to\ncomplete the construction of Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant.\nCoosa Graphite Deposit\nGraphite mining and processing in Alabama requires various permits, including those for any emissions to air, water, or other aspects of the\nenvironment.   Permits may be required from the State of Alabama, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers, and other\nstate and federal agencies.  Specifically, to mine the Coosa Graphite Deposit, permits may be required in accordance with the Alabama Surface Mining\nAct of 1969, which is administered by the Alabama Department of Labor (“DoL”). DoL issues mining permits, ensures that mine sites are properly\nbonded for reclamation purposes, and makes periodic inspections. The Company is currently in the process of determining the requirements for posting\nsurety or negotiable bonds related to the area to be disturbed.  Future mining operations at the Coosa Graphite Deposit may be subject to the U.S.\nNational Environmental Policy Act process, with potential review by various federal agencies that may include the U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency, the Army Corp of Engineers, and others.\nIn Alabama, any surface or groundwater withdrawals are managed through the Alabama Water Use Reporting Program. The Alabama Water\nResources Act and associated regulations establish the requirements for water withdrawals."

Once application information is reviewed and\ndetermined to be complete, OWR will issue a Certificate of Use (“COU”) that lists the applicant’s name and information concerning all registered\nsurface and/or groundwater withdrawal points and their withdrawal information. Entities with a capacity to withdraw more than 100,000 gallons per day\nare required to register with OWR and obtain a COU. The COU certifies that proposed water use will not interfere with existing water use and is\nbeneficial.  The Company anticipates evaluating the future need for a COU during its development of a detailed mine plan.\nCORE VALUES AND ENVIRONMENT, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (“ESG”) CONSIDERATIONS\nWestwater’s core values incorporate ESG principles and drive our business and operations.  Westwater’s core values are:\n●\nSafety:\n●\nOf each other\n●\nOf our environment\n●\nOf the communities where we work\n●\nOf our assets\n●\nOf our reputation\n●\nCost Management\n●\nEffective and efficient use of our shareholders’ assets\n●\nFocus on cost performance\n●\nReliability and Integrity\n●\nHighest level of performance every day\n●\nImproving our processes\n●\nConservative promises well kept\nThe Company works to be a good corporate citizen and to safeguard our employees, operations, neighbors and the local communities in which\nour employees and stakeholders live and work.\nFurther, Westwater intends to report its sustainability in accordance with the applicable guidelines established by the Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (“SASB”).  The SASB is an independent, private sector standards-setting organization dedicated to enhancing the efficiency of the\ncapital markets by fostering high-quality disclosure of material sustainability information.\nEnvironmental Criteria and Actions\nThe DFS for Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant was completed in October 2021. As part of the DFS, we have defined the raw material\ninputs, energy inputs, product streams, and waste streams, including air, water, solids and heat, for processing our graphite into battery products.\n Integrated into these input and output streams, we are defining methods of reducing impacts to our environment, including:\n●\nAssessing the origin of our graphite and its impact to the environment.\n●\nAssessing the supply chain for reagents and their impact to the environment.\n●\nAssessing the energy forecasted for use in the manufacturing of our products.\n●\nPerforming trade off studies for recycling our reagents and waste streams in an effort to reduce our impact to the communities where we\nwork and where we source our input materials.\nGreenhouse gas emissions: Estimates are being quantified and are expected to be finalized through detailed design work.  During the testing\nand commissioning of Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant, Westwater expects to commence monitoring, measuring, and to begin continuous\nimprovement efforts related to its greenhouse gas emissions.  \nAir quality: Estimates are being quantified and are expected to be finalized in 2023."

This\nassumes continuing operations and the realization of assets and liabilities in the normal course of business.\nWe have incurred significant losses since ceasing production of uranium in 2009 and expect to continue to incur losses as a result of costs and\nexpenses related to maintaining our properties and general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2022, we had a net working capital of\napproximately $51.0 million, cash of approximately $75.2 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately $353.3 million. As a result of our\nevaluation of the Company’s liquidity for the next twelve months, we have included a discussion about our ability to continue as a going concern in our\nconsolidated financial statements, and our independent auditor’s report for year ended December 31, 2022 includes an explanatory paragraph that\nexpresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a “going concern.” Our capital needs have, in recent years, been funded through sales of our\ndebt and equity securities. In the event that we are unable to raise sufficient additional funds, we may be required to delay, reduce or severely curtail our\noperations or otherwise impede our on-going business efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial\ncondition, long-term prospects and ability to continue as a viable business.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by inflationary pressures, which may result in increased costs of operations and negatively impact our\nability to access capital.\nThe U.S. has experienced rising inflation in 2022 and U.S. inflation is currently at a 40-year high. This inflation has resulted in an increase in\nour costs for labor, services, and materials. Further, our suppliers face inflationary impacts such as the tight labor market and supply chain disruptions,\nthat could increase the costs to construct and commission the Kellyton Graphite Plant, explore and develop the Coosa Graphite Deposit, and conduct our\nday-to-day operations. The rate and scope of these various inflationary factors may increase our operating costs materially, which may not be readily\nrecoverable, and have an adverse effect on our costs, operating margins, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, sustained inflation has caused and may continue to cause the Federal Reserve Board to raise the target for the federal funds rate, which\ncorrespondingly causes an increase in interest rates.  Increased interest rates could have a negative effect on the securities markets generally which may,\nin turn, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s"

To the extent that we access debt financing or issue variable interest rate instruments in the future, any increase in interest\nrates would increase our cost of borrowing and our interest expense.\nWe are currently operating in a period of economic uncertainty and capital markets disruption, which has been significantly impacted by\ngeopolitical instability and an ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Our business, financial condition and results of operations\ncould be materially adversely affected by any negative impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from the conflict in Ukraine and\ngeopolitical tensions.\nThe ongoing military conflict in Ukraine has caused broad disruption.  Although the length, impact and outcome of that military conflict in\nUkraine is highly unpredictable, it could lead to significant market and other disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices and supply\nof energy resources, instability in financial markets, higher inflation, supply chain interruptions, political and social instability, changes in consumer or\npurchaser preferences as well as increases in cyberattacks and espionage.  While we expect any direct impacts to our business to be limited, the indirect\nimpacts on the economy and on the mining industry and other industries in general could negatively affect our business and may make it more difficult\nfor us to raise equity or debt financing. In addition, the impact of other current macro-economic factors on our business, which may be exacerbated by\nthe war in Ukraine - including inflation, supply chain constraints and geopolitical events - is likely to have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe face a variety of risks related to our planned battery-graphite manufacturing business.\nWe plan to develop a battery-graphite manufacturing business that produces low-cost, high-quality, and high-margin graphite products for\nbattery manufacturers. The planned battery-graphite manufacturing business is significantly different from our historic mining operations and carries a\nnumber of risks, including, without limitation:\n●\nunanticipated liabilities or contingencies, including those related to intellectual property;\n●\nthe need for additional capital and other resources to expand into the battery-graphite manufacturing business;\n●\ncompetition from better-funded public and private companies, including from producers of synthetic graphite, and competition from\nforeign companies that are not subject to the same environmental and other regulations as the Company;\n●\ndifficulty in hiring personnel or acquiring the intellectual property rights and know-how needed for the proposed battery-graphite\nmanufacturing business; and\n●\nthe potential for interruptions in our sources of graphite prior to operation of the Coosa Graphite Deposit due to environmental risks,\ngeopolitical unrest, supply chain disruptions and transportation risks, and regulatory changes.\nEntry into a new line of business may also subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar and may lead to increased\nlitigation and regulatory risk. Further, our battery-graphite manufacturing business model and strategy are still evolving and are continually being\nreviewed and revised, and we may not be able to successfully implement our business model and strategy. We may not be able to produce graphite with\nthe characteristics needed for battery production, and we may not be able to attract a sufficiently large number of customers. Although we have gained\nexperience over the past several years, neither the Company nor any member of its management team has directly engaged in producing graphite before,\nand our lack of this specific experience may result in delays or further complications to the new business. If we are unable to successfully implement our\nnew battery-graphite manufacturing business, our revenue and profitability may not grow as we expect, our competitiveness may be materially and\nadversely affected, and our reputation and business may be harmed."

Initial\ntimetables for the development of our battery-graphite manufacturing business may not be achieved. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the\ndevelopment and implementation of our new battery-graphite manufacturing business could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe construction and operation of the Kellyton Graphite Plant is subject to delays, cost overruns, or may not produce expected benefits.\nConstruction projects similar to our plant construction are subject to broad and strict government supervision and approval procedures,\nincluding but not limited to project approvals and filings; construction, land and project planning approvals; environment protection approvals; pollution\ndischarge permits; work safety approvals; and the completion of inspection and acceptance by relevant authorities. As a result, construction and\noperation of the Kellyton Graphite Plant may be subject to administrative uncertainty, fines or the suspension of work on such projects.  Construction\ndelays related to the Kellyton Graphite Plant or failure to operate the Kellyton Graphite Plant in accordance with agreements with the State of Alabama\nand local municipalities could result in the loss of otherwise available tax credits and incentives.  \nDelays or cost overruns could also result from inaccuracies in the estimates and findings in the DFS; difficulties in negotiation of construction\ncontracts; challenges with managing contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; adverse weather conditions and natural disasters; increased\ncosts, shortages, or inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor; judicial or regulatory action; nonperformance under construction or other\nagreements; engineering or design problems; negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemic health events; work stoppages;\nenvironmental and geological conditions; or challenges with start-up activities and operational performance.  \nTo the extent we are unable to successfully complete construction on time or at all, our ability to develop the Kellyton Graphite Plant could be\nadversely affected, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is not producing any products at a commercial scale at this time. As a result, we do not currently have a reliable source of operating\ncash. If we cannot successfully transition to commercial scale production of graphite and vanadium, partner with another company that has cash\nresources, find other means of generating and/or access additional sources of private or public capital, we may not be able to remain in business.\nWe do not have a committed source of financing for the development of our graphite or vanadium projects. While we have spent approximately\n$55.3 million through December 31, 2022, the remaining capital expenditures to construct Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant are currently estimated\nat approximately $215.7 million, which amount has increased as a result of the optimization of Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant, and delays in\nconstructing the commercial scale processing facility and other cost overruns may increase that estimate. As of December 31, 2022, we have\napproximately $75.2 million in cash, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all,\nfor the remainder of the amount needed to construct Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant or develop our properties. Our inability to construct the\nKellyton Graphite Plant or develop our properties would have a material adverse effect on our future operations.\nWe have incurred losses and have had no revenue from operations since 2009, and we expect to continue to incur losses until the Kellyton\nGraphite Plant becomes operational, which is anticipated to occur in 2024 but could be subject to delays. We have no way to generate cash inflows\noutside of financing activities and we will continue to incur operating losses until we begin graphite and/or vanadium production on a scale sufficient to\ngenerate revenues to fund continuing operations, which cannot be assured. Our future production of purified graphite products is dependent on\ncompletion of the Kellyton Graphite Plant and successful implementation of graphite purification technology. Our future mining of graphite and\nvanadium is dependent upon the completion of an evaluation that will assess the amount, location and size of graphite and vanadium concentrations at\nour Coosa Graphite Deposit. We can provide no assurance that we will successfully produce graphite or vanadium on a commercial scale, that our\nproperties will be placed into production or that we will be able to continue to find, develop, acquire and finance additional mineral resources or\nreserves.

In addition, the Company’s graphite and vanadium exploration and development activities may be significantly adversely affected by\nvolatility in the price of graphite or vanadium. The success of our mining operations and ability to achieve positive cash flow is dependent on our ability\nto develop our properties and then operate them at a profit sufficient to finance further mining activities and for the acquisition and development of\nadditional properties. Any profit will necessarily be dependent upon, and affected by, the long and short-term market prices of graphite and vanadium.\nMineral prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the Company’s control such as global and regional supply and demand,\ninterest rates, exchange rates, inflation or deflation, fluctuation in the value of the United States dollar and foreign currencies, and the political and\neconomic conditions of mineral-producing countries throughout the world. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the\ncombination of these factors may result in the Company’s graphite and vanadium activities not producing an adequate return on invested capital to be\nprofitable or viable. In addition, a significant, sustained drop in graphite and vanadium prices would cause us to recognize impairment of the carrying\nvalue of our graphite and vanadium or other assets, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial conditions and results of operations\nOur operations are subject to environmental risks.\nWe are required to comply with environmental protection laws, regulations and permitting requirements in the United States, and we anticipate\nthat we will be required to continue to do so in the future in connection with the construction and operations at our Kellyton Graphite Plant and Coosa\nGraphite Deposit. We have expended significant resources, both financial and managerial, to comply with environmental protection laws, regulations\nand permitting requirements, and we anticipate that we will be required to continue to do so in the future. The material environmental laws and\nregulations within the U.S. include the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Federal Land Policy Management Act, National Park\nSystem Mining Regulations Act, the State Mined Land Reclamation Acts, and State Department of Environmental Quality regulations, and the rules and\nregulations of the NEPA, the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) as applicable.\nWe cannot predict what environmental legislation, regulation or policy will be enacted or adopted in the future or how future laws and\nregulations will be administered or interpreted. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation, generally, is toward stricter standards, and\nthis trend is likely to continue in the future. This recent trend includes, without limitation, laws and regulations relating to air and water quality,\nreclamation, waste handling and disposal, the protection of certain species, the preservation of certain lands, and epidemics and pandemics to the degree\nthey impact us or our activities. These regulations may require the acquisition of permits or other authorizations for certain activities. These laws and\nregulations may also limit or prohibit activities on certain lands. Compliance with more stringent laws and regulations, as well as potentially more\nvigorous enforcement policies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may necessitate significant capital outlays, may materially affect our results of\noperations and business or may cause material changes or delay to our intended activities.\nOur operations may require additional analysis in the future including environmental, cultural and social impact and other related studies.\nCertain activities require the submission and approval of environmental impact assessments. Environmental assessments of proposed projects carry a\nheightened degree of responsibility for companies and their directors, officers and employees. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to\nobtain or maintain all necessary permits that may be required to continue our operation or exploration of our properties or, if feasible, to commence\ndevelopment, construction or operation of production or mining facilities at such properties on terms which enable operations to be conducted at\neconomically justifiable costs. If we are unable to obtain or maintain permits or water rights for development of our properties or otherwise fail to\nmanage adequately future environmental issues, our operations could be materially and adversely affected."

In the production and marketing of graphite\nand vanadium, there are a number of producing entities, some of which are government controlled and most of which are significantly larger and better\ncapitalized than we are. Many of these organizations also have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and distribution resources than\nwe have.  If we are unable to compete effectively in any of these areas, our ability to operate could be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause we have limited capital, inherent manufacturing and mining risks pose a significant threat to us compared with our larger competitors.\nBecause we have limited capital, we may be unable to withstand significant losses that can result from risks associated with manufacturing and\nmining activities, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, flooding, earthquake, pandemics, interruptions due to weather conditions and\nother acts of nature that larger competitors could more easily withstand. Such risks could result in damage to or destruction of our infrastructure and\nproduction facilities, as well as to adjacent properties, personal injury, environmental damage and processing and production delays, causing monetary\nlosses and possible legal liability.\nWe are dependent on experts and subject to workforce factors that could affect operations.\nOur business and mineral exploration and processing programs depend upon our ability to employ the services of geologists, engineers and\nother experts. In operating our business and in order to continue our operations, we compete with other mineral exploration and processing companies\nand businesses for the services of professionals. Our ability to maintain and expand our business and continue our development of the Kellyton Graphite\nPlant and the Coosa Graphite Deposit may be impaired if we are unable to continue to engage those parties currently providing services and expertise to\nus or identify and engage other qualified personnel to do so in their place.\nWe must attract, train and retain a workforce to meet future needs for the development of the Kellyton Graphite Plant and the Coosa Graphite\nDeposit.  To retain key employees, we may face increased compensation costs, including potential new incentive stock grants and there can be no\nassurance that the incentive measures we implement will be successful in helping us retain our key personnel.  Increased costs and reduced supply of\nlabor may lead to operating challenges.  Failure to hire and adequately train employees and retain key employees may adversely affect the Company’s\nability to manage and operate its business.\nOur patent and other protective measures may not adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we may be infringing on the rights of\nothers.\nOur intellectual property is directed to our proprietary rights to an improved method for the purification of graphite concentrate. We have filed\npatent applications in the United States, and we generally enter into confidentiality and invention agreements with our employees and consultants. We\ncan make no assurances that a patent application will result in an issued patent and our failure to secure rights under the patent application may limit our\nability to protect the intellectual property rights at the core of our proposed graphite production business. In addition, such patent protection and\nagreements and various other measures we take to protect our intellectual property from use by others may not be effective for various reasons generally\napplicable to patents and their granting and enforcement. In addition, the costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention\nagreements or other intellectual property rights may be expensive. Our inability to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights or gain a\ncompetitive advantage from such rights could harm our ability to generate revenues and, as a result, our business and operations.\nWe could also become subject to litigation claiming that our intellectual property or proprietary information infringes the rights of a third party.\nIn that event, we could incur substantial defense costs and, if such litigation is successful, we could be required to pay the claimant damages and\nroyalties for our past and future use of such intellectual property or proprietary information, or we could be prohibited from using it in the future, which\ncould prevent us from pursuing our graphite production business, or we could be required to modify our process and facilities.

The continued spread of COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of capital and\nadversely impacts our access to capital. If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines,\ngovernment actions, facility closures or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations will likely be impacted. In\naddition, our costs may increase as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. These cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by\ninsurance.  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and the extent to which the pandemic may impact our business, financial condition, liquidity,\nresults of operations and prospects will depend highly on future developments, which are very uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.\nThe timing and amount of compensation relating to the revocation of the mining and exploration licenses for our Temrezli and Sefaatli projects is\nyet to be determined.\nOn June 20, 2018, the General Directorate of Mining Affairs, a department of the Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, notified\nthe Company that the mining and exploration licenses for its Temrezli and Sefaatli projects located in Turkey had been revoked and potential\ncompensation would be proffered. In 2018, Westwater reached out on numerous occasions to the Turkish government to resolve this dispute amicably,\nto reinstate the licenses and to remedy its unlawful actions, but to no avail. As a result, on December 13, 2018 Westwater filed a Request for Arbitration\nagainst the Republic of Turkey before the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”), pursuant to the Treaty between the\nUnited States of America and the Republic of Turkey concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments, seeking damages and\nother relief. On December 21, 2018, ICSID advised that it had formally “registered” the Request for Arbitration. On March 11, 2020, Turkey filed a\nrequest to bifurcate the arbitration proceeding, and on March 30, 2020, Westwater filed a response in opposition to Turkey’s request for bifurcation. On\nApril 28, 2020, the arbitral tribunal denied Turkey’s bifurcation request. On May 13, 2020, Turkey filed with the arbitral tribunal a request, which\nWestwater elected not to oppose, to extend the date on which their Counter-Memorial must be filed (and to change dates for subsequent pleadings as\nwell as document production and witness identification deadlines), which the tribunal approved on June 3, 2020. As a result of these decisions by the\ntribunal, Turkey filed its Counter-Memorial on September 14, 2020. The hearing on the substantive issues and damages occurred in the third quarter of\n2021 and the Company is awaiting a formal ruling on the matter.\nWhile the Company intends to continue to seek full and fair compensation for the licenses through arbitration with ICSID, the timing of such\ncompensation cannot yet be determined. In addition, the Company can provide no assurance about the amount of compensation, if any, and an adverse\nresult could have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial conditions and results of operations."

There is no assurance that we can establish the existence of any Mineral Reserve on the property in\ncommercially exploitable quantities. Until we can do so, we cannot earn any revenues from the property, and if we do not do so, and are unable to\nenter into a joint venture or sell the property, we will lose all of the funds that we expend on exploration. If we do not discover any Mineral Reserves\nin a commercially exploitable quantity, our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe have established Mineral Resources at the Coosa Graphite Deposit but have not established any Mineral Reserves according to recognized\nreserve guidelines, nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to do so. A Mineral Reserve is defined by the SEC in its S-K 1300 as that part of\na mineral deposit, which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. There is no guarantee that a\ndeposit will also be a \"reserve\" that meets the requirements of S-K 1300.  If Mineral Reserves on our property are established in the future, there can be\nno assurance that the property can be developed into a producing mine to extract those minerals. Both mineral exploration and development involve a\nhigh degree of risk.\nExploration and development of graphite and vanadium properties are risky and subject to great uncertainties.\nThe exploration for and development of graphite and vanadium deposits involve significant risks. It is impossible to ensure that the current and\nfuture exploration programs on our existing properties will establish reserves. Whether an ore body will be commercially viable depends on a number of\nfactors, including, but not limited to: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; graphite and  vanadium\nprices, which cannot be predicted and which have been highly volatile in the past; mining, processing and transportation costs; perceived levels of\npolitical risk and the willingness of lenders and investors to provide project financing; availability of labor, labor costs and possible labor strikes;\navailability of drilling rigs; and governmental regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land\nuse, importing and exporting materials, foreign exchange, environmental protection, employment, worker safety, transportation, and reclamation and\nclosure obligations. Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable deposits of minerals and there can be no\nassurance that any of our exploration stage properties will be commercially mineable or can be brought into production.\nThe extent of the Company’s vanadium mineral reserves at the Coosa Graphite Deposit is unknown and may not be in sufficient quantities to make\nits extraction and processing economically feasible.\nThe Company discovered vanadium concentrations at the Coosa Graphite Deposit and is executing an exploration plan to further investigate\nthe size and extent of those concentrations. While there can be no assurance that the extent of those concentrations will end up being economically\nfeasible, even if the Company finds vanadium in sufficient quantities to warrant recovery, it ultimately may not be recoverable. Finally, even if any\nvanadium is recoverable, the Company does not know whether recovery can be done at a profit. Our vanadium activities are highly prospective, face a\nhigh risk of failure and may not result in any benefit to the Company.\nPotential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new mineral exploration ventures and the high rate of failure of\nsuch ventures. The likelihood of success of the Company’s vanadium exploration activities must be considered in light of the potential problems,\nexpenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the exploration of new mineral properties. These potential problems\ninclude, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to exploration and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. The\nexpenditures to be made by the Company in the exploration of its new vanadium claims may not result in the discovery of new vanadium deposits.\nProblems such as unusual or unexpected formations and other conditions are encountered in new mineral exploration and often result in unsuccessful\nexploration efforts. If the results of the Company’s new exploration ventures do not reveal viable commercial mineralization, it may decide to abandon\nits claims. If this happens, the Company will not benefit from any of the expenditures it will incur in pursuing the claims."

While applicable mining laws usually provide for rights of access to the\nsurface for the purpose of carrying on mining activities, the enforcement of such rights through the courts can be costly and time consuming. It may be\nnecessary for the Company to negotiate surface access or to purchase the surface rights if long-term access is required. There can be no guarantee that,\ndespite having the right at law to access the surface and carry-on mining activities, the Company will be able to negotiate satisfactory agreements with\nany such existing landowners/occupiers for such access or purchase such surface rights, and therefore it may be unable to carry out planned exploration\nor mining activities at the Coosa Graphite Deposit. In addition, in circumstances where such access is denied, or no agreement can be reached, the\nCompany may need to rely on the assistance of local officials or the courts in such jurisdiction, the outcomes of which cannot be predicted with any\ncertainty. The inability of the Company to secure surface access or purchase required surface rights could materially and adversely affect the timing,\ncost or overall ability of the Company to develop any mineral deposits it may locate at the Coosa Graphite Deposit.\nBecause mineral exploration and development activities are inherently risky, we may be exposed to environmental liabilities and other dangers. If\nwe are unable to maintain adequate insurance, or liabilities exceed the limits of our insurance policies, we may be unable to continue operations.\nThe business of mineral exploration and extraction involves a high degree of risk. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed\ninto production. Unusual or unexpected formations, formation pressures, fires, power outages, labor disruptions, flooding, explosions, cave-ins,\nlandslides and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labor are some of the risks involved in extraction operations and the\nconduct of exploration programs. Previous mining operations may have caused environmental damage at certain of our properties. It may be difficult or\nimpossible to assess the extent to which such damage was caused by us or by the activities of previous operators, in which case, any indemnities and\nexemptions from liability may be ineffective.\nAlthough we carry property and liability insurance with respect to our mineral development and exploration operations, we may become\nsubject to liability for damage to life and property, environmental damage, cave-ins or hazards against which we cannot insure or against which we may\nelect not to insure because of cost or other business reasons. In addition, the insurance industry is undergoing change and premiums are increasing.\nMaterial uninsured environmental or similar liabilities could cause us to be forced to cease operations.\nTitle to the Coosa Graphite Deposit may be subject to defects in title or other claims, which could affect our property rights and claims.\nThere are risks that title to the Coosa Graphite Deposit may be challenged or impugned. There may be valid challenges to the title of the Coosa\nGraphite Deposit which, if successful, could impair development or operations. This is particularly the case because we hold our interest solely through\nleases, as such interest is substantially based on contract as opposed to a direct interest in the property.\nThe lease agreements pursuant to which the Company has interests in the Coosa Graphite Deposit provide that the Company must make a\nseries of cash payments over certain time periods. Failure by the Company to make such payments in a timely fashion may result in the Company losing\nits interest in the Coosa Graphite Deposit. There can be no assurance that the Company will have, or be able to obtain, the necessary financial resources\nto be able to maintain the lease agreements in good standing, or to be able to comply with all of its obligations thereunder, which could result in the\nCompany forfeiting its interest in the Coosa Graphite Deposit."

During 2022, the sale price of\nour common stock ranged from a high of $2.41 per share to a low of $0.78 per share. Volatility in our stock price can be driven by many factors\nincluding, but not limited to, general market conditions, market conditions in the energy materials industry, announcements that we may make regarding\nour business plans or strategy, including announcements concerning our anticipated battery-graphite business, the substantial increase in the sale and\nissuance of shares of our common stock to finance our operations and the accuracy of expectations and predictions of financial analysts and the market\nas they pertain to our future business prospects. In addition, the price of our common stock may increase or decrease substantially for reasons unrelated\nto our operating performance or prospects. If our common stock continues to experience substantial price volatility, any shares investors purchase may\nrapidly lose some or substantially all of their value.\nShareholders of a public company sometimes bring securities class action suits against the company following periods of instability in the\nmarket price of that company’s securities.  If we were involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount of our management’s attention\nand other resources from our business and operations, which could harm our results of operations and require us to incur significant expenses to defend\nthe suit.  Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future.  In\naddition, if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nFurthermore, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or otherwise use our common stock as consideration is impacted by the\nprice of our common stock.  A low stock price may adversely impact our ability to fund our operating and growth plans, including Phase I of the\nKellyton Graphite Plant, which would harm our business and prospects.\nThe Company has no history of paying dividends on its common stock, and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe Company has not previously paid dividends on its common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our available cash, if\nany, for use as working capital and for other general corporate purposes.

AGP executed a land\nlease with the Lake Martin Area Industrial Development Authority, providing AGP rights to approximately 70 acres to construct and operate the\nKellyton Graphite Plant.  Westwater plans to develop the Kellyton Graphite Plant in two phases (Phases I and II).  \nConstruction activities for Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant began in the fourth quarter of 2021 and will continue in 2023.  The Company\nexpects to begin testing and commissioning Phase I in late 2023, and first production to occur in the first half of 2024, subject to securing the additional\nfunding to complete construction.  Additionally, we expect to spend the additional capital necessary related to the Phase I optimization in 2024 and are\ntargeting completion of this optimization and increasing the planned throughput and production in the second half of 2024. For more developments of\nconstruction items see Item 1, Description of Business.\nA plan and design for Phase II is in place at a pre-feasibility level (“PFS”). The future estimated costs to develop and expected production for\neach phase of the Kellyton Graphite Plant development is based on Westwater’s completed DFS, as optimized for Phase I, and the PFS for Phase II, also\nas optimized.  The estimated economics for both Phase I and Phase II, assume that graphite concentrate will be purchased from a third-party rather than\nassuming any potential production from the Coosa Graphite Deposit.\nProduction Pilot Operations\nThe Company completed its pilot program in 2021 and produced approximately 13 metric tonnes of battery-grade graphite products.  During\nthe pilot scale program, graphite concentrates were purified and converted into advanced battery-grade graphite products.  The majority of the pilot\nprogram was performed at contracted laboratories. The purified material was manufactured into our three products, purified micronized graphite, coated\nspherical purified graphite and delaminated expanded graphite. The results of the pilot program were used to inform the results of the Company’s DFS,\nand to provide samples to potential customers. The Company continues to operate its pilot program to produce additional product samples for potential\ncustomers as needed.\nProject Development Plan\nPhase I: After testing and commissioning is completed, the Kellyton Graphite Plant is now expected to have production capacity of\napproximately 7,500 mt of ULTRA-CSPG™ and 8,500 mt of SPG fines, annually. Graphite concentrate feedstock is anticipated to be supplied from\noutside sources until at least 2028.\nPhase II: Upon completion of Phase II, the Company now expects to have annual production capacity of approximately 40,500 mt of ULTRA-\nCSPG™ and 46,000 mt of SPG fines.\nCOOSA GRAPHITE DEPOSIT\nThrough its acquisition of Alabama Graphite, Westwater gained lease rights to a graphite exploration project at the Coosa Graphite Deposit.\nThe deposit is situated in east-central Alabama, approximately 50 miles southeast of the city of Birmingham and approximately 30 miles west of\nKellyton, Alabama.  The Coosa Graphite Deposit is located near Rockford Alabama at 32 ° 54’ 30” North and 86 ° 24’ 00” West and is currently in the\nexploration stage.\nGeneral. The Coosa Graphite Deposit is situated in east-central Alabama, near the western end of Coosa County. The Coosa Graphite Deposit\nis located near the southwestern-most extent of the Alabama Graphite Belt.\nThe Property. The Coosa Graphite Deposit is comprised of a lease of privately-owned mineral rights from a single landowner covering an\noverall area of approximately 41,965 acres (approximately 65.6 square miles). The various property parcels that comprise the lease are contiguous with\neach other, except for a few small and isolated parcels that are situated in the far south part of the project area. The lease has a series of five-year terms\n(commencing August 1, 2012) that are not to exceed 70 years in total. Under the terms of the lease Alabama Graphite is required to make annual\npayments of $10,000"

Alabama Graphite is obligated to pay the owner of the mineral estate a net smelter return\nroyalty of 2.00% for any production and sale of graphite, vanadium and other minerals derived from the leased lands. There is a further obligation to pay\na 0.50% net smelter return royalty, not to exceed $150,000, and make payments of $100,000 at the time of completion of a “bankable feasibility study”\nand an additional $150,000 upon completion of “full permitting” of the leased property. These payments are payable to an unaffiliated third-party. The\nCompany does not hold any surface rights in the project area.\nAccessibility. Access to the Coosa Graphite Deposit is good. The general area of the Coosa Graphite Deposit is accessible from local and\nregional population centers via a network of paved federal, state and county two-lane highways. Various parts of the project lands are traversed by\nnumerous partially maintained dirt and gravel logging roads.\nHistory. The Coosa Graphite Deposit is situated near the southwestern end of the Alabama Graphite Belt, which is a northeast-trending group\nof graphite deposits and occurrences that are situated in the central and eastern parts of the state. The initial attempt to produce graphite mineralization\nin the Alabama Graphite Belt commenced in 1888, with efforts focusing upon prospects located to the northeast of the region of the Coosa Graphite\nDeposit. The first commercial production of graphite from deposits in the Alabama Graphite Belt was in 1899 and limited activities continued at least\ninto the 1940s. Within the lands that comprise the Coosa Graphite Deposit, graphite production was carried out at the Fixico mine, which operated\nintermittently between 1902 and 1908. Other graphite prospects in the project area were evaluated but no efforts were made to mine any other prospects\nin the project area. Alabama Graphite acquired property rights that comprise the Coosa Graphite Deposit and carried out trenching and drilling programs\nand completed an aerial geophysical survey of a portion of the project area between 2012 and 2015.\nProject Geology. The Coosa Graphite Deposit is located at the southern-most end of the Appalachian mountain range in east-central Alabama.\nWithin the Appalachian Mountains a group of Precambrian to Paleozoic age metamorphic rocks host scattered graphite deposits, in an area known as the\nAlabama Graphite Belt. At the Coosa Graphite Deposit, graphite mineralization, sometimes associated with vanadium mineralization, is hosted within\nthe Higgins Ferry Group, which is comprised of coarse to fine-grained biotite-feldspar-quartz gneiss, various quartz-muscovite and quartz-muscovite-\ngraphite schist, quartzite and altered mafic rocks. The rocks of the Higgins Ferry Group are thought to be Precambrian to Paleozoic in age. In the project\narea, graphite (and vanadium) mineralization is hosted in a series of quartz-muscovite-biotite-graphite and quartz-graphite schists that are generally\nmedium to coarse grained, and are moderately foliated and somewhat contorted. The graphitic schist units are occasionally cut by pegmatites, which are\nunmineralized with respect to graphite and vanadium. Graphite grades in the quartz-muscovite-biotite-graphite schist are generally one percent graphite\nor less, while graphite grades in the quartz-graphite schist commonly exceed one percent. The graphitic schists are moderately to strongly weathered to\ndepths that may extend 10s of feet to occasionally more than 100 feet, and can generally be considered to be surface minable.\nProject Activities. Prior to its acquisition by Westwater, Alabama Graphite carried out several exploration programs to identify and partially\ndefine the potential extent and magnitude of graphite mineralization at the Coosa Graphite Deposit, including core and sonic drilling, trenching and\nsampling, and an airborne geophysical survey. As a result of this exploration, a near-surface graphite deposit was partially defined in the central portion\nof the project area.\nPermitting Status. The Company holds an exploration license from the State of Alabama for the Coosa Graphite Deposit, and is currently\nreviewing and applying for local, State, and federal permits for future development."

The Request for Arbitration was filed as a\nresult of the Republic of Turkey’s unlawful actions against the Company’s licenses for the Temrezli and Sefaatli uranium projects owned by Westwater’s\nTurkish subsidiary Adur Madencilik Limited Sirketi (“Adur”). Specifically, in June 2018, the Turkish government cancelled all of Adur’s exploration\nand operating licenses with retroactive effect, rendering Westwater’s investment in Adur effectively worthless. While the Turkish authorities had\nvariously issued, renewed and overseen these licenses for more than a decade, in June 2018 they asserted that those licenses were issued by mistake and\nthat the Turkish government has a governmental monopoly over all uranium mining activities in Turkey, in violation of Westwater’s rights under both\nTurkish and international law. In 2018, Westwater reached out on numerous occasions to the Turkish government to resolve this dispute amicably, to\nreinstate the licenses and to remedy Turkey’s unlawful actions, but to no avail.\nAs a result, on December 13, 2018, Westwater filed before ICSID its arbitration request against the Republic of Turkey. On December 21,\n2018, ICSID registered Westwater’s Request for Arbitration.

Risk Factors” above and\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” above.\nINTRODUCTION\nWestwater Resources, Inc., originally incorporated in 1977, is an energy technology company focused on developing battery-grade natural\ngraphite materials since its acquisition of Alabama Graphite in 2018. Alabama Graphite holds mineral rights to explore and potentially mine the Coosa\nGraphite Deposit.  AGP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Westwater Resources, continued construction activities related to Phase I of the Kellyton\nGraphite Plant and in April of 2022 Alabama Graphite completed the initial drilling stage of its exploration program to further investigate the size and\nextent of both graphite and vanadium mineral concentrations at the Coosa Graphite Deposit.\nSUMMARY OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nConstruction and Financing Progress on Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant\nConstruction activities in 2022 consisted of selecting a general contractor, completing earthwork and site grading, and continuing engineering\nand design work.  In 2022, the Company also installed underground utilities, completed building foundations, and began erecting three of the five\nmanufacturing buildings of the Kellyton Graphite Plant. Construction activity during the year also included receipt of certain long-lead equipment items.\n \nIn response to increasing customer demand and market conditions, the Company has completed an optimization of the original DFS to increase\nthe expected production for Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant.  As a result of this optimization, the Company now expects production capacity for\nPhase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant of 16,000 mt per year, and expected CSPG production of 7,500 mt per year.  The Company now estimates the\ntotal costs for Phase I construction to be approximately $271 million compared to the original estimate of $202 million.  Further, the Company now\nexpects to begin testing and commissioning of Phase I in late 2023, and first production to occur in the first half of 2024, subject to securing the\nadditional funding to complete construction.  Additionally, we expect to complete the Phase I optimization in the second half of 2024 to increase the\nexpected production capacity of Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant. As of December 31, 2022, and inclusive of liabilities at December 31, 2022, the\nCompany has incurred approximately $76.4 million of the cost to construct Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant.  On March 6, 2023, the Company\nexecuted a non-binding, non-exclusive indicative term sheet with an intermediate investment bank in New York for $150 million of private debt\nfinancing that should be sufficient for the completion of Phase I construction. The transaction is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2023\nsubject to completion of due diligence and the negotiation of final terms. However, no assurance can be given regarding the assurance of closing or the\namount of the additional financing that will be available, or whether those amounts will be sufficient to meet the Company’s needs. For additional\ninformation regarding the Kellyton Graphite Plant see Item 2, Properties.\nEngagement with Potential Customers\nIn 2022, we continued to engage with potential customers. The Company is working with potential customers across a number of markets\nincluding automotive companies and lithium-ion battery manufacturers. We continue to operate our pilot program to provide new or additional samples\nat the request of potential customers. To date, the Company has executed Non-Disclosure Agreements with potential customers and has executed five\nletters of intent across multiple product lines, which are subject to customary conditions and quality and packaging specifications to be included in\nfuture"

Under the agreement,\nthe parties will work together to ensure that the ULTRA-CSPG™ that is expected to be produced at the Kellyton Graphite Processing Plant can be used\nas a high-performance anode material for the customer’s batteries.  Subject to those efforts, the parties expect to negotiate another agreement that will\nallow for the sale of potentially all graphite anode material from the Kellyton Graphite Processing Plant for those batteries.\nCoosa Graphite Deposit Technical Report Summary\nThe mineral resource estimate for the Coosa Graphite Deposit, based on 205 drill holes totaling 39,434 ft., was completed by SLR on\nNovember 30, 2022 as an Initial Assessment in accordance with S-K 1300.  For further information regarding this Technical Report Summary and the\nCoosa Graphite Deposit, refer to Item 2, Properties.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSummary\nOur net loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $11.1 million, or $0.25 per share, as compared with a net\nloss from continuing operations of $16.1 million, or $0.49 per share for the same period in 2021. The $5.0 million decrease in our net loss from\ncontinuing operations was due primarily to lower product development, arbitration costs, exploration expenses, and higher interest income; offset\npartially by increases in general and administrative expenses and a realized gain on equity securities that were sold in the fourth quarter of 2021.  \nProduct Development Expenses\nProduct development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $1.1 million, a decrease of $4.8 million compared to the prior year.\nProduct development costs for the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily relate to continued product development, product optimization costs, and\ncontinued sample production of battery-grade natural graphite products for evaluation by potential customers. Product development costs for the year\nended December 31, 2021 were primarily comprised of expenses for our definitive feasibility study related to Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant and\nour graphite processing pilot program that were both completed in 2021.\nExploration Expenses\nExploration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, were $0.8 million, a decrease of $0.3 million compared to the prior year.  The\ndecrease in exploration expenses was the result to the Company completing its initial drilling program at the Coosa Graphite Deposit in April 2022.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, were $9.9 million, an increase of approximately $1.0 million as\ncompared with 2021.  The increase is due primarily to increased personnel costs of approximately $0.8 million, as the Company continues to build its\nteam and higher costs related to the Company’s sales and marketing efforts of $0.2 million.\nArbitration Costs\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred legal and expert consulting costs of $0.1 million.  This represents a decrease\nof $2.0 million compared to the prior year due to lower legal fees for arbitration against the Republic of Turkey.  During the year ended 2021, the\nCompany incurred legal fees for the hearing on substantive issues, which was conducted during the week of September 13-17, 2021. For further\nreference, see discussion at Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K."

The decrease in mineral property expenses was due to lower payments to land and surface owners for less activity related to\nour initial drilling program at the Coosa Deposit which was completed in April 2022.\nSale of Equity Securities\nThe Company realized a $2.1 million gain on the total sale of enCore common shares during the year ended December 31, 2021.  The\nCompany originally received these common shares as consideration for the sale of its uranium business to enCore in the fourth quarter of 2020.  As of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not hold any equity investments in unaffiliated entities.\nOther Income\nOther income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $1.0 million, an increase of approximately $1.0 million compared to prior year.  The\nincrease for the year 2022 compared to prior year is due primarily to interest income of $1.1 million on our investment account; offset partially by\nforeign exchange loss adjustment of $0.1 million for our Euro Denominated bank account.  A change in the Euro to USD exchange rate of $0.01 results\nin a foreign exchange adjustment of less than $0.1 million.\nFINANCIAL POSITION\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared with $16.9 million for the prior\nyear. The $3.7 million decrease in cash used in operating activities was due primarily to decreased graphite product development, arbitration and\nexploration costs.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $52.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared with $2.1 million of cash used in\ninvesting activities for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily the result of increased capital expenditures related to Phase I of\nthe Kellyton Graphite Plant totaling $52.8 million.  The $2.1 million of cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, was\nprimarily due to capital expenditures of $3.4 million and cash deposits on long-lead equipment items of $2.7 million, both of which primarily related to\nthe construction of Phase I of Kellyton Graphite Plant; offset partially by cash received of $3.6 million, net of fees, related to the sale of enCore\ncommon shares in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared with $84.0 million in 2021.\nThe cash inflow for the year ending December 31, 2022 was from the sales of approximately 13.0 million shares of common stock through the\nCompany’s ATM Offering Agreement.  The cash inflow for the year ended December 31, 2021 was from the sales of 10.0 million shares of common\nstock through the Company’s ATM Offering Agreement totaling $49.5 million in net cash proceeds, and 6.1 million common shares sold pursuant to the\n2020 Lincoln Park PA totaling $34.6 million in net cash proceeds. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the proceeds received from sales\nof the Company’s common stock, were primarily used to advance the Company’s graphite business plan, including the construction of Phase I of the\nKellyton Graphite Plant, and general operating expenses.  The $58.1 million decrease in 2022 was primarily due to lower trading volumes and lower\naverage stock prices in 2022 compared to 2021."

During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, and through the date the consolidated financial statements are issued, the Company continued construction activities related to the\nKellyton Graphite Plant. The Company’s construction related contracts include termination provisions at the Company’s election that do not obligate the\nCompany to make payments beyond what is incurred by the third-party service provider through the date of such termination. In its going concern\nanalysis, the Company considered the construction activity and related costs through the date the consolidated financial statements are issued, and the\nCompany’s planned non-discretionary expenditures through March 31, 2024, which combined exceed the cash on hand as of the date of these\nconsolidated financial statements, excluding external funding opportunities and the Company’s current equity facilities.    \n At December 31, 2022 the Company’s cash balances were $75.2 million, inclusive of approximately 5.0 million Euros. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company sold approximately 13.0 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $25.9 million pursuant to the ATM\nOffering Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has $20.8 million remaining available for future sales under the ATM Offering Agreement\nand has 9.7 million shares of common stock available for future sales pursuant to the 2020 Lincoln Park PA.\nThe Company has historically and expects to rely on debt and equity financing to fund its operations and business plan until operations\ncommence at the Kellyton Graphite Plant. Along with evaluating the continued use of the ATM Offering Agreement and the 2020 Lincoln Park PA, the\nCompany is considering other forms of project financing to fund the construction of the Kellyton Graphite Plant, including both Phase I and Phase II.\nThe alternative sources of project financing could include, but are not limited to, project debt, convertible debt, or pursuing a partnership or joint\nventure. If funds are not available to fund the construction of Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant under the Company’s financing facilities or through\nalternative financing sources, the Company may be required to reduce or severely curtail operations, change its planned business development strategies\nrelated to the Coosa Graphite Deposit and Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant, alter the construction and commissioning timeline of Phase I of the\nKellyton Graphite Plant, or put the construction of Phase I on hold until additional funding is obtained.  If the Company is required to abandon\nconstruction and development or alter its intended long-term plans related the Kellyton Graphite Plant, the Company could be required to evaluate the\nrecoverability of its long-lived assets.    \nWhile the Company has utilized its equity facilities to advance its business plan and has been successful in the past raising funds through\nequity and debt financings as well as through the sale of non-core assets, no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available in\namounts sufficient to meet its needs, or on terms acceptable to the Company. Recent declines in the equity and debt capital markets, rising interest rates,\ninflation and generally uncertain economic conditions could significantly impact the Company’s ability to access the necessary funding to advance its\nbusiness plan.  Further, given the recent decline in the Company’s stock price, trading volume, and the decline in the equity markets, the Company’s\naccess to the available capacity on its equity financing facilities may be limited to one-third of its public float.  For additional disclosure, refer to Note 2,\nLiquidity and Going Concern to these consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K. We believe our most critical accounting policies involve those requiring the use of significant estimates and assumptions in determining\nvalues or projecting future costs."

      "text": "Table of Contents\n40\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nThe Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related\ncarrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company considers events or changes in circumstances such as, but not limited to, significant negative\nimpacts in the market price of graphite and or potential graphite products, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner to which we will use our\nlong-lived asset (or asset group), adverse social or political developments, accumulation of costs over projected budget or accumulation of costs in\nexcess of potential future cash flows of a long-lived asset (or asset group).\nImpairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the\nassets. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows or upon an estimate of fair value that may be\nreceived in an exchange transaction. Future cash flows are estimated based on quantities of recoverable minerals, expected commodity prices,\nproduction levels and operating costs of production and capital, based upon the projected remaining future graphite or vanadium production from each\nproject. Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization that is not part of the measured,\nindicated or inferred resource base, are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in\ndetermining whether the assets are impaired. The term “recoverable minerals” refers to the estimated amount of graphite or vanadium that will be\nobtained after taking into account losses during processing and treatment. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for\nwhich there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. The Company’s estimates of future\ncash flows are based on numerous assumptions and it is likely that actual future cash flows will be significantly different than the estimates, as actual\nfuture quantities of recoverable minerals, graphite prices, production levels and operating costs of production and availability and cost of capital are\neach subject to significant risks and uncertainties.\nNo impairment was recorded in 2022 or 2021.  \nInventory\nInventory consisted of raw material of natural flake graphite concentrate purchased from a non-related third party to be used in the creation of\nadditional samples for potential customers, the testing and commissioning of Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant, and future operations.  The\nCompany values the natural flake graphite concentrate at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Net realizable value represents the estimated future\nsales price of the product based on current and long-term graphite prices, less the estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale.\n Write-downs of the natural flake graphite concentrate to net realizable value are reported as a component of costs applicable to sales.  The current\nportion of inventory is determined based on the expected amounts to be processed within the next 12 months and utilize the short-term metal price\nassumption in estimating net realizable value.  Inventory not expected to be processed within the next 12 months are classified as non-current within\nother long-term assets and utilize the long-term metal price assumption in estimating net realizable value.  Costs are removed from raw materials using\nan average cost basis.\nAccounting for Government Grants\n  On June 22, 2021, AGP entered into incentive agreements with the State of Alabama and local municipalities for the siting of the Kellyton\nGraphite Plant. The incentive agreements provide certain tax credits and incentives under the Alabama Jobs Act in connection with the construction of\nthe processing facility. Additionally, in connection with and in contemplation of the incentive agreements, on July 23, 2021, AGP entered into a land\nlease with the Lake Martin Area Industrial Development Authority. The lease provides AGP rights to approximately 70 acres to construct and operate its\ncommercial graphite processing facility in Coosa County, Alabama. The lease has a term of 10-years, a nominal lease payment, and transfer of title to\nAGP at the end of the lease term. Further, the lease provides AGP the option to purchase the land for a nominal amount during the term of the lease. The\nincentive agreements and the lease are accounted for by the Company as a government grant.\nU.S. GAAP does not contain authoritative accounting standards for incentives and grants provided by governmental entities to a for-profit\nentity.

Based on facts and\ncircumstances outlined below, the Company determined it most appropriate to account for the land received from the local municipality as an in-\nsubstance government grant by analogy to International Accounting Standards 20 (“IAS 20”), Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of\nGovernment Assistance. Under the provisions of IAS 20, government grants “are assistance by government in the form of transfers of resources to an\nentity in return for past or future compliance with certain conditions relating to the operating activities of the entity.” A government grant is recognized\nwhen there is reasonable assurance that the Company will meet the terms for receiving and realizing the benefit of the grant. IAS 20 does not define\n“reasonable assurance”, however, based on certain interpretations, it is analogous to “probable” as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(“FASB”) ASC 450-20-20 under U.S. GAAP, which is the definition the Company has applied to its determination of recognizing the land grant as of\nDecember 31, 2022. Under IAS 20, government grants are recognized in earnings on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company\nrecognizes costs for which the grant is intended to compensate (i.e., qualified expenses). Further, IAS 20 permits for the recognition in earnings either\nseparately under a general heading such as other income, or as a reduction of the related expenses. The Company has elected to recognize government\ngrant income separately within other income to present a clearer distinction in its financial statements between its operating income and the amount of\nnet income resulting from the land grant.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company realized the fair value of the land of $1.4 million as an increase to Property, plant, and equipment with\na corresponding obligation recorded in Other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The land represents a non-depreciable asset on the\nCompany’s consolidated balance sheet and will evaluate the land for impairment according to its policy on long-lived assets discussed above. The\ncorresponding obligation recorded in Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet will be amortized to other income over the life of the\nKellyton Graphite Plant once placed in service.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nSmaller reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item.\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nWestwater Resources, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Westwater Resources, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the\nrelated consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred\nto as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated\nfinancial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then\nended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern Uncertainty\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in\nNote 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has last recorded revenues from operations in 2009 and has relied on equity financings,\ndebt financings, and asset sales to fund operations.

Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not\ninclude any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company\nis not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to\nobtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made\nby management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable\nbasis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2)\ninvolved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ Moss Adams LLP\nDenver, Colorado\nMarch 6, 2023\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2017."

      "text": "Table of Contents\n47\n1.\nTHE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company\nWestwater Resources, Inc., originally incorporated in 1977, is an energy technology company focused on developing battery-grade natural\ngraphite materials after its acquisition of Alabama Graphite in 2018. Alabama Graphite holds mineral rights to explore and potentially mine the Coosa\nGraphite Deposit. AGP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Westwater Resources, is currently constructing Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant to process\nnatural flake graphite concentrate into active anode material used in the lithium-ion battery.  AGP hold rights to approximately 70 acres to construct and\noperate the Kellyton Graphite Plant in Coosa County, Alabama.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“U.S.”) and include the accounts of Westwater Resources, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions\nhave been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. “U.S. GAAP” requires\nmanagement to make certain estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates included in the preparation of the financial statements\nare related to asset retirement obligations; estimates of recoverable inventories; write-down of inventory; stock-based compensation and asset\nimpairment, including estimates used to derive future cash flows or market value associated with those assets.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nManagement considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The\nCompany maintains cash deposits in excess of federally insured limits. Management monitors the soundness of the financial institution and believe the\nrisk is negligible.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nFacilities and Equipment\nExpenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and\nrecorded at cost. The facilities and equipment are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the assets. During the periods that the\nCompany’s facilities are not in production, depreciation of its facilities and equipment is suspended as the assets are not in service.\nMineral Properties\nMineral rights acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred, and exploration costs are expensed as incurred. When management determines\nthat a mineral right can be economically developed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the costs then incurred to develop such property will be capitalized.\n During the periods that the Company’s facilities are not in production, depletion of its mineral interests, permits, licenses and development properties is\nsuspended as the assets are not in service. If mineral properties are subsequently abandoned or impaired, any non-depleted costs will be charged to loss\nin that period."

Depreciation\non other property is computed based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Gain or loss\non disposal of such assets is recorded as other income or expense upon disposition of such assets.\nInventory\nInventory consisted of approximately 603 metric tons of raw material of natural flake graphite concentrate provided by a third-party vendor\ntotaling $0.8 million as of December 31, 2022.  The Company values the natural flake graphite concentrate at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\n Net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price of the product based on current and long-term graphite prices, less the estimated costs to\ncomplete production and bring the product to sale.  Write-downs of the natural flake graphite concentration to net realizable value are reported as a\ncomponent of costs applicable to sales.  The current portion of inventory is determined based on the expected amounts to be processed within the next\n12 months and utilize the short-term metal price assumption in estimating net realizable value.  Inventory not expected to be processed within the next\n12 months are classified as non-current within other long-term assets and utilize the long-term metal price assumption in estimating net realizable value.\n Costs are removed from raw materials using an average cost basis.\nAccounting for Government Grants\nU.S. GAAP does not contain authoritative accounting standards for incentives and grants provided by governmental entities to a for-profit\nentity. Absent authoritative accounting standards, interpretative guidance issued and commonly applied by financial statement preparers allows for the\nselection of accounting policies amongst acceptable alternatives. Based on facts and circumstances outlined below, the Company determined it most\nappropriate to account for the land received from the local municipality as an in-substance government grant by analogy to International Accounting\nStandards 20 (“IAS 20”), Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance. Under the provisions of IAS 20, government\ngrants “are assistance by government in the form of transfers of resources to an entity in return for past or future compliance with certain conditions\nrelating to the operating activities of the entity.” A government grant is recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will meet the\nterms for receiving and realizing the benefit of the grant. IAS 20 does not define “reasonable assurance”, however, based on certain interpretations, it is\nanalogous to “probable” as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 450-20-20 under U.S. GAAP, which is the definition the\nCompany has applied to its determination of recognizing the land grant as of December 31, 2021. Under IAS 20, government grants are recognized in\nearnings on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company recognizes costs for which the grant is intended to compensate (i.e. qualified\nexpenses). Further, IAS 20 permits for the recognition in earnings either separately under a general heading such as other income, or as a reduction of\nthe related expenses. The Company has elected to recognize government grant income separately within other income to present a clearer distinction in\nits financial statements between its operating income and the amount of net income resulting from the land grant.\nFor further information related to government grants recognized by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2021, see Note 3 to\nthese consolidated financial statements.\nAsset Impairment\nThe Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related\ncarrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company considers events or changes in circumstances such as, but not limited to, significant negative\nimpacts in the market price of graphite and or potential graphite products, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner to which we will use our\nlong-lived asset (or asset group), adverse social or political developments, accumulation of costs over projected budget or accumulation of costs in\nexcess of potential future cash flows of a long-lived asset (or asset group)."

An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows or upon an estimate of fair value that may be\nreceived in an exchange transaction. Future cash flows are estimated based on quantities of recoverable minerals, expected commodity prices,\nproduction levels and operating costs of production and capital, based upon the projected remaining future mineral production from each project.\nExisting proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization that is not part of the measured,\nindicated or inferred resource base, are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in\ndetermining whether the assets are impaired. The term “recoverable minerals” refers to the estimated amount of mineral that will be obtained after\ntaking into account losses during processing and treatment. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are\nidentifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. The Company’s estimates of future cash flows are\nbased on numerous assumptions and it is likely that actual future cash flows will be significantly different than the estimates, as actual future quantities\nof recoverable minerals, mineral prices, production levels and operating costs of production and availability and cost of capital are each subject to\nsignificant risks and uncertainties.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nU.S. GAAP defines “fair value” as the price that would be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement date (exit price) and establishes a fair-value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair\nvalue using the following definitions (from highest to lowest priority):\n●\nLevel 1 — Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or\nliabilities.\n●\nLevel 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly\nor indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and\nliabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation\nor other means.\n●\nLevel 3 — Prices or valuation techniques requiring inputs that are both significant to the fair-value measurement and unobservable.\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The\nCompany continually monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions with which it invests. Periodically throughout\nthe year, the Company has maintained balances in various U.S. operating accounts in excess of U.S. federally insured limits."

The Company last recorded revenues from\noperations in 2009. Since 2009, the Company has relied on equity financings, debt financings and asset sales to fund its operations. During the year\nended December 31, 2022, and through the date the consolidated financial statements are issued, the Company continued construction activities related\nto the Kellyton Graphite Plant. The Company’s construction related contracts include termination provisions at the Company’s election that do not\nobligate the Company to make payments beyond what is incurred by the third-party service provider through the date of such termination.  In its going\nconcern analysis, the Company considered the construction activity and related costs through the date the consolidated financial statements are issued,\nand the Company’s planned non-discretionary expenditures through March 31, 2024, which combined exceed the cash on hand as of the date of these\nconsolidated financial statements, excluding external funding opportunities and the Company’s current equity facilities.    \n At December 31, 2022 the Company’s cash balances were $75.2 million, inclusive of approximately 5.0 million Euros. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company sold approximately 13.0 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $25.9 million pursuant to the ATM\nOffering Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has $20.8 million remaining available for future sales under the ATM Offering Agreement\nand has 9.7 million shares of common stock available for future sales pursuant to the 2020 Lincoln Park PA.\nThe Company has historically and expects to rely on debt and equity financing to fund its operations and business plan until operations\ncommence at the Kellyton Graphite Plant. Along with evaluating the continued use of the ATM Offering Agreement and the 2020 Lincoln Park PA, the\nCompany is considering other forms of project financing to fund the construction of the Kellyton Graphite Plant, including both Phase I and Phase II.\nThe alternative sources of project financing could include, but are not limited to, project debt, convertible debt, or pursuing a partnership or joint\nventure. If funds are not available to fund the construction of Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant under the Company’s financing facilities or through\nalternative financing sources, the Company may be required to reduce or severely curtail operations, change its planned business development strategies\nrelated to the Coosa Graphite Deposit and Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant, alter the construction and commissioning timeline of Phase I of the\nKellyton Graphite Plant, or put the construction of Phase I on hold until additional funding is obtained.  If the Company is required to abandon\nconstruction and development or alter its intended long-term plans related the Kellyton Graphite Plant, the Company could be required to evaluate the\nrecoverability of its long-lived assets.    \nWhile the Company has utilized its equity facilities to advance its business plan and has been successful in the past raising funds through\nequity and debt financings as well as through the sale of non-core assets, no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available in\namounts sufficient to meet its needs, or on terms acceptable to the Company. Recent declines in the equity and debt capital markets, rising interest rates,\ninflation and generally uncertain economic conditions could significantly impact the Company’s ability to access the necessary funding to advance its\nbusiness plan.  Further, given the recent decline in the Company’s stock price, trading volume, and the decline in the equity markets, the Company’s\naccess to the available capacity on its equity financing facilities may be limited to one-third of its public float.  \nWhen considering the above events and conditions in the aggregate, the Company believes such events and conditions raise substantial doubt\nabout its ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these financial statements were issued."

Additionally, in connection with and in contemplation of the incentive agreements, on July 23, 2021, AGP entered into a land\nlease with the Lake Martin Area Industrial Development Authority. The lease provides AGP rights to approximately 70 acres to construct and operate its\ncommercial graphite processing facility in Coosa County, Alabama. The lease has a term of 10-years, a nominal lease payment, and transfer of title to\nAGP at the end of the lease term. Further, the lease provides AGP the option to purchase the land for a nominal amount during the term of the lease. The\nincentive agreements and the lease are accounted for by the Company as a government grant; whereby the Company realized the fair value of the land\nof $1.4 million as an increase to Property, plant, and equipment with a corresponding obligation recorded in Other long-term liabilities in the\nconsolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021. The land represents a non-depreciable asset on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

There was an\nincrease in the net deferred tax assets, net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”), equity-based compensation and exploration spending on mineral\nproperties.\nIn December 2017, the United States enacted comprehensive tax reform legislation known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’ that, among other\nthings, reduces the U.S. Federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and implements a territorial tax system, but imposes an alternative ‘base\nerosion and anti-abuse tax’ (‘BEAT’), and incremental tax on global intangible low tax foreign income (‘GILTI’) effective January 1, 2018. The\nCompany has selected an accounting policy with respect to both the new BEAT and GILTI rules to compute the related taxes in the period the Company\nbecome subject to these rules. There were no inclusions of either taxes during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nBecause the Company does not believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized, the Company continues to\nrecord a 100% valuation against the net deferred tax assets.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $271.3 million which expire from 2023 to\nindefinite availability.

This does not impact losses\nincurred in years ended in 2017 or earlier. At December 31, 2022, the Company had U.S. capital loss carryforwards of approximately $106.1 million,\nwhich expire in 2026 if not utilized. In addition, at December 31, 2022, the Company had Australian net operating loss carryforwards of $15.2 million,\nincluding approximately $13.3 million associated with the Anatolia Transaction which are available indefinitely, subject to continuing to meet relevant\nstatutory tests. In Turkey, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $3.4 million, which expire from 2023 to 2025.\nFederal and state laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of NOL carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for income\ntax purposes, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). Pursuant to IRC Section 382, annual use of the Company’s NOL\ncarryforwards may be limited in the event a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% occurs within a three-year period.   Following the\nissuance of the Company’s Common Stock in 2001, the Neutron merger in 2012, the Anatolia Transaction in 2015 and the Alabama Graphite acquisition\nin 2018, the ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards will be severely limited on an annual and aggregate basis.  A formal Section 382 study\nwould be required to determine the actual allowable usage of US net operating loss carryforwards.  However, it is possible that past ownership changes\nwill result in the inability to utilize a significant portion of the Company’s NOL carryforward that was generated prior to any change of control.  The\nCompany’s ability to use its remaining NOL carryforwards may be further limited if the Company experiences an IRC Section 382 ownership change in\nconnection with future changes in the Company’s stock ownership.  Based on information currently available, the Company currently estimates that\n$211.9 million of the U.S. net operating losses will not be able to be utilized and have reduced the Company’s deferred tax asset accordingly. This\nresulted in a decrease in the valuation allowance.\nFor financial reporting purposes, loss from operations before income taxes consists of the following components:\nFor the year ended December 31, \n    \n2022\n    \n2021\n(thousands of dollars)\nUnited States\n$\n(11,082)\n$\n(16,103)\nAustralia\n \n(5)\n \n(6)\nTurkey\n \n(34)\n \n(35)\n$\n(11,121)\n$\n(16,144)\nA reconciliation of expected income tax on net income at statutory rates is as follows:\nYear ended December 31,\n    \n2022\n    \n2021\n(thousands of dollars)\nNet loss\n$\n(11,121)\n$\n(16,144)\nStatutory tax rate\n \n21%\n \n21%\nTax recovery at statutory rate\n \n(2,335)\n \n(3,390)\nState tax rate\n(672)\n(1,173)\nForeign tax rate\n \n(1)\n \n(2)\nChange in U.S. tax rates\n \n(32)\n \n(759)\nOther adjustments\n \n180\n \n97\nOperating loss carryforward adjustment\n \n685\n \n(1,409)\nOperating loss Section 382 adjustment\n \n110\n \n(7)\nNondeductible expenses and other permanent items\n \n19\n \n(78)\nSale of Uranium Entities\n—\n(799)\nChange in valuation allowance\n \n2,046\n \n7,520\nIncome tax expense (recovery)\n$\n—\n$\n—\nThe Company does not have any uncertain tax positions.

The Company evaluates the status of current environmental laws and their potential impact on current operating costs and accrual for\nfuture costs. The Company believes its operations are materially compliant with current, applicable environmental regulations.\nAt any given time, the Company may enter into negotiations to settle outstanding legal proceedings and any resulting accruals will be estimated\nbased on the relevant facts and circumstances applicable at that time. We do not expect that such settlements will, individually or in the aggregate, have\na material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nFor details on current legal proceedings see Item 3, Legal Proceedings.\n10. LEASES\nThe Company’s lease portfolio consists of an operating lease for the corporate office, storage space and equipment. The corporate office lease\nhas a remaining lease term of 0.6 years and includes an option to extend the lease for 3 years. Under our corporate office lease, we are required to\nreimburse the lessor each month for common use expenses such as maintenance and security services. Because these amounts are variable from year\nto year and not specifically set in the lease terms, they are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and related lease liability, but rather\nexpensed in the period incurred.\nThe Company is party to several leases that have terms that are less than a year in length. These include leases for land used in exploration\nactivities, office equipment, machinery, office space, storage and other. The Company has elected the short-term lease exemption allowed under the new\nleasing standards, whereby leases with initial terms of one year or less are not capitalized and instead expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm. In addition, the Company holds several leases related to mineral exploration and production to which it has not applied the new leasing standard.\nLeases to explore or use minerals and similar nonregenerative resources are specifically excluded by ASC 842, “Leases.”\nThe right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease\npayments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present\nvalue of lease payments over the lease term using a discount rate of 9.5%. This rate is the Company’s estimated incremental borrowing rate at the lease\ncommencement date."

The tribunal\ndetermined that Westwater’s investment in Turkey was protected by Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments (the “Treaty”), and that\nTurkey’s cancellation of Company’s licenses amounted to an expropriation of Westwater’s investment in violation of Turkey’s obligations under the\nTreaty. The tribunal disagreed with Westwater’s projections of what its investment was worth and how much the investment would have returned if\nTurkey had not cancelled the licenses. The tribunal’s award requires Turkey to pay Westwater a total of approximately $1.3 million in damages, to\nreimburse Westwater for its fees, expenses and costs of the arbitration amounting to approximately $3.7 million, and to pay interest in an amount yet to\nbe determined.\nAs of December 31, 2022, Westwater has not recognized the tribunal’s award in its consolidated financial statements.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its filings\nwith the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information\nis accumulated and communicated to management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management has recognized that any\ncontrols and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives,\nand management is required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures.\nDuring the fiscal period covered by this report, the Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer of the Company, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). Based on that\nevaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in\nRules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records\nthat, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\nThe Company’s management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2022. This evaluation was based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.\nTherefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nBased on management’s evaluation under the COSO 2013 framework, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was\neffective as of December 31, 2022.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent public accounting firm regarding internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s independent public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the\nSEC that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.\nChanges in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nWe have commenced initiatives to improve our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system.  We believe this new system will enhance our\ninternal control over financial reporting due to increased automation.  We will continue to monitor our internal control over financial reporting for\neffectiveness throughout the transition.  \nIn November 2022, we implemented a new payroll system that is hosted by an external service provider.  As a result of this implementation, we\nreplaced internal controls that were previously considered effective with new or modified controls that are also effective.\nExcept for changes in internal controls that we have made related to the integration of the new payroll system and our continuous monitoring of\nthe new ERP system, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that\nhave materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.

For a complete description of the terms and provisions of such\nsecurities, refer to the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Restated Certificate of Incorporation”) and Amended and Restated\nBylaws (the “Amended and Restated Bylaws”), each of which is included as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this exhibit is\na part. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to these documents.\nDescription of Common Stock\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share. As of\nDecember 31, 2019, there were 3,339,541 shares of our common stock issued and 3,339,380 shares of our common stock outstanding, all of which\nare fully paid and non-assessable. As of December 31, 2019, there were 37,786 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding\noptions, 197,622 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants, including warrants to purchase 182,515 shares of our\ncommon stock held by Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, and as of December 31, 2019, 45,886 shares of common stock reserved for future\nissuance under our 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended.\nEach share of our common stock is entitled to one vote for all purposes and cumulative voting is not permitted in the election of directors.\nAccordingly, the holders of more than fifty percent of all of the outstanding shares of our common stock can elect all of the directors. Matters to be\nvoted upon by the holders of our common stock require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at a stockholders meeting at which a\nquorum is present.\nThere are no preemptive, subscription, conversion or redemption rights pertaining to our common stock. The absence of preemptive rights\ncould result in a dilution of the interest of existing stockholders should additional shares of common stock be issued. Holders of our common stock\nare entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by our Board of Directors out of assets legally available and to share ratably in our assets\nupon liquidation.\nComputershare Trust Company is the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “WWR.”\nPossible Anti-Takeover Effects of Delaware Law and our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws\nCertain provisions of Delaware law, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws discussed below could\ndiscourage or make it more difficult to accomplish a proxy contest or other change in our management or the acquisition of control by a holder of a\nsubstantial amount of our common stock. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish, or could deter, transactions\nthat stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interests or in our best interests. These provisions are intended to enhance the\nlikelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our Board of Directors and in the policies formulated by the Board of Directors and\nmay discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change of control of us. The provisions also are intended to\ndiscourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights. Such provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our management.\nDelaware Statutory Business Combinations Provision.    We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with\nan “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless\nthe business combination is, or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder was, approved in a prescribed manner or\nanother prescribed exception applies. For purposes of Section 203, a “business combination” is"

Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of capital\nstock, par value $0.001 per share. As of December 31, 2019, 3,339,541shares of our common stock were issued and 3,339,380 shares of our\ncommon stock were outstanding. Our Board of Directors has the authority, without further approval of the stockholders, to issue such shares,\nwhich would adversely affect the voting power and ownership interest of holders of our common stock. This authority may have the effect of\ndeterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing a change in control, and discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market\nprice.\nAdvance Notice Provisions for Stockholder Proposals and Stockholder Nominations of Directors.    Our Amended and Restated Bylaws\nprovide that, for nominations to the Board of Directors or for other business to be properly brought by a stockholder before a meeting of\nstockholders, the stockholder must first have given timely notice of the proposal in writing to our Secretary. For an annual meeting, a stockholder’s\nnotice generally must be delivered not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual\nmeeting. Detailed requirements as to the form of the notice and information required in the notice are specified in the amended and restated\nbylaws. If it is determined that business was not properly brought before a meeting in accordance with our bylaw provisions, such business will not\nbe conducted at the meeting.\nAmendment of Bylaws.    Our Board of Directors is expressly authorized to alter or repeal our Amended and Restated Bylaws.\nSpecial Meetings of Stockholders.    Special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by our Chairman, President or pursuant to a\nresolution adopted by a majority of the total number of directors. Stockholders may not propose business to be brought before a special meeting of\nthe stockholders."
