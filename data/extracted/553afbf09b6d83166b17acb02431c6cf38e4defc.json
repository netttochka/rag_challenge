      "text": "United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.\n \nii\n \n \nPART I\n \nItem 1. Business\n \nOur Strategy\n \nOur objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates to treat diseases where the innate immune system is dysfunctional causing\nand contributing to the patient’s disease. Innate immune dysfunction can occur for a variety of reasons including genetics, lifestyle, and other factors\nhowever, age plays a signiﬁcant role in the development of immune dysfunction. Innate immune dysfunction can be in cancer where Natural Killer (“NK”)\ncells are inactive and contribute to a tumor’s evasion of the immune system and/or disease progression. Further, chronic inﬂammation causes expression\nof MUC4 and immunosuppressive cells of the tumor microenvironment proliferate to protect the tumor from attack by the patient’s immune system and can\ncause other diseases such as neurologic and metabolic diseases where chronic inﬂammation results in innate immune system dysfunction. Our initial\nfocus will be the treatment of cancer, treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease (“AD”), the treatment of Treatment Resistant Depression (“TRD”) and an out-\nlicensing strategy for Duchenne’s Muscular Dystrophy (“DMD”). In cancer, we plan to pursue two parallel development programs: (1) with INKmune we will\ninitially focus on treating women with resistant disease relapse refractory carcinoma solid tumor and patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome\n(high risk MDS); (2) with INB03, we plan to treat patients with cancers that express MUC4, a mucinous polyglucan on the surface of some epithelial cancer\ncells, that appears to predict resistant to immunotherapy including women with MUC4 expressing HER2+ breast cancer and potentially other MUC4\nresistant cancers. Our third drug candidate XPro1595 (“XPro”), targets Alzheimer’s Disease and TRD. XPro for AD has completed Phase I trials and\nPhase II trials are underway in Australia and Canada. The Company is currently in discussions with the US FDA to obtain approval to commence the\nPhase II AD trials in the U.S. which the FDA placed on full clinical hold on May 20, 2022. XPro for TRD is being prepared for Phase II trials and will start\nafter the FDA has cleared XPro for use in the US. In early 2023, the Company also announced pre-clinical data in DMD including new intellectual property\nfor the purpose of trying to seek partnership for the development of this program. DMD is a X-linked genetic disease that occurs most often in young boys.\nPeople with DMD do not produce dystrophin, a protein necessary for normal skeletal muscle function. The patients develop weakness of skeletal muscles\ninitially seen as weakness in standing and walking. Over time, the disease progresses forcing the patient to be wheelchair bound by early teens. The\npatients die young due to respiratory and cardiac failure before they reach thirty years old. Therapies for DMD delay progression, there is no cure.\n \nThe overall principal components of our business strategy to achieve these objectives are to:\n \n \n●\npursue development strategies and regulatory approval pathways that allow the treatment of oncology patients with our lead product\ncandidates, INKmune and INB03;\n \n \n \n \n● \npursue development strategies and regulatory approval pathways that allow the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases in patients with our\nlead product candidates, XPro;\n \n \n●\nPursue development strategies with a dominant-negative tumor necrosis factor (“DN-TNF”) compound for the treatment of DMD;\n \n \n●\nadopt a product development strategy that solidiﬁes our existing intellectual property (“IP”) to prevent competition and expand our IP suite into\nrelated immunotherapeutic areas;\n \n \n \n \n●\nprovide clear value propositions to third-party payers, such as managed care companies or government programs like Medicare, to merit\nreimbursement for our product candidates; and\n \n \n \n \n●\nCollaborate with other pharmaceutical companies with respect to, among other things, our INKmune and the DN-TNF platform that includes\nINB03 and XPro product candidates, our DMD DN-TNF candidate and other products that will beneﬁt from development or marketing beyond\nour current resources.\n \nPursue development and regulatory approval pathways. We believe INKmune, INB03 and XPro may be approvable under pathways that are\npotentially shorter than those typically available for drug products based on novel active ingredients, including as an orphan drug under the Orphan Drug\nAct and approval under the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) Accelerated Approval Program (see “Government Regulation”). We have not yet\nhad a discussion with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) and/or FDA regarding such designation, but plan to do so in\nthe future. We believe the INKmune MDS cancer program may qualify for orphan status. We believe that it would take a minimum of six months to receive\nOrphan Drug status once we apply for application and a minimum of 12 months to receive a designation once we submit an application. We might never\nhave these discussions, submit applications under the Orphan Drug Act or the FDA Accelerated Approval Program or have these applications approved if\nwe do.\n \n1\n \n \nAdopt a two-pronged patent strategy. We are pursuing a two-pronged product development strategy that will seek to solidify our existing IP to\nprevent competition and expand our IP suite into related therapeutic areas. We are conﬁdent that our core in-licensed IP (see “Intellectual Property”) will\nallow us both freedom-to-operate and provide robust protection from outside competition. We will continue to invest in expanding our patent suite. We will\nalso seek to further to strengthen our IP position by looking to in-license IP related to our focus on the innate immune system.\n \nProvide clear value propositions to third-party payors to merit reimbursement for our product candidates . We are designing our clinical\ndevelopment programs to demonstrate compelling, competitive advantages to patients and prescribers, and to demonstrate value propositions to third-\nparty payors. We believe the use of INKmune and/or INB03 in patients with a high risk of tumor progression and death from tumor should prolong survival,\nimprove the patient’s quality of life and decrease the total cost of care for patients with these lethal malignancies. For example, cancer patients relapse\nfrequently. Each relapse requires a complex treatment regimen that has decreasing beneﬁts. Treatment with INKmune as an out-patient may provide a\nmore durable remission and limit the need for treatment-associated hospitalizations. At the patient level, we believe INKmune and INB03 therapy, if\napproved, should improve survival and quality of life. At the payor level, we believe INKmune, if approved, should provide more predictable costs and\noutcomes. Therapies for Alzheimer’s disease are needed for medical, social and economic reasons. The cost of Alzheimer’s disease to the government is\nlarge and growing. Recently approved therapies that target amyloid have a modest impact on disease progression and are diﬃcult to use due to side-"

We believe treatment of dementia patients with XPro,\nincluding Alzheimer’s disease, may provide a strategy to alter the costly dynamic of this disease in society today.\n \nCollaborate to maximize the value of our technology . We believe there are two reasons for us to enter collaborations with other companies. The\nﬁrst is the further development of INKmune, INB03, XPro and DN-TNF by either providing additional innovations to the product, including combination\ntherapy strategies, and/or providing resources to improve the speed and breadth of the development process. The second is to optimize the\ncommercialization of our products either globally or regionally. The ideal partner will benefit us in both ways.\n \nWe continue to look for ways to utilize our unique capabilities to optimize clinical application of cell therapies. We believe that we have identiﬁed a\nway to manufacture human mesenchymal stem cells for the medical research and biotech community that oﬀers large volumes of high-quality, low\npassage human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells with minimal batch-to-batch variability. We have established a reliable supply of human umbilical\ncords based on our agreement with the Anthony Nolan Cord Blood Bank in the United Kingdom and may seek additional supplies in the future. We have\ndeveloped a validated manufacturing process that reliably produces contract manufacturer of the clinical grade (“cGMP”) quality mesenchymal stem cells\nthat we call CORDstrom. The manufacturing process can be performed at a contract manufacturing site under the direction of Mark Lowdell, the\nCompany’s CSO. We will seek academic laboratories and biopharma companies who need a reliable source of high quality pooled human umbilical cord\nmesenchymal stem cells for research of and development of clinical products. Once identiﬁed, we plan to act as a cGMP for the development of\ntherapeutic products by utilizing contract manufacturers. Because the production of the product is not continuous, we do not expect to engage a contract\nmanufacturer until we have a customer identiﬁed. To date, we are supporting two academic clinical trials with CORDstrom. One program is a Phase 2 trial\nsponsored by the Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital in the UK treating children with Erythematous Bullousa (“EB”), a disﬁguring skin disease in\nchildren that is similar to a second degree burn and the second program is treatment of system lupus in adults. Both these studies are ongoing. INmune\nBio is supplying the clinical product for treatment of these patients. The Company does not know the results of these trials until they are announced by the\nprincipal investigators at the clinical sites. We have identiﬁed contract manufacturers in the UK that have the capability to produce cGMP stem cells. We\nexpect the commercial arrangement with academic laboratories or biopharma companies to be a combination of fee-for-service and licensing that does not\nrequire additional investment by us. We will be opportunistic in pursuing therapeutic opportunities for our own portfolio with this platform in the future if\nresources become available. The regulatory path for therapeutic applications of the mesenchymal stem cell products is well established and similar to the\nregulatory approval process for other cell therapies. We will only be responsible for regulatory compliance related to manufacturing of the mesenchymal\nstem cells when the product is being developed by a third party. When developing a therapeutic product for the Company’s commercial portfolio, the\nCompany will be responsible for all aspects of the regulatory process.\n \n2\n \n \nOverview of Immunotherapy for Cancer\n \nThe immune system has two parts, innate and adaptive. The innate immune system is the body’s ﬁrst line of defense against an infection,\nproviding immediate, non-speciﬁc responses to eliminate harmful cells in the body. Components of the innate immune system include cytokines,\nchemokines, macrophages, neutrophils and NK cells, among others.\n \nThe adaptive immune system is often initially triggered by the innate immune system, mounts a delayed response against diseased cells and\nplays a role protecting against re-infection. An adaptive immune response is highly speciﬁc to a pathogen or antigen and is developed or learned from\nprior exposure. Key components of the adaptive immune system include antibodies which bind to antigens and mark them for destruction by other immune\ncells, B-cells which produce these antibodies upon exposure to antigens, and T-cells which attack and eliminate the diseased cells.\n \nThe biopharmaceutical industry has made signiﬁcant advances in harnessing speciﬁc components of innate and adaptive immune systems for\ntherapeutic use. Some of these approaches are summarized below.\n \nCytokines. Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (“TNF”) is the focus of XPro and INB03. TNF biology has four elements that include two cytokines,\nsoluble TNF and trans-membrane TNF (“sTNF” and “tmTNF,” respectively), and two receptors, TNF Receptor 1 and 2 (“TNFR1” and “TNFR2”). The\nbiology of TNF ligation of TNFR varies dramatically based on what elements of the TNF system that are used. sTNF binding to TNFR1 is responsible for\ninﬂammation and cell death while sTNF binding to TNFR2 promotes proliferation of regulatory T cells (“Treg”). In patients with advanced cancers,\nincreased sTNF is not favorable to long-term survival because it promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transformation and metastasis while making the tumor\nmicroenvironment more immunosuppressive promoting resistance to therapy. In the CNS, sTNF promotes neuronal cell death, demyelination and synaptic\npruning while tmTNF promotes nerve cell survival, improves synaptic function and stimulates remyelination. In brief, sTNF is the “bad” TNF and tmTNF is\nthe “good” TNF. In patients with cancer, infection or neurologic disease, blockade of tmTNF function has negative consequences such as\nimmunosuppression, increased infection, synaptic dysfunction and demyelination.\n \nOne of the early applications of immunotherapy is the use of cytokines, including interferons and interleukin-2 (“IL-2”). Interferons are molecules\nthat inhibit the growth and replication of diseased cells and stimulate innate immune cells to attack them. They have been used as standard of care for\nhepatitis B and C and multiple sclerosis, and to a lesser extent, as treatment for certain cancers, including chronic myeloid leukemia, cutaneous T-cell\nlymphoma, myeloma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. However, the use of interferons has generally decreased over the years due to serious adverse\nevents (e.g., ﬂu-like symptoms and dramatic weight loss) and introduction of new therapies with higher eﬃcacy, better safety proﬁles and more convenient\nadministration although Alpha-interferon remains the treatment of choice for some hematological conditions such as polycythemia. IL-2 activates T-cells\nand NK cells to attack diseased cells. IL-2 has been used to treat select cancers, but due to its relatively poor safety proﬁle, physicians often only resort to\nthis therapy for the most advanced settings.\n \nAntibody therapy. Antibodies exist in three formats: monoclonals (“mAbs”), oligo/polyclonal and antibody-drug conjugates. mAbs represent an\neﬀective therapeutic modality and are important to the treatment paradigm of various diseases. Drug manufacturers have leveraged mAbs’ ability to\ninduce an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or ADCC eﬀect to develop better treatments that prolong survival and quality of life of patients. In\naddition, mAbs designed to inhibit speciﬁc checkpoints in the immune system have overcome in vivo immune suppression and the resulting immune\nresponses have led to profound therapeutic beneﬁt in some patients. However, the degree of eﬃcacy of these therapies is heavily reliant on the immune\nsystem of patients, many of whom are severely immuno-compromised. In addition, mAbs are manufactured through a complex process that requires\npuriﬁcation of cell products created from a cell line. Polyspeciﬁc antibodies, for example bi-speciﬁc antibodies, are able to target more than one antigen.\nThese are often used to bring and eﬀector T cell in contact with a target cell. Antibody drug conjugates are mAbs attached to a toxin, chemotherapy or\nradio therapy that delivers the cancer killing payload directly to the cancer.\n \n3"

      "text": "Dendritic Cell Therapies. This approach is designed to indirectly stimulate a patient’s T-cells by leveraging the role of dendritic cells in\npresenting antigens to T-cells. Cancer vaccines are the most common application of dendritic cells. The only FDA-approved dendritic cell therapy is\nPROVENGE, which entails collecting monocytes from the patient, maturing them into dendritic cells, “loading” ex vivo with the patient’s cancer antigens,\nand then re-infusing in the patient. Currently, this process is cumbersome and expensive, and again, relies on an intact and eﬀective immune system of\nthe patient. There are additional ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials being conducted by our competitors aimed at addressing certain of the\nlimitations associated with this approach. To date, current clinical results of dendritic cell therapies have been mixed.\n \nCAR-T and TCR Therapies.  T-cells recognize diseased cells by receptors engaging with antigens that are present on or inside the diseased\ncells. CAR-T therapy entails genetically engineering T-cells to express synthetic CARs that direct T-cells to antigens on the surface of cancer cells. TCR\ntherapy modiﬁes T-cells to express high-aﬃnity tumor speciﬁc TCRs that recognize intra-cellular antigens that must be presented on the surface of target\ncells. In early clinical trials, CAR-T and TCR therapies have demonstrated impressive anti-tumor activity in a narrow spectrum of hematologic cancers and\ngarnered signiﬁcant attention by research institutions and biopharmaceutical companies. We believe a key limitation of adaptive autologous\nimmunotherapy is the need to retrieve non-compromised immune cells from a cancer patient which requires a complex and costly manufacturing process\nto develop the therapy. The complexity of this personalized process is reﬂected in the price of the two approved therapies. CAR-T therapies -\ntisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel for advanced leukemia and lymphoma respectively. The cost of a single therapy is many hundreds of\nthousands of dollars. As a consequence of this need to harvest active T-cells, current Phase I clinical trials for autologous CAR-T cell therapy in large part\nenroll patients from highly selected, often relatively early-stage disease in a narrow spectrum of cancers, including bulky hematological cancers. In\naddition, Phase I clinical trials of CAR-T cell immunotherapy have reported severe adverse toxicities of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity,\nrequiring hospitalization, pre-conditioning and, in some instances, intensive care unit admission following side eﬀects associated with cytokine release\nsyndrome. As a result, though our competitors continue to develop their CAR-T and TCR product candidates with the goal of addressing certain of the\nlimitations associated with these approaches, we believe these serious challenges may limit their potential and use in a variety of indications, including\nsolid tumors.\n \nCheckpoint Inhibitors. Immune cells express proteins that are immune checkpoints that control and down-regulate the immune response. These\nare best deﬁned in T lymphocytes and include PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3 and LAG3. Tumor cells express the ligands to these receptors. When T cells bind the\nligand to these proteins on the tumor cells, the T cell is turned oﬀ and does not attempt to attack the tumor cell. Thus, checkpoint inhibitors (“CPI”) are part\nof the complex strategy used by the tumor to evade the patient’s immune system and are responsible for resistance to immunotherapy. Biopharmaceutical\ncompanies have successfully developed CPI that block the receptor/ligand interaction to promote the adaptive immune response to the tumor. Six CPI are\ncurrently approved, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, and ipilimumab for a wide variety of solid tumors including\nmelanoma, lung, bladder, gastric cancers and others. More CPI are in development and more tumor types will be added to the list of sensitive tumors over\nthe next years. CPI have become the backbone of cancer therapy and are expected to be the best -selling class of drugs by 2027.\n \nNK Cells. NK cells typically represent approximately 2% to 13% of circulating lymphocytes and are a critical component of the immune system\nresponsible for innate immunity. Unlike adaptive immune cells, they are ever present and ready to attack, having the inherent ability to detect and\neliminate diseased cells without the need for antigen presentation, which is why they are called “natural killers.”\n \nNK cells bind to stress ligands expressed by the diseased cells and directly eliminate them. This binding induces NK cells to release cytokines,\nincluding, interferons and GM-CSF, which are integral in recruiting additional innate and adaptive immune responses by the host. NK cells also represent\na critical eﬀector cell for ADCC, whereby target cells bound with human antibodies, whether made by the patient’s body or administered, are selectively\ndestroyed by the NK cells.\n \n4\n \n \nOur Innate Immune Dominant-Negative TNF (“DN-TNF”) product candidate\n \nWe renamed XPro, which we license from Xencor, to INB03 when it is used for cancer related indications. We will continue to call the drug XPro\nwhen used for treatment of neurologic and psychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease and TRD discussed below. INB03 and XPro are the same\ndrug with diﬀerent names. INB03 neutralizes soluble TNF in the tumor microenvironment (“TME”). Neutralizing sTNF in the TME has two main eﬀects –\ndecreases expression of MUC4 by the tumor and converting the immunosuppressive cancer promoting TME that promotes tumor growth to an\nimmunologically active TME that promotes tumor cell death. INB03 decreases proliferation of MDSC, promotes recruitment of cytotoxic T cells to the TME\nand may convert immunosuppressive tumor macrophages into tumor phagocytic macrophages. In murine models, these changes make the tumor reverse\nresistance to treatment with immunotherapy alone or in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such a lapatinib and tucatinib. MUC4 expression\nis increased by sTNF produced by the tumor. MUC4 causes resistance to trastuzumab therapy in HER2+ breast and gastric cancer cells by preventing\nbinding of trastuzumab to HER2 by steric hinderance. By neutralizing sTNF with INB03, decreases MUC4 expression to allow trastuzumab to bind HER2.\nThe importance of trastuzumab based immunotherapy in the treatment of HER2 expressing tumors has increased recently due to the success of\ntrastuzumab-deruxtecan (Enhertu, TDxd). TDxd improves survival in women with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer in both high and low HER2 expressing\ntumors. MUC4 expression inhibits the TDxd tumor killing in a murine model of HER2+ trastuzumab resistant HER2+ breast cancer. The mechanism by\nwhich combination of INB03 with TKI improves eﬃcacy over TKI alone remains under investigation. By using INB03 as part of combination therapy for\ncancer, we believe the patient’s dysregulated immune response, a hallmark of cancer progression and resistance to therapy, to be converted to a\ncoordinated immune response that can overcome resistance mechanisms to immunotherapy in MUC4 expressing cancers. These immune responses\nhave been studied in at least two animal models. In a murine model of an inﬂammatory cancer, where 3-methylcholanthrese is given to mice in a\nsubcutaneous injection that causes the development of multiple cutaneous fibrosarcoma. This model was developed by Y Akamatsu in 1967 while working\nat the National Cancer Institute of the NIH. In research published by Professor Nikola Vujanovic in Cancer Immunology Research in 2016, treatment with\nINB03 resulted in smaller and fewer cancers with increased survival. INB03 is an engineered PEGylated protein that neutralizes human soluble TNF, a\nhuman inﬂammatory cytokine that is increased in patients with advanced cancer. By speciﬁcally neutralizing the cytokine, there is decreased\nphosphorylation of STAT3, an essential step required for the proliferation of the MDSC population, and secretion of the immunosuppressive cytokines. The\ncombination of decreased MDSC proliferation and decreased immunosuppressive cytokines allows the immune system to respond to the tumor. This data\nwas published in an article entitled Inhibition of Soluble Tumor Necrosis Factor Prevents Chemically Induced Carcinogenesis in Mice in Cancer\nImmunology Research in Cancer Immunology Research, 2016. In summary, INB03 functions as an innate immune system checkpoint inhibitor by\neliminating the population of MDSC that provides an immunosuppressive shield protecting the tumor, the patient’s immune system is able to function\nnormally to the beneﬁt of the patient – it can attack the tumor. TNF plays an important role in breast cancer (Schillaci R, Front. Oncol., 22 April 2020\n| https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.00584). In a murine model of trastuzumab resistant breast cancer using JMIT-1 cells, a human cell line of HER2\npositive breast cancer resistant to trastuzumab placed into immunocompromised mice, INB03 downregulates MUC4 from the surface of the JMIT-1\nHER2+ breast cancer cells to allow the trastuzumab resistant cells to become trastuzumab sensitive (Figure A from Bruni, NYAS 2020) to decrease tumor\ngrowth (from Schillaci SABCS 2018, Figure B). JMIT-1 cells are also resistant to lapatinib, a TKI inhibitor used as a second line therapy in women with\ntrastuzumab resistant HER2+ breast cancer. The addition of INB03 to lapatinib in the animal model reverses lapatinib resistance in part by decreasing\nexpression of MUC4 (from Bruni NYAS 2020, Figure C). In addition to decreasing resistance to trastuzumab by decreasing MUC4 expression, INB03"

Recently, Dr. Schillaci reported the MUC4\nexpressing triple negative breast (TNBC) cancer patients have a worse overall survival. (Schillaci SABCS 2021). More recently, Schillaci has shown that\nMUC4 causes resistance to trastuzumab ADC (trastuzumab-XXX and TDxd). Combination therapy with INB03 overcomes resistance in this breast cancer\nmodel. These data may be relevant to all tumors that express HER2 or MUC4 including upper gastrointestinal malignancies such as gastric and pancreatic\ncancer.

      "text": "immune system, not the cancer. We do expect to develop the INB03 beyond Phase II to target a speciﬁc type of cancer to meet the current system of\nregulatory approval. For instance, INB03 may be approved to treat patients with HER2+/MUC4+ breast cancer. To get subsequent approval for the\ntreatment of patients with MUC4+ TNBC or MUC4+ pancreatic cancer, we will need to perform a pivotal trial in patients with TNBC and pancreatic cancer\nrespectively. After the ﬁrst regulatory approval, if and when achieved, we believe the diﬃculty and cost of achieving these labels extensions will decline\nwith each successive approval. At this time, we cannot predict if patients without biomarkers of inﬂammation, elevated MDSC or cytokines, or increased\nexpression of MUC4 will benefit from treatment with INB03. Those studies may be performed in the future, but they are not a priority.\n \nXPro neutralizes soluble TNF in the brain in exactly the same way INB03 neutralizes soluble TNF in the tumor microenvironment but the eﬀects\nof soluble TNF neutralization in the brain are diﬀerent. The cause of the destructive neuroinﬂammation in the brain are microglial and astroglial cells. The\nglial cell are two of four cells in the neural unit that also includes oligodendrocytes and nerve cells. Activated microglial cells are considered the resident\nmacrophages of the brain. The primary role of microglial cells is to protect the neural unit from infection. When innate immune dysfunction causes chronic\ninﬂammation, activated microglial cells produce soluble TNF that activates astrocytes. Activated glial cells cause nerve cell and oligodrocyte dysfunction\nthat results in synaptic pruning, nerve cell death and demyelination of neurons. These pathologies contribute, in part, to neurodegenerative diseases such\nas AD, Parkinson’s disease, ALS, MS, Huntington’s disease, glaucoma and TBI (traumatic brain injury) may contribute to neuropsychiatric diseases such\nas depression, bi-polar disease, sleep disorders, autism, schizophrenia and PTSD. In the setting of AD, microglial activation causes dendritic pruning,\nsynaptic dysfunction and nerve cell death that contributes to cognitive decline and the behavioral manifestations of AD including depression,\naggressiveness, sleep disorders, hallucinations and anhedonia. Elimination of microglial activation should reverse these symptoms. Because soluble TNF\nis the apex cytokine in the inﬂammatory cytokine cascade, neutralization of soluble TNF with XPro should prevent glial activation and normalizes function\nof the neural unit.\n \nThe Company has completed a Phase I trial using XPro to reverse neuroinﬂammation in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. The trial was\nperformed in Australia and is partially funded by a $1M USD Part-the-Cloud Award from the Alzheimer’s Association. The clinical trial was the ﬁrst in the\nCompany’s development program for the treatment of dementia. The open label, dose escalation trial in patients with Alzheimer’s disease with biomarkers\nof peripheral inﬂammation (one of CRP>1.5mg/L, HgbA1c>6.0, ESR>10sec or have ApoE4) treats the patients with XPro as a once-a-week subcutaneous\ninjection for 3 months. AD patients with one biomarker of inﬂammation are classiﬁed as having AD with neuroinﬂammation (ADi). The company estimates\nthis group of patients includes at least 40% of patients with AD. Patients have multiple biomarkers of neuroinﬂammation tested before and during therapy\nincluding soluble biomarkers in blood and cerebral spinal ﬂuid, behavioral biomarkers (neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD) and neuroimaging biomarkers\nusing MRI. The primary goal of this short, open label study was to demonstrate that treatment with XPro decreases neuroinflammation safely and to define\nthe dose of XPro to use in the Phase II trial. The Company has opened a Phase II trial in ADi in Australia (“AUS”) and Canada (“CAN”). We anticipate\nopening additional countries including the US in 2023. The Phase II ADi program is not yet open in the US. The FDA has placed a full clinical hold on the\nprogram related to product characteristics in the product produced for the Phase II program at KBI Biosciences in 2021. The XPro produced by KBI is\nbeing used in the Phase II trial in AUS and CAN, the Phase II extension trial in patients that have completed the Phase II trial in AUS and the Expanded\nAccess Scheme in patients who completed the Phase I trial in AUS. The Company is working closely with the FDA to reverse the clinical hold. We cannot\npredict when this will occur. Our plan is to continue to enroll patients in the Phase II ADi trial in regulatory venues outside of the US while working to\nresolve the concerns of the FDA. The goal of the Phase II trial will be to demonstrate the prolonged control of neuroinﬂammation in patients with dementia\nwill help control cognitive decline. The Company has review its two Phase II trials in dementia, one each in mild cognitive impairment due to\nneuroinﬂammation (“MCI”) and mild ADi. New data supports combining the two trials into a single trial. Instead of having separate blinded randomized\nPhase II clinical trials in mild ADi and MCI2, there will be one clinical trial in early ADi that will include patients with either mild ADi or MCI. Combination of\nthe two trials into a single clinical trial may speed enrollment and decrease costs and will likely mirror the planned Phase III registration trial without\nincreasing the risk of the clinical program.\n \n7\n \n \nThe Phase I trial enrolled 18 patients at doses of 0.3, 0.6 and 1.0mg/kg given once a week as subcutaneous injection for three months. Patients in\nthe 10mg/kg group were oﬀered extended use of the drug for up to 12 months. Three patients remained on XPro for 12 months. Preliminary data was\npresented in a webinar on 13 July 2020. Neuroimaging data from six patients were presented in the ﬁgure below. In summary, treatment with XPro at\neither 0.3 or 1.0mg/kg once-a-week as a subcutaneous injection (low and target dose respectively) decreased white matter free water (“WMFW”) as\nmeasured by MRI. WMFW is a validated biomarker of neuroinﬂammation. Although the number of patients is low, there was a dose response with a\ngreater decrease in WMFW in the target dose compared to the low dose group. An analysis of inﬂammation in white matter tracts demonstrated a\nsigniﬁcant decrease in WMFW (40%; range 20-52%) in the arcute fasciculus, a white matter tract important in the control of language and short-term\nmemory (Figure D). These data suggest XPro is decreasing neuroinﬂammation in patients with Alzheimer’s disease who have biomarkers of peripheral\ninflammation.\n \n \n \nAdditional data was presented on January 21, 2021. The goal of the January 21 data release was to show a correlation between the white matter\nfree water, a novel biomarker of inﬂammation with cerebral spinal ﬂuid (“CSF”) cytokines and chemokine levels, a traditional measure neuroinﬂammation.\nCSF cytokine/chemokines were measured in 9 patients before and after 12 weeks of weekly therapy with XPro using a panel from OLINK Target 48\nCytokine (https://www.olink.com/products/olink-target-48-cytokine/), that measures 45 (Figure AD1)."

A large data set of proteins were identiﬁed. Early\nanalysis of the data focusing on 26 AD related proteins demonstrated changes in inﬂammation, neuronal and synaptic proteins caused by decreasing\nneuroinﬂammation after treatment with XPro (Figure AD3). The proteome also demonstrated a clear dose response with a greater number of proteins\nbeing aﬀected by the target dose compared to low dose XPro therapy (0.3 vs 1.0 mg/kg/week for 12 weeks) (Figure AD4).

      "text": "9\n \n \nThe results of the Phase I study demonstrated that XPro safely decreases neuroinﬂammation in patients with ADi who have biomarkers of\nperipheral inflammation or are ApoE4 positive when given for at least 3 months at the 1mg/kg once a week dose. Decreasing neuroinflammation with XPro\nappears to decrease neurodegeneration and improve synaptic function and promote remyelination. The eﬀect of XPro on the biology and immunology of\nthe brain in patients with AD suggest XPro therapy in patients with peripheral biomarkers of inﬂammation or ApoE4 allele(s) may impact cognitive decline.\nAlthough there were anecdotes of improved cognitive function in patients receiving the target dose of XPro, this cannot be veriﬁed because the trial was\nnot a blinded, randomized trial. The impact on cognition of controlling neuroinﬂammation with XPro will be studied in the Phase II program which is a\nblinded randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial.\n \nThe Company has consolidated the two Phase II trials into a single trial of early ADi. Early ADi patients have either mild AD or MCI with\nneuroinﬂammation. Mild AD or MIC patients must with at least one of elevated CRP, hemoglobinA1c, ESR in blood or have an ApoE4 allele are eligible for\nthe trial. The blinded randomized trial in patients with early ADi will enroll 201 patients in a 2:1 ratio (XPro:placebo) at 1mg/kg once a week. The trial is\ncurrently enrolling study subjects. Patients will be treated for 6 months. The primary end-point is Early/Mild Alzheimer’s Cognitive Composite (EMACC), a\nsensitive cognitive end-point validated for use in patients with early AD. Secondary cognitive (ADAS-Cog13, CDR-SB and NPI) and functional (GAS,\nADCS-ADL) end-points will be measured. Biomarkers of inﬂammation using white and gray matter analytics measured by MRI DTI similar to those used in\nthe Phase I trial will also be used. All patients will be eligible to continue XPro for at 12 additional months. Clinical and MRI metrics will be followed during\nthe extension trial.\n \nEﬀective therapy for TRD is a large unmet need. Twenty percent of patients with a Major Depressive Disorder have TRD. Once third of TRD\npatients have peripheral biomarkers to inﬂammation (elevated CRP). This is a large patient population. The role of TNF and anti-TNF therapeutics was\nexplored in a small open label clinical trial by Prof. Andrew Miller, MD of Emory University whereby it was demonstrated that patients which have elevated\nTNF levels responded to treatment with infliximab (Miller, 2011).\n \nThe Company received a $2.9M USD award from the National Institute of Mental Health (“NIMH”) to treat TRD with XPro. The blinded,\nrandomized Phase II trial will use a biomarkers of peripheral inﬂammation to select patients with TRD for enrollment. Patients will be treated for 6 weeks.\nPrimary end-points include both clinical and neuroimaging measures. The ﬁnal trial design is ongoing and discussions with the FDA are not complete. The\nCompany anticipates receiving authorization to initiate the clinical trial in 2023 at which point the Company may begin to request funds from the NIMH\npursuant to the award.\n  \nINB03 and XPro are delivered as a subcutaneous injection, similar to an insulin treatment, given one to three times per week. Because this is a\nsimple subcutaneous injection similar to an insulin injection (the therapy patients give themselves for treatment of Type 1 diabetes mellitus), we expect\npatients to administer the therapy by themselves or caregivers and not require expensive or logistically challenging clinic visits to receive the therapy.\n \n10\n \n \nRelease of INB03 and XPro drug supply\n \nGMP DN-TNF product (INB03 and XPro) used in the oncology Phase I, AD Phase I and COVID-19 Phase II trial were manufactured by Lonza at\na site in New Hampshire. The supply of Lonza DN-TNF product is limited but allowed completion of the Phase I study in Alzheimer’s disease and support\nof patients in the extension study for 12 months. New batches of XPro have been produced to support future clinical trials. The Company engaged KBI\nBiopharma to manufacture 6 lots of XPro/INB03 at the Boulder, Colorado facility using the original master cell bank and updated manufacturing process.\nTwo lots have been converted into drug product using the US ﬁll/ﬁnish facility of Vetter Pharma. Two of the lots are frozen as drug substance at -80C with\na plan to convert to drug product the second half of 2023. The ﬁnal two lots are frozen as a cell paste with a plan to process to drug substance in during\n2023 or 2024 as needed to support the clinical trials. We plan to use a two-step approach to improve the yield of the drug substance from the fermentation\nprocess. We hope to improve the yield of the drug product using the existing E.coli-based system. Once the new process is validated and functional, we\nwill perform a manufacturing campaign drug for future clinical trials. In the future, the Company may consider a strain change to improve yield of the\nfermentation step further. The decision for strain improvements and strain change will be made in the future as clinical development programs proceed.\n \nInteraction with Regulatory Authorities Regarding INB03 and XPro Development"

      "text": "We have completed a Phase I trial with INB03 in oncology and a Phase I trial with XPro in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. The Phase II\nprogram with Alzheimer’s disease started during 2022. The Phase I trial with XPro in patients with Alzheimer’s disease was performed in Australia under\nthe regulatory authority of the TGA using the Clinical Trials Exemption (“CTX”) scheme. Our ﬁrst interaction with the regulatory body occurred in March\n2018. The Company received approval to initiate the Phase I trial with INB03 in patients with advanced solid tumors on May 21, 2018. The second\ninteraction with the regulatory body occurred in March 2019. The Company received approval to initiate the Phase I trial with XPro in patients with\nAlzheimer’s disease in May 2019 and received authorization to start the Phase II trial in patients with mild AD on January 5, 2022. Our ﬁrst interaction with\nthe FDA occurred in July 2020 as part of the Phase II Quellor program to treat respiratory failure in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. The\nnewly manufactured XPro is being used to support the Phase II AD trial in AUS and CAN, the extension trial in AUS, and the Expand Access Scheme in\nAUS. The FDA has not allowed the use of this drug in the US yet. The FDA has asked for additional analytical testing to demonstrate comparability\nbetween the XPro used in the Phase I oncology, AD and Phase II COVID-19 clinical trials with the drug planned to be used in the Phase II AD clinical\ntrials. This comparability testing is underway. We cannot predict when the FDA will release the US Phase II from clinical hold. The CAN and AUS\nregulatory authorities are aware of the FDA clinical hold – they have not asked for similar information and allow the clinical program to proceed.\n \nINB03 Product Development Path: Proposed Phase II Studies in patients with cancer\n \nPhase I open label study in patients with advanced solid tumors has been completed. All future studies cancer will use INB03 as part of\ncombination therapy. The evolution of oncology standard of care occurs quickly. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (“CPI”) were introduced 5 years ago. The\nsuccess of CPI change the focus of cancer therapy from cytotoxic based cancer regimens to immunotherapy-based cancer regimens. The approval of\nTrastuzumab (“TDxd”) in 2022 had a similar eﬀect on HER2 expressing cancers. For example, use of trastuzumab based therapy in HER2+ breast cancer\nrequired 3+ expression of HER2. With TDxd, low HER2 expression (1+ or 2+ but not null) beneﬁt for TDxd. This has dramatically expanded the number of\nwomen eligible for trastuzumab based immunotherapy from 20% to half of women with breast cancer. This dramatic change in breast cancer standard-of-\ncare impacted our development plans for INB03 in breast cancer. The Phase II trial is planned to be in women who have failed TDxd therapy. About half\nof women who receive TDxd are resistant to therapy. We believe, but need to conﬁrm, that many of those women express MUC4. We believe an\nexploratory, single arm open label Phase II in woman who progress after TDxd is warranted. We believe the combination of TDxD, INB03 and TKI will be\neﬀective. We continue to conduct pre-clinical studies of INB03 in MUC4 expressing tumors. A decision on the clinical trial will not be made until the pre-\nclinical work has been completed and the data has been presented to an Advisory Board of clinical experts.\n \n11\n \n \nINB03 Registration Studies and/or Partnering\n \nWe plan to pursue an eﬃcient registration strategy using INB03 to improve the lives of patients with cancer and biomarkers of resistance such as\nMUC4. We believe that this strategy has use across many types of solid tumors including patients who have failed CPI, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (“TKI”)\nand anti-cancer antibody therapy such as trastuzumab monoclonal antibodies and trastuzumab based antibody drug conjugates. We have an active\npartnering position as it relates to INB03 development in cancer, although limited partnering discussion are underway at this time for INB03. We do not\nexpect partnering discussions to begin until Phase II data demonstrating efficacy of INB03 as part of combination therapy for cancer are available.\n \nOur INB03 platform can be used in cancer patients in many ways. The Phase I trial suggests the drug should not be used alone to treat cancer\nbut used in combination with, but not limited to, other cancer therapies including cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation and surgery. We\nbelieve that INB03 can also be used to treat many types of hematologic and epithelial cancers.\n \nINB03 and XPro Regulatory Strategy\n \nDrugs from the DN-TNF platform will be developed using adequately powered, well designed studies with the goal to demonstrate a meaningful\nclinical beneﬁt to patients. Beyond Phase I, these will most often be blinded, randomized clinical trials using validated end-points that have been\nauthorized by a regulatory authority – the FDA, TGA, MHRA, EMA, etc. Currently, all planned studies will be performed in North America, AUS, EU and/or\nthe UK. Because there are no therapies similar to INB03 or XPro approved in any market, we plan to take advantage of the regulatory opportunities\naﬀorded to therapies that treat markets with a high unmet need. In the U.S., this includes Orphan Drug Designation and expedited programs for approval\nincluding Accelerated Approval, Breakthrough Therapy Designation, Fast Track Designation, and priority review (see “Government Regulation). We\ncannot predict which, if any, of these programs we will beneﬁt from without further discussions with the FDA, EMA and other competent regulatory\nauthorities.\n \nImmunotherapy for Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease \n \nXPro is being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Microglial activation and neuroinﬂammation are important causes of the\nsynaptic dysfunction and nerve cell death that causes cognitive decline in patient with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. The relationship between β\namyloid plaques and tau neuroﬁbrillary tangles, the traditional targets in AD drug development and neuroinﬂammation is complex. We believe targeting\nplaques and tangles will have limited benefit. Targeting neuroinflammation, the common pathway leading to synaptic dysfunction and nerve cell death, may\nbe an eﬀective treatment strategy. Substantial pre-clinical data supports the use of XPro in murine models of AD. Substantial indirect data supports use of\nXPro in humans including a decreased risk of AD in patients treated with non-selective TNF inhibitors for rheumatoid arthritis and treatment using direct\ninjection into paraspinous venous plexus. Because of diﬀerent mechanism of action of XPro compared to the non-selective TNF inhibitors, we expect a\nlower risk of immunosuppression and demyelinating complications such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The Company reported preliminary data on July 13,\n2020 and January 21, 2021 supporting the use of XPro to decrease neuroinﬂammation in patients with Alzheimer’s disease and biomarkers of peripheral\ninflammation (see above).\n  \nWe completed enrollment of patients into an open label, biomarker directed, Phase I clinical trial in AUS that approaches AD as an immunologic\ndisease. Patients with dementia with the diagnosis of AD with biomarkers of chronic inﬂammation that includes at least one of a hs-CRP>1.5 mg/L, a\nESR>10 mm/h, a HbgA1C>6.0% or are ApoE4 positive were treated with XPro for 12 weeks. Three dosing cohorts were preformed – 0.3, 0.6 and 1.0 mg\nper week as a subcutaneous injection. Patients had multiple inﬂammatory biomarkers test before therapy, at 6 weeks and at 12 weeks. Biomarkers were\nreported in blood and cerebral spinal ﬂuid, MRI measures of white matter tract neuroinﬂammation, axonal quality and axon myelin, and MRI measures of\ngray matter quality after XPro therapy. Cognitive end-points were not the focus of the Phase 1 clinical trial because of the wide range of disease severity\nenrolled and lack of a placebo group. Patients enrolled in the Phase I trial had MMSE ranging from 24 to 12. This wide range of disease severity at the\ntime of enrollment and the lack of a blinded concurrent control group did not allow for determination of cognitive beneﬁt beyond several anecdotal reports.\nThe ﬁrst patient was enrolled in the low dose 0.3mg/kg/week cohort in the last week of November 2019. The Safety Review Committee met by\nteleconference on January 7, 2020, to review the course of the patients in the ﬁrst cohort and voted to open the second cohort, 1.0mg/kg/week, to\nenrollment. The ﬁrst patients were enrolled in the cohort the second week of February 2020. Based on preliminary data released on July 13, 2020, and\nJanuary 21, 2021, we closed after completion of a 0.6mg/kg treatment group. We canceled plans to treat patients with 3.0mg/kg. The data from the Phase\nI trial allowed the Company to choose a design the Phase II trials described above."

      "text": "12\n \n \nXPro Registration Studies and/or Partnering\n \nWe plan to aggressively pursue an eﬃcient registration strategy using XPro to improve the lives of patients with ADi. We deﬁne ADi as\nAlzheimer’s disease with biomarkers of inﬂammation. We believe ADi is not the only indication for XPro in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric\ndiseases. We plan to pursue other indications in neurodegenerative diseases as resources become available. We have received NIMH funding to support\na Phase II TRD program that hopes to start patient enrollment in 2023. We have an active partnering position as it relates to XPro development in\nneurodegenerative and neuropshyciatric diseases, although limited partnering discussion are underway at this time. There are two partnering opportunities\nwith this novel immunotherapy for the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric diseases. The ﬁrst is a traditional partnership focused on the developing the\ndrug for all neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric applications. The second is a more focused partnership developing XPro as part of a combination\ntherapy for a company’s existing therapy. After completion of proof-of-concept Phase II studies, we will decide what the most eﬃcient registration strategy\nis available to the company with XPro.\n \nDN-TNF for the treatment of Duchene Muscular Dystrophy\n \nThe Company also is exploring partnership opportunities outside of neurodegenerative disease with DN-TNF such as DMD. DMD is a X-linked\nmuscular dystrophy that occurs in 1 in 3500 male births in the US. The disease is caused by defects in dystrophin, a protein needed for efficient function of\nskeletal muscle. Boys with DMD develop skeletal muscle weakness that manifests early on with diﬃcult standing and walking. The boys become\nwheelchair bound by late adolescence and die of respiratory and cardiac failure in their twenties. There is no cure. Symptomatic therapies include\ncorticosteroids and novel strategies to replace dystrophin including ASO and gene therapies. Better therapies are needed.\n \nThe pathology of DMD is inﬂammation, skeletal muscle cell destruction, replacement of muscle ﬁbers with fat and ﬁbrosis. The most widely used\ntherapy, corticosteroids are focused on decreasing skeletal muscle inﬂammation. Although anti-inﬂammatory, corticosteroids cause metabolic and\nimmunologic problems including insulin resistance, obesity, hirsutism, short stature, depression and behavioral problems. Long term use of corticosteroids\nexacerbates skeletal muscle weakness.\n \nIn collaboration with Professor Armando Vallarta of University of California Irvine, the Company has completed and has ongoing studies with DN-\nTNF in murine models of DMD. The animal models show that DN-TNF therapy decreases inﬂammation and muscle degradation, promotes muscle\nregeneration and decreases ﬁbrosis. This is a unique set of attributes compared to other therapies on the market or in development. Because muscle cells\nproduce TNF, we believe the beneﬁts of DN-TNF therapy extends beyond the obvious immunologic attributes of modifying T cell and macrophage\ninfiltrates. Pre-clinical animal studies continue to better define the exact mechanism for these effects.\n \nThe Company has ﬁled global IP on the use of DN-TNF to treat muscular dystrophy. The Company has placed the IP and knowhow into a wholly\nowned subsidiary called DN02, Inc. The purpose of this structure is to facilitate partnering and/or co-development of DN-TNF for DMD in a way that does\nnot complicate or compromise the development of XPro for CNS diseases. The Company is actively seeking a partner to develop DN-TNF for DMD. We\ncannot predict if or when or under what terms a partnership will be formed.\n \n13\n \n \nINKmune: Our NK cell Directed Product Candidate\n \nINKmune is our lead product candidate that converts the patient’s resting NK cells into cancer memory like NK cells, an essential step to allow\nthem to participate in the immune control of the patient’s cancer. We have shown this works ex vivo in human tissue cell cultures, and we believe that this\nwill work in vivo which is the purpose of our planned clinical trials.\n \nCancers grow and relapse because they evade the immune system. In many cancers, NK cells are the most important cell for the elimination of\nresidual disease that causes cancer relapse. NK cells target cells based on a series of complex antigens on the cancer cell surface that signal the NK\ncells to activate and kill the cancer cell. NK cells develop a memory like NK cell phenotype to enhance killing of cancer cells. This phenotype requires\nmultiple simultaneous signals to be delivered to the NK cells. A cocktail of three cytokines, IL12, IL15 and IL18 can be used to convert a resting NK cell to\ncytokine induced memory like NK cells (“CIML”) [Fehneger 2016 ] or by INKmune priming with INB16 (TpNK – tumor primed NK cells). Although the\nintracellular biology of these two strategies has yet to be worked out, they do not appear to be identical. In summary, INKmune converts resting NK cells\ninto tumor killing memory like NK cells that function well in the hostile environment of the TME. (Figure 1 below)."

The higher the avidity\nthe greater the tumor cell killing. Cytokine stimulation may increase avidity of NK binding to some cancer cells whereas, in all experiments to date,\nINKmune priming enhances NK binding to all cancer cells tested. The relative increase in avidity to speciﬁc cancer cells is cytokine speciﬁc; as shown\nbelow, IL15 increases NK avidity for the ovarian cancer line SKOV-3 whereas IL2 has a limited eﬀect.

It is likely that the\nuse of multiple cytokines will achieve the same level of avidity and cytotoxicity as INKmune but studies with multiple cytokines have not yet been\nperformed (Figure below).\n \n \nWe have demonstrated TpNK killing of many tumor types in laboratory studies. Tumor priming is eﬀective regardless of the source of the NK cells\n(normal volunteers or patients with cancer) and in many types of tumors – both cell lines and primary tumors from patients. The principle of TpNK killing\nhas also been demonstrated in two Phase I trials in patient with acute myelogenous leukemia (“AML”). These trials were not supported by us and used a\nﬁrst-generation personalized cell therapy product and treatment strategy that is diﬀerent from the INKmune product and treatment strategy. In these trials,\nhaplo-identical NK cells obtained from a ﬁrst degree relative by leukapheresis were primed ex-vivo using a lysate of the parent cell line from which we\nderived INB16 - INKmune. Once the TpNK therapy has been produced and passed quality testing, the patient received conditioning therapy with\nchemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and ﬂudarabine), the primed haplo-identical NK cells were given to patients by intravenous infusion. Two Phase I\nclinical trials have been performed using that ﬁrst-generation adoptive cell therapy treatment strategy. An investigator-initiated trial performed at the Royal\nFree Hospital in London 2009 was funded by a UK charity. Fifteen patients with relapsed, high-risk AML were enrolled in the trial. Because of drop-out due\nto disease progression, delays in product production and complications of conditioning therapy, only 7 of the ﬁfteen patients were treated with the TpNK\ncell product. Four of seven patients showed clear beneﬁt from the treatment with the TpNK product with prolonged relapse free remission and, in one\npatient, conversion of a partial remission to full remission. None of the remissions were durable; all patients ultimately died from disease progression. The\nsafety of the product was found to be a combination of toxicity from the chemotherapy/radiotherapy conditioning regimen and the TpNK therapy. In\ngeneral, the complications were well tolerated although did require medical intervention including prolonged periods of aplasia in two heavily pretreated\npatients that resolved with supportive care. The results of this study have been published in a medical journal (PLoS One. 2015 Jun 10;10(6):e0123416.\ndoi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0123416. eCollection 2015). In 2013, a second open label, multi-center trial was performed in the US using the same product\nand procedures but targeting a slightly diﬀerent patient population. In the second trial, 12 patients in ﬁrst remission with AML were treated with the haplo-"

Patients were followed for safety and relapse free survival. This trial\nconﬁrmed the safety of the TpNK treatment in patients with AML and reinforced many of the eﬃcacy ﬁndings seen in the ﬁrst trial with none of the\npreviously experienced side eﬀects. Patients beneﬁted from haplo-identical TpNK therapy with prolonged relapse free survival including two patients that\nremain in remission more than 42 months after treatment.

The results of the laboratory and Phase I studies provide evidence that our strategy for treating\nresidual disease is sensible but unproven.\n \n15\n \n \nBecause INKmune primes NK cells to target naturally occurring antigens, we believe INKmune can be used in to treat a wide variety of cancers\nincluding hematologic malignancy (AML, MM, CML, high risk MDS) and solid tumors (renal, prostate, breast, ovarian, pancreas and lung). We expect the\nlist of INKmune sensitive tumors to continue to expand.\n \nThe primary role for INKmune will be an immunotherapy targeting residual disease in patients after debulking cancer therapies such as cytotoxic\nchemotherapy and surgery. At this time, we plan to give INKmune as monotherapy. We do not rule out the possibility of using INKmune as part of\ncombination therapy in the future. We do not expect to need to modify INKmune to treat these additional types of cancer, because we believe INKmune is\na universal cancer therapy where “one size ﬁts all”. We believe for INKmune to receive regulatory approval for each cancer indication, clinical trials will\nneed to be performed which demonstrate its safety and eﬀectiveness as a treatment for each such cancer. We believe the diﬃculty and cost of achieving\nthese labels extensions will decline with each successive approval, if and when achieved. For example, if INKmune is proven to be eﬀective therapy in\npatients with ovarian cancer and high-risk MDS, we will need to perform separate pivotal trials for approval in lung, prostate or renal cancer.\n \nThree step process to preparation for INKmune human clinical trials:\n \nINKmune GMP scale-up for Phase I/II clinical material\n \nThe working cell banks and individual INKmune product to be used in the patients for the clinical trial have been produced at the Centre for Cell,\nGene & Tissue Therapeutics at Royal Free Hospital / University College London to full cGMP (MHRA MIA(IMP)11149). All manufacturing has been under\nthe direction of Professor Mark Lowdell. The Company can produce enough INKmune to complete both Phase I clinical trials in women with ovarian\ncancer and in patients with high-risk MDS. We have validated storage of INKmune for up over 3 years in vapor phase nitrogen and have a fully scalable,\nclosed system manufacturing process in validation which can produce up to 6 patient doses per week during phase I and II trials. At intermediate scale we\ncan manufacture 40 doses per week in a single 80-liter bioreactor. Importantly, we have validated the storage of INKmune at -80 oC for up to 27 days\nwhich greatly facilitates the delivery and local storage of the drug for clinical trials and post commercialization use. In contrast, as far as we know all other\nNK cell therapies and T cell therapies require complex shipping of drug products in vapor phase nitrogen below -150oC and specialized arrangements for\nongoing storage at the clinical sites. We may need additional INKmune for future clinical trials.\n  \nInteraction with Regulatory Authorities Regarding INKmune Development\n \nThe INKmune Phase I studies in high-risk MDS are being performed in the UK and Greece. We met with the Medicines and Healthcare Products\nRegulatory Agency (“MHRA”), the UK version of the FDA as part of a Scientiﬁc Advice Meetings in preparation for submitting the CTA for our ﬁrst planned\nprogram. The purpose of the meeting was to explain to the MHRA our manufacturing process and clinical plan for the development of INKmune in a\nPhase I relapse/refractory ovarian cancer. We are working to seek regulatory approval to start a solid tumor program in the US. The Company has had\ninitial discussion with the FDA. Those discussions are ongoing. We plan to ﬁle an IND for a solid tumor indication in 2023. We have not announced the\nsolid tumor target.\n \n \n \n16\n \n \nINKmune Product Development Path Proposed Phase I Study in patients with high-risk MDS\n \nDuring 2021, we initiated an open label Phase I cancer study in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (“MDS”). Patients are being\nenrolled who have a low burden of disease after completion of conventional therapy. The ﬁrst patients were enrolled in the ﬁrst quarter of 2021. In the\nPhase I trial, patients with detectable residual disease in bone marrow and/or peripheral blood (<15% blasts by conventional tests) will be treated with\nintravenous infusions of INKmune and monitored for changes in peripheral blood NK activation, NK function and changes in residual blast counts in blood\nand bone marrow. We and others have previously shown that MDS patients with inadequate NK function have statistically signiﬁcantly poorer prognosis"

Moreover, INKmune-primed NK cells are not inhibited by the hypoxic conditions\nof the diseased bone marrow microenvironment.\n \nThe ﬁrst patient was treated in the second quarter of 2021. The patient is now more than 12 months out from therapy with INKmune. The patient,\npart of the ﬁrst cohort, received 1x10^8 INKmune cells on day 1,8 and 15 as an in-patient. The patient did not require any type of conditioning therapy or\ncytokine support. The patient tolerated the three infusions without any problems. The patient underwent intensive monitoring over 120 days. There are 4\nobservations from this ﬁrst patient. The patient has dramatically increased the number of activated, “memory-like” NK cells in circulation. Memory-like NK\ncells (mlNK) are activated NK cells with a unique cell surface protein phenotype and which show enhanced lysis of tumor cell in vitro. Post treatment with\nINKmune, elevated levels of mlNK cells were present in the patients in the peripheral blood for more than 119 days when trial follow-up ceased. The\npatient mlNK actively kill NK resistant cancer targets in vitro. Finally, the patient has had a signiﬁcant clinical improvement with a reduction of his ECOG\nscore from 2 to 0 and a significant reduction in blood product support.\n \nThree compassionate use cases have also been treated. Two were young patients with AML who had failed previous hematopoietic stem cell\ntransplants (“HSCT”). The ﬁrst compassionate-treatment patient showed such improved neutrophil and platelet counts that she was discharged from\nhospital for the ﬁrst time in six months. The second patient treated compassionately had failed two high risk HSCT and entered the course of INKmune\ntherapy with high percentage of blasts in his bone marrow. His blood NK cells responded in diﬀerentiation into mlNK as hoped but it is too early to\ndetermine if INKmune has provide any clinical benefit.\n \n \n \n17\n \n \nINKmune Registration Studies and/or Partnering\n \nThe Company plans to ﬁle an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application in 2023 for a Phase I/II trial of INKmune in a solid tumor indication.\nOther solid cancers are of interest including nasopharyngeal cancer (“NPC”) which is a known target for NK cells and an important unmet clinical need in\nemerging markets such as mainland China. Renal cell carcinoma is also a known target for INKmune. We may seek partner or sell INKmune. Although our\ndevelopment strategy is focused on North America and Europe, we believe INKmune will also be attractive for markets on the Paciﬁc Rim, South Asia and\nSouth America, but will wait for partners to help with the development in those regions, however, at this time, we are not negotiating with any potential\npartners.\n \nImportantly, we have published data demonstrating INKmune eﬃcacy at priming allogeneic NK cells ex-vivo (described above) and this includes\npriming of NK cells diﬀerentiated from cord-blood derived hematopoietic stem cells (Domogala et al Cytotherapy 2017: 19:710-720). Numerous\ncompanies are developing therapeutic strategies using cord blood derived NK cell products and one or more may wish to partner with us to potentiate their\nproduct by co-incubation or co-administration with INKmune. We are also aware of companies developing cytokine primed NK cells (CIML) for the\ntreatment of cancer. We believe tumor primed NK cells are superior to ex vivo or in vivo cytokine strategies.\n \nChallenges in the Market for Our Product Candidates\n \nThe market for new oncology therapies is competitive, complicated, and rapidly evolving. We will be competing with companies that are older,\nlarger, better ﬁnanced and have greater experience. There are two types of drug companies – development companies and commercial companies.\nDevelopment companies take the risk of developing new products to proof-of-concept. Once proof-of-concept has been achieved, if the drug provides\nclinical beneﬁt, the product is usually acquired by a commercial company, which completes the drug’s clinical development and markets the product. We\nare a development company which will seek to develop products such as INKmune from the bench to the bedside to demonstrate proof-of-concept. The\ngoal for us is to successfully develop such products to the point where they are attractive targets for potential partners/acquirers.\n \nAccording to a recent Markets and Markets report, the immunotherapy market is growing rapidly at an annual rate of over 13%. Recently, the\nmarket is biased towards T cell-based immunotherapies including bi-speciﬁc antibody therapies, checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cell-based therapies.\nThere are substantial numbers of clinical trials that are focused on the adaptive immune system versus clinical trials that are focused on the innate\nimmune system for the treatment of cancer. Our challenge will be to educate partners on the value of NK cell-based therapeutic strategies. The need to\neducate people of the importance of INB03 is equally challenging. At the academic and investor level, there is little recognition of the role MUC4 plays in\ncausing resistance to immunotherapy. The concept of adding a drug to modify the immunosuppressive environment of the TME to allow immunotherapy to\nbe eﬀective is also new. We will be responsible for educating them on the importance of MUC4 expression, TAM, MDSC and why INB03 may be an\nimportant addition to the oncologist’s armamentarium. We believe educating investors and partners about new therapeutic opportunities is an easier task\nthan trying to diﬀerentiate our company from the many other cancer immunotherapy companies.

This set of biomarkers\npredicts a tumor that will be resistant to therapy. We believe MUC4 expression means that patient will be resistant to ﬁrst line trastuzumab based\nimmunotherapy and will be resistant to CPI. INB03 is a unique category of cancer therapies. It is does not kill cancer cells. INB03 modulates the\nimmunology of the TME to make existing therapies more eﬀective. The advantage of this strategy is that it can be used prospectively, and it does not add\ntoxicity to existing therapy.\n \n \n \nINKmune Competition\n \nOur industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and signiﬁcant technological change. Our potential competitors include large\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and\nresearch institutions. We believe that key competitive factors that will aﬀect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are\neﬃcacy, safety, tolerability, reliability, price, and reimbursement level. Many of our potential competitors, including many of the organizations named\nbelow, have substantially greater ﬁnancial, technical, and human resources than we do and signiﬁcantly greater experience in the discovery and\ndevelopment of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly,\nour competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining FDA approval for and achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. Our\ncompetitors’ drugs may be more eﬀective, or more eﬀectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product\ncandidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. We\nanticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Further, the\ndevelopment of new treatment methods for the conditions we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.\n \nINKmune is an immunotherapy that harnesses the biology of NK cells for the treatment of cancer. There is a long list of immunotherapy strategies\nfor the treatment of cancer and the immunotherapy for cancer market is growing rapidly. There are at least three ways to classify immunotherapy for\ncancer. The list below classifies immunotherapy strategies beginning with those that are most closely related to INKmune:\n \n \n1.\nCompanies in the NK cell therapy business;\n \n \n \n \n2.\nCompanies in the personalized immune-oncology business; and\n \n \n \n \n3.\nCompanies in the precision immuno-oncology business.\n \n19\n \n \nWe are not aware of any approved treatments that are classiﬁed as NK cell therapies. We are aware of public companies in the NK cell therapy\nbusiness such as Century Therapeutics, Immunity Bio, Nkarta, Fate Therapeutics, Glycostem and others. These companies are developing products that\ninvolve replacing or supplementing NK cells of the patient for the treatment cancer. Their product requires extensive ex-vivo cell manipulations which, with\nrespect to Century Therapeutics and Fate Therapeutics, may include gene therapy. The next larger group of companies are in the personalized immuno-\noncology business with products focused on T cell activation strategies. The most popular are the CAR-T cell therapies which are a patient speciﬁc ex-\nvivo gene therapy approach to a single disease (for example: pediatric ALL). CAR-T therapy has become wildly popular of late and includes many private\ncompanies, newer public companies such as Bluebird, Juno Therapeutics and Mustang Bio as well as established companies such as Novartis and\nGilead. For many of the companies, CAR-T cell therapies is their only business. For the latter two, CAR-T cell therapies is a newly in-licensed program\nwith marketing authorization in the US. Finally, the precision immune-oncology category also includes companies with anti-cancer antibody products and\nthe newer “check-point” inhibitors. Antibody therapies are all about “illuminating” the cancer to the innate immune system (NK cells). Monoclonal\nantibodies were the original immunotherapy that drove the growth of well-known biopharma companies including Genentech/Roche, Amgen, Merck and\nothers. Each of these products is disease speciﬁc (ie: treat only HER2+ breast cancer). Modern therapeutic antibodies are much more complicated bi-\nspeciﬁc and tri-speciﬁc antibodies that attempt to connect the cancer with activated T-cells of the adaptive immune system. Check-point inhibitors are\ncurrently the most rapidly expanding product category in immuno-oncology. These CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) and PD-1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab and\nnivolumab) speciﬁcally block a mechanism that shields cancers from T-cell killing. The two companies in this business are Merck (pembrolizumab) and"

There are many others trying to join this promising therapeutic area including large companies such as BMS and Roche.\n \nThere are several FDA approved drugs that improve the ability of the innate immune system (NK-cells) to treat cancer including mono-clonal\nantibody therapies (for example: Rituximab®; Avastin® and Herceptin® marketed by Roche/Genentech); and “check-point” inhibitors (Yervoy® and\nOpdivo®, BMS, Keytruda®, Merck and others). There is a large amount of development activity in the immune checkpoint inhibitor ﬁeld from both\npharmaceutical giants including AstraZeneca, Merck & Co, Pﬁzer, Merck KGaA, Roche, GSK, Novartis and Amgen and many start-ups, small companies\nand university spin-oﬀs which have emerged in the past two years.

The list of companies with poly-speciﬁc antibodies that attempt to link the cancer with a cytotoxic T cell is long, includes\nboth private and public companies (Amgen, Xencor, F-Star, Merus and many others). Finally, two CAR-T cell therapies were just approved for the\ntreatment of ALL – Kymriah™ (Novartis) and Yescarta™ (Gilead). We expect additional drugs to gain marketing authorization in the immune-oncology\nspace.\n \nTo our knowledge, there are no innate immune check-point inhibitors in development that have the unique characteristics of INB03 that neutralize\nsTNF to: i) decreases the proliferation of MDSC; ii) decreasing local and systemic immunosuppression caused by MDSC by stopping production of\nimmunosuppressive cytokines and; iii) improving NK/DC cross-talk to recruit the adaptive immune system to fight the cancer.\n \n20\n \n \nIntellectual Property\n \nWe seek to protect our therapeutic programs by continuously developing patent properties covering novel compositions, formulations, purpose-\nlimited compositions, combination treatments, methods of medical treatment, and other inventions, whether created internally or in-licensed, in the United\nStates Patent & Trademark Oﬃce (the “USPTO”), the World Intellectual Property Organization (“WIPO”) under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”),\nand in patent oﬃces for various foreign jurisdictions. While each invention is unique and territories for protection are decided on a case-by-case basis, we\ngenerally pursue patents in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, and the United States, and sometimes in Brazil, China and/or Korea. We currently have in\nour portfolio eleven (11) issued patents and forty-seven (47) pending patent applications, including both company-owned and in-licensed properties. The\nfollowing sections and corresponding tables summarize, for each of our current therapeutic programs, our pending and granted patent positions, to the\nextent publicly available, as of the time of preparing this document:\n \nDN-TNF Platform Technology (Oncology, Central Nervous System Disorders, Acute and Chronic Peripheral Diseases)\n \nThe DN-TNF Platform Technology covers a variety of dominant negative tumor necrosis factor (“DN-TNF”) variant proteins, including the\npegylated DN-TNF protein variants known as XPro and INB03. These DN-TNF protein variants can be considered a platform technology for treating the\nunderlying immune dysfunction associated with many disease manifestations. Unlike approved anti-TNF therapeutics, DNTNF selectively targets and\nneutralizes soluble TNF, and is therefore not immunosuppressive. Additionally, XPro has been shown to cross the blood brain barrier after peripheral\nadministration, making it attractive for use in treating CNS disorders.

One commercial application of INKmune includes use as a\ntherapeutic composition designed to enhance the ability of a patient’s own NK cells to seek, recognize and eliminate cancer. Another commercial\napplication of INKmune includes use as a cytokine-like (“pseudokine”) agent for enhancing NK cell killing speciﬁcity, potency, and eﬃcacy of NK cell -\nbased therapeutics. INKmune, as a therapeutic, is intended for provision as an I.V. -infused product containing replication-incompetent bio substrate units,\neach of which is adapted to present an aggregate of protein ligands and/or receptors to a patient’s own NK cells, in vivo. Upon contacting the patient’s NK\ncells, INKmune converts resting NK cells into what we call “primed” NK cells (“pNKs”). Data suggests that pNKs demonstrate enhanced killing of tumor\ncells, thus INKmune may indirectly improve a patient’s own immune response to cancer. As a pseudokine agent, INKmune can be used to contact the NK\ncells of an NK cell therapeutic product in vitro, e.g., during manufacturing, for enhancing characteristics of the NK cell therapeutic and rendering an\nimproved product.

Pre-clinical and clinical material for the early clinical trials with INKmune has been manufactured\nunder the direction of Mark Lowdell at a licensed Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) facility. The master cell bank, working cell bank and individual\nproduct doses were completed in July 2018. This clinical material is planned for use in the Phase I/II clinical trials in ovarian cancer. As we progress in our\nclinical programs, additional working cell banks and therapeutic product will be produced from the existing master cell bank. This process takes\napproximately 6 months and is not anticipated to delay the initiation of the high-risk MDS Phase I/II trials. We may transfer the manufacturing to a diﬀerent\ncommercial contract manufacturing organization after completion of these Phase II studies.\n \nHuman Mesenchymal Stem Cells\n \nIn November 2017 (amended in October 2022), we entered into a Material Transfer and License Agreement with the Anthony Nolan Cord Blood\nBank (“AN”), the oldest and largest non-directed cord blood bank in the United Kingdom for the supply the starting material for the mesenchymal stem\ncells - umbilical cords not used after cord blood harvest. Mark Lowdell’s research group developed and validated a methodology for producing large\nnumbers of clinical-grade pooled human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (“HucMSC”). We believe we are well positioned to become a\npreferred manufacturing partner for companies who need MSC for clinical programs. Manufacture of HucMSC is performed under the direction of Mark\nLowdell in a licensed GMP facility that is contracted to the Company as part of existing research and development agreements. The starting material for\nthe HucMSC product is provided by the AN. The HucMSC product produced in this facility are fully qualiﬁed to be used for either research or clinical trials.\nWe have developed a validated manufacturing process that reliably produces contract manufacturer of the clinical grade (“cGMP”) quality mesenchymal\nstem cells that we call CORDstrom. To date, we are supporting two academic clinical trials with CORDstrom. One program is a in the UK treating children\nwith erythematous bullousa, a disﬁguring skin disease in children that is similar to a second degree burn and treatment of system lupus in adults. Both\nthese studies are ongoing. INmune Bio is supplying the clinical product for treatment of these patients. The Company does not know the results of these\ntrials until they are announced by the principal investigators at the clinical sites. Currently, we plan to supply HucMSC to third parties for their research use\nand in clinical trials as part of the development process for commercial pro/ducts. We may decide to expand this agreement in the future if the commercial\nand/or development opportunities warrant such expansion. At the current time, we expect this program to be funded by revenues from commercial sales.\nThe agreement with AN terminates on November 29, 2027. AN may terminate the license on written notice to us, if a donor withdraws consent to the\ncontinued use of umbilical cord tissue samples that were obtained by AN. Additionally, either party may terminate the agreement on 30 days prior written\nnotice to the other if that other party materially breach any term of the agreement and such breaches (to the extent it is remediable) is not remedied within\n30 days of the written request to the other party to do so.\n \n25\n \n \nChallenges in the Market for Immunotherapy Products\n \nGovernment Regulation\n \nThe FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory agencies impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval,\nlabeling, manufacture, marketing, and distribution of drug products.

The regulatory approval process is generally lengthy and expensive, with no guarantee of a positive result. Moreover, failure to comply with\napplicable FDA or other requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunctive relief including partial or total\nsuspension of production, or withdrawal of a product from the market.\n \nVarious regulatory authorities regulate, among other things, the research, manufacture, promotion, and distribution of drugs in the United States\nunder the FDA and other statutes and implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before prescription drug product candidates may be\nmarketed in the United States generally involves the following:\n \n \n●\ncompletion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good\nLaboratory Practice regulations;\n \n \n \n \n●\nsubmission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become eﬀective before human clinical trials may\nbegin;\n \n \n \n \n●\nfor some products, performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s regulations, including\nGood Clinical Practices, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;\n \n \n \n \n●\nsubmission to the FDA of a new drug application or NDA;\n \n \n \n \n●\nsatisfactory completion of an FDA preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is produced to assess\ncompliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations; and\n \n \n \n \n●\nFDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.\n \nThe testing and approval process requires substantial time, eﬀort and ﬁnancial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our\nproduct candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.\n \nPreclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals and\nother animal studies. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the\nFDA. Some preclinical testing may continue even after an IND is submitted. The IND also includes one or more protocols for the initial clinical trial or trials\nand an investigator’s brochure. An IND automatically becomes eﬀective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period,\nraises concerns or questions relating to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such cases, the\nIND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before any clinical trials can begin. Clinical trial holds also may be imposed\nat any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance with regulatory requirements. An independent institutional review board, or\nIRB, at each of the clinical centers proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that\ncenter. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to\nanticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the consent form signed by the trial participants and must monitor the study until completed.\n \nThe FDA oﬀers several regulatory mechanisms that provide expedited or accelerated approval procedures for selected drugs in the indications on\nwhich we are focusing our eﬀorts. These include accelerated approval under Subpart H of the agency’s NDA approval regulations, fast track drug\ndevelopment procedures and priority review.\n \n26\n \n \nWe plan to seek orphan drug designation for INKmune for the treatment of high-risk MDS if the results of the clinical trials support this activity. The\nUnited States, European Union and other jurisdictions may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which, in\nthe United States, is generally a disease or condition that aﬀects no more than 200,000 individuals. In the European Union, orphan drug designation can\nbe granted if: the disease is life threatening or chronically debilitating and aﬀects no more than 50 in 100,000 persons in the European Union; without\nincentive it is unlikely that the drug would generate suﬃcient return to justify the necessary investment; and no satisfactory method of treatment for the\ncondition exists or, if it does, the new drug will provide a signiﬁcant beneﬁt to those aﬀected by the condition. If a product that has an orphan drug\ndesignation subsequently receives the ﬁrst regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan\nexclusivity, meaning that the applicable regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication,\nexcept in limited circumstances, for a period of seven years in the United States and 10 years in the European Union Orphan drug designation does not\nprevent competitors from developing or marketing diﬀerent drugs for the same indication or the same drug for diﬀerent indications. Orphan drug\ndesignation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After orphan drug designation is granted, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential\norphan use are publicly disclosed. Orphan drug designation does not convey an advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the review and approval\nprocess. However, this designation provides an exemption from marketing and authorization (NDA) fees. We plan to follow a similar path with INB03 or\nXPro, although the precise indication cannot be determined until we are farther along in the development process.\n \nClinical Trials\n \nPhase 1 clinical trials typically involve the initial introduction of the product candidate into healthy human volunteers. In Phase 1 clinical trials, the\nproduct candidate is typically tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics.\n \nPhase 2 clinical trials are conducted in a limited patient population to gather evidence about the eﬃcacy of the product candidate for speciﬁc,\ntargeted indications; to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.\n \nPhase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical eﬃcacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically\ndispersed clinical trial sites. The size of Phase 3 clinical trials depends upon clinical and statistical considerations for the product candidate and disease,\nbut sometimes can include several thousand patients. Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-beneﬁt ratio of the product candidate\nand provide an adequate basis for product labeling.\n \nClinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualiﬁed medical investigators\naccording to approved protocols that detail the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to\nbe used to monitor participant safety. Regulatory procedures diﬀer in each country we will be working in. For example, in the US, each protocol is\nsubmitted to the FDA as part of the IND for their review and consent before enrolling patients in the clinical trial. The US is not the only place to perform\nclinical trials. Most countries have systems in place to allow academics and companies to sponsor clinical trials of novel therapies in patients.

Other venues such as Europe, Canada, Japan and other Paciﬁc Rim countries may be included in the development program in\nthe future. The ﬁrst clinical trial with INKmune will be initiated in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, the regulatory submission is made to the\nMHRA for a clinical trials authorization (“CTA”). This is a multistep process. The Company had a Scientiﬁc Advice meeting with the MHRA in September\n2017 to discuss the INKmune Phase I/II trial in women with relapse/refractory ovarian cancer including trial design, manufacturing processes and clinical\ntrial execution. The MHRA gave recommendations on trial design, manufacturing controls and the regulatory procedures needed to initiate the clinical trial.\nWe received CTA approval from the MHRA for an INKmune trial in ovarian cancer on December 18, 2018. The approval allows for the execution of the\nPhase I/II INKmune clinical trial in the United Kingdom. We plan to have two cancer clinics referring the 6 patients needed for the Phase I portion of the\ntrial. We expect the ﬁrst Phase I sites to be in the United Kingdom. If the ﬁrst cohort of the Phase I trial proceeds as planned, we expect to expand the\nclinical trial in the United Kingdom and may include clinical sites in the US. Any Phase II program will start as a multi-national trial because at least 30\npatients will be required to complete the Phase II program. The additional clinical sites in the United Kingdom or US have not been identiﬁed at this time.\nNo additional regulatory procedures will be needed to add sites in the United Kingdom. To add sites in the US, we will need to ﬁle an IND with the FDA.\nOnce the FDA approves the IND, clinical sites can be opened. We have chosen relapsed/refractory ovarian cancer as the anticipated Phase 1 study for\nINKmune for a number of reasons. Relapsed refractory is a disease with poor treatment options. Our pre-clinical data suggests INKmune may have\nadvantages over other immunotherapies in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer has a sensitive and validated biomarker to measure disease\nburden – CA125. This allows the Company to accurately select patients for the clinical trial and determine if INKmune therapy is eﬀective. This provides\nregulatory advantages for registration of INKmune. INB03 will follow a similar development strategy but used Australia for the Phase I programs. In\nAustralia, clinical trials for INB03 are performed under the clinical trials notiﬁcation (“CTN”) scheme authorized by the Therapeutic Good Administration\n(“TGA”). The TGA is the equivalent agency to the FDA in the US and the MHRA in the United Kingdom. We ﬁled an Australian Clinical Trial Notiﬁcation, or\nCTN, for INB03 and XPro during the second quarter of 2018 and 2019 respectively. Applications were accepted in May 2018 and 2019 to allow us to\ninitiate the Phase I trials in cancer and Alzheimer’s disease respectively. We have completed the oncology Phase 1 open label dose escalation trial in\npatients with advanced solid tumors and biomarkers of inflammation in their blood.\n \n27\n \n \nThe INBO3 Phase I trial has been completed and provided evidence of safety and a pharmacodynamic drug aﬀect, decrease of inﬂammatory\nbiomarkers, needed to move the program to a Phase II clinical trial in cancer. The Phase II clinical trial will combine INB03 with approved second line\ntherapy in patients with HER2+ breast cancer with or without brain metastasis that have progressed after treatment with TDxd. This is a combination trial\nwhere the addition of INB03 to approved second line therapy may provide a therapeutic alternative in a disease without any drugs approved. The\nCompany has not lost interest in combining INB03 with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI), but competition for patients is ﬁerce in this arena. Our plan is\nto pursue treatment of tumors that express MUC4 as our lead indication. Tumors that express MUC4 are resistant to all forms of immunotherapy due to a\ncombination of increased MDSC in the tumor, decrease tumor macrophage (TAM) phagocytosis, decreased inflammation in the tumor (a “cold” tumor) and\ndirect eﬀects of MUC4 and soluble TNF on HER2 function. If combination therapy with INB03 decreases MUC4 expression and changes the TME to make\nthe “cold” tumor “hot”, then addition of a CPI will be warranted. At this time, the combination trial to treat MUC4+ TDxd resistant HER2+ expressing cancer\nis our most probable registration strategy for INB03. This includes the combination of INB03 with trastuzumab antibody drug conjugate therapy TDxd in\ncombination with a TKI and/or CPI. Current therapies for TDxd resistant cancers are used on a trial by error approach. Using MUC4 expression as a\nbiomarker for to predict resistance may bring a precision medicine approach to this diﬃcult clinical scenario. Addition of INB03 to the treatment regimen\nfor treating MUC4+ cancers may convert “cold” tumors to “hot” tumors making the eligible for treatment with CPI. The design and successful completion of\na Phase II trial is not guarantee of clinical relevance or commercial viability. There are multiple therapies on the market or in development for the treatment\nof resistant breast cancer. The introduction of TDxd to the clinician’s armamentarium is new and evolving. The future standard-of-care is not known. The\nregistration and development strategy for INB03 is multinational. The Phase II program may enroll patients in other countries, including the United States\nafter submitting an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. If partnering is successful at any stage\nof INB03 development, we expect the partner to inﬂuence the development and regulatory decisions needed with moving the drug to commercialization.\nFinally, combination therapy to treat patients resistant to trastuzumab or CPI are not the only oncology application for INB03. INB03 can be combined with\nother immune-oncology therapy to improve eﬃcacy, safety or both. INB03 can be used as part of combination therapy with immuno-oncology drugs,\npaired with tradition therapies such as cytotoxic chemotherapy, kinase inhibitors, cell therapies or radiation therapy. The company is pursuing pre-clinical\ndata in some of these areas. When and if positive developments occur, we will communicate them to our shareholders. There are other regulatory venues\nthat will be important for both our products – the largest and most important is Europe. In Europe, the European Medicines Agencies (“EMA”) is\nresponsible for authorization of clinical trials in member states. In EU, there may be a requirement to get individual country authorization at the same time\nas EMA authorization. The initial development of INB03 and XPro occurred in AUS followed by trials in other regulatory jurisdictions including the US. The\ndevelopment of INKmune will start in the United Kingdom followed by trials in the US. XPro is being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease\nunder a Part-the-Cloud Award received Feb 2019. The biomarker directed Phase I trial was performed in AUS using a regulatory strategy identical to that\nused for INB03 in cancer. Regulatory approval to initiate the trial was received on February 8, 2019. XPro treats microglial activation and innate immune\ndysregulation may be the cause with Alzheimer’s disease in some patients. To our knowledge, there are few companies using an anti-inﬂammatory\nstrategy for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Those companies include Denali Therapeutics (NASDAQ: DNLI); developing DNL747 that targets critical\nsignaling proteins in the TNF pathway that regulate inﬂammation and cell death. Alector (NASDAQ: ALEC) in partnership with Abbvie is developing AL002\nthat targets TREM2 on microglial cells. Gliacure is targeting microglial cells in Alzheimer’s disease with a small molecule candidate GC021109.\n \nLecanemab (Leqembi™; Eisai) was approved for the treatment of patients with Early AD in January 2023 This is this the second anti-amyloid\ndrug for the treatment of ealy AD to be approved. Donanemab (Lilly), a third drug anti-amyloid therapy for early AD is expected to be approved in the\nsecond half of 2023. These three drugs have similar eﬃcacy and safety proﬁles. One of the common safety problems is the development of ARIA\n(Alzheimer’s Related Imaging Abnormality) that causes a delay or discontinuation of therapy. ARIA is neuroinﬂammation related side-eﬀect more common\nin patients expressing ApoE4. The modest eﬃcacy, sub-optimal safety and diﬃculty of use makes combination therapy for the treatment of early AD an\nattractive development and therapeutic strategy. The Company is following the developments in this area closely.\n \n28\n \n \nClinical testing must satisfy extensive FDA regulations. Reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the\nFDA and safety reports must be submitted for serious and unexpected adverse events. Success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in\nlater stage clinical trials. The FDA, an IRB or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a ﬁnding that the research subjects\nor patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.\n \nNew Drug Applications\n \nAssuming successful completion of the required clinical trials, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are"

      "text": "submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. An NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information, as well as proposed labeling for the ﬁnished\nproduct. An NDA applicant must develop information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and ﬁnalize a process for manufacturing\nthe product in accordance with cGMP. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality product within speciﬁcations\napproved by the FDA. The manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the ﬁnal product. In addition, appropriate\npackaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable\ndeterioration over its shelf life. Prior to approval, the FDA will conduct an inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP.\n \nThe FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for ﬁling. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for\nﬁling. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for ﬁling. After an\napplication is ﬁled, the FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should\nbe approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers them carefully when\nmaking decisions. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisﬁed. Data obtained from clinical trials are not\nalways conclusive and the FDA may interpret data diﬀerently than we interpret the same data. The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may\nrequire additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure ﬁnal approval of the NDA. If a product receives\nregulatory approval, the approval may be signiﬁcantly limited to speciﬁc diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which\ncould restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to\nfurther assess a drug’s safety and eﬀectiveness after NDA approval and may require surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products\nwhich have been commercialized. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or\nefficacy questions are raised after the product reaches the market.\n \nPost-Approval Requirements\n \nAny products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA,\nincluding, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, distribution, and advertising\nand promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject\nto prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which\nsuch products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. Pharmaceutical manufacturers and their\nsubcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections\nby the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-\nparty manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the signiﬁcance of the change, may require prior\nFDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting\nrequirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money\nand eﬀort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. If our future\nsuppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may, among other things, halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from\ndistribution, or withdraw approval of the product.\n \n29\n \n \nThe FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product\nreaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or\nwith manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety\ninformation; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions\nunder a REMS program.\n \nThe FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products. A company can make only those claims\nrelating to safety and eﬃcacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and\nother agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of oﬀ-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result\nin, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally\navailable products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that diﬀer from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such oﬀ-label\nuses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such oﬀ-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied\ncircumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s\ncommunications on the subject of off-label use of their products.\n \nOther Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements\n \nOur sales, promotion, medical education, clinical research and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous\nregulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of\nJustice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and state and\nlocal governments. Our promotional and scientiﬁc/educational programs must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the civil False Claims Act,\nphysician payment transparency laws, privacy laws, security laws, and additional federal and state laws similar to the foregoing.\n \nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, the knowing and willing, direct or indirect oﬀer, receipt, solicitation or payment of\nremuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients, including the purchase, order or lease of any good, facility, item or service that would be\npaid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. Remuneration has been broadly deﬁned to include anything of\nvalue, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced-price items and services. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply\nto arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneﬁciaries on the other.\nAlthough there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and\nsafe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or\nrecommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular\napplicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the\nlegality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have\ninterpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal\nhealthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. The government has enforced the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to\nreach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham research or consulting and other ﬁnancial arrangements with physicians. Further, a\nperson or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or speciﬁc intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the\ngovernment may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or\nfraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private\npayors."

The FCA has been used to prosecute persons or entities that “cause” the submission of claims for payment that are\ninaccurate or fraudulent, by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product oﬀ-label, submitting claims\nfor services not provided as claimed, or submitting claims for services that were provided but not medically necessary. Actions under the FCA may be\nbrought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in signiﬁcant\nmonetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of signiﬁcant liability, in its investigation\nand prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for\nunapproved uses and other illegal sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multibillion dollar settlements under the\nFCA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, certain companies that were found to be in violation of the\nFCA have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans, and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate integrity\nagreements, restricting the manner in which they conduct their business.\n \nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among\nother things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare beneﬁt program, including private third-party\npayors; knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, ﬁctitious or fraudulent statement in\nconnection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare beneﬁts, items or services; and willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare\noﬀense. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Aﬀordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA\nsuch that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\n \nGiven the signiﬁcant size of actual and potential settlements, we expect that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to\ninvestigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse\nstatutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and\nother state programs. Additionally, to the extent that our products, once commercialized, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign\nlaws.\n \nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare\nproviders. The Patient Protection and Aﬀordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the\nAﬀordable Care Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies\nfor which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with speciﬁc exceptions, for payments or other\ntransfers of value made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their\nimmediate family members. Covered manufacturers are required to collect and report detailed payment data and submit legal attestation to the accuracy\nof such data to the government each year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000\nper year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that\nare not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Additionally, entities that do not comply with mandatory reporting\nrequirements may be subject to a corporate integrity agreement. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose\nrestrictions on covered manufacturers’ marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to\nphysicians and other healthcare professionals.\n \nWe may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes\nspeciﬁed requirements on certain health care providers, plans and clearinghouses (collectively, “covered entities”) and their “business associates,” relating\nto the privacy, security and transmission of individually identiﬁable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards\ndirectly applicable to “business associates,” deﬁned as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit\nprotected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal\npenalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority\nto ﬁle civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil\nactions. In addition, certain states have their own laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which\ndiffer from each other and/or HIPAA in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\n \n31\n \n \nCoverage and Reimbursement\n \nSales of pharmaceutical products depend signiﬁcantly on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement are provided by third-party\npayors. Third-party payors include state and federal government health care programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and other\norganizations. Although we currently believe that third-party payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, we\ncannot be certain of this. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the cost-eﬀectiveness, and reducing reimbursement for\nmedical products and services. In addition, signiﬁcant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. The U.S.\ngovernment, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on\ncoverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and\nadoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. We may need to\nconduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-eﬀectiveness of our products. The product candidates that we develop may not be\nconsidered cost-eﬀective and thus may not be covered or suﬃciently reimbursed. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek coverage and\nreimbursement from third-party payors, as each payor will make its own determination as to whether to cover a product and at what level of\nreimbursement. Thus, one payor’s decision to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that another payor will\nprovide coverage or that the reimbursement levels will be adequate. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply\nthat an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or suﬃcient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive\nand profitable basis.\n \nHealthcare Reform"

      "text": "The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the\nhealthcare system in ways that could aﬀect our ability to sell our products proﬁtably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere,\nthere is signiﬁcant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or\nexpanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these eﬀorts and has been signiﬁcantly aﬀected by\nmajor legislative initiatives.\n \nBy way of example, in March 2010, the Aﬀordable Care Act (“ACA”) was signed into law, intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce\nor constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and\nhealth insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the\nACA of importance to our potential drug candidates are:\n \n \n●\nan annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures, or imports speciﬁed branded prescription drugs and biologic agents,\napportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n \n \n \n \n●\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the\naverage manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;\n \n \n \n \n●\na new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are\ninhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;\n \n \n \n \n●\na new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to oﬀer 50% point-of-sale discounts oﬀ\nnegotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneﬁciaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer’s\noutpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n \n \n \n \n●\nextension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care\norganizations;\n  \n32\n \n \n \n●\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to oﬀer Medicaid coverage to additional\nindividuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty\nlevel, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;\n \n \n●\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and\n \n \n \n \n●\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical eﬀectiveness\nresearch, along with funding for such research.\n \nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include, among others, the\nBudget Control Act of 2011, which mandates aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per ﬁscal year eﬀective April 1, 2013,\nand, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in eﬀect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013,\nPresident Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several\nproviders, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to\nproviders from three to ﬁve years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.\n \nSince its enactment, there have been judicial, administrative, executive and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021\nthe U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without speciﬁcally ruling on the\nconstitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in eﬀect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, President Biden issued\nan executive order to, among other things, instruct certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit\naccess to health care, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and\npolicies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.\n \nOn March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate\ncap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1,\n2024. Payment methodologies may also be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, Centers for Medicare and\nMedicaid Services may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. There also has been heightened governmental\nscrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in\nseveral recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more\ntransparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient\nprograms and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. By way of example, in August 2022, the Inﬂation Reduction Act of\n2022, or the IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare\n(beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price\nincreases that outpace inﬂation (ﬁrst due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in\n2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as\nopposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be eﬀectuated, or the impact of the IRA on\nour business.\n \nAt the state level, legislatures in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control\npharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost\ndisclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition,\nregional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which\nsuppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs.\n \nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage\ncriteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in\nreimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The\nimplementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain proﬁtability or"

      "text": "RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\n \nWe will need additional capital. If additional capital is not available or is available at unattractive terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce the\nscope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or curtail our operations.\n \nAs of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $52.2 million and we had $15 million of outstanding debt. \nIn order to develop and\nbring our product candidates to market, we must commit substantial resources to costly and time-consuming research, preclinical and clinical trials and\nmarketing activities. We anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to maintain our current operations for at least the next twelve\nmonths. We anticipate using our cash and cash equivalents to fund further research and development with respect to our lead product candidates. We\nmay, however, need to raise additional funding sooner if our business or operations change in a manner that consumes available resources more rapidly\nthan we anticipate. Our requirements for additional capital will depend on many factors, including:\n \n \n●\nsuccessful commercialization of our product candidates;\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates;\n \n \n \n \n●\ncosts associated with protecting our intellectual property rights;\n \n \n \n \n●\ndevelopment of marketing and sales capabilities;\n \n \n \n \n●\npayments received under future collaborative agreements, if any; and\n \n \n \n \n●\nmarket acceptance of our products, if any.\n \nIssuances of additional debt or equity securities could impact the rights of the holders of our common stock and will dilute their ownership\npercentage. Moreover, the establishment of other funding facilities may impose restrictions on our operations. These restrictions could include limitations\non additional borrowing and speciﬁc restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem our\nstock or make investments. We may also raise additional capital by pursuing opportunities for the licensing or sale of certain intellectual property and other\nassets. We cannot oﬀer assurances, however, that any strategic collaboration, sales of securities or sales or licenses of assets will be available to us on a\ntimely basis or on acceptable terms, if at all. We may be required to enter into relationships with third parties to develop or commercialize products or\ntechnologies that we otherwise would have sought to develop independently, and any such relationships may not be on terms as commercially favorable\nto us as might otherwise be the case.\n \nIn the event that suﬃcient additional funds are not obtained through strategic collaboration opportunities, sales of securities, funding facilities,\nlicensing arrangements, borrowing arrangements and/or asset sales on a timely basis, we may be required to reduce expenses through the delay,\nreduction or curtailment of our projects, or further reduction of costs for facilities and administration.\n \nWe cannot provide assurances that changed or unexpected circumstances will not result in the depletion of our capital resources more rapidly\nthan we currently anticipate. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital in suﬃcient amounts or on favorable terms, or at\nall. If we are unable to raise adequate additional capital when required or in suﬃcient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to delay, scale\nback or discontinue one or more product development programs, curtail our commercialization activities, signiﬁcantly reduce expenses, sell assets\n(potentially at a loss), enter into relationships with third parties to develop or commercialize products or technologies that we otherwise would have sought\nto develop or commercialize independently, cease operations altogether, pursue an acquisition of our company at a price that may result in up to a total\nloss on investment for our stockholders, file for bankruptcy or seek other protection from creditors, or liquidate all of our assets.\n \n35\n \n \nTo fund our operations and service our debt, we will be required to generate a signiﬁcant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash\ndepends on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt obligations would have a material\nadverse eﬀect on our business, ﬁnancial condition, cash ﬂows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common\nstock to decline.\n \nPrevailing economic conditions and ﬁnancial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may aﬀect our ability to make\npayments on our debt. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such\nas refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Alternatively, we may\nalso attempt to reﬁnance certain of our debt, for example, to extend maturities. Our ability to restructure or reﬁnance our debt will depend on the capital\nmarkets and our ﬁnancial condition at such time. If we are unable to access the capital markets, whether because of the condition of those capital markets\nor our own ﬁnancial condition or reputation within such capital markets, we may be unable to reﬁnance our debt. In addition, any reﬁnancing of our debt\ncould be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Our\ninability to generate suﬃcient cash ﬂow to satisfy our debt obligations or to reﬁnance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could\nhave a material adverse eﬀect on our business, ﬁnancial condition, cash ﬂows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common\nstock and/or debt securities to decline.\n \nOur ability to continue to reduce our indebtedness will depend upon factors including our future operating performance, our ability to access the\ncapital markets to reﬁnance existing debt and prevailing economic conditions and ﬁnancial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our\ncontrol. We can provide no assurance of the amount by which we will reduce our debt, if at all. In addition, servicing our debt will result in a reduction in\nthe amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including operating costs and research and development costs.\n \nOur debt agreement contains covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.\n \nThe terms of our debt agreement contains, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to\noperate our business, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt or issue guarantees, create liens, repurchase stock,\nor make other restricted payments, and make certain voluntary prepayments of speciﬁed debt. As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to\nchanges in business and economic conditions and engage in beneﬁcial transactions, including to obtain additional ﬁnancing as needed, may be restricted.\nFurthermore, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to\naccelerate our obligation to repay the debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have suﬃcient funds available to repay it. The Company violated\ncertain non-financial debt covenants during 2022 and obtained a waiver from its lender for the violations during February 2023."

If the FDA does not remove the clinical hold on a timely basis, or at all, our development timelines\nand our business may be adversely affected, and our stock price may decline.\n \nAs previously announced by the Company in a press release dated on May 23, 2022, the FDA placed a full clinical hold on XPro, requesting\nadditional information around the Company’s chemistry manufacturing and controls for the treatment.  The Company is working with the regulatory body\nto have the current hold removed as soon as possible, but it is not yet clear when the hold will be lifted. If the FDA does not lift the clinical hold in a timely\nmanner, or at all, our long-term development timeline for XPro and our business, ﬁnancial condition or results of operations, may be adversely aﬀected.\nThe trial for XPro in Alzheimer’s disease is currently open in Australia and Canada.\n \nWe face intense competition in the markets targeted by our lead product candidates. Many of our competitors have substantially greater\nresources than we do, and we expect that all of our product candidates under development will face intense competition from existing or future\ndrugs.\n \nWe expect that all of our product candidates under development, if approved, will face intense competition from existing and future drugs\nmarketed by large companies. These competitors may successfully market products that compete with our products, successfully identify drug candidates\nor develop products earlier than we do, or develop products that are more effective, have fewer side effects or cost less than our products, if any.\n \n36\n \n \nAdditionally, if a competitor receives FDA approval before we do for a drug that is similar to one of our product candidates, FDA approval for our\nproduct candidate may be precluded or delayed due to periods of non-patent exclusivity and/or the listing with the FDA by the competitor of patents\ncovering its newly-approved drug product. Periods of non-patent exclusivity for new versions of existing drugs such as our current product candidates can\nextend up to three and one-half years. See “Business — Government Regulation.”\n \nThese competitive factors could require us to conduct substantial new research and development activities to establish new product targets, which\nwould be costly and time consuming. These activities would adversely affect our ability to commercialize products and achieve revenue and profits.\n \nCompetition and technological change may make our product candidates and technologies less attractive or obsolete.\n \nWe compete with established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are pursuing other forms of treatment for the same indications we\nare pursuing and that have greater ﬁnancial and other resources. Other companies may succeed in developing products earlier than us, obtaining FDA\napproval for products more rapidly, or developing products that are more eﬀective than our product candidates. Research and development by others may\nrender our technology or product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive, or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy we develop. We face\ncompetition from companies that internally develop competing technology or acquire competing technology from universities and other research\ninstitutions. As these companies develop their technologies, they may develop competitive positions that may prevent, make futile, or limit our product\ncommercialization efforts, which would result in a decrease in the revenue we would be able to derive from the sale of any products.\n \nThere can be no assurance that any of our product candidates will be accepted by the marketplace as readily as these or other competing\ntreatments. Furthermore, if our competitors’ products are approved before ours, it could be more diﬃcult for us to obtain approval from the FDA. Even if\nour products are successfully developed and approved for use by all governing regulatory bodies, there can be no assurance that physicians and patients\nwill accept our product(s) as a treatment of choice.\n \nFurthermore, the pharmaceutical research industry is diverse, complex, and rapidly changing. By its nature, the business risks associated\ntherewith are numerous and signiﬁcant. The eﬀects of competition, intellectual property disputes, market acceptance, and FDA regulations preclude us\nfrom forecasting revenues or income with certainty or even confidence.\n \nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to pursue the development of our technologies and products would be negatively\naffected.\n \nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our technologies and products. If we do not\nadequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies to produce and market drugs in direct competition with us\nand erode our competitive advantage. Some foreign countries lack rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights and do not protect\nproprietary rights to the same extent as the United States. Many companies have had diﬃculty protecting their proprietary rights in these foreign countries.\nWe may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights.\n \nWe have received, and are currently seeking, patent protection for numerous compounds and methods of treating diseases. However, the patent\nprocess is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our products by obtaining\nand defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following: patents that may be issued or licensed may be challenged, invalidated, or\ncircumvented, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage; our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than us and\nmany of which have made signiﬁcant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere\nwith, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the United States or in international markets; there may be signiﬁcant\npressure on the United States government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the\nUnited States for treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; countries other than the United States\nmay have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create,\ndevelop, and market competing products.\n  \n37\n \n \nMoreover, any patents issued to us may not provide us with meaningful protection, or others may challenge, circumvent or narrow our patents.\nThird parties may also independently develop products similar to our products, duplicate our unpatented products or design around any patents on\nproducts we develop. Additionally, extensive time is required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product. While extensions of\npatent term due to regulatory delays may be available, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent,\neven with an extension, may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantages of the patent.\n \nIn addition, the United States Patent and Trademark Oﬃce (the “USPTO”) and patent oﬃces in other jurisdictions have often required that patent"

Our success will depend in part on the ability\nof our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce our licensed intellectual property. Our licensors may not successfully prosecute any applications for or\nmaintain intellectual property to which we have licenses, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing such intellectual\nproperty, or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would. Without protection for the intellectual property we license, other companies might\nbe able to offer similar products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects. If we lose any of\nour right to use third-party intellectual property, it could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our technologies, products or services, as well as harm\nour competitive business position and our business prospects.\n \n38\n \n \nWe are dependent on our licensing agreement with Xencor, and the termination of this agreement could a have an adverse eﬀect on our\nbusiness.\n \nOn October 3, 2017, the Company entered into a license agreement with Xencor, Inc., which has discovered and developed a proprietary\nbiological molecule that inhibits soluble tumor necrosis factor. Pursuant to the license agreement, Xencor granted the Company an exclusive worldwide,\nroyalty-bearing license in licensed patent rights, licensed know-how and licensed materials to make, develop, use, sell and import any pharmaceutical\nproduct that comprises, contains, or incorporates Xencor’s proprietary protein known as XPro that inhibits soluble tumor necrosis factor (or all\nmodiﬁcations, formulations and variants of the licensed protein that speciﬁcally bind soluble tumor necrosis factor) alone or in combination with one or\nmore active ingredients, in any dosage or formulation. If we breach this Agreement Xencor may be able to terminate it and as a result of this terminate our\nbusiness could be negatively impacted.\n \nOur officers and Directors own the company that we license our INKmune patent from.\n \nOn October 29, 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Immune Ventures, LLC (Immune Ventures). The license agreement\nrelates to our natural killer program, INKmune. Immune Ventures is owned by our RJ Tesi, our CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors, David Moss,\nour Chief Financial Oﬃcer and Treasurer and Mark Lowdell, our Chief Scientiﬁc Oﬃcer. Because our oﬃcers and directors also own Immune Ventures\nthere may be an inherent conflict of interest which could result in unanticipated actions that adversely affect us.\n \nWe have a limited operating history and expect to incur significant additional operating losses.\n \nWe are an early-stage company formed in September 2015 and have only a limited operating history. Therefore, there is limited historical financial\ninformation upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. Our prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses, and\ndiﬃculties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of operations. We expect to incur substantial additional operating expenses over the\nnext several years as our research, development, and commercial activities increase. The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve\nproﬁtability are uncertain. Our ability to generate material revenue and achieve proﬁtability will depend on, among other things, successful completion of\nthe preclinical and clinical development of our product candidate; obtaining necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA and international regulatory\nagencies; implementing successful manufacturing, sales, and marketing arrangements; and raising suﬃcient funds to ﬁnance our activities. If we are\nunsuccessful at some or all of these undertakings, our business, prospects, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\n \nINKmune represents a novel approach to cancer treatment that creates significant challenges for us.\n \nWe believe INKmune represents a novel approach to cancer treatment. Advancing this novel therapy creates signiﬁcant challenges for us,\nincluding:\n \n \n●\nEducating medical personnel regarding the potential side effect profile of INKmune;\n \n \n \n \n●\nSourcing clinical and, if approved, commercial supplies for the materials used to manufacture and process our product candidates;\n \n \n \n \n●\nObtaining regulatory approval, as the FDA and other regulatory authorities have limited experience with commercial development of\nimmunotherapies for cancer; and\n \n \n \n \n●\nEstablishing sales and marketing capabilities upon obtaining any regulatory approval to gain market acceptance of a novel therapy.\n \nEven if we are able to commercialize any product candidate that we develop, the product may become subject to unfavorable pricing\nregulations, third-party payor reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives that could harm our business."

If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nEven if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish and maintain pricing suﬃcient to\nrealize a meaningful return on our investment.\n \n39\n \n  \nThere is signiﬁcant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drugs. Marketing approvals, pricing\nand reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be\nmarketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some non-U.S. markets,\nprescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain\nmarketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of the product, possibly for\nlengthy time periods, which may negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing\nlimitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\n \nWe depend on obtaining certain patents and protecting our proprietary rights.\n \nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary\nrights of third parties or having third parties circumvent our rights. We have ﬁled and are actively pursuing a patent application for our product candidates.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual\nquestions. Thus, there can be no assurance that our patent application will result in the issuance of a patent, that we will develop additional proprietary\nproducts that are patentable, that any patents issued to us will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by any third parties,\nthat the patents of others will not impede our ability to do business or that third parties will not be able to circumvent our patents. Furthermore, there can\nbe no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate any of our products not under patent protection, or, if patents are\nissued to us, design around the patented products we developed or will develop.\n \nWe may be required to obtain licenses from third parties to avoid infringing patents or other proprietary rights. No assurance can be given that any\nlicenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights would be made available, if at all, on terms we ﬁnd acceptable. If we do not obtain such\nlicenses, we could encounter delays in the introduction of products or could ﬁnd that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such\nlicenses could be prohibited.\n \nA number of pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research and academic institutions have developed\ntechnologies, ﬁled patent applications or received patents on various technologies that may be related to or aﬀect our business. Some of these\ntechnologies, applications or patents may conﬂict with our technologies or patent applications. Such conﬂict could limit the scope of the patents, if any,\nthat we may be able to obtain or result in the denial of our patent applications. In addition, if patents that cover our activities are issued to other companies,\nthere can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses to these patents at a reasonable cost or be able to develop or obtain alternative\ntechnology. If we do not obtain such licenses, we could encounter delays in the introduction of products, or could ﬁnd that the development, manufacture\nor sale of products requiring such licenses could be prohibited. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against\nus on patents it might infringe or in filing suits against others to have such patents declared invalid.\n \nMuch of our know-how and technology may not be patentable. To protect our rights, we plan to require employees, consultants, advisors and\ncollaborators to enter into conﬁdentiality agreements. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for\nour trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure. Further, our business may be adversely\naffected by competitors who independently develop competing technologies, especially if we obtain no, or only narrow, patent protection.\n \n40\n \n \nWe are subject to various government regulations.\n \nThe manufacture and sale of human therapeutic products in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions are governed by a variety of statutes and\nregulations. These laws require approval of manufacturing facilities, controlled research and testing of products and government review and approval of a\nsubmission containing manufacturing, preclinical and clinical data in order to obtain marketing approval based on establishing the safety and eﬃcacy of\nthe product for each use sought, including adherence to current cGMP during production and storage, and control of marketing activities, including\nadvertising and labeling.\n \nThe products we are currently developing will require signiﬁcant development, preclinical and clinical testing and investment of substantial funds\nprior to its commercialization. The process of obtaining required approvals can be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that we\ndevelop successfully this product or any future products, or that this product or any future products we develop will prove to be safe and effective in clinical\ntrials or receive applicable regulatory approvals. Potential investors and shareholders should be aware of the risks, problems, delays, expenses and\ndifficulties which we may encounter in view of the extensive regulatory environment which controls our business.\n \nIf we are unable to keep up with rapid technological changes in our field or compete effectively, we will be unable to operate profitably.\n \nWe are engaged in a rapidly changing ﬁeld. Other products and therapies that will compete directly with the product that we are seeking to\ndevelop and market currently exist or are being developed. Competition from fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and more established\nbiotechnology companies is intense and is expected to increase. Most of these companies have signiﬁcantly greater ﬁnancial resources and expertise in\ndiscovery and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than us. Smaller companies may\nalso prove to be signiﬁcant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biopharmaceutical or\nbiotechnology companies. Many of these competitors have signiﬁcant products that have been approved or are in development and operate large, well-\nfunded discovery and development programs. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also\nconduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for therapeutic products and clinical development and marketing.\nThese companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualiﬁed scientiﬁc and management personnel. In addition to the\nabove factors, we will face competition based on product efficacy and safety, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, availability of supply, marketing"

While we will seek to\nexpand our technological capabilities in order to remain competitive, there can be no assurance that research and development by others will not render\nour technology or products obsolete or non-competitive or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy we develop, or that any therapy we\ndevelop will be preferred to any existing or newly developed technologies.\n \nWe may request priority review for our product candidate in the future. The FDA may not grant priority review for our product candidate.\nMoreover, even if the FDA designates such product for priority review, that designation may not lead to a faster regulatory review or approval\nprocess and, in any event, would not assure FDA approval.\n \nWe may be eligible for priority review designation for our product candidate if the FDA determines such product candidate oﬀers major advances\nin treatment or provides a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review designation means that the goal for the FDA to review an\napplication in six months, rather than the standard review period of ten months. The FDA has broad discretion with respect to whether or not to grant\npriority review status to a product candidate, so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for such designation or status, the FDA may\ndecide not to grant it. Thus, while the FDA has granted priority review to other oncology disease products, our product candidate, should we determine to\nseek priority review, may not receive similar designation. Moreover, even if our product candidate is designated for priority review, such a designation\ndoes not necessarily mean a faster regulatory review process or necessarily confer any advantage with respect to approval compared to conventional\nFDA procedures. Receiving priority review from the FDA does not guarantee approval within an accelerated timeline or thereafter.\n \n41\n \n \nWe believe we may in some instances be able to secure approval from the FDA or comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities to use\naccelerated development pathways. If we are unable to obtain such approval, we may be required to conduct additional preclinical studies or\nclinical trials beyond those that we contemplate, which could increase the expense of obtaining, and delay the receipt of, necessary marketing\napprovals.\n \nWe anticipate that we may seek an accelerated approval pathway for our product candidates. Under the accelerated approval provisions in the\nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the FDA’s implementing regulations, the FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product designed\nto treat a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic beneﬁt over available therapies upon a determination that the product\nhas an eﬀect on a surrogate endpoint or intermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical beneﬁt. The FDA considers a clinical\nbeneﬁt to be a positive therapeutic eﬀect that is clinically meaningful in the context of a given disease, such as irreversible morbidity or mortality. For the\npurposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other\nmeasure that is thought to predict clinical beneﬁt, but is not itself a measure of clinical beneﬁt. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a clinical endpoint that\ncan be measured earlier than an eﬀect on irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an eﬀect on irreversible morbidity or\nmortality or other clinical beneﬁt. The accelerated approval pathway may be used in cases in which the advantage of a new drug over available therapy\nmay not be a direct therapeutic advantage but is a clinically important improvement from a patient and public health perspective. If granted, accelerated\napproval is usually contingent on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval conﬁrmatory studies to verify and\ndescribe the drug’s clinical benefit. If such post-approval studies fail to confirm the drug’s clinical benefit, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug.\n \nPrior to seeking such accelerated approval, we will seek feedback from the FDA and will otherwise evaluate our ability to seek and receive such\naccelerated approval. There can be no assurance that after our evaluation of the feedback and other factors we will decide to pursue or submit a New\nDrug Application, or NDA, for accelerated approval or any other form of expedited development, review or approval. Similarly, there can be no assurance\nthat after subsequent FDA feedback we will continue to pursue or apply for accelerated approval or any other form of expedited development, review or\napproval, even if we initially decide to do so. Furthermore, if we decide to submit an application for accelerated approval or under another expedited\nregulatory designation (e.g., breakthrough therapy designation), there can be no assurance that such submission or application will be accepted or that\nany expedited development, review or approval will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. The FDA or other non-U.S. authorities could also require us to\nconduct further studies prior to considering our application or granting approval of any type. A failure to obtain accelerated approval or any other form of\nexpedited development, review or approval for our product candidate would result in a longer time period to commercialization of such product candidate,\ncould increase the cost of development of such product candidate and could harm our competitive position in the marketplace.\n \nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs or experience\ndelays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidate.\n \nOur product candidates are either in early clinical development or have not entered into clinical trials and are in development stage. Therefore,\nthe risk of failure of our product candidates is high. It is impossible to predict when or if our product candidates will prove eﬀective or safe in humans or will\nreceive regulatory approval. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete\npreclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and eﬃcacy of our product candidate in humans. Clinical\ntesting is expensive, diﬃcult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical\ntrials can occur at any stage of testing. The clinical development of our product candidates is susceptible to the risk of failure inherent at any stage of drug\ndevelopment, including failure to demonstrate eﬃcacy in a clinical trial or across a broad population of patients, the occurrence of severe or medically or\ncommercially unacceptable adverse events, failure to comply with protocols or applicable regulatory requirements and determination by the FDA or any\ncomparable non-U.S. regulatory authority that a drug product is not safe or eﬀective for its intended uses. It is possible that even if our product candidate\nhas a beneﬁcial eﬀect, that eﬀect will not be detected during clinical evaluation as a result of one or more of a variety of factors, including the size,\nduration, design, measurements, conduct or analysis of our clinical trials. Conversely, as a result of the same factors, our clinical trials may indicate an\napparent positive eﬀect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive eﬀect, if any. Similarly, in our clinical trials we may fail to detect\ntoxicity of, or intolerability caused by our product candidates, or mistakenly believe that our product candidates are toxic or not well tolerated when that is\nnot in fact the case.\n \n42\n \n \nThe outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a\nclinical trial do not necessarily predict ﬁnal results.

In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying\ninterpretations and analyses. Many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have\nnonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for the product candidates. Even if we believe that the results of clinical trials for our product candidate\nwarrant marketing approval, the FDA or comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities may disagree and may not grant marketing approval of our product\ncandidate.\n \nIn some instances, there can be signiﬁcant variability in safety or eﬃcacy results between diﬀerent clinical trials of the same product candidate\ndue to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, diﬀerences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes\nin and adherence to the clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. Any clinical trials that we may conduct may not\ndemonstrate the efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidate.\n \nThe results of preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials may not be predictive of future results.

In addition, initial success in clinical trials may not be indicative of results obtained\nwhen such trials are completed. In particular, the small number of patients in our planned early clinical trials may make the results of these trials less\npredictive of the outcome of later clinical trials. For example, even if successful, the results of our initial clinical trials for XPro may not be predictive of the\nresults of further clinical trials of this drug candidate or any of our other drug candidates. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data often are susceptible to\nvarying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their drug candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and\nclinical trials nonetheless have failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. Our future clinical trials may not ultimately be successful or support\nfurther clinical development of any of our drug candidates. There is a high failure rate for drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials. A number of\ncompanies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suﬀered signiﬁcant setbacks in clinical development even after achieving\nencouraging results in earlier studies.

Interim data from clinical trials that we may\ncomplete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data\nbecome available. Preliminary or top-line data also remain subject to audit and veriﬁcation procedures that may result in the ﬁnal data being materially\ndiﬀerent from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the ﬁnal data are\navailable. Adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our reputation and business prospects.\n \nIf clinical trials of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and eﬃcacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and comparable non-U.S.\nregulators, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and\ncommercialization of our product candidates.\n \nWe are not permitted to commercialize, market, promote or sell any product candidate in the United States without obtaining marketing approval\nfrom the FDA.

Qualiﬁcation to\nmaintain orphan drug status is generally monitored by the regulatory authorities during the orphan drug exclusivity period, currently seven years from the\ndate of approval in the United States.\n \nWe intend to seek orphan drug designation in the United States for our product candidate for the treatment of AML and ovarian cancer and we\nexpect to rely on orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidate. Even if granted, orphan drug designation, and related market exclusivity, in the United\nStates could be lost. Further, even if we are granted orphan drug status, the FDA can still approve diﬀerent drugs for use in treating the same indication or\ndisease, which would create a more competitive market for us, and our revenues will be diminished.\n \nFurther, for our product candidate, it is possible that another company also holding orphan drug designation for the same product candidate will\nreceive marketing approval for the same indication before we do. If that were to happen, our applications for that indication may not be approved until the\ncompeting company’s period of exclusivity expires. Even if we are the ﬁrst to obtain marketing authorization for an orphan drug indication, there are\ncircumstances under which a competing product may be approved for the same indication during the seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, such as if\nthe later product is shown to be clinically superior to the orphan product, or if the later product is deemed a diﬀerent product than ours. Further, the seven-\nyear marketing exclusivity would not prevent competitors from obtaining approval of the same product candidate as ours for indications other than those in\nwhich we have been granted orphan drug designation, or for the use of other types of products in the same indications as our orphan product.\n \n46\n \n \nIf the market opportunities for our product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, our revenues may be adversely aﬀected, and our\nbusiness may suﬀer. Because the target patient populations of our product candidates are small, we must be able to successfully identify\npatients and capture a significant market share to achieve and maintain profitability.\n \nWe focus our research and product development on treatments for certain cancer indications. Our projections of both the number of people who\nhave failed other therapies or have limited medical options for such indications, are based on estimates. These estimates may prove to be incorrect and\nnew studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence. The number of patients with such diseases in the United States, Europe and elsewhere\nmay turn out to be lower than expected or may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our products, or new patients may become increasingly\ndiﬃcult to identify or gain access to, all of which would adversely aﬀect our results of operations and our business. Additionally, because our target patient\npopulations are small, we will be required to capture a significant market share to achieve and maintain profitability.\n \nWe may fail to comply with regulatory requirements .\n \nOur success will be dependent upon our ability, and our collaborative partners’ abilities, to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements,\nincluding cGMP, and safety reporting obligations. The failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, ﬁnes,\ninjunctions, civil penalties, total or partial suspension of regulatory approvals, refusal to approve pending applications, recalls or seizures of products,\noperating and production restrictions and criminal prosecutions.\n \nEven if our product candidates receive marketing approval, they may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients,\nthird-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success and the market opportunity for the product\ncandidates may be smaller than we estimate."

Even if INKmune, our DN-TNF product platform (INB03 or XPro), or any other product candidate we\ndevelop is approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities for marketing and sale, it may nonetheless fail to gain suﬃcient market acceptance by\nphysicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. For example, physicians are often reluctant to switch their patients from\nexisting therapies even when new and potentially more effective or convenient treatments enter the market. Further, patients often acclimate to the therapy\nthat they are currently taking and do not want to switch unless their physicians recommend switching products or they are required to switch therapies due\nto lack of reimbursement for existing therapies.\n \nEﬀorts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the beneﬁts of our product candidate may require signiﬁcant resources and\nmay not be successful. If our product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of market acceptance, we may not generate\nsigniﬁcant revenues and we may not become proﬁtable. The degree of market acceptance of INmune or any other product candidate we develop, if\napproved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n \n \n●\nthe efficacy and safety of the product;\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe potential advantages of the product compared to alternative treatments;\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n \n \n \n \n●\nwhether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-line therapy or as a second- or third-line therapy;\n \n \n●\nlimitations or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions, contained in the product’s approved labeling;\n \n \n \n \n●\nour ability to offer the product for sale at competitive prices;\n \n \n \n \n●\nour ability to establish and maintain pricing sufficient to realize a meaningful return on our investment;\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe product’s convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n \n47\n \n \n \n●\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try, and of physicians to prescribe, the product;\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe strength of sales, marketing and distribution support;\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe approval of other new products for the same indications;\n \n \n \n \n●\nchanges in the standard of care for the targeted indications for the product;\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe timing of market introduction of our approved products as well as competitive products and other therapies;\n \n \n \n \n●\navailability and amount of reimbursement from government payors, managed care plans and other third-party payors;\n \n \n \n \n●\nadverse publicity about the product or favorable publicity about competitive products; and\n \n \n \n \n●\npotential product liability claims.\n \nThe potential market opportunities for our product candidate are diﬃcult to estimate precisely. Our estimates of the potential market opportunities\nare predicated on many assumptions, including industry knowledge and publications, third-party research reports and other surveys. While we believe that\nour internal assumptions are reasonable, these assumptions involve the exercise of signiﬁcant judgment on the part of our management, are inherently\nuncertain and the reasonableness of these assumptions has not been assessed by an independent source. If any of the assumptions proves to be\ninaccurate, the actual markets for our product candidate could be smaller than our estimates of the potential market opportunities.\n \nEven if we obtain regulatory approvals for INKmune and/or any product from our DN-TNF platform (INB03, XPro) those approvals and ongoing\nregulation of our products may limit how we manufacture and market our products, which could prevent us from realizing the full beneﬁt of our\nefforts.\n \nIf we obtain regulatory approvals, INKmune and/or the DN-TNF product platform, and the manufacturing facilities used for its production will be\nsubject to continual review, including periodic inspections, by the FDA and other United States and foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, regulatory\nauthorities may impose signiﬁcant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of INKmune or other products that we may develop. These and other\nfactors may significantly restrict our ability to successfully commercialize INKmune.\n \nWe and many of our vendors and suppliers will be required to comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, which include\nrequirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as to the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Furthermore,\nany manufacturing facilities will need to be approved by regulatory agencies before these facilities can be used to manufacture, and they will also be\nsubject to additional regulatory inspections. Any material changes we may make to our manufacturing process may require approval by the FDA and state\nor foreign regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with FDA or other applicable regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution, civil penalties,\nrecall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a product from the market.\n \nWe must also report adverse events that occur when our products are used. The discovery of previously unknown problems with INKmune, the\nDN-TNF product platform or manufacturing facilities used to manufacture INKmune, or the DN-TNF product platform may result in restrictions or sanctions\non our products or manufacturing facilities, including withdrawal of our products from the market.

However, we may not be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements, or\nif we are able to do so, their sales forces may not be successful in marketing our products. Any revenue we receive would depend upon the eﬀorts of such\nthird parties, which may not be successful. We may have little or no control over the sales, marketing and distribution eﬀorts of such third parties and our\nrevenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized our product candidates ourselves. We also face competition in our search for\nthird parties to assist us with the sales, marketing and distribution eﬀorts of our product candidates. There can be no assurance that we will be able to\ndevelop internal sales, marketing distribution capabilities or establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators to commercialize any product\nin the United States or overseas.\n \nWe face substantial competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and our operating results may suﬀer if we fail to\ncompete effectively.\n \nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We expect that we will face significant competition from major\npharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide with respect to INKmune, our DN-TNF product\nplatform, and any other of our product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. Speciﬁcally, due to the large unmet medical\nneed, global demographics and relatively attractive reimbursement dynamics, the oncology market is ﬁercely competitive and there are a number of large\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of product candidates for the\ntreatment of cancer. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing technologies and drug products that are more eﬀective, have\nfewer or more tolerable side eﬀects or are less costly than any product candidates that we are currently developing or that we may develop, which could\nrender our product candidates obsolete and noncompetitive.\n \n50\n \n \nWe rely on key personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualiﬁed personnel, we may not be able to grow\neffectively.\n \nWe are dependent on certain members of our management, the loss of services of one or more of whom could materially adversely aﬀect us. In\nparticular, our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued services of Dr. Raymond J. Tesi, our President and CEO. Dr. Tesi has overseen\nINmune Bio since inception and provides leadership for our growth and operations strategy as well as being an inventor of our patents. Although we have\nentered into an employment agreement with Dr. Tesi, if he were to nevertheless terminate his employment with us, the loss of the services of Dr. Tesi,\nwould have a material adverse eﬀect on our growth, revenues, and prospective business. We are also highly dependent on the other principal members of\nour management and scientiﬁc team. We are not aware of any present intention of any of our key personnel to leave our company or to retire. The loss of\nany of our key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain qualiﬁed personnel, may signiﬁcantly delay or prevent the achievement of our research,\ndevelopment or business objectives and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n \nOur ability to manage growth eﬀectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our management systems and to recruit and train\nnew employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel.\n \nProduct liability lawsuits against us could divert our resources, cause us to incur substantial liabilities and limit commercialization of any\nproducts that we may develop.\n \nWe face an inherent risk of product liability claims as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidate despite obtaining appropriate informed\nconsents from our clinical trial participants. We will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any product that we may develop. For example, we\nmay be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or\nsale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the\nproduct, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot\nsuccessfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product\ncandidate. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n \n \n●\ndecreased demand for our product candidate or products that we may develop;\n \n \n \n \n●\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n \n \n \n \n●\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n \n \n \n \n●\nsignificant costs to defend resulting litigation;\n \n \n \n \n●\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n \n \n \n \n●\nloss of revenue;\n \n \n \n \n●\nreduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\n \nAlthough we plan to maintain general liability insurance, this insurance may not fully cover potential liabilities that we may incur. The cost of any\nproduct liability litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. In addition, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly\nexpensive. If we are unable to obtain or maintain suﬃcient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product\nliability claims, it could prevent or inhibit the development and commercial production and sale of our product candidate, which could adversely aﬀect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n \n51"

We also intend to add personnel in our research and development and manufacturing departments as we expand our clinical trial and research\ncapabilities. Any inability to attract and retain qualiﬁed employees to enable our planned growth and establish additional capabilities or our failure to\nmanage our growth effectively could delay or curtail our product development and commercialization efforts and harm our business.\n \nIf we or any of our third-party manufacturers do not maintain high standards of manufacturing, our ability to develop and commercialize our\nproduct candidate could be delayed or curtailed.\n \nWe and any third parties that we may use in the future to manufacture our products must continuously adhere to cGMP regulations rigorously\nenforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. If our facilities or the facilities of third parties who produce our products do not pass a pre-\napproval inspection, the FDA will not grant market approval for our product candidates. In complying with cGMP, we and any third-party manufacturers will\nneed to expend signiﬁcant time, money and eﬀort in production, record-keeping and quality control to assure that each component of our product\ncandidates meets applicable speciﬁcations and other requirements. We or any of these third-party manufacturers may also be subject to comparable or\nmore stringent regulations of foreign regulatory authorities. If we or any of our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with these requirements, we may be\nsubject to regulatory action, which could delay or curtail our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize our product candidates. If\nour component part manufacturers and suppliers fail to provide components of sufficient quality, and that meet our required specifications, our clinical trials\nor commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or halted, and we could face product liability claims.

We and such manufacturers will be subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the\nUnited States governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of medical and hazardous materials. Although we will seek to ensure that\nour procedures for using, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of\ncontamination or injury resulting from medical or hazardous materials. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability or local, city,\nstate or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable\nfor damages or penalized with ﬁnes, and the liability could exceed our resources. We do not have any insurance for liabilities arising from medical or\nhazardous materials. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may\nimpair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\n \nWe plan to rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates. Any failure by a third party to meet its obligations with\nrespect to the clinical development of our product candidate may delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product\ncandidates.\n \nWe plan to rely on academic institutions and private oncology centers to conduct clinical trials relating to our product candidates. Our reliance on\nthird parties to conduct clinical trials could, depending on the actions of such third parties, jeopardize the validity of the clinical data generated and\nadversely affect our ability to obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities.\n \nSuch clinical trial arrangements will provide us with information rights with respect to the clinical data, including access to and the ability to use\nand reference the data, including for our own regulatory ﬁlings, resulting from the clinical trials. If investigators or institutions breach their obligations with\nrespect to the clinical trials of our product candidate, or if the data proves to be inadequate, then our ability to design and conduct any future clinical trials\nmay be adversely affected.\n \n52\n \n \nOur reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our\nresponsibilities. For example, we will design our clinical trials and will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in\naccordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to\nas good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible\nand accurate and that the rights, integrity and conﬁdentiality of trial participants are protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control will not\nrelieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials\non a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within speciﬁed timeframes. Failure to do so can result in ﬁnes, adverse publicity and civil and\ncriminal sanctions.\n \nFurthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do\nnot successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our\nstated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidate and will not be able to, or\nmay be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidate.\n \nWe also expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials.

There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory\nproposals at the federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot\npredict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing eﬀorts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and\nother payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect:\n \n \n●\nthe demand for any of our products, if approved;\n \n \n \n \n●\nour ability to set a price that we believe is fair for any of our products, if approved;\n \n \n \n \n●\nour ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability;\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe level of taxes that we are required to pay; and\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe availability of capital.\n \nIn March 2010, the Aﬀordable Care Act, or the ACA, became law in the United States (see “Business — Government Regulation”). The goal of\nACA is to reduce the cost of healthcare, broaden access to health insurance, constrain healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse,\nadd transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry, impose additional health\npolicy reforms, and substantially change the way healthcare is ﬁnanced by both governmental and private insurers. While we cannot predict what impact\non federal reimbursement policies this legislation will have in general or on our business speciﬁcally, ACA may result in downward pressure on\npharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of any of our products, if they are approved.\n \n53\n \n \nWe cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory\ndevelopments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse eﬀect on anticipated\nrevenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may aﬀect our overall ﬁnancial\ncondition and ability to develop product candidates.\n \nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\n \nAs is the case with other pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly on obtaining and\nenforcing patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the pharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity, and therefore, is\ncostly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent\nreform legislation. Further, recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have either narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or\nweakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this\ncombination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained.\n \nIn September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the American Invents Act, or AIA, was signed into law. The AIA includes a number\nof signiﬁcant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that aﬀect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also aﬀect patent\nlitigation. The USPTO is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the AIA, and many of the substantive changes to\npatent law associated with the AIA. It is not clear what other, if any, impact the AIA will have on the operation of our business. Moreover, the AIA and its\nimplementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent application, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business and financial condition.\n \nAn important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a “ﬁrst-to-ﬁle” system for deciding\nwhich party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are ﬁled by diﬀerent parties claiming the same invention. A third party that\nﬁles a patent application in the USPTO after that date but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had\nmade the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to ﬁling of a patent\napplication. Furthermore, our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends on whether the diﬀerences between our technology and\nthe prior art allow our technology to be patentable over the prior art. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are\nconﬁdential for a period of time after ﬁling, we cannot be certain that we were the ﬁrst to either (1) ﬁle any patent application related to our product\ncandidates or (2) invent any of the inventions claimed in our patents or patent applications.\n \nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may ﬁle a patent infringement suit and providing\nopportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16,\n2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal court necessary to\ninvalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding suﬃcient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even\nthough the same evidence would be insuﬃcient to invalidate the claim if ﬁrst presented in a district court action.

[RESERVED]\n \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our ﬁnancial statements and\nnotes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical ﬁnancial information, the following discussion and analysis contains\nforward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results could diﬀer materially from those anticipated by these\nforward-looking statements as a result of many factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these diﬀerences below and\nelsewhere in this Form 10-K, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements.”\n \nOverview\n \nWe are a clinical-stage immunology company focused on developing drugs that may reprogram the patient’s innate immune system to treat\ndisease. We believe this may be done by targeting cells of the innate immune system that cause acute and chronic inﬂammation and are involved in\nimmune dysfunction associated with chronic diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. The Company’s drugs are in clinical trials and\nhave not been approved by a regulatory authority. The Company has two therapeutic platforms – a dominant-negative TNF platform (“DN-TNF”, “XPro™”,\n“XPro1595™” or “pegipanermin”) and a Natural Killer (“NK”, or “INKmune™”) platform. The DN-TNF platform neutralizes soluble TNF (“sTNF”) without\naﬀecting trans-membrane TNF (“tmTNF”) or TNF receptors -TNFR1 and TNFR2. This unique biologic mechanism diﬀerentiates the DN-TNF drugs from\ncurrently approved non-selective TNF inhibitors that inhibit both sTNF and tmTNF. Protecting the function of tmTNF and TNF receptors while neutralizing\nthe function of sTNF is a potent anti-inﬂammatory strategy that does not cause immunosuppression or demyelination which occur in the currently\napproved non-selective TNF inhibitors. Currently approved non-selective TNF inhibitors treat autoimmune disease, but are contraindicated in patients with\ninfection, cancer and neurologic diseases because they increase the risk of infection, cancer and demyelinating neurologic diseases, respectively; all the\nsafety problems are due to oﬀ-target eﬀects on inhibiting tmTNF. The NK platform targets the dysfunctional natural killer cells in patients with cancer. NK\ncells are part of the normal immunologic response to cancer with important roles in immunosurveillance to prevent cancer and in preventing relapse by\neliminating residual disease. Residual disease is the cancer left behind after therapy is ﬁnished. Residual disease can grow to cause relapse. The\nmechanism by which INKmune improves the ability of the patient’s NK cells to kill their cancer is complex. The NK cells of cancer patients lose the ability\nto bind and kill cancer cells. A measure of NK cell binding to cancer cells is avidity. The higher the avidity, the greater the bond between the NK cell to\ncancer cell and thus the greater NK killing of cancer cells. INKmune increase NK avidity and further improves mitochondrial function and upregulates\nnutrient receptors. These metabolic changes may help the INKmune primed NK cell to function in the hostile tumor microenvironment and persist much\nlonger. These mechanisms improve the ability of INKmune primed NK cells to overcome the immune evasion of the patient’s cancer cells. We believe"

      "text": "INKmune is best used to eliminate residual disease after the patient has completed other cancer therapies. Both the DN-TNF platform and the INKmune\nplatform can be used to treat multiple diseases. The DN-TNF platform will be used as an immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer and\nneurodegenerative disease. INKmune is being developed to treat NK sensitive hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.  \n \n60\n \n \nWe believe our DN-TNF platform can be used as a cancer therapy to reduce resistance in immunotherapy and as a CNS (“central nervous\nsystem”) therapy to target glial activation to prevent progression of Alzheimer’s disease (“AD”), and to target neuroinﬂammation in treatment resistant\ndepression (“TRD”) and as a drug to prevent muscle degeneration, prevent ﬁbrosis and promote muscle regeneration in Duchene muscular dystrophy\n(DMD). The drug is named diﬀerently for the oncology and CNS indications; INB03™ or XPro™, respectively, but it is the same drug product. For DMD,\nthe company is exploring DN-TNF compounds that is optimized for the treatment of DMD. This novel compound has the same mechanism of action but\nhas novel IP protection. In each case, we believe neutralizing sTNF is a cornerstone to the treatment of these diseases. As an immunotherapy for cancer,\nwe are using INB03 to neutralize sTNF produced by HER2+ trastuzumab resistant breast cancers to reverse resistance to targeted therapy. sTNF\nproduced by the tumor causes an up-regulation of MUC4 express causing steric hindrance of trastuzumab binding to the HER receptor on HER2+ breast\ncancer cells. Without binding, trastuzumab based therapies are not eﬀective. Neutralizing sTNF reverses MUC4 expression converting a trastuzumab\nresistant breast cancer cell into a trastuzumab sensitive breast cancer cell. In addition, INB03 changes the immunobiology of the tumor microenvironment\nby decreasing the number of immunosuppressive myeloid cells, both myeloid derived suppressor cells and tumor active macrophages, and increasing the\nnumber of cytotoxic lymphocytes and phagocytic macrophages in the TME. The Company has completed an open label dose escalation trial in cancer\npatients with metastatic solid tumors that have failed multiple lines of therapy. The trial informs the design of the Phase II trial by demonstrating that INB03\nwas safe and well tolerated, deﬁned the dose of INB03 to carry into Phase II trials, and demonstrated a pharmacodynamic end-point. A Phase II trial is\nplanned in patients with advanced MUC4+ expressing cancer.\n \nLikewise, we believe the DN-TNF platform can be used to treat selected neurodegenerative diseases by modifying the brain microenvironment\n(“BME”). The Company believes the core pathology of cognitive decline is a combination of neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction.\nNeurodegeneration is nerve cell death that may include demyelination. Synaptic dysfunction means the connections between nerve cells stop working\neﬃciently and may decrease in number. The combination of neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction causes cognitive decline and behavioral\nchanges associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD. XPro completed a Phase I trial treating patients with Alzheimer’s disease that was partially funded by a\nPart-the-Clouds Award from the Alzheimer’s Association. We believe XPro targets activated microglia and astrocytes of the brain that produce sTNF that\npromotes nerve cell loss and synaptic dysfunction, key elements in the development of dementia. In animal models, elimination of sTNF prevents nerve\ncell dysfunction and reverses synaptic pruning. The Phase I trial in patients with biomarkers of inﬂammation with AD has been completed. The open label,\ndose escalation trial was designed to demonstrate that XPro can safely decrease neuroinﬂammation in patients with ADi. The endpoints of the trial are\nmeasures of neuroinﬂammation and neurodegeneration in blood and cerebral spinal ﬂuid by measuring changes in inﬂammatory cytokine levels in the\nCNS and using MRI-DTI to measure white matter free water. White matter free water; a validated measure of neuroinﬂammation in the brain. XPro, at the\n1mg/kg/week dose decreased inﬂammatory cytokines in the CSF and decreased white matter free water in the brain demonstrating that XPro can\ndecrease neuroinﬂammation in patients with AD. We also studied downstream beneﬁts of decreasing neuroinﬂammation by measuring changes in the\nCSF proteome and quantifying changes in novel white matter MRI biomarkers. XPro signiﬁcantly decreases biomarkers of neurodegeneration as\nmeasured by changes in the CSF proteome including neuroﬁlament light chain, phospho Tau 217 and VILIP-1; decreases of 84%, 46% and 91%\nrespectively after 3 months of therapy. Three months of XPro therapy improved measures of synaptic function, as measured in the CSF proteome\nincluding a 222% increase in Contactin 2 and a 56% decrease neurogranin, changes that contribute to improved synaptic function.\n \nThe successful completion of the Phase I trial in AD has informed the design of a blinded randomized, placebo controlled Phase II trials in patients\nwith early ADi. Early ADi includes patients with AD and MCI who have at least one biomarker of inﬂammation (ADi and MCI2 respectively). The early ADi\ntrial is a blinded randomized trial to test if treatment of early AD patients with neuroinﬂammation with XPro will aﬀect cognitive decline. The Phase II trial in\nearly ADi has six important elements. Two hundred patients are being enrolled in a 2:1 ratio (XPro vs placebo). The patients will receive 1mg/kg/week as\na subcutaneous injection for six months. An enrichment strategy identical to the successful strategy used in the Phase I trial will be used to ensure patients\nhave neuroinﬂammation. Patients will need to have one or more enrichment criteria: elevated blood level of at least one of C-reactive protein, hemoglobin\nA1c, erythrocyte sedimentation and at least one allele of ApoE4. The primary end-point will be Early/mild Alzheimer’s Cognitive Composite (“EMACC”), a\nvalidated cognitive measure that is more sensitive than traditional end-points used in many studies of patients with early AD. The trial is open in Australia\nand Canada and will open in the US pending the lift of a clinical hold by the US FDA. All patients will be oﬀered to stay on therapy for at least 12 months in\nan extension trial. Clinical and biomarker data will be collected during the extension trial.\n \n61\n \n  \nEﬀective therapy for TRD is a large unmet need. Twenty percent of patients with a Major Depressive Disorder have TRD. Once third of TRD\npatients have peripheral biomarkers to inﬂammation (elevated CRP). This is a large patient population. The role of TNF and anti-TNF therapeutics was\nexplored in a small open label clinical trial by Prof. Andrew Miller, MD of Emory University demonstrated the patients have elevated TNF levels and\ntreatment with inﬂiximab treated their depression (Miller, 2011). The Company received a $2.9M USD award from the National Institute of Mental Health\n(“NIMH”) to treat TRD with XPro. The blinded, randomized Phase II trial will use biomarkers of peripheral inﬂammation to select patients with TRD for\nenrollment. Patients will be treated for 6 weeks. Primary end-points include both clinical and neuroimaging measures. The ﬁnal trial design is ongoing and\ndiscussions with the FDA are not complete. The Company anticipates receiving authorization to initiate the clinical trial once the pending clinical hold is\nlifted.\n \nWe believe that INKmune improves the ability of the patient’s own NK cells to attack their tumor. INKmune interacts with the patient’s NK cells to\nconvert them from inert resting NK cells into memory-like NK cells that kill the patient’s cancer cells. INKmune is a replication incompetent proprietary cell\nline that is given to the patient after determining that i) the patient has adequate NK cells in their circulation and ii) those NK cells are functional when\nexposed to INKmune in vitro. INKmune is designed to be given to patients after their immune system has recovered after cytotoxic chemotherapy to target\nthe residual disease the remains after treatment with cytotoxic therapy. We believe INKmune can be used to treat numerous hematologic malignancies\nand solid tumors including leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, lung, ovary, breast, renal and prostate cancer. The Company has initiated a Phase I\ntrial using INKmune to treat patients with high risk MDS/AML, a form of leukemia. One patient has been treated in the Phase I trial for MDS and three\npatients have been treated compassionately in AML. In the four patients, INKmune therapy is safe, produces memory-like NK cells that kill cancer in vitro,\npromotes development of cancer killing memory-like NK cells that can be found in the patient’s circulation of 4 months. The Company will continue to\nenroll patients in the Phase I trial. The Company intends to initiate a separate Phase I/2 trial of INKmune in a solid tumor during 2023.\n \n62"

To date, we have generated no significant\nrevenue. We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deﬁcit of approximately\n$91.0 million. Our net losses were $27,299,000 and $30,340,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Clinical site initiation\nand patient enrollment have and may continue to be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic. Some patients\nhave not, and others may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services.\nSimilarly, the ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staﬀ who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to\nCOVID-19, may adversely impact the Company’s clinical trial operations.\n \nThe severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to,\nthe duration and severity of the pandemic and the extent and severity of the impact on the Company’s service providers, suppliers, contract research\norganizations (“CROs”) and the Company’s clinical trials, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. As of the date of issuance of Company’s\nﬁnancial statements, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may materially impact the Company’s ﬁnancial condition, liquidity or results of\noperations is uncertain.\n \n63\n \n \nAs a company with less than $1.07 billion in revenue during our last ﬁscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS\nAct.

We track outsourced development\ncosts by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, other internal costs or external consultant costs to speciﬁc\nproduct candidates or development programs.\n \nWe participate, through our wholly-owned subsidiary in Australia, in the Australian research and development tax incentive program, such that a\npercentage of our qualifying research and development expenditures are reimbursed by the Australian government, and such incentives are reﬂected as a\nreduction of research and development expense.

The United Kingdom has recently enacted certain\nchanges to the research and development program which will limit the research and development tax incentive available to the Company. The United\nKingdom research and development tax incentive is recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the incentive will be received, the relevant\nexpenditure has been incurred and the amount of the consideration can be reliably measured.\n \nSubstantially all of our research and development expenses to date have been incurred in connection with our current and future product\ncandidates. We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as we advance an increased number of\nour product candidates through clinical development, including the conduct of our planned clinical trials and manufacturing drug to be used in those\nclinical trials. The process of conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. The successful development\nof product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or costs required to complete the remaining\ndevelopment of any product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of product candidates.\n \nThe costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project owing to, but not limited to, the following:\n \n \n●\nper patient trial costs;\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe number of sites included in the clinical trials;\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe countries in which the clinical trials are conducted;\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe length of time required to enroll eligible patients;\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe number of patients that participate in the clinical trials;\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe number of doses that patients receive;\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe cost of comparative agents used in clinical trials;\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;\n \n \n \n \n●\npotential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies;\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe duration of patient follow-up;\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate; and\n \n \n \n \n●\nthe cost of manufacturing, finishing, labeling and storage drug used in the clinical trial\n \nWe do not expect any of our product candidates to be commercially available for at least the next several years, if ever. We expect to continue to\nincur signiﬁcant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future, which may ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-\nyear.

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to\nmake estimates and assumptions that aﬀect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date\nof our ﬁnancial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on\nan ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances,\nthe results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nActual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n \nIn-Process Research and Development\n \nThe Company evaluates the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consists of in-process research and development (“IPR&D”),\non an annual basis or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. An impairment of indeﬁnite-lived intangible assets would occur if the fair value\nof the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. Intangible assets with ﬁnite lives are tested for impairment when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If these facts and circumstances exist, the Company assesses for\nrecovery by comparing the carrying values of the assets with their future undiscounted net cash ﬂows. Signiﬁcant management judgment is required in the\nforecast of future operating results that are used in the preparation of expected undiscounted cash flows.\n \n66\n \n \nIPR&D assets are considered to be indeﬁnite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development projects.\nDuring the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are tested for impairment. If the related project is terminated or abandoned, the Company\nmay have a full or partial impairment related to the IPR&D assets, calculated as the excess of their carrying value over fair value. The valuation process is\nvery complex and requires signiﬁcant input and judgment using internal and external sources with respect to the Company’s future revenue and expense\ngrowth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, and other assumptions and estimates.\n \nResearch and Development (“R&D”)\n \nR&D expenses consist primarily of costs related to clinical studies and outside services, personnel expenses, and other R&D expenses. Clinical\nstudies and outside services costs relate primarily to services performed by clinical research organizations and related clinical or development\nmanufacturing costs, materials and supplies, ﬁling fees, regulatory support, and other third-party fees. Personnel expenses relate primarily to salaries,\nbenefits and share-based compensation. R&D expenditures are charged to operations as incurred.\n \nWe recognize R&D tax credits receivable from the United Kingdom and Australian government for spending on R&D as a reduction of R&D\nexpenses.\n \nStock-Based Compensation\n \nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted to service providers, employees, and directors based on\nthe estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. We calculate the estimated fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes\noption-pricing model, which is impacted by the fair value of our common stock, as well as changes in assumptions regarding a number of highly complex\nand subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the market value of common stock on the grant date, the expected dividend yield,\nthe expected term of the awards, the risk-free interest rates and the expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards. The\nexpected volatility is based on the historical volatility of a few unrelated public companies within our industry over the most recent period commensurate\nwith the estimated expected term of our stock options as we have insufficient historical information regarding the volatility of the share price of our common\nstock. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in eﬀect at the time of grant. We\nhave never declared or paid dividends and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future.\n \nWe recognize the fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the period during which a service provider is required to provide services\nin exchange for the award (generally the vesting period). We account for forfeitures as they occur.\n \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under SEC rules.\n \nLicensing and Collaboration Agreements\n \nWe anticipate that in-licensing, out-licensing and strategic collaborations will become an integral part of our operations, providing the company\nwith opportunities to leverage our partners’ expertise and capabilities to further expand the potential of our technologies, product candidates and revenue\nstreams.\n \nXencor"

The increase in general and administrative expenses is largely due to higher compensation, including stock-based compensation\n($1.5 million higher during the year ended December 31, 2022) and higher rent expense and right of use asset impairment ($0.2 million higher during the\nyear ended December 31, 2022), partially offset by lower consulting expense ($1.5 million lower during the year ended December 31, 2022).\n \nResearch and Development\n \nResearch and development expenses decreased to $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $20.5 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. The decrease in research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 is mainly due to\nthe Company incurring $4.6 million of lower manufacturing costs in connection with producing its DN-TNF product and also due to incurring $2.6 million of\nlower expenses on the COVID-19 clinical trial, partially oﬀset by the Company’s compensation (including stock-based compensation) which was $1.8\nmillion higher in 2022 compared to 2021.\n  \nOther Expense, net\n \nOther expense, net increased to $1.3 million during the year ending December 31, 2022, compared to $1.2 million during the year ending\nDecember 31, 2021. The increase in other expense is due to higher interest expense on the Company’s debt ($1.0 million higher), partially oﬀset by $0.7\nmillion higher interest income from money market investments.\n \n68\n \n \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \nLiquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations and otherwise operate on\nan ongoing basis.\n \nWe incurred a net loss of $27,299,000 and $30,340,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash used in\noperating activities was $22,686,000 and $28,504,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Since inception, we have funded\nour operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of our common stock and from the receipts of grants. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and\ncash equivalents of $52,153,000. We anticipate that operating losses and net cash used in operating activities will increase over the next few years as we\nadvance our products under development.\n \nOur primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, third-party clinical and preclinical research and development services, costs\nincurred to manufacture our drugs under development, compensation and related expenses, legal, patent and other regulatory expenses and general\noverhead costs. We believe our use of CROs provides us with flexibility in managing our spending.\n \nThe Company incurs the majority of its research and development expenses in Australia and the United Kingdom. Fluctuations in the rate of\nexchange between the United States dollar and the pound sterling as well as the Australian dollar could adversely aﬀect our ﬁnancial results, including our\nexpenses as well as assets and liabilities. We currently do not hedge foreign currencies but will continue to assess whether that strategy is appropriate. As\nof December 31, 2022, the cash balance held by our foreign subsidiaries with currencies other than the United States dollar was approximately $0.1\nmillion.\n \nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deﬁcit of $91.0 million and working capital of $53.8 million.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash ﬂows for each of the two years in the period\nended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “ﬁnancial statements”). In our opinion, the ﬁnancial statements present\nfairly, in all material respects, the ﬁnancial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash ﬂows\nfor each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica\n \nBasis for Opinion\n \nThese ﬁnancial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s ﬁnancial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting ﬁrm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not\nrequired to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an\nunderstanding of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the eﬀectiveness of the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n \nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁnancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures\nin the ﬁnancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and signiﬁcant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n \n/s/ Marcum LLP"

(the “Company” or “INmune Bio”) was organized in the State of Nevada on September 25, 2015 and is a clinical stage biotechnology\npharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing its product candidates to treat diseases where the innate immune system is not\nfunctioning normally and contributing to the patient’s disease. INmune Bio has two product platforms. The DN-TNF product platform utilizes dominant-\nnegative technology to selectively neutralize soluble TNF, a key driver of innate immune dysfunction and mechanistic target of many diseases. DN-TNF is\ncurrently being developed for Alzheimer’s and treatment resistant depression (“XPro”) and cancer (“INB03”) and an out-licensing strategy for Duchenne’s\nMuscular Dystrophy (“DMD”). The Natural Killer Cell Priming Platform includes INKmune aimed at priming the patient’s NK cells to eliminate minimal\nresidual disease in patients with cancer. INmune Bio’s product platforms utilize a precision medicine approach for the treatment of a wide variety of\nhematologic malignancies, solid tumors and chronic inflammation.\n \nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\n \nThe accompanying consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\n(“US GAAP”) in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\n \nThe consolidated ﬁnancial statements herein have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP and include the accounts of INmune Bio, its wholly-\nowned UK subsidiary, and its wholly-owned Australia subsidiary (collectively, the “Company”). All signiﬁcant intercompany accounts and transactions have\nbeen eliminated.\n \nNOTE 2 – LIQUIDITY\n \nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deﬁcit of $ 91,014,000 and experienced losses since its inception. The Company had cash,\ncash equivalents of $52,153,000 as of December 31, 2022 and has not generated positive cash ﬂows from operations. To date, the Company has funded\nits operations primarily through the sale of its common stock. Although it is diﬃcult to predict the Company’s liquidity requirements, as of December 31,"

      "text": "2022, and based upon the Company’s current operating plan, the Company believes that it will have suﬃcient cash to meet its projected operating\nrequirements for at least the next 12 months following the ﬁling date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K based on the balance of cash available as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\n \nManagement expects operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that the Company will ever earn revenues or\nachieve proﬁtability, or if achieved, that they will be sustained on a continuing basis. In addition, the manufacturing, clinical and preclinical development\nactivities as well as the commercialization of the Company’s products, if approved, will require signiﬁcant additional ﬁnancing. The Company may be\nunable to secure such ﬁnancing when needed, or if available, such ﬁnancings may be under terms that are unfavorable to the Company or the current\nstockholders. If the Company is unable to raise additional funds when needed, it may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate development\nprograms, which may adversely affect its business and operations.\n \nF-7 \n \n \nNOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n \nUse of Estimates\n \nPreparing ﬁnancial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that aﬀect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions.\n \nRisks and Uncertainties\n \nThe Company is subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the\nCompany’s business is highly uncertain and diﬃcult to predict. Also, economies worldwide have also been negatively impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic, however policymakers around the globe have responded with ﬁscal policy actions to support the healthcare industry and economy as a whole.\nThe magnitude and overall effectiveness of these actions remain uncertain.\n \nIn addition, the Company’s clinical trials have been aﬀected by and may continue to be aﬀected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical site initiation and\npatient enrollment have and may continue to be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic. Some patients have\nnot, and others may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Similarly,\nthe ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staﬀ who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-\n19, may adversely impact the Company’s clinical trial operations.\n \nThe severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the\nduration and severity of the pandemic and the extent and severity of the impact on the Company’s service providers, suppliers, contract research\norganizations (“CROs”) and the Company’s clinical trials, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. As of the date of issuance of Company’s\nﬁnancial statements, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may materially impact the Company’s ﬁnancial condition, liquidity or results of\noperations is uncertain.\n \nCash and Cash Equivalents\n \nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company\nholds cash in banks in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. However, the Company believes risk of loss is minimal as the\ncash is held by large, highly-rated financial institutions. \n \nF-8 \n \n \nResearch and Development Tax Incentive Receivable\n \nThe Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary in Australia, participates in the Australian research and development tax incentive program, such that\na percentage of our qualifying research and development expenditures are reimbursed by the Australian government, and such incentives are reﬂected as\na reduction of research and development expense. The Australian research and development tax incentive is recognized when there is reasonable\nassurance that the incentive will be received, the relevant expenditure has been incurred and the amount of the consideration can be reliably measured.\nAt each period end, management estimates the reimbursement available to the Company based on available information at the time.\n \nThe Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom, participates in the research and development program provided by the United\nKingdom tax relief program, such that a percentage of our qualifying research and development expenditures are reimbursed by the United Kingdom\ngovernment, and such incentives are reﬂected as a reduction of research and development expense. The United Kingdom research and development tax\nincentive is recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the incentive will be received, the relevant expenditure has been incurred and the\namount of the consideration can be reliably measured. At each period end, management estimates the reimbursement available to the Company based\non available information at the time.\n \nIntangible Assets\n \nThe Company capitalizes costs incurred in connection with in-process research and development purchased from others if the asset has alternative uses\nand such uses are not restricted under applicable license agreements; patent applications (principally legal fees), patent purchases, and trademarks\nrelated to its cell line as intangible assets. Acquired in-process research and development costs that do not have alternative uses are expensed as\nincurred. When the assets are determined to have a ﬁnite life (upon completion of the development of the in-process research and development for its\nDN-TNF platform), the useful life will be determined, and the in-process research and development intangible assets will be amortized.\n \nDuring the fourth quarter and if business factors indicate more frequently, the Company performs an assessment of the qualitative factors aﬀecting the fair\nvalue of our in-process research and development. If the qualitative assessment suggests that impairment is more likely than not, a quantitative analysis is\nperformed. The quantitative analysis involves a comparison of the fair value of the in-process research and development with the carrying amount. If the\ncarrying amount of the in-process research and development exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of its in-process research and development and"

      "text": "determined that there were no indicators of impairment.\n \nBasic and Diluted Loss per Share\n \nBasic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares\nduring the period. Diluted loss per share gives eﬀect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes\nall potential common shares if their eﬀect is anti-dilutive. For all periods presented, there is no diﬀerence in the number of shares used to calculate basic\nand diluted shares outstanding due to the Company’s net loss position.\n \nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had 4,841,417 potentially issuable shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and 74,074\npotentially issuable shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants.\n \nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had 4,097,000 potentially issuable shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and 93,866\npotentially issuable shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants.\n  \nF-9 \n \n \nRevenue Recognition\n \nThe Company recognizes revenue when the customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reﬂects the consideration the\nCompany expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company recognizes revenue following the ﬁve-step model prescribed under\nASC Topic 606: (1) identify contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4)\nallocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenues when (or as) the Company satisﬁes the\nperformance obligations. The Company records the expenses related to revenue in research and development expense, in the periods such expenses\nwere incurred.\n \nThe Company records deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance, including amounts which are refundable.\n \nThe Company’s 2022 and 2021 revenue was from the sale of MSC’s to one and three customers, respectively, and was recognized when the MSC’s were\ndelivered to the customers. \n \nStock-Based Compensation\n \nThe Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards at the date of grant, which requires the\ninput of highly subjective assumptions, including expected volatility and expected life. Changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially aﬀect the\nmeasure of estimated fair value of our share-based compensation. These assumptions are subjective and generally require signiﬁcant analysis and\njudgment to develop. When estimating fair value, some of the assumptions will be based on, or determined from, external data and other assumptions\nmay be derived from our historical experience with stock-based payment arrangements. The appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a\nmatter of judgment, based on relevant facts and circumstances. The Company accounts for forfeitures of stock options as they occur.\n \nResearch and Development\n \nResearch and development (“R&D”) costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development credits are recorded by the Company as a reduction of\nresearch and development costs. Major components of research and development costs include cash compensation, stock-based compensation, costs of\npreclinical studies, clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing, costs of drug development, costs of materials and supplies, facilities cost, overhead\ncosts, regulatory and compliance costs, and fees paid to consultants and other entities that conduct certain research and development activities on the\nCompany’s behalf.\n \nThe Company recognizes grants as contra research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations on a systematic basis over the\nperiods in which the entity recognizes as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.\n \nIncome Taxes\n \nThe Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for\nthe estimated tax consequences attributable to diﬀerences between the ﬁnancial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis\n(temporary diﬀerences). The eﬀect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes\nthe enactment date.\n \nForeign Currency Translation\n \nThe Company’s ﬁnancial statements are presented in the U.S. dollar (“$”), which is the Company’s reporting currency, while its functional currencies are\nthe U.S. Dollar for its U.S. based operations, British Pound (“GBP”) for its United Kingdom-based operations and Australian Dollars (“AUD”) for its\nAustralian-based operations. All assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, stockholders’ equity is translated at\nhistorical rates and statement of operations items are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation\nadjustments are reported under other comprehensive income. Gains and losses resulting from the translations of foreign currency transactions and\nbalances are reflected in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss.\n \nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n \nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments, as clariﬁed in subsequent amendments. ASU 2016-13 changes the impairment model for certain ﬁnancial instruments. The new model is a\nforward-looking expected loss model and will apply to ﬁnancial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost and certain oﬀ-balance\nsheet credit exposures. This includes loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, loan commitments, ﬁnancial guarantees and net investments in leases, as\nwell as trade receivables. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, credit losses will be measured in a manner similar to today, except\nthat the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. In October 2019, the FASB voted to delay\nthe eﬀective date of this standard. Topic 326 will be eﬀective for the Company on January 1, 2023. The Company does not expect this standard to have a\nmaterial effect on the Company’s financial statements."

During February 2023, the Company received $3,763,000 of R&D tax credit reimbursements from Australia.\n \nXencor, Inc. License Agreement\n \nOn October 3, 2017, the Company entered into a license agreement (“Xencor License Agreement”) with Xencor, Inc. (“Xencor”), which has discovered\nand developed a proprietary biological molecule that inhibits soluble tumor necrosis factor. During June 2021, the Company entered into the First\nAmendment to License Agreement. Pursuant to the license agreement, Xencor granted the Company an exclusive worldwide, royalty-bearing license in\nlicensed patent rights, licensed know-how and licensed materials (as deﬁned in the license agreement) to make, develop, use, sell and import any\npharmaceutical product that comprises, contains, or incorporates Xencor’s proprietary protein known as “XPro” that inhibits soluble tumor necrosis factor\n(or all modiﬁcations, formulations and variants of the licensed protein that speciﬁcally bind soluble tumor necrosis factor) alone or in combination with one\nor more active ingredients, in any dosage or formulation (“Licensed Products”). The Company believes the protein has numerous medical applications.\nSuch additional alternative applications of the technology are available under the Xencor License Agreement. In connection with the Xencor License\nAgreement, the Company paid Xencor a one-time non-creditable and non-refundable fee of $100,000 and issued Xencor 1,585,000 shares of the\nCompany’s common stock with a fair value of $12,221,000. In addition, the Company issued Xencor fully vested warrants with a fair value of $ 4,193,000\nto purchase an additional number of shares of common stock equal to 10% of the fully diluted company shares immediately following such purchase,\nwhich warrant has since been cancelled (see the description below). The aggregate purchase price for the full exercise of the warrant was $10,000,000.\n \nThe Company recorded $16,514,000 for the acquisition of intangible assets for the in-process research and development as the fair value of the cash,\nstock and warrants on the date of the License Agreement acquisition in accordance with Accounting Standards Codiﬁcation 730 – Research and\nDevelopment. The Company has the license rights to pursue alternative applications of the technology as part of its future development plans.\n \nThe Company also agreed to pay Xencor a 5% royalty on Net Sales of all Licensed Products in a given calendar year, which are payable on a country-by-\ncountry and licensed product by licensed product basis until the date that is the later of (a) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim covering such\nLicensed Product in such country or (b) ten years following the first sale to a third party of the licensed product in such country.\n \nF-11 \n \n \nUnder the Xencor License Agreement, the Company also agreed to pay Xencor a percentage of any sublicensing revenue that it receives.\n \nOn June 10, 2021, the Company and Xencor entered into an Option Cancellation Agreement whereby Xencor terminated its warrant to purchase 10% of\nthe fully diluted shares of the Company in exchange for a cash payment of $15,000,000 and 192,533 shares of the Company’s common stock with a fair\nvalue of $3,300,000 based on the market price of the common stock as of June 10, 2021, which the Company issued in June 2021. The Company ﬁled a\nregistration statement covering the resale of these shares during September 2021 and agreed to keep the registration statement continuously eﬀective\nuntil all such shares cease to be outstanding or otherwise cease to be registrable securities as deﬁned in the Option Cancellation Agreement. The\nCompany charged the cash consideration paid to Xencor to enter into the Option Cancellation Agreement to equity as the fair value of the warrant\nimmediately prior to the Option Cancellation Agreement was greater than the consideration paid to Xencor.\n \nINKmune License Agreement\n \nOn October 29, 2015, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “INKmune License Agreement”) with Immune Ventures, LLC\n(“Immune Ventures”). Pursuant to the INKmune License Agreement, the Company was granted exclusive worldwide rights to the patents, including rights\nto incorporate any improvements or additions to the patents that may be developed in the future.

Controls and Procedures\n \nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\n \nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n \nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Chief Financial Oﬃcer, evaluated the eﬀectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures as of December 31, 2022. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as deﬁned in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it ﬁles or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and\nreported, within the time periods speciﬁed in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and\nprocedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it ﬁles or submits under the Exchange Act is\naccumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal ﬁnancial oﬃcers, as appropriate to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-beneﬁt\nrelationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Chief Financial Oﬃcer concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022.\n \nAttestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\n \nOur independent registered public accounting ﬁrm will not be required to formally attest to the eﬀectiveness of our internal controls over ﬁnancial reporting\nfor as long as we are an “emerging growth company” pursuant to the provisions of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.\n \nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n \nOur CEO and our CFO are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, as such term is deﬁned in\nExchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Management conducted an assessment of the eﬀectiveness of our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of December\n31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Our management concluded that our internal controls over ﬁnancial reporting were\neffective based on those criteria, as of December 31, 2022.\n \nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n \nNone.\n \nItem 9B.
