      "text": "PART I\nItem 1.    Business\nOverview\nZiff Davis, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“Ziff Davis”, the “Company”, “our”, “us” or “we”), is a vertically focused digital media and internet company whose portfolio includes leading\nbrands in technology, shopping, gaming and entertainment, connectivity, health, cybersecurity, and martech. Our Digital Media business specializes in the technology, shopping, gaming and\nentertainment, connectivity, and healthcare markets, offering content, tools and services to consumers and businesses. Our Cybersecurity and Martech business provides cloud-based subscription\nservices to consumers and businesses including cybersecurity, privacy and marketing technology.\nOur Digital Media business generates revenues from advertising and sponsorships, subscription and usage fees, performance marketing, and licensing fees. This business generates revenues\nfrom the sale of display and video advertising; customer clicks to online merchants, as well as, commissions on sales attributed to clicks to online merchants; business-to-business leads sold to\ninformation technology (“IT”) vendors; the licensing of technology, data, and other intellectual property to clients; and the sale of subscription services to consumers and businesses. Our Cybersecurity\nand Martech businesses generate revenues primarily from customer subscription and usage fees. Our consolidated revenues are currently generated primarily from two basic business models, each\nwith different financial profiles and variability. Our Digital Media business is driven primarily by advertising revenues, has relatively higher sales and marketing expenses, and has seasonal strength in\nthe fourth quarter. Our Cybersecurity and Martech business is driven by subscription revenues, with relatively stable and predictable margins from quarter to quarter. We continue to pursue additional\nacquisitions, which may include companies operating under business models that differ from those we operate under today. Such acquisitions could impact our consolidated profit margins and the\nvariability of our revenues.\nZiff Davis was incorporated in 2014 as a Delaware corporation through the creation of a holding company structure. Our Cybersecurity and Martech businesses are operated by our wholly\nowned subsidiary J2 Global Ventures, LLC. Prior to the spin-off of Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc. (“Consensus”), our Cybersecurity and Martech businesses were operated by our former wholly\nowned subsidiary J2 Cloud Services, LLC, which was founded in 1995, and subsidiaries of J2 Cloud Services, LLC. On October 7, 2021 (the “Distribution Date”), the Company completed the\npreviously announced separation (the “Separation”) of its cloud fax business into Consensus, an independent publicly traded company, and the Company transferred J2 Cloud Services, LLC to\nConsensus who in turn transferred non-fax assets and liabilities back to Ziff Davis, such that Consensus was left with the cloud fax business. In connection with the Separation, we changed our name\nto Ziff Davis, Inc. from J2 Global, Inc. (for certain events prior to October 7, 2021, the Company may be referred to as J2 Global). The Separation was achieved through the Company’s distribution of\n80.1% of the shares of Consensus common stock to holders of Company common stock as of the close of business on October 1, 2021, the record date for the distribution.\nProgrammatic Mergers and Acquisitions\nIn addition to growing our business organically, on a regular basis, we acquire businesses to grow our customer bases, expand and diversify our service offerings, enhance our technologies,\nacquire skilled personnel, and enter into new markets. Our programmatic approach to mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) is a central tenet of our capital allocation strategy, which seeks to optimize the\nallocation of our investable capital, including the free cash flow generated by our businesses, to M&A, share repurchases, and the strengthening of our balance sheet. Since 2012, we have deployed\napproximately $3.0 billion on more than 80 acquisitions across the globe in a variety of verticals within the internet and software categories (exclusive of any acquisitions that were part of businesses\nwe have since divested). Our highly systematic and repeatable M&A process allows us to execute a large volume of M&A with velocity and conviction. Our M&A program is built on a rigorous and\nanalytical approach that leverages deep industry knowledge, technological expertise, and investment acumen. Our evaluation criteria for potential acquisitions varies by sector, but our focus on value-\noriented fundamentals is a central factor in every transaction we evaluate. We seek to acquire businesses that can generate predictable growing free cash flow over long time horizons. The primary\nmetric we use to differentiate opportunities in our M&A pipeline is the expected internal rate of return that the potential acquisition will generate for Ziff Davis. While we take a highly disciplined\napproach to the evaluation of M&A, we have a wide aperture and significant flexibility when it comes to the types of transactions we are capable of evaluating and executing. Since 2010, we have\nacquired venture-backed growth companies, distressed businesses in need of turnaround, complex corporate carve-outs, founder-owned businesses, public companies and private equity-backed\nbusinesses. We also have a multi-faceted approach to transaction sourcing that ranges from participation in sell-side auctions led by investment banks to the sourcing of proprietary transactions\nthrough our executive network. Acquisitions broadly fall into one of two categories at Ziff Davis: (1) tuck-ins or (2) platform acquisitions. Our tuck-in acquisitions are typically focused on the\nacquisition of: (a) a customer base, (b) a strong but under monetized media audience or (c) a new product or service that can be sold to our existing customers or audience. Platform acquisitions are\nbusinesses at scale that can stand on their own within Ziff Davis and which we believe have the potential to serve as a platform for future M&A. Since 2012, the majority of our acquisitions by deal\ncount have been tuck-\n-3-"

For instance, we will license the right to use PCMag’s “Editors’\nChoice” logo and other copyrighted editorial content to businesses whose products have earned such distinction.\nWe believe competitive factors relating to attracting and retaining users include the ability to provide premium and exclusive content and the reach, effectiveness, and efficiency of our\nmarketing services to attract consumers, advertisers, healthcare professionals and publishers.

We have filed to protect our rights to our brands in certain alternative top-level domains\nsuch as “.org”, “.net”, “.biz”, “.info” and “.us”, among others.\nLike other technology-based businesses, we face the risk that we will be unable to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, and the risk that we will be found to have\ninfringed the proprietary rights of others. For more information regarding these risks, please refer to the section entitled Risk Factors contained in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nResearch and Development\nThe markets for our services are evolving rapidly, requiring ongoing expenditures for research and development and timely introduction of new services and service enhancements. Our future\nsuccess will depend, in part, on our ability to enhance our current services, to respond effectively to technological changes, attract and retain engineering talent, sell additional services to our existing\ncustomer base, and introduce new services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers.\nWe devote significant resources to develop new services and service enhancements. Our research, development and engineering expenditures were $74.1  million, $78.9  million and\n$57.1 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For more information regarding the technological risks that we face, please refer to the section entitled Item\n1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business over the internet and, in some cases, using services of third-party\ntelecommunications and internet service providers. These include, among others, laws and regulations addressing privacy, data storage, retention and security, freedom of expression, content, taxation,\nnumbers, advertising, and intellectual property. For information about the risks we face with respect to governmental regulation, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 4,400 employees, nearly evenly split between U.S. and non-U.S based employees. Our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate our\nhighly qualified workforce is very important to our continued success. Approximately 50 of the editorial employees in our Digital Media business have elected to join a union. We chose to voluntarily\nrecognize the union and have negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with the union. None of our other employees are represented by collective bargaining.\nAcquisition Strategy Impact on Human Capital\nThe Company has made more than 80 acquisitions since its inception, including six during 2022 (exclusive of any acquisitions that were part of businesses we have since divested). We\nbelieve that welcoming and integrating new groups of employees where each group has its own unique culture, organizational norms, and expectations, is a strength of ours. We believe that our\nintegration approach reduces the human capital risk associated with our acquisition strategy, and we believe that our ability to effectively integrate new employees and businesses is a core competency\nof the Company.\nOur Culture\nCulture at the Company operates on two levels. While we have a strong enterprise-wide culture that focuses on our core values – diversity, equity and inclusion, environmental sustainability,\ncommunity, data privacy and security, and governance – we also have a strong network of micro-cultures that operate within many of our businesses and drive their success. Integrating those micro-\ncultures and values is important; we work hard to foster an environment of collaboration and embrace the power of small groups working together.\nAn important dimension of the enterprise culture at Ziff Davis continues to stem from our belief that profitability and corporate responsibility go hand in hand. We believe that “Doing is\nGreater than Talking,” which has been a rallying cry to employees, galvanizing them to take action to create social value and impact.\nWith their work and many contributions, our employees play a crucial role in supporting the Company’s “Five Pillars of Purpose,” which continue to include:\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion - Reinforce our diverse workforce, reflect our diverse audiences, and extend upon our inclusive culture.\n-9-"

We\nbelieve that for our business to succeed over the long term, the Company must have an inclusive corporate culture that embraces diversity and promotes equity across our enterprise.\nWe continue to take steps to promote that culture. To date, we have:\n•\nCreated the Ziff Davis Diversity Council, a diverse group of employees that develops recommendations for recruiting, mentorship, and advancement;\n•\nSupported six Employee Resource Groups to increase opportunities for networking, learning, and development;\n•\nExpanded the Employee Resource Group program to include the Family Employee Resource Group (“ERG”) for caregivers, with more groups to come;\n•\nIntroduced DEI targets into our executive compensation program beginning in 2021; and\n•\nLaunched a mentorship program for all employees to leverage internal leadership and expertise.\nWe believe that transparency and accountability are important parts of managing human capital risk. To that end, in 2022 we published our third Annual Diversity Report, available on our\nwebsite, which details our workforce race representation, gender representation, and details how those differ between our overall workforce and our senior employees, as well as introducing\ncommitments to DEI initiatives within our current and future workforce. We are proud of our progress to date – and we recognize we have much more to do.\nHiring\nWe reinforce our culture and our values by seeking out diverse candidates, and looking for candidates that fit well with our organizational priorities. We have had success in this area: 36\npercent of all recent new hires in the U.S. have been people of color, and 58 percent of recent new hires in the U.S. have been women. We are working to proactively attract more diverse talent; we\ndouble our referral bonus paid to employees when we hire a person of color they recommend; we continued our partnership with Professional Diversity Network to advertise our open roles to\nemployees aligning with a multitude of identity groups; and we became a 2022 Afrotech conference sponsor.\nEmployee Compensation & Benefits\nCompensation is an important consideration for all of our employees and we strive to pay competitive compensation packages that reflect the success of the business and the individual\ncontributions of each colleague. We are committed to fair pay practices and roles are periodically benchmarked to help inform where adjustments may be needed.\nWe care for our employees by providing benefits we believe are effective at attracting and retaining the talent critical for our success and, more importantly, assist in their day to day well-\nbeing. Those benefits include comprehensive health insurance coverage, covering 83% of health insurance premiums for covered U.S. employees in each of last three years, an employee stock\npurchase program, 401k program, flexible time off, free access to telemedicine, and up to 16 weeks of paid parental leave for birth parents. In addition, we offer paid sick, military, jury duty, and\nbereavement leave, paid short and long term disability leave, family planning support, a program offering free access to meditation and healthy eating apps, and monthly webinars focused on wellness\nthrough the “Wellness Your Way” program.\nWe support our local communities by providing employees with 16 hours annually of fully paid Volunteer Time Off, partnering with Benevity to support volunteer event opportunities\nglobally. We also expanded our Employee Assistance Fund (“EAF”) with America’s Charities to help employees impacted by unexpected financial hardship resulting from natural and other disasters\nas well as personal hardship, supporting employees from India, the United States, and Canada, with plans to add more countries in the future.\n-10-"

The risks and uncertainties described\nbelow are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our business. If any of these known or unknown\nrisks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our\ncommon stock will likely decline and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results.\nRisks Related To Our Business\n•\nAcquisitions and investments in our business play a significant role in our growth.\n•\nAcquisitions may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\n•\nThe majority of our revenue within the Digital Media business is derived from short-term advertising arrangements, and our Digital Media business may lose or be unable to attract advertisers\nif it cannot develop, commission, or acquire compelling content, if it cannot attract users to mobile offerings or if advertisers’ marketing budgets are cut or reduced.\n•\nWe face risks associated with system failures, security breaches, and other technological issues.\n•\nWe face risks associated with changes in our tax rates, changes in tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, assessments or\naudits by taxing authorities, and potential exposure to additional tax liabilities (including with respect to sales and use, telecommunications, or similar taxes).\n•\nWe face risks associated with weakened global and U.S. economic conditions, volatility in the economy, and political instability.\n•\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be successful in growing our brands or revenue.\n•\nIf the distribution of Consensus, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Ziff Davis,\nConsensus, and Ziff Davis stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\n•\nOur business is highly dependent on our billing systems functioning properly, and we face risks associated with credit and debit card declines and merchant standards imposed by credit and\ndebit card companies.\n•\nWe face potential liability for various types of legal claims, and we may be engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could divert significant\noperational resources and our management’s time and attention.\n•\nOur businesses depend in part on attracting visitors to our websites from search engines.\n•\nWe may be subject to risks from international operations, including risks associated with currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls and other adverse changes in global financial\nmarkets, including unforeseen global crises such as war, strife, strikes, global health pandemics, as well as risks associated with international laws and regulations.\n•\nWe may be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, and we may be unable to adequately protect our own intellectual property rights.\n•\nOur business is dependent on the supply of services and other business requirements from other companies.\n•\nOur business is dependent on our retention of our executive officers, and senior management, and our ability to hire and retain key personnel.\n•\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial flexibility and our competitive position, and we require significant cash to service our debt and fund our capital requirements.\n•\nWe are exposed to risk if we cannot maintain or adhere to our internal controls and procedures.\n•\nWe previously identified a material weakness in 2021, which has since been remediated, but which may have adversely affected our business, reputation, results of operations, and stock price.\n-12-"

These may in turn subject us to\nclaims, judgments, monetary liabilities and other remedies, and to limitations on our business practices.\n•\nWe operate across many different markets and may be exposed to a variety of government and private actions or self-regulatory developments regarding data privacy and security.\n•\nData privacy and security regulations such as the GDPR, the CCPA, and CDPA impose significant compliance costs and expose us to substantial risks, particularly with respect to health data\nand other sensitive data.\n•\nDevelopments in the healthcare industry and associated regulations could adversely affect our business, including our Everyday Health Group set of brands.\n•\nOur business could suffer if providers of broadband internet access services block, impair or degrade our services.\n•\nOur business faces risks associated with advertisement blocking technologies and advertising click fraud.\n•\nThe industries in which we operate are undergoing rapid technological changes, and we may not be able to keep up.\nRisks Related To Our Stock\n•\nFeatures of the 1.75% Convertible Notes and 4.625% Senior Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company.\n•\nConversions of the 1.75% Convertible Notes would dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their 1.75% Convertible Notes.\n•\nWe are a holding company and our operations are conducted through, and substantially all of our assets are held by, subsidiaries, which may be subject to restrictions on their ability to pay\ndividends to us to fund our dividends, if any, and interest payments and other holding company expenses.\n•\nFuture sales of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.\n•\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders.\n•\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline, due to various reasons, including variations between actual results and investor expectations, industry and regulatory changes, introduction of\nnew services by our competitors, developments with respect to IP rights, geopolitical events such as war, threat of war or terrorist actions, and global health pandemics, among others.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nAcquisitions and investments in our business have historically played a significant role in our growth and we anticipate that they will continue to do so.\nWe plan to acquire additional or invest in new or current businesses, products, services and technologies that complement or augment our service offerings and customer base in order to\nenhance our rate of growth. We may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment strategies, manage disparate technologies, lines of business, personnel and corporate\ncultures, realize our business strategy or the expected return on our investment, or manage a geographically dispersed company. If we are unable to identify and execute on acquisitions or execute on\nour investment strategies, our revenues, business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could suffer.\nWe have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nWe intend to continue to develop new services, enhance existing services and expand our geographic presence through acquisitions of other companies, service lines, technologies, and\npersonnel.\n-13-"

      "text": "Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n•\nDifficulties in integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products, and personnel of the acquired businesses;\n•\nDifficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets may have stronger market positions;\n•\nDiversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions; and\n•\nThe potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors, and other business partners of the businesses we acquire.\nAcquisitions may also cause us to:\n•\nUse a substantial portion of our cash resources or incur debt;\n•\nSignificantly increase our interest expense, leverage, and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition;\n•\nAssume liabilities;\n•\nIssue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership;\n•\nRecord goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges;\n•\nIncur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; and\n•\nBecome subject to intellectual property or other litigation.\nMergers and acquisitions are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control. We cannot give assurances that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will\nnot materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions.\nThe majority of our revenue within the Digital Media business is derived from short-term advertising arrangements and a reduction in spending by or loss of current or potential\nadvertisers would cause our revenue and operating results to decline.\nIn most cases, our agreements with advertisers have a term of one year or less and may be terminated at any time by the advertiser or by us without penalty. Advertising agreements often provide that\nwe receive payment based on “served” impressions, but the online ad industry has started to shift so that payment will be made based on “viewable” impressions, and that change in basis could have a\nnegative effect on available impressions thereby reducing our revenue potential. Accordingly, it is difficult to accurately forecast display revenue. In addition, our expense levels are based in part on\nexpectations of future revenue. Moreover, we believe that advertising on the internet, as in traditional media, fluctuates significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our\ncontrol. Some of these factors include (a) budget constraints of our advertisers, (b) cancellations or delays of projects by our advertisers due to numerous factors, including but not limited to, supply\nchain issues, (c) the cyclical and discretionary nature of advertising spending, (d) general economic, internet-related, and media industry conditions, (e) tax and other legislation and regulation, as well\nas (f) extraordinary events, such as war, acts of terrorism or aggression, extreme weather events including as exacerbated by climate change, and pandemics or other public health crises. The state of\nthe global economy and availability of capital has impacted and could further impact the advertising spending patterns of existing and potential advertisers. Continued reduction in spending by, or loss\nof, existing or potential advertisers would negatively impact our revenue and operating results. Further, we may be unable to adjust our expenses and capital expenditures quickly enough to\ncompensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall.\nIf we are unable to develop, commission, or acquire compelling content in our Digital Media business at acceptable prices, our expenses may increase, the number of visitors to our online\nproperties may not grow, or may decline, and/or visitors’ level of engagement with our websites may decline, any of which could harm our operating results.\nOur future success depends in part on the ability of our Digital Media business to aggregate compelling content and deliver that content through our online properties. Users are increasingly\ndemanding high-quality content and services including more video and mobile-specific content. Such content and services may require us to make substantial payments to third parties if we are unable\nto develop content of our own. Our ability to maintain and build relationships with such third-party providers is critical to our success. In addition, as new methods for accessing the internet become\navailable, including through alternative devices, we may need to enter into amended agreements with existing third-party providers to cover the new devices. We may be unable to enter into new, or\npreserve existing, relationships with the third-parties whose content or services we seek to\n-14-"

      "text": "obtain. In addition, as competition for compelling content increases both domestically and internationally, our third-party providers may increase the prices at which they offer their content and\nservices to us and potential providers may not offer their content or services to us at all, or may offer them on terms that are not agreeable to us. An increase in the prices charged to us by third-party\nproviders could harm our operating results and financial condition. Further, many of our content and services licenses with third parties are non-exclusive. Accordingly, other media providers may be\nable to offer similar or identical content. This increases the importance of our ability to deliver compelling content and personalization of this content for users in order to differentiate our properties\nfrom other businesses. Although we generally develop compelling content of our own, when we are unable to do so, we engage freelance services or obtain licensed content which may not be at\nreasonable prices and which could harm our operating results.\nIn our Digital Media business, if we are unable to prove that our advertising and sponsorship solutions provide an attractive return on investment for our customers, our financial results\ncould be harmed.\nOur ability to grow revenue from our Digital Media business is dependent on our ability to demonstrate to marketers that their marketing campaigns with us provide a meaningful return on\ninvestment (“ROI”) relative to offline and other online opportunities. Certain of the marketing campaigns with respect to our Digital Media business are designed such that the revenues received are\nbased entirely upon the ROI delivered for customers. Our Digital Media business has invested significant resources in developing its research, analytics, and campaign effectiveness capabilities and\nexpects to continue to do so in the future. Our ability, however, to demonstrate the value of advertising and sponsorship on Digital Media business properties depends, in part, on the sophistication of\nthe analytics and measurement capabilities, the actions taken by our competitors to enhance their offerings, whether we meet the ROI expectations of our customers, and a number of other factors. If\nwe are unable to maintain sophisticated marketing and communications solutions that provide value to our customers or demonstrate our ability to provide value to our customers, our financial results\nwill be harmed.\nA system failure, security breach or other technological risk could delay or interrupt service to our customers, harm our reputation, lead to a loss of customers, or subject us to significant\nliability.\nOur operations are dependent on our network being free from material interruption by damage from fire, earthquake, or other natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure,\nunauthorized entry, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, or any other events beyond our control. Similarly, the operations of our partners and other third parties with which we work are also susceptible to\nthe same risks. There can be no assurance that our existing and planned precautions of backup systems, regular data backups, security protocols, and other procedures will be adequate to prevent\nsignificant damage, system failure or data loss, and the same is true for our partners, vendors, and other third parties on which we rely. We have experienced attempts to gain unauthorized access to\ncustomer accounts. To date, these events have not resulted in the material impairment of any business operations.\nAlso, many of our services are web-based, and the amount of data we store for our users on our servers has been increasing. Despite the implementation of security measures, our\ninfrastructure, and that of our partners, vendors, and other third parties may be vulnerable to computer viruses, hackers, or similar disruptive problems caused by our vendors, partners, other third\nparties, subscribers, employees, or other internet users who attempt to invade public and private data networks. As seen in the industries in which we operate and others, these activities have been, and\nwill continue to be, subject to continually evolving cybersecurity and technological risks. Further, in some cases we do not have in place disaster recovery facilities for certain ancillary services.\nMoreover, a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other sensitive data. For example, a significant number of our\nCybersecurity and Martech customers authorize us to bill them directly for all transaction fees charged by us. We rely on encryption and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of\nconfidential information, including customer financial information is highly dependent on our billing systems functioning. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of\ncryptography, or other developments may result in a material compromise or breach of the technology used by us, our partners, our vendors, or other third parties to protect transaction and other\nconfidential data. Any system failure or security breach that causes interruptions or data loss in and to our operations and systems or those of our partners, vendors, customers, or other third parties, or\nwhich leads to the misappropriation of our or our customers’ confidential information, could result in a significant liability to us (including in the form of judicial decisions and/or settlements,\nregulatory findings and/or forfeitures, and other means), cause considerable harm to us and our reputation (including requiring notification to customers, regulators, and/or the media), cause a loss of\nconfidence in our products and services, and deter current and potential customers from using our services. We use vendors to assist with cybersecurity risks, but these vendors may not be able to\nassist us adequately in preparing for or responding to a cybersecurity incident. We maintain insurance related to cybersecurity risks, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses\nfrom any breaches or other adverse consequences related to a cybersecurity-event. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating\nresults, and cash flows, or a negative impact to our reputation could cause us to suffer other negative consequences. For example, we may incur remediation costs (such as liability for stolen assets or\ninformation, repairs of system damage, and incentives to customers or business partners in an effort to maintain relationships after an attack); increased cybersecurity\n-15-"

      "text": "protection costs (which may include the costs of making organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third-party experts and\nconsultants); lost revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack; litigation and legal risks (including regulatory\nactions by state and federal governmental authorities and non-U.S. authorities); increased insurance premiums; reputational damage that adversely affects customer or investor confidence; and damage\nto the company’s competitiveness, stock price, and diminished long-term shareholder value. To date, such events have not resulted in the material impairment of any business operations.\nChanges in our tax rates, changes in tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities\nmay adversely impact our financial results.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions where a number of our subsidiaries are organized. Our provision for income taxes\nis based on a jurisdictional mix of earnings, statutory tax rates, and enacted tax rules, including transfer pricing. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be\nsubject to significant change. As a result, our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. These changes may adversely impact our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities and government bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of\nadverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax and other tax reserves. If our reserves are not sufficient to cover these contingencies, such inadequacy\ncould materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nIn addition, due to the global nature of the internet, it is possible that various states or foreign countries might attempt to impose additional or new regulation on our business or levy\nadditional or new sales, income, or other taxes relating to our activities. Tax authorities at the international, federal, state, and local levels are currently reviewing the appropriate treatment of\ncompanies engaged in e-commerce and online advertising. New or revised international, federal, state, or local tax regulations or court decisions may subject us or our customers to additional sales,\nincome, and other taxes. For example, the European Union, certain member states, and other countries, as well as states within the United States, have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising\nand marketplace service revenues. The application of existing, new or revised taxes on our business, in particular, sales taxes, VAT, and similar taxes would likely increase the cost of doing business\nonline and decrease the attractiveness of selling products and advertising over the internet. The application of these taxes on our business could also create significant increases in internal costs\nnecessary to capture data and collect and remit taxes. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nMoreover, we are currently under or subject to examination for indirect taxes in various states, municipalities and foreign jurisdictions. We currently have a $25.5 million reserve established\nfor these matters. If a material indirect tax liability associated with prior periods were to be recorded, for which there is not a reserve, it could materially affect our financial results for the period in\nwhich it is recorded.\nFurthermore, much of our Digital Media e-commerce revenue comes from arrangements in which we are paid by retailers to promote their digital product and service offers on our sites.\nCertain states have implemented regulations that require retailers to collect and remit sales taxes on sales made to residents of such states if a publisher, such as us, that facilitated that sale is a resident\nof such state. Paid retailers in our marketplace that do not currently have sales tax nexus in any state that subsequently passes similar regulations and in which we have operations, employees, or\ncontractors now or in the future, may significantly alter the manner in which they pay us, cease paying us for sales we facilitate for that retailer in such state, or cease using our marketplace, each of\nwhich could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected, or in the future should collect sales and use, telecommunications, or similar taxes, and we could be subject to\nliability with respect to past or future tax, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe believe we remit state and local sales and use, excise, utility user, and ad valorem taxes, as well as fees and surcharges or other similar obligations, in all relevant jurisdictions in which we\ngenerate sales, based on our understanding of the applicable laws in those jurisdictions. Such tax, fee, and surcharge laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction, and the application of each of them to\ne-commerce businesses, such as ours, is a complex and evolving area. The jurisdictions where we have sales may apply more rigorous enforcement efforts or take more aggressive positions in the\nfuture that could result in greater tax liability. In addition, in the future we may also decide to engage in activities that would require us to pay sales and use, telecommunications, or similar taxes in\nnew jurisdictions. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n-16-"

Weakened global and U.S. economic conditions (including reduced economic growth, recessions,\ninflationary conditions, rising interest rates, and increased unemployment), volatility in the economy, and political instability may affect us and certain of our customers. Among other things, such\nconditions may lead, and have in the past led, to decreased usage of our services, decreased retention rates, decreased advertising, e-commerce, subscription or other revenues, and increased costs. The\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and the reactions of governmental and public health authorities and others to the pandemic, disrupted and may continue to disrupt economic activity, resulting in reduced\ncommercial and consumer confidence and spending, increased unemployment, inflation, volatility in the global economy, instability in the credit and financial markets, labor shortages, and disruption\nin supply chains. These each may impact, and have in the past impacted, our revenues and profitability. For example, in connection with the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. and other\ngovernments have imposed severe economic sanctions and export controls and have threatened additional sanctions and controls. The full impact of these measures, or of any potential responses to\nthem by Russia or other countries, on the businesses and results of operations or our customers or us is unknown.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nClimate change may have an adverse impact on our business locations, and those of our customers and vendors. For example, our business locations, or those of our customers and vendors,\nmay experience adverse climate-related events, including fluctuations in temperature or water availability, floods, wildfires (and resultant air quality impacts), and power shutoffs associated with these\nevents. A climate-related event that destroys or disrupts any of our critical systems could severely impact our ability to conduct business, and we cannot ensure that our systems and data centers will\nremain fully operational during and immediately after such an event or disruption. Climate-related events also pose risks to our employees’ ability to stay connected and perform their job duties,\nparticularly for those who work from home. We may experience increased employee turnover, business losses or additional costs to maintain or resume operations due to climate-related events. In\naddition, changes in regulatory requirements, markets and shareholder expectations regarding climate change may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have begun the\nassessment and management of climate-related risks to our operations, including through our Environmental, Social and Governance Committee, but we cannot ensure that we are fully able to assess\nor manage such risks.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and some of our competitors may have greater resources to commit to growth, superior technologies, cheaper pricing, or more\neffective marketing strategies. Also, we face significant competition for users, advertisers, publishers, developers, and distributors.\nFor information regarding our competition, and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate, see the subsection entitled “Competition” with respect to each of our\nDigital Media and Cybersecurity and Martech businesses contained in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, some of our competitors include major companies with much greater\nresources and significantly larger customer bases than we have. Some of these competitors offer their services at lower prices than we do. These companies may be able to develop and expand their\nnetwork infrastructures and capabilities more quickly, adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities\nmore readily, and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services than we can. There can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter markets that we are\ncurrently serving and plan to serve or that we will be able to compete effectively. Competitive pressures may reduce our revenue, operating profits, or both.\nOur Digital Media business faces significant competition from online media companies as well as from social networking sites, mobile applications, traditional print and broadcast media,\ngeneral purpose and search engines, and various e-commerce sites. Our Cybersecurity and Martech business faces competition from cloud software services and applications across several categories\nincluding secured communications, cybersecurity, and marketing technology.\nSeveral of our competitors offer an integrated variety of software and internet products, advertising services, technologies, online services, and content. We compete against these and other\ncompanies to attract and retain subscribers, users, advertisers, partners, and developers. We also compete with social media and networking sites which are attracting a substantial and increasing share\nof users and users’ online time, and may continue to attract an increasing share of online advertising dollars.\nIn addition, several competitors offer products and services that directly compete for users with our Digital Media business offerings. Similarly, the advertising networks operated by our\ncompetitors or by other participants in the display marketplace offer services that directly compete with our offerings for advertisers, including advertising exchanges, ad networks, demand side\nplatforms, ad serving technologies, and sponsored search offerings.

Some of our existing competitors and possible entrants may have greater brand recognition for certain products and services, more\nexpertise in a particular segment of the market, and greater operational, strategic, technological, financial, personnel, or other resources than we do. Many of our competitors have access to\nconsiderable financial and technical resources with which to compete aggressively, including by funding future growth and expansion and investing in acquisitions, technologies, and research and\ndevelopment. Further, emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and provide new products and services faster than we can. In addition, competitors may consolidate with each other or collaborate,\nand new competitors may enter the market. Some of the competitors of our Cybersecurity and Martech business in international markets have a substantial competitive advantage over us because they\nhave dominant market share in their territories, are owned by local telecommunications providers, have greater brand recognition, are focused on a single market, are more familiar with local tastes\nand preferences, or have greater regulatory and operational flexibility due to the fact that we may be subject to both U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements.\nIf our competitors are more successful than we are in developing and deploying compelling products or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, developers, or distributors, our\nrevenue and growth rates could decline.\nOur growth will depend on our ability to develop, strengthen, and protect our brands, and these efforts may be costly and have varying degrees of success.\nOur brand recognition has significantly contributed to the success of our business. Strengthening our current brands and launching competitive new brands will be critical to achieving widespread\ncommercial acceptance of our products and services. This will require our continued focus on active marketing, the costs of which have been increasing and may continue to increase. In addition,\nsubstantial initial investments may be required to launch new brands and expand existing brands to cover new geographic territories and technology fields. Accordingly, we may need to spend\nincreasing amounts of money on, and devote greater resources to, advertising, marketing, and other efforts to cultivate brand recognition and customer loyalty. In addition, we are supporting an\nincreasing number of brands, each of which requires its own investment of resources. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues and, even if they do, increased revenues may not\noffset the expenses incurred. A failure to launch, promote, and maintain our brands, or the incurrence of substantial expenses in doing so, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur brand recognition depends, in part, on our ability to protect our trademark portfolio and establish trademark rights covering new brands and territories. Some regulators and competitors\nhave taken the view that certain of our brands, such as eVoice, are descriptive or generic when applied to the products and services offered by our Cybersecurity and Martech business. Nevertheless,\nwe have obtained U.S. and foreign trademark registrations for our brand names, logos, and other brand identifiers, including eVoice. If we are unable to obtain, maintain or protect trademark rights\ncovering our brands across the territories in which they are or may be offered, the value of these brands may be diminished, competitors may be able to dilute, harm, or take advantage of our brand\nrecognition and reputation, and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected.\nWe hold domain names relating to our brands, in the U.S. and internationally. The acquisition and maintenance of domain names are generally regulated by governmental agencies and their\ndesignees. The regulation of domain names may change. Governing bodies may establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars, or modify the requirements for\nholding domain names. As a result, we may be unable to acquire or maintain all relevant domain names that relate to our brands. Furthermore, international rules governing the acquisition and\nmaintenance of domain names in foreign jurisdictions are sometimes different from U.S. rules, and we may not be able to obtain all of our domains internationally. As a result of these factors, we may\nbe unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our brands, trademarks or other proprietary rights. In addition,\nfailure to secure or maintain domain names relevant to our brands could adversely affect our reputation and make it more difficult for users to find our websites and services.\nIf the distribution of Consensus equity, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Ziff Davis,\nConsensus and Ziff Davis stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\nThe separation of Consensus was effected by a pro rata distribution to our shareholders of 80.1% of the stock of Consensus, comprising our prior cloud fax business. We obtained (i) a private\nletter ruling from the IRS, satisfactory to our Board of Directors, regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the separation and related transactions and (ii) an opinion of outside\ncounsel, satisfactory to our Board of Directors, regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nunder Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). The opinion of outside counsel and the IRS private letter ruling were based, among other things, on various facts and\nassumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of Ziff Davis and Consensus (including those relating to the past and future conduct of Ziff Davis and Consensus).

Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt of the IRS private letter ruling and/or opinions of counsel or other external tax advisors, the IRS could\ndetermine that the distribution and certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions,\nrepresentations, statements or undertakings that were included in the request for the IRS private letter ruling or on which any opinion was based are false or have been violated. In addition, the IRS\nprivate letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution, together with certain related transactions, qualifies as a transaction that is generally tax-\nfree for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and an opinion of outside counsel or other external tax advisor represents the judgment of such counsel or advisor which is not binding on the IRS or any\ncourt. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt by Ziff Davis of the IRS private letter ruling and the tax opinions referred to above, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert that the\ndistribution and/or certain related transactions do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the IRS were to\nprevail with such a challenge, Ziff Davis, Consensus and Ziff Davis’ stockholders could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability.\nIf the distribution, together with certain related transactions, fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, Ziff Davis would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the Consensus common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and Ziff Davis stockholders who receive\nshares of Consensus common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.\nIn addition, we may incur certain tax costs in connection with the separation, including non-U.S. tax costs resulting from separations in multiple non-U.S. jurisdictions that do not legally\nprovide for tax-free separations, which may be material. As a result of requirements of Section 355 of the Code or other applicable tax laws, in order to avoid the risk of incurring material tax-related\nliabilities, for a period of time after the separation we may determine to forego certain strategic transactions, equity issuances or repurchases or other transactions that we would otherwise believe to be\nin the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business.\nOur business is highly dependent on our billing systems.\nA significant part of our revenues depends on prompt and accurate billing processes. Customer billing is a highly complex process, and our billing systems must efficiently interface with\nthird-party systems, such as those of credit card processing companies. Our ability to accurately and efficiently bill our customers is dependent on the successful operation of our billing systems and\nthe third-party systems upon which we rely, such as our credit card processor, and our ability to provide these third parties the information required to process transactions. In addition, our ability to\noffer new services or alternative-billing plans is dependent on our ability to customize our billing systems. Any failures or errors in our billing systems or procedures could impair our ability to\nproperly bill our current customers or attract and service new customers, and thereby could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIncreased numbers of credit and debit card declines in our business could lead to a decrease in our revenues or rate of revenue growth.\nA significant number of our paid Cybersecurity and Martech subscribers and certain Digital Media subscribers pay for our services through credit and debit cards. Weakness in certain\nsegments of the credit markets and in the U.S. and global economies could result in increased numbers of rejected credit and debit card payments. We believe this could result in increased customer\ncancellations and decreased customer signups. Rejected credit or debit card payments, customer cancellations and decreased customer sign up may adversely impact our revenues and profitability.\nIf our business experiences excessive fraudulent activity or cannot meet evolving credit card company merchant standards, we could incur substantial costs and lose the right to accept\ncredit cards for payment and our subscriber base could decrease significantly.\nA significant number of our paid Cybersecurity and Martech subscribers and certain Digital Media subscribers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all service fees\ncharged by us. If people pay for these services with stolen credit cards, we could incur substantial unreimbursed third-party vendor costs. We also incur losses from claims that the customer did not\nauthorize the credit card transaction to purchase our service. If the numbers of unauthorized credit card transactions become excessive, we could be assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks\nand could lose the right to accept credit cards for payment. In addition, we are subject to Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) data security standards, which require periodic audits by independent third\nparties to assess our compliance. PCI standards are a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security. Failure to comply with the security requirements or rectify a\nsecurity issue may result in fines or a restriction on accepting payment cards. Credit card companies may change the standards required to utilize their services from time to time. If we are unable to\nmeet these new standards, we could be unable to accept credit cards.

Payments under such indemnification provisions may be material. For a\nmore detailed description of certain lawsuits in which we are involved, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nIf we are unable to continue to attract visitors to our websites from search engines, then consumer traffic to our websites could decrease, which could negatively impact the sales of our\nproducts and services, our advertising revenue and the number of purchases generated for our retailers through our Digital Media marketplace.\nWe generate consumer traffic to our websites using various methods, including search engine marketing, or SEM, search engine optimization, or SEO, email campaigns and social media\nreferrals. Our net revenues and profitability levels are dependent upon our continued ability to use a combination of these methods to generate consumer traffic to our websites in a cost-efficient\nmanner. We have experienced and continue to experience fluctuations in search result rankings for a number of our websites. There can be no assurances that we will be able to grow or maintain\ncurrent levels of consumer traffic.\nOur SEM and SEO techniques have been developed to work with existing search algorithms utilized by the major search engines. Major search engines frequently modify their search\nalgorithms. Changes in search engine algorithms or user interfaces could cause our websites to receive less favorable placements, which could reduce the number of users who visit our websites. In\naddition, we use keyword advertising to improve our search ranking and to attract users to our sites. If we fail to follow legal requirements regarding the use of keywords or search engine guidelines\nand policies properly, search engines may rank our content lower in search results or could remove our content altogether from their indices.\nAny decline in consumer traffic to our websites could adversely impact the amount of ads that are displayed and the number of purchases we generate for our retailers, which could adversely\naffect our net revenues. An attempt to replace this traffic through other channels may require us to increase our sales and marketing expenditures, which would adversely affect our operating results\nand which may not be offset by additional net revenues.\nAs we continue to grow our international operations, adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results\nof operations.\nAs we expand our international operations, we could be exposed to significant risks of currency fluctuations.

However, these measures may provide only limited protection and it may be costly and time-consuming to enforce compliance\nwith our intellectual property rights. In some circumstances, we may not have adequate, economically feasible or realistic options for enforcing our intellectual property and we may be unable to\ndetect unauthorized use. While we have a robust worldwide portfolio of issued patents and pending patent applications, there can be no assurance that any of these patents will not be challenged,\ninvalidated or circumvented, that we will be able to successfully police infringement, or that any rights granted under these patents will in fact provide a competitive advantage to us.\nIn addition, our ability to register or protect our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property may be limited in some foreign countries. As a result, we may not\nbe able to effectively prevent competitors in these regions from utilizing our intellectual property, which could reduce our competitive advantage and ability to compete in those regions and negatively\nimpact our business.\nWe also strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We typically enter into confidentiality and\ninvention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of,\nour proprietary information. However, we may not be successful in executing these agreements with every party who has access to our confidential information or contributes to the development of\nour technology or intellectual property rights. Those agreements that we do execute may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. These contractual arrangements and\nthe other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not prevent the misappropriation or disclosure of our proprietary information nor deter independent development of similar\ntechnology or intellectual property by others.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of the content on our websites and mobile applications, and our other intellectual property and technology, is difficult and costly.

We may not be able to effect any such\nalternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, would materially and adversely\naffect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risk if we cannot maintain or adhere to our internal controls and procedures.\nWe have established and continue to maintain, assess, and update our internal controls and procedures regarding our business operations and financial reporting. Our internal controls and\nprocedures are designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding our business operations and financial reporting. However, because of the inherent limitations in this process, internal controls and\nprocedures may not prevent or detect all errors or misstatements. To the extent our internal controls are inadequate or not adhered to by our employees, our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults could be materially adversely affected. For example, in 2021 we identified a material weakness in our internal control related to our accounting for the Consensus Spin-Off, which we\nsubsequently remediated. Although we successfully remediated this control weakness and it did not result in any material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements for the periods\npresented, it is reasonably possible that it could have led to a material misstatement of account balances or disclosures. We cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal control\nover financial reporting will not be identified in the future.\nIf we are not able to maintain internal controls and procedures in a timely manner, or without adequate compliance, we may be unable to accurately or timely report our financial results or\nprevent fraud and may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities such as the SEC or Nasdaq. Any such action or restatement of prior-period financial results as a result could\nharm our business or investors’ confidence in the Company and could cause our stock price to fall.\n-23-"

In\naddition, upon conversion of the 1.75% Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any\nfractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 1.75% Convertible Notes being converted. It is our intention to satisfy our conversion obligation by paying and delivering\na combination of cash and shares of our common stock, where cash will be used to settle each $1,000 of principal and the remainder, if any, will be settled via shares of our common stock. However,\nwe may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases or redemptions of the 1.75% Convertible Notes or the 4.625% Senior Notes\nsurrendered therefor or 1.75% Convertible Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase or redeem the 1.75% Convertible Notes or the 4.625% Senior Notes or to pay cash upon\nconversions of the 1.75% Convertible Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our current or future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase or redeem 1.75%\nConvertible Notes or 4.625% Senior Notes at a time when the repurchase or redemption is required by the applicable indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the 1.75%\nConvertible Notes as required by the applicable 1.75% Convertible Notes indenture would constitute a default under the applicable indenture. A default under any indenture or the fundamental change\nor change of control itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness or certain of our other current indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness\nwere to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase or redeem the 1.75% Convertible Notes or the 4.625%\nSenior Notes or make cash payments upon conversions of the 1.75% Convertible Notes.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 1.75% Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the 1.75% Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of the 1.75% Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the 1.75% Convertible Notes at\nany time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their 1.75% Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares\nof our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which\ncould adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their 1.75% Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a\nportion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nDivestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements.\nWe continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the\ndesired return on investment. For example, in 2021, we spun off our online fax business and sold our B2B backup business. These transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact\nour business. For example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and even\nafter reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. In addition, divestitures or other\ndispositions may dilute our earnings per share, have other adverse financial and accounting impacts, and distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. In addition, we have retained\nresponsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold or disposed of. The resolution of\nthese contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.\nPotential indemnification liabilities to Consensus pursuant to the separation agreement could materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and\ncash flows.\nWe entered into a separation and distribution agreement and related agreements with Consensus to govern the separation and distribution of Consensus and the relationship between the two\ncompanies going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party and could lead to disputes between the parties. If we are required to indemnify\nConsensus under the circumstances set forth in these agreements, we may be subject to substantial liabilities.

Each of these risks could negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nESG matters, as well as related reporting obligations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation and performance.\nU.S. and international regulators, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG matters. The Company has established and publicly announced its ESG goals, including its\ncommitments to diversity and inclusion. These statements reflect current plans and aspirations of the Company and are not guarantees that that the Company will be able to achieve them. The failure\nto accomplish or accurately track and report on these goals on a timely basis, or at all, could adversely affect the reputation, financial performance, and growth of the Company, and expose it to\nincreased scrutiny from the investment community as well as enforcement authorities.\nRisks Related To Our Industries\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company’s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Company’s\nbusiness.\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company’s\nactivities in areas including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile\ncommunications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import/export and sanctions requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash\nrepatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health, and safety. Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be\nonerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a\nresult of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Company’s products and services less attractive to the Company’s customers,\ndelay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to\nensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company’s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the\nCompany’s policies and procedures.\nOur services may become subject to burdensome regulation, which could increase our costs or restrict our service offerings.\nWe believe that most of our cloud services are “information services” under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and related precedent, or, if not “information services,” that we are entitled\nto other exemptions, meaning that we generally are not currently subject to U.S. telecommunications services regulation at both the federal and state levels. In connection with our Cybersecurity and\nMartech business, we utilize data transmissions over public telephone lines and other facilities provided by third-party carriers. These transmissions are subject to foreign and domestic laws,\nregulations and requirements by the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”), state public utility commissions, foreign governmental authorities, and industry trade associations such as the\nCTIA. These regulations and requirements affect our ability to provide services, the availability of numbers, the prices we pay for transmission services, the administrative costs associated with\nproviding our services, the competition we face from telecommunications service providers and other aspects of our market. However, as the services we offer expand, we may become subject to other\nregulatory agency regulation. It is also possible that a federal or state regulatory agency could take the position that our offerings, or a subset of our offerings, are properly classified as\ntelecommunications services or otherwise not entitled to certain exemptions upon which we currently rely. Such a finding could potentially subject us to fines, penalties or enforcement actions as well\nas liabilities for past regulatory fees and charges, retroactive contributions to various telecommunications-related funds, telecommunications-related taxes, penalties, and interest. It is also possible that\nsuch a finding could subject us to additional regulatory obligations that could potentially require us either to modify our offerings in a costly manner, diminish our ability to retain customers, or\ndiscontinue certain offerings, in order to comply with certain regulations. Changes in the regulatory environment could decrease our revenues, increase our costs and restrict our service offerings. In\nmany of our international locations, we are subject to regulation by the applicable governmental authority.\nIn the U.S., Congress, the FCC, and a number of states require regulated telecommunications carriers to contribute to federal and/or state Universal Service Funds (“USF”). Generally, USF is\nused to subsidize the cost of providing service to low-income customers and those living in high cost or rural areas. Congress, the FCC and a number of states are reviewing the manner in which a\nprovider’s contribution obligation is calculated, as well as the types of entities subject to USF contribution obligations. If any of these reforms are adopted, they could cause us to alter or eliminate our\nnon-paid services and to raise the price of our paid services, which could cause us to lose customers. Any of these results could lead to a decrease in our revenues\n-25-"

For example, in the United States, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) prohibits\nplacing calls or sending text messages to mobile phones without “prior express consent” subject to limited exceptions, and a plaintiff may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per\nviolation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. Parties that solely enable calling or text messaging are only directly liable under the TCPA\npursuant to federal common law vicarious liability principles. We take significant steps to ensure that users understand that they are responsible for how they use our technology including complying\nwith relevant federal and state law. However, because we do not enjoy absolute exemption from liability under the TCPA and related FCC and FTC rules, we could face inquiries from the FCC and\nFTC or enforcement actions by these agencies, or private causes of action, if someone uses our service for such impermissible purposes. If this were to occur and we were to be held liable for\nsomeone’s use of our service for unauthorized calling or text messaging mobile users, the financial penalties could cause a material adverse effect on our operations and harm our business reputation.\nAlso, in the United States, the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act (“CALEA”) requires any telecommunications carriers to be capable of performing wiretaps and recording\nother call identifying information in cooperation with law enforcement. In September 2005, the FCC expanded the definition of “telecommunications carriers” to include facilities-based broadband\ninternet access providers and Voice-over-Internet-Protocol (“VoIP”) providers that interconnect with the public switched telephone network. As a result of this definition, the Company’s VoIP offerings\nare subject to CALEA, which has impacted our operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of new and existing laws and regulations which could subject us to claims, judgments, monetary liabilities, and other remedies, and to limitations on our business\npractices.\nThe application of existing domestic and international laws and regulations to us relating to issues such as defamation, pricing, advertising, taxation, promotions, billing, consumer protection,\naccessibility, content regulation, data privacy, export restrictions and sanctions, intellectual property ownership and infringement, and accreditation in many instances is unclear or unsettled. In\naddition, we will also be subject to any new laws and regulations directly applicable to our domestic and international activities. Further, the application of existing laws to us or our subsidiaries\nregulating or requiring licenses for certain businesses of our advertisers including, for example, distribution of pharmaceuticals, alcohol or other regulated substances, adult content, tobacco, or\nfirearms, as well as insurance and securities brokerage, and legal services, can be unclear. Internationally, we may also be subject to laws regulating our activities in foreign countries and to foreign\nlaws and regulations that are inconsistent from country to country. Our Digital Media and Cybersecurity and Martech businesses utilize contractors, freelancers and/or staff from third-party\noutsourcers to provide content and other services. However, in the future, arrangements with such individuals may not be deemed appropriate by a relevant government authority, which could result in\nadditional costs and expenses. We may incur substantial liabilities for expenses necessary to defend such litigation or to comply with these laws and regulations, as well as potential substantial\npenalties for any failure to comply. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also cause us to change or limit our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nThe use of consumer data by online service providers and advertising networks is a topic of active interest among federal, state, and international regulatory bodies, and the regulatory\nenvironment is unsettled and evolving. Federal, state, and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, disclosure, sharing, and security of data that we receive from and\nabout our users. Our privacy and cookie policies and practices concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of user data are posted on our websites.\nA number of U.S. federal laws, including those referenced below, impact our business. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) is intended, in part, to limit the liability of eligible\nonline service providers for listing or linking to third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others. Portions of the Communications Decency Act (“CDA”) are\nintended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who distribute third-party content. We rely on the protections provided by both the DMCA and the CDA in conducting our\nbusiness. If these or other laws or judicial interpretations are changed to narrow their protections, or if international jurisdictions refuse to apply similar provisions in international lawsuits, we will be\nsubject to a greater risk of liability, our costs of compliance with these regulations or to defend litigation may increase, or our ability to operate certain lines of business may be limited. The Children’s\nOnline Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) is intended to impose restrictions on the ability of online services to collect some types of information from children under the age of 13. In addition, the\nProviding Resources, Officers, and Technology to Eradicate Cyber Threats to Our Children Act of 2008 (“PROTECT Act”) requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal\nchild pornography laws under certain circumstances, as well as other federal, state or international laws and legislative efforts designed to protect children on the internet may impose additional\nrequirements on us.\n-26-"

While we believe we are in compliance with the relevant laws\nand regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines, forfeitures, and other adverse actions.\nThe Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (the “CAN-SPAM Act”), which allows for penalties that run into the millions of dollars, requires\ncommercial emails to include identifying information from the sender and a mechanism for the receiver to opt out of receiving future emails. Several states have enacted additional, more restrictive\nand punitive laws regulating commercial email. Foreign legislation exists as well, including Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation and the European laws that have been enacted pursuant to the GDPR and\nEuropean Union Directive 2002/58/EC and its amendments. We use email as a significant means of communicating with our existing and potential users. We believe that our email practices comply\nwith the requirements of the CAN-SPAM Act, state laws, and applicable foreign legislation. If we were ever found to be in violation of these laws and regulations, or any other laws or regulations, our\nbusiness, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nMany third-parties are examining whether the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) concept of public accommodation also extends to websites and to mobile applications. Generally,\nsome plaintiffs have argued that websites and mobile applications are places of public accommodation under Title III of the ADA and, as such, must be equipped so that individuals with disabilities\ncan navigate and make use of subject websites and mobile applications. The issue is currently under litigation and there is a split in the federal court of appeals circuits as to what the ADA requires.\nCertain appellate circuits have found that websites standing alone are subject to the ADA and therefore must be accessible to people with disabilities. Other circuits, including the Ninth Circuit, which\nhas appellate jurisdiction over federal district courts in California have found that in order for websites to be places of public accommodation, and therefore subject to the ADA, there must be both a\nnexus between the website and the goods and services the website provides as well as a physical brick and mortar location for consumers. We cannot predict how the ADA will ultimately be\ninterpreted as applied to websites and mobile applications.\nWe believe we are in compliance with relevant law. If the law changes or if certain courts with appellate jurisdiction outside of California attempt to exercise jurisdiction over us and find that\nour website and mobile applications must comply with the ADA, then any adjustments or requirements to implement any changes prescribed by the ADA could result in increased costs to our\nbusiness, we may become subject to injunctive relief, plaintiffs may be able to recover attorneys’ fees, and it is possible that, while the ADA does not provide for monetary damages, we become\nsubject to such damages through state consumer protection or other laws. It is possible that these potential liabilities could cause a material adverse effect on our operations and harm our business\nreputation.\nNative advertising is an increasing part of our Digital Media business’s online advertising revenue. On December 22, 2015, the FTC issued Guidelines and an Enforcement Policy Statement\non native advertising, described by the FTC as, in part, ads which often “resemble the design, style, and functionality of the media in which they are disseminated.” The Company believes it is\ncompliant with the requirements of these guidelines on our current practices and offerings. However, we will continue to monitor what effect this guideline and other related government regulations,\nand how the FTC enforces it, could have on our native advertising and branded content business. In addition, the timing and extent of any enforcement by the FTC with regard to the native advertising\npractices by the Company, or others, could reduce the revenue we generate from this line of business. The UK similarly has issued guidelines on native advertising in the UK Code of Non-broadcast\nAdvertising and Direct & Promotional Marketing (“CAP Code”) and is regulated, in part, by the Advertising Standards Authority. The Company believes it is compliant with the requirements of the\nCAP Code on our current practices and offerings and will continue to monitor the effect of these and other related governmental regulations.\nAs of May 25, 2018, certain data transfers from and between the European Union (“EU”) are subject to the GDPR. As discussed in more detail below, the GDPR prohibits data transfers from\nthe EU to other countries outside of the EU, including the U.S., without appropriate security safeguards and practices in place. Previously, for certain data transfers from and between the EU and the\nU.S., the Company, like many other companies, had relied on what is referred to as the “EU-U.S. Safe Harbor,” in order to comply with privacy obligations imposed by EU countries. The European\nCourt of Justice invalidated the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor. Additionally, other countries that relied on the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor that were not part of the EU have also found that data transfers to the U.S.\nare no longer valid based on the European Court of Justice ruling. Although U.S. and EU policymakers approved a new framework known as “Privacy Shield” that would allow companies like us to\ncontinue to rely on some form of a safe harbor for the transfer of certain data from the EU to the U.S., on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a judgment declaring as\n“invalid” the European Commission’s Decision (EU) 2016/1250 on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, rendering it invalid. We cannot predict how or if these\nissues will be resolved nor can we evaluate any potential liability at this time.\n-27-"

Some independent data regulators have adopted the position that other forms of compliance are also invalid, though the legal\ngrounds for these findings remain unclear at this time. We cannot predict at this time whether the alternative grounds that the Company continues to implement will be found to be consistent with\nrelevant laws nor can we evaluate what, if any, potential liability may be at this time.\nOn June 28, 2018, the California legislature enacted the CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020 and became enforceable starting July 1, 2020. The CCPA, which covers businesses that\nobtain or access personal information of California resident consumers, grants consumers enhanced privacy rights and control over their personal information and imposes significant requirements on\ncovered companies with respect to consumer data privacy rights. The CCPA provides consumers with the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information including the requirement to include a\n“Do Not Sell” link on our websites and applications that sell personal data of California resident consumers. Based on the final implementation regulations released by the California Attorney General\nin August 2020, we believe we have implemented such links where necessary, we action consumer opt outs and other subject rights when requested, and our privacy policies have been updated and\nposted on our websites. In addition, in November 2020 California voters adopted the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) that amends the CCPA, including creating a new agency to implement\nand enforce the law. The CPRA took effect on January 1, 2023 and is subject to a number of required rule-makings. We believe we comply with the CPRA and are continuing to evaluate the impact to\nour business, if any. Other states have enacted or are considering enacting similar privacy laws, which may subject our Company to additional requirements and restrictions that could have an impact\non our business.\nFurther, failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies, applicable requirements, or industry self-regulatory principles related to the collection, use, sharing, or security of\npersonal information, or other privacy, data-retention or data protection matters could result in a loss of user confidence in us, damage to our brands, and ultimately in a loss of users and advertising\npartners, which could adversely affect our business. Changes in these or any other laws and regulations or the interpretation of them could increase our future compliance costs, limit the amount and\ntype of data we can collect, transfer, share, or sell, make our products and services less attractive to our users, or cause us to change or limit our business practices. Further, any failure on our part to\ncomply with any relevant laws or regulations may subject us to significant civil or criminal liabilities.\nMoreover, our Everyday Health Group business may be subject to additional government oversight or regulation by Congress, the FTC, the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices and state legislatures and regulatory agencies. In addition, certain services provided by Everyday Health Group constituent businesses are also subject to private regulation both directly by\naccrediting bodies and indirectly by industry codes followed by commercial supporters and providers of continuing education programs for healthcare professionals.\nIf we are subject to burdensome laws or regulations or if we fail to adhere to the requirements of public or private regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could\nsuffer.\nGovernment and private actions or self-regulatory developments regarding internet privacy matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nCertain business units within our Digital Media business collect and sell data about their users’ online behavior and the revenue associated with this activity could be impacted by government\nregulation and enforcement, industry trends, self-regulation, technology changes, consumer behavior and attitude, and private action. We also use such information to work with our advertisers to more\neffectively target ads to relevant users and consumers, which ads command a higher rate.\nMany of our users voluntarily provide us with demographic and other information when they register for one of our services or properties. In order for our Everyday Health Group brands to\ndeliver marketing and communications solutions to pharmaceutical and medical device companies, health insurers, hospital systems, and other customers, we rely on data provided by our users. We\nalso purchase data from third-party sources to augment our user profiles and marketing databases so we are better able to personalize content, enhance our analytical capabilities and better target our\nmarketing programs. If changes in user sentiment regarding the sharing of information results in a significant number of visitors to our websites and applications refusing to provide us with\ninformation such as demographic information, information about their specific health interests, or profession information, our ability to personalize content for our users and provide targeted\nmarketing solutions would be impaired. If our users choose to opt-out of having their data used for behavioral targeting, it would be more difficult for us to offer targeted marketing programs to our\ncustomers.\nWe append data from third-party sources to augment our user profiles. If we are unable to acquire data from third-party sources for whatever reason, or if there is a marked increase in the cost\nof obtaining such data, our ability to personalize content and provide marketing solutions could be negatively impacted.\n-28-"

These regulations seek, among\nother things, to allow consumers to have greater control over the use of private information collected online, to forbid the collection or use of online information, to demand a business to comply with\ntheir choice to opt out of such collection or use, and to place limits upon the disclosure of information to third-party websites. Similarly, exercise of the “Do Not Sell” right under the CCPA limits a\nbusiness’ ability to monetize certain personal information collected online. Such laws and regulations could have a significant impact on the operation of our advertising and data businesses. U.S.\nregulatory agencies have also placed an increased focus on online privacy matters and, in particular, on online advertising activities that utilize cookies or other tracking tools. Consumer and industry\ngroups have expressed concerns about online data collection and use by companies, which has resulted in the release of various industry self-regulatory codes of conduct and best practice guidelines\nthat are binding for member companies and that govern, among other things, the ways in which companies can collect, use and disclose user information, how companies must give notice of these\npractices and what choices companies must provide to consumers regarding these practices.\nWe may be required or otherwise choose to adopt Do Not Track mechanisms or self-regulation principles or provide opt-outs from the sale of certain user data, in which case our ability to use\nour existing tracking technologies, to collect and sell user behavioral data, and permit their use by other third parties could be impaired.

The interpretation of these laws may be uncertain and may also impose conflicting\nobligations on us. While we work to comply with all applicable law and relevant “best practices” addressing cybersecurity, privacy, data security and data protection, this is an area of the law that is\nconstantly evolving as are the relevant industry codes and threat matrix. Further it is possible that applicable law and “best practices” are interpreted in an inconsistent or conflicting manner either by\ndiffering federal, state or international authorities or across the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any failure or perceived failure by us, our partners, our vendors, or third parties on which we rely for\nour operations could result in a significant liability to us (including in the form of judicial decisions and/or settlements, regulatory findings and/or forfeitures, and other means), cause considerable\nharm to us and our reputation (including requiring notification to customers, regulators, and/or the media), cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, and deter current and potential\ncustomers from using our services.

The GDPR harmonizes EU data privacy laws and contains significant obligations and\nrequirements that have resulted in a greater compliance burden with respect to our operations and data use in Europe, which will continue to increase our costs. The CCPA, in its original form and as\namended under the CPRA, similarly contains significant obligations and requirements that have resulted in a greater compliance burden with respect to our operations and data usage of California\nresidents, which will continue to increase our costs. Additionally, government authorities will have more power to enforce compliance and impose substantial penalties for any failure to comply. In\naddition, individuals have the right to compensation under the GDPR, and individuals may have the right to file a class action under the CCPA in certain circumstances. In the event the Company fails\nto maintain compliance, the Company could be exposed to material damages, costs and/or fines if an EU government authority, an EU resident, the California Attorney General or a California resident\ncommenced an action. Failure to comply or maintain compliance could cause considerable harm to us and our reputation (including requiring notification to customers, regulators, and/or the media),\ncause a loss of confidence in our products and services, and deter current and potential customers from using our services. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nprospects, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nWe face potential liability related to the privacy and security of health-related information we collect from, or on behalf of, our consumers and customers.\nThe privacy and security of information about the physical or mental health or condition of an individual is an area of significant focus in the United States and in other jurisdictions because\nof heightened privacy concerns and the potential for significant consumer harm from the misuse of such sensitive data. We have procedures and technology in place intended to safeguard the\ninformation we receive from customers and users of our services from unauthorized access or use.\nThe Privacy Standards and Security Standards under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) establish a set of basic national privacy and security\nstandards for the protection of individually identifiable health information by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and certain healthcare providers, referred to as “covered entities”, and the\nbusiness associates with whom such covered entities contract for services. Notably, whereas HIPAA previously directly regulated only these covered entities, the Health Information Technology for\nEconomic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”) made certain of HIPAA’s Privacy and Security Standards directly applicable to covered entities’ business associates. Business associates are\nsubject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable Privacy and Security Standards. Additionally, certain states have adopted comparable privacy and security laws\nand regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA.\nHIPAA directly applies to covered entities such as hospital clients of certain of our subsidiaries. Since these clients disclose protected health information to our subsidiaries so that those\nsubsidiaries can provide certain services to them, those subsidiaries are business associates of those clients. In addition, we may sign business associate agreements in connection with the provision of\nthe products and services developed for other third parties or in connection with certain of our other services that may transmit or store protected health information.\nFailure to comply with the requirements of HIPAA, HITECH, regulations promulgated under HIPAA and HITECH (including but not limited to the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and the\nHealth Breach Notification Rule), or any of the applicable federal and state laws and regulations regarding patient privacy, identity theft prevention and detection, breach notification and data security\nmay subject us to penalties, including civil monetary penalties and, in some circumstances, criminal penalties or contractual liability under agreements with our customers and clients. Any failure or\nperception of failure of our products or services to meet HIPAA, HITECH and related regulatory requirements could expose us to risks of investigation, notification, litigation, penalty or enforcement,\nadversely affect demand for our products and services, and force us to expend significant capital and other resources to modify our products or services to address the privacy and security\nrequirements of our clients and HIPAA and HITECH.\nThese laws and regulations are subject to interpretation by courts and regulators that might expand their scope of coverage. For example, the FTC recently adopted a Policy Statement offering\nguidance on the scope of its Health Breach Notification Rule, and issued related guidance, stating that consumer mobile applications that draw health information from one source and health or non-\nhealth information from one or more other sources are covered by the Rule, and that breaches of security under the Rule include disclosures of sensitive health information without user authorization.\nAny changes in these or any other laws and regulations or the interpretation of them could increase our future compliance costs, limit the amount and type of data we can collect, transfer, share, or sell,\nmake our products and services less attractive to our users, or cause us to change or limit our business practices. Further, any failure on our part to comply with any relevant laws or regulations may\nsubject us to significant civil or criminal liabilities.\n-30-"

      "text": "Developments in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business.\nA significant portion of Everyday Health Group’s advertising and sponsorship revenues is derived from the healthcare industry, including pharmaceutical, medical device, over-the-counter,\nand consumer-packaged-goods companies, and could be affected by changes affecting healthcare spending. Industry changes affecting healthcare spending could impact the market for these offerings.\nGeneral reductions in expenditures by healthcare industry participants could result from, among other things:\n•\ngovernment regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which healthcare industry participants interact with consumers and the general public;\n•\nchanges to federal and state tax rates and allowed expense deductions;\n•\nconsolidation of healthcare industry participants;\n•\nreductions in governmental funding for healthcare; and\n•\nadverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting pharmaceutical and medical device companies or other healthcare industry participants.\nEven if general expenditures by industry participants remain the same or increase, developments in the healthcare industry may result in reduced spending in some or all of the specific market\nsegments that we serve now or in the future. For example, use of our content offerings and the sale of our products and services could be affected by:\n•\nchanges in the design and provision of health insurance plans;\n•\na decrease in the number of new drugs or pharmaceutical and medical device products coming to market; and\n•\ndecreases in marketing expenditures by pharmaceutical or medical device companies as a result of governmental regulation or private initiatives that discourage or prohibit advertising or\nsponsorship activities by pharmaceutical or medical device companies.\nThe healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years, and we expect that significant changes to the healthcare industry will continue to occur. However, the timing and impact of\ndevelopments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict. We cannot assure you that the demand for our offerings will continue to exist at current levels or that we will have adequate technical,\nfinancial, and marketing resources to react to changes in the healthcare industry.\nGovernment regulation of healthcare creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies with our Everyday Health Group set of brands.\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences. Existing and future laws and regulations affecting the healthcare\nindustry could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs, and restrict our operations. Many healthcare laws are complex, and their application may not be clear. Our failure\nto accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or other failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could create liability for us. Even in areas where we are not subject to\nhealthcare regulation directly, we may become involved in governmental actions or investigations through our relationships with customers that are regulated, and participation in such actions or\ninvestigations, even if we are not a party and not the subject of an investigation, may cause us to incur significant expenses. Additionally, government actions, investigations, or pronouncements, or a\nchange in self-regulatory organization rules or healthcare industry norms, might impact healthcare industry customer views of risks associated with purchasing our services and result in a reduction in\ntheir expenditures.\nFor example, there are federal and state laws that govern patient referrals, physician financial relationships and inducements to healthcare providers and patients. The federal healthcare\nprograms’ anti-kickback provisions prohibit any person or entity from willingly offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward, or in return for\neither the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase or order\nof any item, good, facility or service covered by these programs. Many states also have similar anti-kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a\nfederal healthcare program. Our sale of advertising and sponsorships to healthcare providers potentially implicates these laws. However, we review our practices to ensure that we comply with all\napplicable laws. The laws in this area are broad, and we cannot determine precisely how they will be applied to our business practices. Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that\nany of our practices violate any of these laws could subject us to liability and require us to change or terminate some portions of our business.\nFurther, we derive revenues from the sale of advertising and promotion of prescription and over-the-counter drugs and medical devices, as well as non-drug consumer health and wellness\nproducts. If the FDA or the FTC finds that any of the information provided on our properties violates FDA or FTC regulations, they may take regulatory or judicial action against us and/or the\nadvertiser of that information. State attorneys general may also take similar action based on their state’s consumer protection statutes. Any increase or change in regulation of advertising and\npromotion in the healthcare industry could make it more difficult for us to generate and grow our advertising and sponsorship revenues.\n-31-"

      "text": "In addition, the practice of most healthcare professions requires licensing under applicable state law and state laws may further prohibit business entities from practicing medicine, which is\nreferred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. Similar state prohibitions may exist with respect to other licensed professions. We believe that we do not engage in the practice\nof medicine or any other licensed healthcare profession, or provide, through our properties, professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or other advice that is tailored in such a way as to\nimplicate state licensing or professional practice laws. However, a state may determine that some portion of our business violates these laws and may seek to have us discontinue those portions or\nsubject us to penalties or licensure requirements. Any determination that we are a healthcare provider and acted improperly as a healthcare provider may result in liability to us.\nOur business could suffer if providers of broadband internet access services block, impair or degrade our services.\nOur business is dependent on the ability of our customers and visitors to our digital media properties to access our services and applications over broadband internet connections. Internet\naccess providers and internet backbone providers may be able to block, degrade, or charge for access or bandwidth use of certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses\nand the loss of users. Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet. Use of our services and applications through mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets,\nmust have a high-speed data connection. Broadband internet access services, whether wireless or landline, are provided by companies with significant market power. Many of these providers offer\nproducts and services that directly compete with ours.\nMany of the largest providers of broadband services have publicly stated that they will not degrade or disrupt their customers’ use of applications and services, like ours. If such providers were to\ndegrade, impair, or block our services, it would negatively impact our ability to provide services to our customers and likely result in lost revenue and profits, and we would incur legal fees in\nattempting to restore our users’ access to our services. Broadband internet access providers may also attempt to charge us or our customers additional fees to access services like ours that may result in\nthe loss of customers and revenue, decreased profitability, or increased costs to our retail offerings that may make our services less competitive.\nTechnologies have been developed that are able to block certain of our advertisements or impair our ability to serve interest-based advertising which could harm our operating results.\nTechnologies have been developed and are likely to continue to be developed that can block internet or mobile display advertising. Most of our Digital Media business revenues are derived\nfrom fees paid by advertisers in connection with the display of advertisements or clicks on advertisements on web pages or mobile devices. As a result, such technologies and tools are reducing the\nnumber of display advertisements that we are able to deliver or our ability to serve our interest-based advertising and this, in turn, could reduce our advertising revenue and operating results. Adoption\nof these types of technologies by more of our users could have a material impact on our revenues. We have implemented third-party products to combat these ad-blocking technologies and are\ndeveloping other strategies to address advertisement blocking. However, our efforts may not be successful to offset the potential increasing impact of these advertising blocking products.\nIf we or our third-party service providers fail to prevent click fraud or choose to manage traffic quality in a way that advertisers find unsatisfactory, our profitability may decline.\nA portion of our display revenue comes from advertisers that pay for advertising on a price-per-click basis, meaning that the advertisers pay a fee every time a user clicks on their advertising.\nThis pricing model can be vulnerable to so-called “click fraud,” which occurs when clicks are submitted on ads by a user who is motivated by reasons other than genuine interest in the subject of the\nad. A portion of our display revenue also comes from advertisers that pay for advertising on the bases of price-per-impression, price-per-visit or price-per-engagement. These pricing models can also\nbe vulnerable to fraud known variously as “invalid traffic” or “non-human traffic,” which occurs when the impression, visit or engagement is generated for reasons other than genuine interest in the\nsubject of the ad. We or our third-party service providers may be exposed to the risk of click fraud, invalid traffic or other clicks, actions or conversions that advertisers may perceive as undesirable. If\nfraudulent or other malicious activity is perpetrated by others and we or our third-party service providers are unable to detect and prevent it, or choose to manage traffic quality in a way that advertisers\nfind unsatisfactory, the affected advertisers may experience or perceive a reduced return on their investment in our advertising programs which could lead the advertisers to become dissatisfied with\nour advertising programs and they might refuse to pay, demand refunds, or withdraw future business. Undetected click fraud could damage our brands and lead to a loss of advertisers and revenue. We\nobtain third-party certification that certain of our products apply “best practices” to detect and prevent click fraud. If we are unable to maintain such certification, advertisers might refuse to pay,\ndemand refunds, and withdraw future business, and our business reputation might be harmed.\nThe industries in which we operate are undergoing rapid technological changes and we may not be able to keep up.\nThe industries in which we operate are subject to rapid and significant technological change. We cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business. We expect that new\nservices and technologies will emerge in the markets in which we compete.

Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards.\nWe may be unable to obtain access to new technologies on acceptable terms or at all and may therefore be unable to offer services in a competitive manner. Any of the foregoing risks could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nRisks Related To Our Stock\nThe fundamental change purchase features of the 1.75% Convertible Notes and the change of control features of the 4.625% Senior Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial\nattempt to take over our company.\nThe terms of the 1.75% Convertible Notes require us to offer to purchase the 1.75% Convertible Notes for cash in the event of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 1.75%\nConvertible Notes), and the terms of the 4.625% Senior Notes require us to offer to repurchase the 4.625% Senior Notes for cash in the event of a change of control (as defined in the indenture\ngoverning the 4.625% Senior Notes). These features may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of the Company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.\nConversions of the 1.75% Convertible Notes could dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their 1.75% Convertible\nNotes.\nThe conversion of some or all of the 1.75% Convertible Notes could dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable\nupon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 1.75% Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market\nparticipants because the conversion of the 1.75% Convertible Notes could depress the price of our common stock.\nWe are a holding company and our operations are conducted through, and substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by, our subsidiaries, which may be subject to certain\nrestrictions on their ability to pay dividends to us to fund dividends on our stock, pay interest on the 1.75% Convertible Notes or 4.625% Senior Notes and fund other holding company\nexpenses.\nWe are a holding company. We conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries. A substantial portion of our consolidated assets is held by our subsidiaries. Accordingly,\nour ability to pay dividends on our stock, service our debt, including the 1.75% Convertible Notes and 4.625% Senior Notes, and fund other holding company expenses depends on the results of\noperations of our subsidiaries and upon the ability of such subsidiaries to provide us with cash, whether in the form of dividends, loans, or otherwise. Dividends, loans or other distributions to us from\nsuch subsidiaries could be subject to future contractual and other restrictions.\nFuture sales of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.\nAs of February 24, 2023, substantially all of our outstanding shares of common stock were available for resale, subject to volume and manner of sale limitations applicable to affiliates under\nSEC Rule 144. Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market or the perception of such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. These sales\nalso might make it more difficult for us to issue equity securities in the future at a price that we think is appropriate, or at all.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders.\nProvisions of Delaware law and of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of us. For example, we are subject to Section\n203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which would make it more difficult for another party to acquire us without the approval of our Board of Directors. Additionally, our certificate of\nincorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without requiring any stockholder approval, and preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a\ntakeover proposal. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline.\nOur stock price and trading volumes have been volatile and we expect that this volatility will continue in the future due to factors, such as:\n•\nAssessments of the size of our advertiser, user, and subscriber bases, our average revenue per user and subscriber, and comparisons of our results in these and other areas versus prior\nperformance and that of our competitors;\n•\nOur growth and profitability;\n•\nVariations between our actual results and investor expectations;\n•\nRegulatory or competitive developments affecting our markets;\n•\nInvestor perceptions of us and comparable public companies;\n-33-"

Our Digital Media business specializes in the technology, shopping, gaming and entertainment, and healthcare markets, offering content, tools and services to consumers\nand businesses. Our Cybersecurity and Martech business provides cloud-based subscription services to consumers and businesses including cybersecurity, privacy, and marketing technology.\nIn February 2021, we sold certain Voice assets in the United Kingdom and, in September 2021, we sold our B2B Backup business.\nOn October 7, 2021, we completed the separation of our cloud fax business (the “Separation”) into an independent publicly traded company, Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc. (“Consensus”).\nIn connection with the Separation, we changed our name to Ziff Davis, Inc. from J2 Global, Inc. (for certain events prior to October 7, 2021, the Company may be referred to as J2 Global). The\nSeparation was achieved through the Company’s distribution of 80.1% of the shares of Consensus common stock to holders of J2 Global common stock as of the close of business on October 1, 2021,\nthe record date for the distribution. The J2 Global stockholders of record received one share of Consensus common stock for every three shares of J2 Global’s common stock and we retained a 19.9%\ninterest in Consensus following the Separation (“Investment in Consensus”). Before the Separation, we reported our results as Digital Media and Cloud Services. In connection with the Separation, we\nnow refer to these segments as Digital Media and Cybersecurity and Martech.\nThe accounting requirements for reporting the Separation of Consensus as a discontinued operation were met when the Separation was completed on October 7, 2021. Accordingly, the\naccompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented reflect the results of the Consensus business as a discontinued operation. Ziff Davis did not retain a controlling interest in\nConsensus.\nOn June 10, 2022, the Company entered into a Fifth Amendment to its Credit Agreement and on September 15, 2022, the Company entered into a Sixth Amendment to its Credit Agreement,\neach with MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent and the lenders party thereto, to effectuate two debt-for equity exchanges of portions of the Investment in Consensus.\nThe Fifth Amendment to the Credit Agreement provided for the issuance of a senior secured term loan under the Credit Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount of $90.0 million (the “Term Loan\nFacility”) and the Sixth Amendment to the Credit Agreement provided for the issuance of a senior secured term loan under the Credit Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount of $22.3 million (the\n“Term Loan Two Facility”). Both amendments provided for certain other changes to the Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 10 - Debt in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation. During June 2022, the Company borrowed approximately $90.0 million under the Term Loan Facility and completed a non-cash exchange of 2.3 million shares of the Investment in\nConsensus to settle its obligation of $90.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan Facility plus related interest. During September 2022, the Company borrowed\napproximately $22.3 million under the Term Loan Two Facility and completed a non-cash exchange of 0.5 million shares of the Investment in Consensus to settle its obligation of $22.3 million\noutstanding aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan Two Facility plus related interest. As of December 31, 2022, the Company holds approximately 1.1 million shares of the common stock of\nConsensus. The Investment in Consensus represents an investment in equity securities for which the Company elected the fair value option and subsequent fair value changes in the Consensus shares\nare included in our assets and results from continuing operations.\nOur consolidated revenues are currently generated primarily from two basic business models, each with different financial profiles and variability. Our Digital Media business is driven\nprimarily by advertising revenues, has relatively higher sales and marketing expense and has seasonal strength in the fourth quarter. Our Cybersecurity and Martech business is driven primarily by\nsubscription revenues with relatively stable and predictable margins from quarter to quarter. In addition to growing our business organically, on a regular basis we acquire businesses to grow our\ncustomer bases, expand and diversify our service offerings, enhance our technologies, acquire skilled personnel, and enter into new markets. We continue to pursue additional\n-39-"

For our advertising businesses, net advertising\nrevenue retention is an indicator of our ability to retain the spend of our existing advertisers year over year, which we view as a reflection of the effectiveness of our advertising platform. Similarly, we\nmonitor the number of our advertisers and the revenue per advertiser, as defined below, as these metrics provide further details related to our reported revenue and contribute to certain of our business\nplanning decisions.\nFor our subscription and licensing businesses, the number of subscribers that we serve is an indicator of our customer retention and growth.

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ significantly from\nthose estimates under different assumptions and conditions and may be material.\nThe accounting policies described below are those we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and that require the most\ncomplex and subjective management judgment.\nRevenue Recognition\nDigital Media\nDigital Media revenues are earned primarily from the delivery of advertising services and from subscriptions to services and information.\nRevenue is earned from the delivery of advertising services on websites that are owned and operated by us and on those websites that are part of Digital Media’s advertising network.\nDepending on the individual contracts with the customer, revenue for these services is recognized over the contract period when any of the following performance obligations are satisfied: (i) when an\nadvertisement is placed for viewing, (ii) when a qualified sales lead is delivered, (iii) when a visitor “clicks through” on an advertisement; or (iv) when commissions are earned upon the sale of an\nadvertised product.\nRevenue from subscriptions is earned through the granting of access to, or delivery of, data products or services to customers. Subscriptions cover video games and related content, health\ninformation, data and other copyrighted material. Revenues under such agreements are recognized over the contract term for use of the service. Revenues are also earned from listing fees,\nsubscriptions to online publications, and from other sources. Subscription revenues are recognized over time.\nWe also generate Digital Media subscription revenues through the license of certain assets to clients. Assets are licensed for clients’ use in their own promotional materials or otherwise and\nmay include logos, editorial reviews, or other copyrighted material. Revenues under such license agreements are recognized over the contract term for use of the asset. On instances when technology\nassets are licensed to our clients, revenues from the license of these assets are recognized over the term of the access period.\nThe Digital Media business also generates revenue from other sources which include marketing and production services. Such other revenues are generally recognized over the period in\nwhich the products or services are delivered.\nWe also generate Digital Media revenues from transactions involving the sale of perpetual software licenses, related software support and maintenance, hardware used in conjunction with its\nsoftware, and other related services. Revenue is\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n-41-"

      "text": "recognized for these software transactions with multiple performance obligations after (i) the contract has been approved and we are committed to perform the respective obligations and (ii) we can\nidentify and quantify each obligation and its respective selling price. Once the respective performance obligations have been identified and quantified, revenue will be recognized when the obligations\nare met, either over time or at a point in time depending on the nature of the obligation.\nRevenues from software license performance obligations are generally recognized upfront at the point in time that the software is made available to the customer to download and use.\nRevenues for related software support and maintenance performance obligations are related to technical support provided to customers as needed and unspecified software product upgrades,\nmaintenance releases and patches during the term of the support period when they are available. We are obligated to make the support services available continuously throughout the contract period.\nTherefore, revenues for support contracts are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period the support services are provided. Hardware product and related software performance\nobligations, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a bundled performance obligation. The revenues for this bundled performance\nobligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware and software products are delivered and ownership is transferred to the customer. Other service revenues are generally\nrecognized over time as the services are performed.\nThe Company records revenue on a gross basis with respect to revenue generated (i) by the Company serving online display and video advertising across its owned and operated web\nproperties, on third-party sites or on unaffiliated advertising networks; (ii) through the Company’s lead-generation business; and (iii) through the Company’s subscriptions. The Company records\nrevenue on a net basis with respect to revenue paid to the Company by certain third-party advertising networks who serve online display and video advertising across the Company’s owned-and-\noperated web properties and certain third-party sites.\nCybersecurity and Martech\nThe Company’s Cybersecurity and Martech revenues substantially consist of subscription fees and usage-based fees, a significant portion of which are paid in advance. The Company defers\nthe portions of monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual fees collected in advance of the satisfaction of performance obligations and recognizes them in the period earned.\nAlong with its numerous proprietary Cybersecurity and Martech solutions, the Company also generates subscription revenues by reselling various third-party solutions, primarily through its\nemail security line of business. These third-party solutions, along with the Company’s proprietary products, allow it to offer customers a variety of solutions to better meet the customer’s needs. The\nCompany records revenue on a gross basis with respect to reseller revenue because the Company has control of the specified good or service prior to transferring control to the customer.\nImpairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets  \nThe Company accounts for long-lived assets, which include property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives (subject to\namortization), in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (“ASC\n360”), which requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nRecoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the expected undiscounted future net cash flows generated by the asset. If it is determined that the asset may not be\nrecoverable, and if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent of the difference.\nThe Company assesses the impairment of identifiable definite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be\nrecoverable. Factors it considers important which could individually or in combination trigger an impairment include the following:\n•\nSignificant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;\n•\nSignificant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the Company’s overall business;\n•\nSignificant negative industry or economic trends;\n•\nSignificant decline in the Company’s stock price for a sustained period; and\n•\nThe Company’s market capitalization relative to net book value.\nIf the Company determined that the carrying value of definite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of\nimpairment, it would record an impairment equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value.\n-42-"

      "text": "The Company assessed whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying amount of definite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets may not be\nrecoverable. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any events or circumstances indicating impairment of long-lived assets, other than the recording of an\nimpairment of certain operating right-of-use assets and associated property and equipment. Refer to Note 11 - Leases to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K. No impairment was recorded for the year ended 2020.\nThe Company classifies its long-lived assets to be sold as held for sale in the period (i) it has approved and committed to a plan to sell the asset, (ii) the asset is available for immediate sale in\nits present condition, (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to sell the asset have been initiated, (iv) the sale of the asset is probable and the transfer is expected to qualify\nfor recognition as a sale within one year, (v) the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, and (vi) it is unlikely that significant changes to\nthe plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. The Company initially measures a long-lived asset that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any\ncosts to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a long-lived asset until\nthe date of sale. Upon designation as an asset held for sale, the Company stops recording depreciation expense on the asset. The Company assesses the fair value of a long-lived asset less any costs to\nsell at each reporting period and until the asset is no longer classified as held for sale.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets \nThe Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with GAAP and uses estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for\nacquisitions to the fair value of the assets, including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired. Such estimates may be based on significant unobservable inputs and assumptions such as, but\nnot limited to, future revenue growth rates, gross and operating margins, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, discount rates and terminal growth rate assumptions. The Company uses established\nvaluation techniques and may engage reputable valuation specialists to assist with the valuations. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but\nwhich are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Fair values are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date of an acquisition\nas information relative to closing date fair values becomes available. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Intangible assets resulting\nfrom the acquisitions of entities accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting are recorded at the estimated fair value of the assets acquired. Identifiable intangible assets are comprised of\npurchased customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, developed technologies and other intangible assets. Intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized over the period of estimated\neconomic benefit ranging from one to twenty years and are included in general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company evaluates its goodwill and\nindefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”), which provides that goodwill and other intangible assets with\nindefinite lives are not amortized but tested annually for impairment or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. In connection with the annual impairment test for\ngoodwill, the Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the\nCompany determines that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it then performs an impairment test of goodwill. The impairment test\ninvolves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. The Company generally determines the fair value of its reporting units\nusing a mix of an income approach and a market approach. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. During\nthe years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment of $27.4 million and $32.6 million, respectively. No goodwill impairment was recognized during the year\nended December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 9 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements and the Company’s expectations of the impact on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.\n-43-"

The main focus of our platform monetization programs is to provide relevant and useful advertising to visitors to our websites, provide meaningful\ncontent that informs and shapes purchase intent, and leverage our brand and editorial assets into subscription platforms. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the\nads displayed on our websites and those included within our advertising networks, and improve the effectiveness of our content in driving purchase decisions and subscriptions.\nThe operating margin we realize on revenues generated from ads placed on our websites is significantly higher than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from those\nplaced on third-party websites. Growth in advertising revenues from our websites has generally exceeded that from third-party websites. This trend has generally had a positive impact on our operating\nmargins.\nWe expect acquisitions to remain an important component of our strategy and use of capital in this business; however, we cannot predict whether our current pace of acquisitions will remain\nthe same within this business, especially in light of the current macroeconomic conditions. In a given period, we may close greater or fewer acquisitions than in prior periods or acquisitions of greater\nor lesser significance than in prior periods. Moreover, future acquisitions of businesses within this space, but with different business models, may impact Digital Media’s overall operating profit\nmargins.\nCybersecurity and Martech\nThe main focus of our Cybersecurity and Martech service offerings is to reduce or eliminate costs, increase sales and enhance productivity, mobility, business continuity, and security of our\ncustomers as the technologies and devices they use evolve over time. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to enhance our existing offerings and offer new services to continue to satisfy the\nevolving needs of our customers.\nWe expect acquisitions to remain an important component of our strategy and use of capital in this business; however, we cannot predict whether our current pace of acquisitions will remain\nthe same within this business, especially in light of the current macroeconomic conditions.

Interest expense, net was $33.8 million and $72.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Interest expense, net decreased in 2022 compared to 2021\nprimarily due to approximately $11.5 million less interest expense due to the redemption of our 3.25% Convertible Notes in August 2021, approximately $15.7 million less interest expense from the\nadoption of ASU 2020-06 during 2022, and approximately $9.5 million less interest expense from the 4.625% Senior Notes related to a lower principal balance over the period due to the repurchase of\na portion of the outstanding 4.625% Senior Notes throughout 2022.\nGain (loss) on debt extinguishment, net.

Loss on sale of businesses was $21.8 million in 2021.

Loss on investment, net increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the net realized loss on the disposition of 2.9 million shares from\nour Investment in Consensus during 2022 resulting from the decrease in the quoted share price of Consensus during 2022.\nOther income, net. Other income, net is generated primarily from miscellaneous items and gain or losses on currency exchange. Other income, net was $8.4 million and $1.3 million in 2022\nand 2021, respectively. The change was attributable to changes in gain or losses on currency exchange.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax regulations (including those related to transfer pricing), and different tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we\noperate. The tax bases of our assets and liabilities reflect our best estimate of the tax benefits and costs we expect to realize. When necessary, we establish valuation allowances to reduce our deferred\ntax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) of $22.8 million, after considering substantial restrictions on the utilization of these NOLs due\nto “ownership changes”, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). The Company estimates that all of the above-mentioned federal NOLs will be\navailable for use before their expiration. $20.7 million of the NOLs expire through the year 2037 and $2.1 million of the NOLs carry forward indefinitely depending on the year the loss was incurred.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had interest expense limitation carryovers of $6.4 million and $23.3 million, respectively, which last indefinitely.

Our effective tax rates for 2022 and 2021 were 44.2% and (4.0)%, respectively.\nThe increase in our annual effective income tax rate in 2022 from 2021 was primarily attributable to the following:\n1.\nan increase in our effective income tax rate during 2022 due to recognizing a deferred tax liability related to the Investment in Consensus resulting in a tax expense of $13.4 million; and\n2.\nan increase in our tax expense due to a lower net reduction in our reserves in 2022 as compared to 2021 for uncertain tax positions, primarily due to the lapse of the statute of limitations in\ncertain jurisdictions; and\n3.\nan increase in our effective income tax rate during 2022 for U.S. state and local taxes due to a greater portion of our income being subject to tax in the U.S.; partially offset by\n4.\na decrease in our effective income tax rate during 2022 due to recognizing a tax benefit for a deferred tax asset related to goodwill impairment.\nIn order to provide additional understanding in connection with our foreign taxes, the following represents the statutory and effective tax rate by significant foreign country:\nIreland\nUnited Kingdom\nCanada\nStatutory tax rate\n12.5%\n19.0%\n26.5%\nEffective tax rate \n15.6%\n20.8%\n24.3%\n(1) Effective tax rate excludes certain discrete items.\nThe statutory tax rate is the rate imposed on taxable income for corporations by the local government in that jurisdiction. The effective tax rate measures the taxes paid as a percentage of\npretax profit. The effective tax rate can differ from the statutory tax rate when a company can exempt some income from tax, claim tax credits, or due to the effect of book-tax differences that do not\nreverse and discrete items.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis.

To achieve these objectives, we maintain\nour portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy or otherwise approved by the Board of Directors.\nOur cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our cash and cash\nequivalents approximated fair value. Our return on these investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalent investments primarily in funds that invest in U.S. treasuries, money market funds, as well as, demand\ndeposit accounts with maturities of 90 days or less of $652.8 million and $694.8 million, respectively.

Subject to customary conditions, the Company may, from time to time, request increases in the commitments under the Credit Agreement in an\naggregate amount up to $250 million, for a total aggregate commitment of up to $350 million. The proceeds of the Credit Facility are intended to be used for working capital and general corporate\npurposes of the Company and its subsidiaries, including to finance certain permitted acquisitions and capital expenditures in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.\n-53-"

The final maturity of the Credit Facility will occur on April 7, 2026. The Company is permitted to make voluntary prepayments of the Credit Facility at any\ntime without payment of a premium or penalty.\nOn June 2, 2021, June 21, 2021, August 20, 2021 and September 16, 2021, the Company entered into First, Second, Third and Fourth Amendments (together the “Amendments”) to the Credit\nAgreement. The Amendments (i) provided for the issuance of a senior secured term loan under the Credit Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount of $485.0 million (the “Bridge Loan Facility”),\n(ii) permitted the spin-off of the Company’s cloud fax business into a new publicly traded company, and (iii) provided for certain other changes to the Credit Agreement. During the third quarter of\n2021, the Company drew on the full amount of the Bridge Loan Facility with $485.0 million outstanding (later extinguished as described below). The proceeds of the Bridge Loan Facility were used\nto redeem the Company’s 3.25% Convertible Notes. See Note 10 - Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe loans under the Bridge Loan Facility (the “Bridge Loans”) bore interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) initially upon funding of the Bridge Loans, either a base rate plus 2.00%, or a\nLIBOR rate plus 3.00%, (ii) from six months after the funding date of the Bridge Loans until twelve months after the funding date of the Bridge Loans, either a base rate plus 2.50%, or a LIBOR rate\nplus 3.50%, and (iii) from twelve months after the funding date of the Bridge Loans until repayment of the Bridge Loans, either a base rate plus 3.00% or a LIBOR rate plus 4.00%. The Bridge Loan\nFacility was to mature on the date that was 364 days after the funding date of the Bridge Loans, with two automatic extensions, each for an additional three months, if SEC approval of the spin-off\ntransaction was still outstanding.\nOn October 7, 2021, in exchange for the equity interest in Consensus, Consensus issued $500.0 million of senior notes due 2028 to Ziff Davis. Ziff Davis then exchanged such notes with the\nlenders under the Credit Agreement and Credit Agreement Amendments by and among the subsidiaries of Ziff Davis party thereto as guarantors, Citicorp North America Inc. and MUFG Union Bank,\nN.A. and MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders, in exchange for extinguishment of outstanding indebtedness under the Bridge Loan Facility. Such lenders or their affiliates\nagreed to resell the 2028 notes to qualified institutional buyers in the United States pursuant to Rule 144A.\nWe cannot ensure that future interest rate movements will not have a material adverse effect on our future business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. To date,\nwe have not entered into interest rate hedging transactions to control or minimize certain of these risks.\nMarket Risk\nIn connection with the Separation, the Company retained the Investment in Consensus, the remaining portion of which was valued at approximately $58.4 million as of December 31, 2022\nbased upon the quoted market price of Consensus common stock. The Company’s results of operations and financial condition have been and may be materially impacted by increases or decreases in\nthe price of Consensus common stock, which is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nGains (losses) on the Investment in Consensus were as follows (in thousands):\nYear ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\nRealized losses on securities sold during the period\n$\n(46,743)\n$\n— \nUnrealized (losses) gains recognized during the period on equity securities held at the reporting date\n$\n(7,145)\n$\n298,490 \nThe carrying value of our Investment in Consensus at December 31, 2022 was $58.4 million, or approximately 1.7% of the Company’s consolidated total assets.

      "text": "Foreign Currency Risk\nWe conduct business in certain foreign markets, primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the European Union. Our principal exposure to foreign currency risk relates to\ninvestment and inter-company debt in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the\nAustralian Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, the New Zealand Dollar, and the Norwegian Kroner. If we are unable to settle our intercompany debts in a timely manner, we remain exposed to foreign\ncurrency fluctuations.\nAs we expand our international presence, we become further exposed to foreign currency risk by entering new markets with additional foreign currencies. The economic impact of currency\nexchange rate movements is often linked to variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions, and other factors. These changes, if material, could cause us to adjust our financing\nand operating strategies.\n   As currency exchange rates change, translation of the income statements of the international businesses into U.S. Dollars affects year-over-year comparability of operating results.\nHistorically, we have not hedged translation risks because cash flows from international operations were generally reinvested locally; however, we may do so in the future. Our objective in\nmanaging foreign exchange risk is to minimize the potential exposure to changes that exchange rates might have on earnings, cash flows, and financial position.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, foreign exchange gains (losses) amounted to $8.2 million, $2.0 million, and $(3.1) million, respectively.\nCumulative translation adjustments, net of tax, included in other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, was $(32.5) million, $(21.3) million, and\n$(8.9) million respectively.\nWe currently do not have derivative financial instruments for hedging, speculative or trading purposes and therefore are not subject to such hedging risk. However, we may in the future\nengage in hedging transactions to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n-55-"

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations,\ncomprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated\nfinancial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the\nresults of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company's internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (“COSO”) and our report dated March 1, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nChange in Accounting Method Related to Convertible Instruments\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for convertible instruments due to the adoption of Accounting Standards\nUpdate No. 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entities Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) effective January 1, 2022\nunder the modified retrospective approach.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws\nand the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nconsolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our\naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated\nto the audit committee and that: (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n-56-"

Goodwill is\ntested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there are certain events or changes in circumstances. As a result of a goodwill impairment assessment, the Company recorded impairment\nof $27.4 million during the third quarter for one of the Digital Media reporting units. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived from an\nincome approach and a market approach.\nWe identified the interim goodwill impairment assessment within certain Digital Media reporting units as a critical audit matter because of certain significant assumptions management makes\nas part of the assessment to estimate the fair value of the affected reporting units. The income approach requires certain significant management assumptions in projecting future discounted cash flows,\nspecifically revenue growth rates and discount rates. The market approach requires certain judgments in selecting the appropriate peer companies and the valuation multiples. Auditing revenue growth\nrates and discount rates as well as assessing the reasonableness of peer companies and valuation multiples involved especially challenging and subjective auditor judgment due to the nature and extent\nof audit effort required to address these matters, including the involvement of professionals with specialized skill or knowledge.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical matter included:\n•\nEvaluating the reasonableness of certain significant management assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of the affected reporting units, including the revenue growth rate used in\nthe projected future cash flows by comparing to prior period forecasts, historical operating performance, and publicly available industry information.\n•\nUtilizing personnel with specialized knowledge and skill in valuation to assist in: (i) testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical\naccuracy of the calculation, and (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of both the identified peer companies and valuation multiples used in the market approach by calculating indicated multiples\nand related quartiles and comparing those to the ones used by management’s valuation specialist.\n/s/ BDO USA, LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2014.\nLos Angeles, California\nMarch 1, 2023\n-57-"

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.       The Company\nZiff Davis, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“Ziff Davis”, the “Company”, “our”, “us”, or “we”), is a vertically focused digital media and internet company whose portfolio includes brands\nin technology, shopping, gaming and entertainment, connectivity, health, cybersecurity, and martech. The Company’s Digital Media business specializes in the technology, shopping, gaming, and\nhealthcare markets, offering content, tools and services to consumers and businesses. The Company’s Cybersecurity and Martech business provides cloud-based subscription services to consumers and\nbusinesses including cybersecurity, privacy and marketing technology.\nOn October 7, 2021, in connection with the spin-off of its cloud fax business described further below, the Company changed its name from J2 Global, Inc. to Ziff Davis, Inc. (for certain\nevents prior to October 7, 2021, the Company may be referred to as J2 Global).\n2.    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ziff Davis and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, including judgments about investment classifications and the reported\namounts of net revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company believes that its most significant estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of\ninvestments, its assessment of ownership interests as variable interest entities and the related determination of consolidation, share-based compensation expense, fair value of assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed in connection with business combinations, long-lived and intangible asset impairment, contingent consideration, income taxes and contingencies, and allowance for credit losses. On\nan ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates based on historical experience and on various other factors that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results\ncould materially differ from those estimates.\nConsensus, Inc. Spin-Off and Discontinued Operations\nOn September 21, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved its previously announced separation of the cloud fax business (the “Separation”) into an independent\npublicly traded company, Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc. (“Consensus”). On October 7, 2021 (the “Distribution Date”), the Separation was completed and the Company transferred J2 Cloud Service,\nLLC to Consensus who in turn transferred non-fax assets and liabilities back to Ziff Davis such that Consensus was left with the cloud fax business. The Separation was achieved through the\nCompany’s distribution of 80.1% of the shares of Consensus common stock to holders of J2 Global common stock as of the close of business on October 1, 2021, the record date for the distribution.\nThe Company’s stockholders of record received one share of Consensus common stock for every three shares of J2 Global’s common stock. On October 8, 2021, Consensus began trading on Nasdaq\nunder the stock symbol “CCSI”. Ziff Davis, Inc. retained a 19.9% interest in Consensus following the Separation (the “Investment in Consensus”).\n-63-"

      "text": "ZIFF DAVIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\nOn October 7, 2021, Consensus paid Ziff Davis approximately $259.1 million of cash in a distribution that was anticipated to be tax-free provided certain requirements were met, and issued\n$500.0  million of senior notes due 2028 to Ziff Davis, which Ziff Davis then exchanged with the lenders under the Credit Agreement and Credit Agreement Amendments by and among the\nsubsidiaries of Ziff Davis party thereto as guarantors, Citicorp North America Inc. and MUFG Union Bank, N.A. and MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders, for the\nextinguishment of indebtedness outstanding under the Bridge Loan Facility. Refer to Note 10 - Debt for additional details. Such lenders or their affiliates agreed to resell the 2028 notes to qualified\ninstitutional buyers in the United States pursuant to Rule 144A.\nThe accounting requirements for reporting the Company’s cloud fax business as a discontinued operation were met when the Separation was completed. Accordingly, the consolidated\nfinancial statements reflect the results of the cloud fax business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. Ziff Davis did not retain a controlling interest in Consensus.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company entered into a Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment to its existing Credit Agreement, providing for the issuance of senior secured\nterm loans under the Credit Agreement (the “Term Loan Facilities”), in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $112.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company\nsubsequently completed non-cash exchanges of 2,800,000 shares of its common stock of Consensus with the lenders under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to settle the Company’s obligations of\n$112.3 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan Facilities plus related interest. Refer to Note 10 - Debt for additional details.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company continues to hold approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock of Investment in Consensus. The Investment in Consensus represents the\ninvestment in equity securities for which the Company elected the fair value option and subsequent fair value changes in the Consensus shares are included in the assets of and results from continuing\noperations. Refer to Note 5 - Investments and Note 6 - Discontinued Operations and Dispositions for additional information.\nAllowances for Credit Losses\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable, which is recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable. Changes in the allowance are classified as ‘General\nand administrative’ expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company assesses collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics\nexist and on an individual basis when it identifies specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, the Company considers\nhistorical collectability based on past due status. It also considers customer-specific information, current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to\ninform adjustments to historical loss data. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the adequacy of these reserves.\nThe rollforward of allowance for credit losses on Accounts receivable, net is as follows (in thousands):\nYear ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020\nBeginning balance\n$\n9,811 \n$\n11,552 \n$\n8,480 \n(Decreases) increases to bad debt expense\n(255)\n3,107 \n5,315 \nWrite-offs, net of recoveries\n(2,688)\n(4,848)\n(2,243)\nEnding balance\n$\n6,868 \n$\n9,811 \n$\n11,552 \nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when the Company satisfies its obligation by transferring control of the goods or services to its customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to\nwhich the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Refer to Note 3 - Revenues for additional details.\nPrincipal vs. Agent\nThe Company determines whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis by assessing whether the Company is acting as the principal or an agent in the transaction. If the\nCompany is acting as the principal in a transaction, the Company reports revenue on a gross basis. If the Company is acting as an agent in a transaction, the Company reports revenue on a net basis. In\ndetermining whether the Company acts as the principal or an agent, the Company follows the accounting guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards\nCodification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, for principal-agent considerations and assesses: (i) if another party is involved in providing goods or services to the\ncustomer, (ii) whether the Company controls the specified goods or services prior to transferring control to the customer and (iii) whether the Company has discretion on pricing.\n-64-"

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\nSales Taxes\nThe Company has made an accounting policy election to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are (i) both imposed on\nand concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected by the Company from a customer.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company complies with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”), in measuring fair value and in disclosing fair value\nmeasurements. ASC 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.\nThe carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, interest receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, interest payable, customer deposits, and long-term debt are\nreflected in the financial statements at cost. With the exception of certain investments and long-term debt, cost approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of such instruments. The fair value\nof the Company’s outstanding debt was determined using the quoted market prices of debt instruments with similar terms and maturities when available. As of the same dates, the carrying value of\nother long-term liabilities approximated fair value as the related interest rates approximate rates currently available to the Company.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers the balance of its investment in funds that substantially hold securities that mature within three months or less from the date the Company purchases these securities\nto be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents either approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments or are at fair value.\nInvestments\nThe Company accounts for its investments in debt securities in accordance with ASC Topic 320, Investments - Debt Securities (“ASC 320”). Debt investments are typically comprised of\ncorporate debt securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income. All\ndebt securities are accounted for on a specific identification basis.\nThe Company’s available-for-sale debt securities are carried at an estimated fair value with any unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheets. Available-for-sale debt securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of that difference, if any, is\ncaused by expected credit losses. Expected credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recognized in loss on investments, net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and any\nremaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated comprehensive loss on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company accounts for its investments in equity securities in accordance with ASC Topic 321, Investments - Equity Securities (“ASC 321”) which requires the accounting for equity\ninvestments, other than those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, generally be measured at fair value for equity securities with readily determinable fair values. Equity securities\nwithout a readily determinable fair value, which are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting, are measured at their cost, less impairment, if any, and adjusted for observable price\nchanges arising from orderly transactions in the same or similar investment from the same issuer. Any unrealized gains or losses will be reported within earnings on our Consolidated Statements of\nOperations.\nThe Company assesses whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss on an investment has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions. Refer to Note 5 - Investments\nfor additional information.\nThe Investment in Consensus are equity securities accounted for at fair value under the fair value option, and the related fair value gains and losses are recognized in earnings. As the initial\ncarrying value of the Investment in Consensus was negative immediately following the Separation, the Company elected the fair value option under ASC 825-10-25 to support the initial recognition of\nthe Investment in Consensus at fair value and the negative book value was recorded as a gain at the date of Separation. The fair value of Consensus common stock is readily available as Consensus is a\npublicly traded company.\n-65-"

      "text": "ZIFF DAVIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\nVariable Interest Entities (“VIE”s)\nA VIE requires consolidation by the entity’s primary beneficiary. The Company evaluates its investments in entities in which it is involved to determine if the entity is a VIE and if so, whether\nit holds a variable interest and is the primary beneficiary. The Company has determined that it holds a variable interest in its investment as a limited partner in the OCV Fund I, LP (“OCV Fund”,\n“OCV” or the “Fund”), as well as, another independent corporation. In determining whether the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, both of the following characteristics\nmust be present:\na) the Company has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance (the power criterion); and\nb) the Company has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE, or the right to receive benefits of the VIE, that could potentially be significant to the VIE (the economic criterion).\nThe Company has concluded that, as a limited partner in OCV, although the obligations to absorb losses or the right to benefit from the gains is not insignificant, the Company does not have\n“power” over OCV because it does not have the ability to direct the significant decisions which impact the economics of OCV. The Company believes that the OCV general partner, as a single\ndecision maker, holds the ability to make the decisions about the activities that most significantly impact the OCV Fund’s economic performance. As a result, the Company has concluded that it will\nnot consolidate OCV, as it is not the primary beneficiary of the OCV Fund, and will account for this investment under the equity-method of accounting (see Note 5 - Investments).\nOCV qualifies as an investment company under ASC Topic 946, Financial Services, Investment Companies (“ASC 946”). Under ASC Topic 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint\nVentures, an investor that holds investments that qualify for specialized industry accounting for investment companies in accordance with ASC 946 should record its share of the earnings or losses,\nrealized or unrealized, as reported by its equity method investees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company recognizes its equity in the net earnings or losses relating to the investment in OCV on a one-quarter lag due to the timing and availability of financial information from OCV. If\nthe Company becomes aware of a significant decline in value that is other-than-temporary, the loss will be recorded in the period in which the Company identifies the decline.\nDebt Issuance Costs and Debt Discount\nThe Company capitalizes costs incurred with borrowing and issuance of debt securities and records debt issuance costs and discounts as a reduction to the debt amount. These costs and\ndiscounts are amortized and included in interest expense over the life of the borrowing using the effective interest method.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company primarily invests its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities with major financial institutions primarily within the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and the\nEuropean Union. These investments are made in accordance with the Company’s investment policy with the principal objectives being preservation of capital, fulfillment of liquidity needs and above\nmarket returns commensurate with preservation of capital. The Company’s investment policy also requires that investments in marketable securities be in only highly rated instruments, with\nlimitations on investing in securities of any single issuer. However, these investments are not insured against the possibility of a total or near complete loss of earnings or principal and are inherently\nsubject to the credit risk related to the continued credit worthiness of the underlying issuer and general credit market risks.

      "text": "ZIFF DAVIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\nForeign Currency\nMost of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries use the local currency of their respective countries as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing at\nthe balance sheet dates. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars at average exchange rates for the period. Gains and losses resulting from translation are recorded as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Net translation loss was $32.5 million, $21.3 million and $8.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Realized\ngains and losses from foreign currency transactions are recognized within ‘Other income (loss), net’ on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign exchange gains (losses) amounted to $8.2\nmillion, $2.0 million and $(3.1) million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Equipment under a finance lease is stated at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the assets and is recorded in cost of revenues and general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The estimated useful\nlives of property and equipment range from one to ten years. Fixtures, which are comprised primarily of leasehold improvements and equipment under finance leases, are amortized on a straight-line\nbasis over their estimated useful lives or for leasehold improvements, the related lease term, if less. The Company has capitalized certain internal-use software and website development costs which\nare included in property and equipment and depreciated using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life which is evaluated for each specific project and is typically three years.\nImpairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company accounts for long-lived assets, which include property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives (subject to\namortization), in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (“ASC 360”), which requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the expected undiscounted\nfuture net cash flows generated by the asset. If it is determined that the asset may not be recoverable, and if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is\nrecognized to the extent of the difference.\nThe Company assesses the impairment of identifiable definite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be\nrecoverable. Factors it considers important which could individually or in combination trigger an impairment include the following:\n•\nSignificant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;\n•\nSignificant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the Company’s overall business;\n•\nSignificant negative industry or economic trends;\n•\nSignificant decline in the Company’s stock price for a sustained period; and\n•\nThe Company’s market capitalization relative to net book value.\nIf the Company determined that the carrying value of definite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of\nimpairment, it would record an impairment equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value.\nThe Company assessed whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying amount of definite-lived assets may not be recoverable. During the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not have any events or circumstances indicating impairment of long-lived assets, other than the recording of an impairment of\ncertain operating lease right-of-use assets and associated property and equipment. The Company regularly evaluates its office space requirements in light of more of its workforce working from home\nas part of a permanent “remote” or “partial remote” work model. The impairment is presented in general and administrative expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to Note 11 -\nLeases for additional details.\n-67-"

      "text": "ZIFF DAVIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\nThe Company classifies its long-lived assets to be sold as held for sale in the period (i) it has approved and committed to a plan to sell the asset, (ii) the asset is available for immediate sale in\nits present condition, (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to sell the asset have been initiated, (iv) the sale of the asset is probable and the transfer is expected to qualify\nfor recognition as a sale within one year, (v) the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, and (vi) it is unlikely that significant changes to\nthe plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. The Company initially measures a long-lived asset that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any\ncosts to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a long-lived asset until\nthe date of sale. Upon designation as an asset held for sale, the Company stops recording depreciation expense on the asset. The Company assesses the fair value of a long-lived asset less any costs to\nsell at each reporting period and until the asset is no longer classified as held for sale.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with GAAP and uses estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for\nacquisitions to the fair value of the assets, including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired. Such estimates may be based on significant unobservable inputs and assumptions such as, but\nnot limited to, future revenue growth rates, gross and operating margins, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, discount rates and terminal growth rate assumptions. The Company uses established\nvaluation techniques and may engage reputable valuation specialists to assist with the valuations. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but\nwhich are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Fair values are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date of an acquisition\nas information relative to closing date fair values becomes available. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Intangible assets resulting\nfrom the acquisitions of entities accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting are recorded at the estimated fair value of the assets acquired. Identifiable intangible assets are comprised of\npurchased customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, developed technologies and other intangible assets. Intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized over the period of estimated\neconomic benefit ranging from one to twenty years and are included in general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company evaluates its goodwill and\nindefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”), which provides that goodwill and other intangible assets with\nindefinite lives are not amortized but tested annually for impairment or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. In connection with the annual impairment test for\ngoodwill, the Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the\nCompany determines that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it then it performs an impairment test of goodwill. The impairment test\ninvolves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. The Company generally determines the fair value of its reporting units\nusing a mix of an income approach and a market approach. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. During\nthe years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 the Company recorded a goodwill impairment of $27.4 million, $32.6 million and zero, respectively. Refer to Note 9 - Goodwill and Intangible\nAssets for additional details.\nThe Company performed the annual impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite lives for fiscal 2021 and 2020 using a qualitative assessment primarily taking into consideration\nmacroeconomic, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance and any other relevant company-specific factors. The Company concluded that there were no impairments in 2021 and\n2020. The Company did not perform an assessment in 2022, as there were no intangible assets with indefinite lives during 2022.\nContingent Consideration\nCertain of the Company’s acquisition agreements include contingent earn-out arrangements, which are generally based on the achievement of future income thresholds or other metrics. The\ncontingent earn-out arrangements are based upon the Company’s valuations of the acquired companies and reduce the risk of overpaying for acquisitions if the projected financial results are not\nachieved.\nThe fair values of these earn-out arrangements are included as part of the purchase price of the acquired companies on their respective acquisition dates. For each transaction, the Company\nestimates the fair value of contingent earn-out payments as part of the initial purchase price and records the estimated fair value of contingent consideration as a liability on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. The Company considers several factors when determining that contingent earn-out liabilities are\n-68-"

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\npart of the purchase price, including the following: (1) the valuation of our acquisitions is not supported solely by the initial consideration paid, and the contingent earn-out formula is a critical and\nmaterial component of the valuation approach to determining the purchase price; and (2) the former shareholders of acquired companies that remain as key employees receive compensation other than\ncontingent earn-out payments at a reasonable level compared with the compensation of the Company’s other key employees. The contingent earn-out payments are not affected by employment\ntermination.\nThe Company measures its contingent earn-out liabilities in connection with acquisitions at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy (see Note 7 - Fair Value Measurements). The Company may use various valuation techniques depending on the terms and conditions of the contingent consideration, including\na Monte-Carlo simulation. This simulation uses a probability distribution for each significant input to produce hundreds or thousands of possible outcomes and the results are analyzed to determine\nprobabilities of different outcomes occurring. Significant increases or decreases to these inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower liability with a higher liability capped by the\ncontractual maximum of the contingent earn-out obligation. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate and amount paid will be\nrecorded in earnings. The amount paid that is less than or equal to the liability on the acquisition date is reflected as cash used in financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nAny amount paid in excess of the liability on the acquisition date is reflected as cash used in operating activities.\nThe Company reviews and re-assesses the estimated fair value of contingent consideration on a quarterly basis, and the updated fair value could be materially different from the initial\nestimates or prior amounts. Changes in the estimated fair value of its contingent earn-out liabilities and adjustments to the estimated fair value related to changes in all other unobservable inputs are\nreported in general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSelf-Insurance Program\nThe Company provides health and dental insurance plans to certain of its employees through a self-insurance structure. The Company has secured reinsurance in the form of a two tiered stop-\nloss coverage that limits the exposure arising from any claims made. Self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based on management’s estimate of the discounted\nultimate costs for self-insured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience. Although management believes it has the ability to reasonably\nestimate losses related to claims, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded self-insurance liabilities.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company’s income is subject to taxation in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining\nits provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Company establishes\nreserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves for tax contingencies are established when the Company\nbelieves that certain positions might be challenged despite the Company’s belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and\ncircumstances, such as the outcome of a tax audit or lapse of a statute of limitations. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are\nconsidered appropriate.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized using enacted\ntax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. ASC 740 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it\nis more likely than not that some or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance is reviewed quarterly based upon the facts and circumstances known at the time. In\nassessing this valuation allowance, the Company reviews historical and future expected operating results and other factors, including its recent cumulative earnings experience, expectations of future\ntaxable income by taxing jurisdiction and the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes, to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are realizable.\nASC 740 provides guidance on the minimum threshold that an uncertain income tax benefit is required to meet before it can be recognized in the financial statements and applies to all income\ntax positions taken by a company. ASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by\ndetermining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.\nThe second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. If it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on\nits technical merits, no benefit will be recorded. Uncertain income tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition\nthreshold. The Company\n-69-"

The CARES\nAct, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum\ntax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations, increased limitations on qualified charitable contributions, and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified\nimprovement property. The Company does not believe these provisions have a significant impact to our current and deferred income tax balances. The Company will benefit from the technical\ncorrection to tax depreciation related to qualified improvement property and has elected to defer income tax payments and employer side social security payments where eligible.\nOn August 16, 2022, the “Inflation Reduction Act” of 2022 (“IRA”) was signed into law. The IRA included many climate and energy provisions and introduced a 15% corporate alternative\nminimum tax (“CAMT”) for taxpayers whose average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeds a certain threshold. The IRA also enacted a one percent excise tax on stock repurchases\nmade by publicly traded U.S. corporations. The CAMT and excise tax on stock repurchases are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The Company does not believe that it will be\nsubject to the CAMT as it is expected to be under the threshold of the average annual adjusted financial statement income.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based awards to employees and non-employees in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”),\nwhich requires compensation cost, measured at the grant date fair value, to be recognized over the employee’s requisite service period using the straight-line method. The measurement of share-based\ncompensation expense is based on several criteria, including but not limited to the valuation model used and associated input factors, such as expected term of the award, stock price volatility, risk free\ninterest rate, dividend rate, and award cancellation rate. Certain of these inputs are subjective and are determined using management’s judgment. If differences arise between the assumptions used in\ndetermining share-based compensation expense and the actual factors, which become known over time, the Company may change the input factors used in determining future share-based\ncompensation expense. Any such changes could materially impact the Company’s results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter. The Company estimates\nthe vesting term based upon the historical exercise behavior of its employees.\nEarnings Per Common Share (“EPS”)\nEPS is calculated pursuant to the two-class method as defined in ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share (“ASC 260”), which specifies that all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards\nthat contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities and should be included in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method.\nBasic EPS is calculated by dividing net distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to common shareholders, excluding participating securities, by the weighted-average number of\ncommon shares outstanding. The Company’s participating securities consist of its unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents.\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging\n—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”) using the modified retrospective method.\nFollowing this adoption, the Company applies the if-converted method for the diluted net income per share calculation of convertible debt instruments. Prior to the adoption, the Company used the\ntreasury stock method when calculating the potential dilutive effect of convertible debt instruments.\nResearch, Development and Engineering\nResearch, development and engineering costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for software development incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility, in the form of a working\nmodel, are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives. Research, development and engineering expenditures were $74.1 million, $78.9 million and $57.1 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSegment Reporting\nASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting (“ASC 280”), establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in their annual consolidated\nfinancial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports.

The Company’s business segments are based on the organization structure used by the chief operating decision maker\nfor making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance.\nThe Company has two reportable segments: (i) Digital Media and (ii) Cybersecurity and Martech. Refer to Note 18 - Segment Information for additional detail.\nAdvertising Costs\nThe Company incurs external advertising costs to promote its brands. These costs primarily consist of expenses related to digital advertising on websites and apps of third parties, creative\nservices, trade shows and similar events, marketing expenses, and marketing intelligence expenses. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nexternal advertising costs were $128.8 million, $143.5 million and $96.0 million, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06. The provisions of this update simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470-20,\nDebt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible instruments. The convertible debt instruments are be accounted for as a single liability at the amortized cost if separation is no longer\nrequired unless (1) a convertible instrument contains features that require bifurcation as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or (2) a convertible debt instrument was issued at\na substantial premium. Among other potential impacts, this change is expected to reduce reported noncash interest expense, increase reported net income, and result in a reclassification of certain\nconversion feature balance sheet amounts from stockholders’ equity to liabilities. Similarly, the debt discount, which is equal to the carrying value of the embedded conversion feature upon issuance,\nwill no longer be amortized into income as interest expense over the life of the instrument. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 requires the use of the if-converted method to calculate the impact of convertible\ninstruments on diluted earnings per share, which includes the effect of share settlement for instruments that may be settled in cash or shares, except for certain liability-classified share-based payment\nawards.\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective method. The cumulative effect of the changes made on the Consolidated Balance Sheet upon this\nadoption increased the carrying amount of the 1.75% Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 10 - Debt below) by approximately $85.9  million, increased retained earnings by approximately\n$23.4 million, reduced deferred tax liabilities by approximately $21.2 million and reduced additional paid-in capital by approximately $88.1 million. The effect of the change on the earnings per share\nof the Company was an increase of $0.25 on each Basic and Diluted Net income per common share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. This update\nrequires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606. This update is\neffective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted, including in interim periods. The Company early adopted ASU\n2021-08 during the second quarter of 2022. An entity that early adopts in an interim period should apply the amendments (1) retrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition date\noccurs on or after the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period of early application and (2) prospectively to all business combinations that occur on or after the date of initial\napplication. Therefore, the adoption of ASU 2021-08 was applied retrospectively to January 1, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2021-08 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements and related disclosures.\nRecently issued applicable accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This update provides for\noptional financial reporting alternatives to reduce cost and complexities associated with accounting for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. This\nupdate applies only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference London Interbank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of\nreference rate reform. The accommodations were available for all entities through December 31, 2022, with early adoption permitted. This update was later amended by ASU 2022-06.\n-71-"

Subscriptions cover video games and related content, health\ninformation, data and other copyrighted material. Revenues under such agreements are recognized over the contract term for use of the service. Revenues are also earned from listing fees,\nsubscriptions to online publications, and from other sources. Subscription revenues are recognized over time.\nWe also generate Digital Media subscription revenues through the license of certain assets to clients. Assets are licensed for clients’ use in their own promotional materials or otherwise and\nmay include logos, editorial reviews, or other copyrighted material. Revenues under such license agreements are recognized over the contract term for use of the asset. In instances when technology\nassets are licensed to our clients, revenues from the license of these assets are recognized over the term of the access period.\nThe Digital Media business also generates revenue from other sources which include marketing and production services. Such other revenues are generally recognized over the period in\nwhich the products or services are delivered.\nWe also generate Digital Media revenues from transactions involving the sale of perpetual software licenses, related software support and maintenance, hardware used in conjunction with its\nsoftware, and other related services. Revenue is recognized for these software transactions with multiple performance obligations after (i) the contract has been approved and we are committed to\nperform the respective obligations and (ii) we can identify and quantify each obligation and its respective selling price. Once the respective performance obligations have been identified and\nquantified, revenue will be recognized when the obligations are met, either over time or at a point in time depending on the nature of the obligation.\nRevenues from software license performance obligations are generally recognized upfront at the point in time that the software is made available to the customer to download and use.\nRevenues for related software support and maintenance performance obligations are related to technical support provided to customers as needed and unspecified software product upgrades,\nmaintenance releases and patches during the term of the support period when they are available. We are obligated to make the support services available continuously throughout the contract period.\nTherefore, revenues for support contracts are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period the support services are provided. Hardware product and related software performance\nobligations, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a bundled performance obligation. The revenues for this bundled performance\nobligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware and software products are delivered and ownership is transferred to the customer. Other service revenues are generally\nrecognized over time as the services are performed.\nThe Company records revenue on a gross basis with respect to revenue generated (i) by the Company serving online display and video advertising across its owned and operated web\nproperties, on third-party sites or on unaffiliated advertising networks; (ii) through the Company’s lead-generation business; and (iii) through the Company’s subscriptions. The Company records\nrevenue on a net basis with respect to revenue paid to the Company by certain third-party advertising networks who serve online display and video advertising across the Company’s owned-and-\noperated web properties and certain third-party sites.\n-72-"

Refer to Note 4 - Business Acquisitions for additional details.\nPerformance Obligations\nThe Company is often a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same customer, or a party related to that customer. These situations require judgment to determine if those\narrangements should be accounted for as a single contract. Consideration of both the form and the substance of the arrangement is required. The Company’s contracts with customers may include\nmultiple performance obligations, including complex contracts when advertising and licensing services are sold together.\nThe Company determines the transaction price based on the amount to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for services provided. The Company includes any fixed\nconsideration within its contracts as part of the total transaction price. The Company’s contracts occasionally contain some component of variable consideration, which is often immaterial and\nestimated. The Company does not include in the transaction price taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are (i) both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction\nand (ii) collected by us from the customer. Due to the nature of the services provided, there are no obligations for returns.\n-73-"

      "text": "ZIFF DAVIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time\nThe Company’s Digital Media business has technology subscriptions that have standalone functionality. As a result, they are considered to be functional intellectual property where the\nperformance obligations are satisfied at a point in time. This is evidenced once a digital key is delivered to the customer. Once the key is delivered to the customer, the customer has full control of the\ntechnology and the Company has no further performance obligations. The Company has concluded that revenue is recognized once the digital key is delivered. The Company believes that this method\nis a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods and services.\nPractical expedients\nExistence of a Significant Financing Component in a Contract\nIf at contract inception, the Company expects that the period between payment by the customer and the transfer of promised goods or services by the Company to the customer will be one\nyear or less, the Company does not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component. In addition, the Company has determined that the payment terms that the Company provides to its\ncustomers are structured primarily for reasons other than the provision of finance to the Company. The Company typically charges a single upfront amount for services because other payment terms\nwould affect the nature of the risk assumed by the Company to provide service given the costs of the customer acquisition and the highly competitive and commoditized nature of the business we\noperate which allows customers to easily move from one provider to another. This additional risk may make it uneconomical to provide the service.\nCosts to Obtain a Contract\nThe Company’s revenues are primarily generated from customer contracts that are for one year or less. Costs primarily consist of incentive compensation paid based on the achievements of\nsales targets in a given period for related revenue streams and are recognized in the month when the revenue is earned. Incentive compensation is paid on the issuance or renewal of the customer\ncontract. As a practical expedient, for amortization periods which are determined to be one year or less, the Company expenses any incremental costs of obtaining the contract with a customer when\nincurred. For those customers with amortization periods determined to be greater than one year, the Company capitalizes and amortizes the expenses over the period of benefit.\nIn addition, the Company partners with various affiliates in order to generate a portion of its revenue for certain lines of business. The commissions earned by the Company’s affiliates are\nincentive based and are paid on the acquisition of new customers in a given period. For those customers with amortization periods determined to be greater than one year, the Company capitalizes and\namortizes the expenses over the period of benefit.\nRevenues Invoiced\nThe Company has applied the practical expedient for certain revenues streams to exclude the disclosure of the value of remaining performance obligations for the following types of contracts:\ni.\nContracts within an original expected term of one year or less,\nii.\nContracts for which the Company recognizes revenue in proportion to the amount it has the right to invoice for services performed.\nTransaction Price Allocation to Future Performance Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of transaction price that is allocated to future performance obligations was approximately $21.2 million and is expected to be recognized as\nfollows: 93% by December 31, 2023 and 7% by December 31, 2025. The amount disclosed does not include revenues related to performance obligations that are part of a contract with original\nexpected duration of 12 months or less or portions of the contract that remain subject to cancellations.\n-75-"

Refer to Note 10 - Debt for additional details. Such lenders or their affiliates agreed to resell the 2028 notes to qualified\ninstitutional buyers in the United States pursuant to Rule 144A. The Company incurred a net loss on extinguishment of debt principal outstanding on the Bridge Loan Facility of approximately $8.8\nmillion, which is recorded within ‘Gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, net’ component of ‘Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes’ within the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations for the year ended December 31, 2021 (see note 10 - Debt).

These transaction costs primarily related to professional fees associated with preparation of regulatory filings and transaction execution and separation activities\nwithin finance, tax and legal functions.\nIn connection with the Separation, Ziff Davis and Consensus entered into several agreements that govern the relationship of the parties following the Separation, which are further discussed\nin Note 21 - Related Party Transactions. Further, certain of the Company’s management and members of its board of directors resigned from the Company as of the Distribution Date and joined\nConsensus.\nThe Company made an accounting policy election not to allocate interest to discontinued operations.

      "text": "ZIFF DAVIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n7.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company complies with the provisions of ASC 820, which defines fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures required for fair value\nmeasurements of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing\nan asset or a liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820 establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair\nvalue:\n§\nLevel 1 – Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n§\nLevel 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive\nmarkets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n§\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nThe Company’s money market funds are classified within Level 1. The Company values these Level 1 investments using quoted market prices. The fair value of long-term debt is determined\nusing recent quoted market prices or dealer quotes for each of the Company’s instruments, which are Level 1 inputs.\nThe Investment in Consensus are equity securities for which the Company elected the fair value option, and the fair value of the Investment in Consensus and subsequent fair value changes\nare included in our assets of and results from continuing operations, respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our investment in Consensus common stock was remeasured at fair value based on\nConsensus’ closing stock price, with unrealized (losses) gains of $(7.1) million and $298.5 million, respectively, recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and a balance of $58.4 million\nand $229.2 million, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of the investment in Consensus is determined using the quoted market prices, which is a Level 1 input.\nThe fair value of our 4.625% Senior Notes and our 1.75% Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 10 - Debt) was determined using quoted market prices or dealer quotes for instruments with\nsimilar maturities and other terms and credit ratings, which are Level 1 inputs.\nCertain of the Company’s debt securities are classified within Level 2. The Company values these Level 2 investments based on model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from\nor corroborated by observable market data. The Company has investment in a corporate debt security that is measured at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses are\nreported in other comprehensive income until realized. These corporate debt securities do not have a readily determinable fair value because acquired securities are privately held, not traded on any\npublic exchanges and not an investment in a mutual fund or similar investment. The investment in corporate debt securities is classified as available-for-sale and is initially measured at its transaction\nprice. The fair value of the corporate debt securities is determined primarily based on significant estimates and assumptions, including Level 3 inputs. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value was\ndetermined based upon various probability-weighted scenarios and included assumptions of a 13% discount rate and conversion in a range of 0.8 years - 1.3 years.\nThe Company classifies its contingent consideration liability in connection with acquisitions within Level 3 because factors used to develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs,\nsuch as volatility and market risks, and are not supported by market activity. The valuation approaches used to value Level 3 investments considers unobservable inputs in the market such as time to\nliquidity, volatility, dividend yield, and breakpoints.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on October 1st at the reporting unit level, or more frequently if indicators of\nimpairment exist, or if a decision is made to dispose of a business. The Company’s Digital Media reportable segment is comprised of seven reporting units and the Cybersecurity and Martech\nreportable segment is comprised of two reporting units.\nThe changes in carrying amounts of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows (in thousands):\nDigital Media\nCybersecurity and\nMartech\nConsolidated\nBalance as of January 1, 2021\n$\n942,934 \n$\n582,066 \n$\n1,525,000 \nGoodwill acquired (Note 4)\n55,704 \n41,328 \n97,032 \nGoodwill removed due to sale of businesses \n— \n(50,277)\n(50,277)\nGoodwill impairment\n— \n(32,629)\n(32,629)\nPurchase accounting adjustments \n(1,437)\n505 \n(932)\nForeign exchange translation\n(542)\n(6,197)\n(6,739)\nBalance as of December 31, 2021\n$\n996,659 \n$\n534,796 \n$\n1,531,455 \nGoodwill acquired (Note 4)\n95,737 \n— \n95,737 \nGoodwill impairment\n(27,369)\n— \n(27,369)\nPurchase accounting adjustments \n4,475 \n(137)\n4,338 \nForeign exchange translation\n(3,513)\n(9,174)\n(12,687)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$\n1,065,989 \n$\n525,485 \n$\n1,591,474 \n(1)\nOn February 9, 2021, in a cash transaction, the Company sold certain of its Voice assets in the United Kingdom which resulted in $1.3 million of goodwill being removed in connection with this sale and on September 17, 2021, the Company\nsold certain of its B2B Backup assets which resulted in $49.0 million of goodwill being removed in connection with the sale (see Note 6 - Discontinued Operations and Dispositions).\n(2)\nPurchase accounting adjustments relate to measurement period adjustments to goodwill in connection with prior business acquisitions (see Note 4 - Business Acquisitions).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company reassessed the fair value of a reporting unit within the Digital Media reportable segment as a result of a forecasted reduction in\nrevenue and operating income in that reporting unit, as well as an increase in interest rates and market volatility that would affect the Company’s assumptions on its discount rate. Based on the\nquantitative fair value test, the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value, and the Company recorded an impairment of approximately $27.4 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using an equal weighting of an income approach that was based on the discounted estimated future cash flows of the reporting\nunit and a market approach that uses the guideline public company approach. We believe the combination of these approaches provides a reasonable valuation approach because it incorporates the\nexpected cash generation of the reporting unit in addition to how a third-party market participant would value the reporting unit. As the business is assumed to continue in perpetuity, the discounted\nfuture cash flows include a terminal value. Determining fair value using a discounted estimated future cash flow analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items,\nincluding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. The expected cash flows used in the discounted cash flow analyses were based on the most recent\nforecast for the reporting unit. For years beyond the forecast period, the estimates were based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. The discount rate the Company used represents the estimated\nweighted average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk involved in its reporting unit operations and the rate of return a market participant would expect to earn. Determining\nfair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies. From the comparable companies, a representative market\nmultiple is determined, which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Following the impairment, this reporting unit had goodwill of approximately $86.9 million\nand the carrying value approximated its fair value.\n(1)\n(2)\n(2)\n-91-"

The Company re-allocated goodwill between the two\nidentified reporting units based upon the relative fair value of the respective reporting units. Immediately before and immediately following this change in reporting units, the Company performed a\nquantitative fair value assessment using the income approach and market approach noted above, and each of these reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and, therefore, there was no\nimpairment to goodwill.\nDuring the year ended December  31, 2021, the Company recorded an impairment of approximately $32.6 million related to the Company’s B2B Backup business (included in the\nCybersecurity and Martech reportable segment). In 2021, the Company received an offer to purchase the B2B Backup business and management determined that the fair value of that business less cost\nto sell was lower than its carrying amount. The fair value of the business was determined based upon the offer price. The fair value of the remaining reporting unit was determined using an equal\nweighting of an income approach and a market approach, and was in excess of the remaining carrying value of the reporting unit.\nGoodwill as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 reflects accumulated impairment losses of $27.4 million and $32.6 million, respectively, in the Digital Media reportable segment and the\nCybersecurity and Martech reportable segment, respectively.\nIntangible Assets Subject to Amortization\nIntangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting are recorded at the estimated fair value of the assets acquired. Identifiable\nintangible assets are comprised of purchased customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, developed technologies, and other intangible assets. The fair values of these identified intangible\nassets are based upon expected future cash flows or income, which take into consideration certain assumptions such as customer turnover, trade names and patent lives. These determinations are\nprimarily based upon the Company’s historical experience and expected benefit of each intangible asset. If it is determined that such assumptions are not accurate, then the resulting change will impact\nthe fair value of the intangible asset. Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over the period of estimated economic benefit, which ranges from one to twenty years.\nAs of December 31, 2022, intangible assets subject to amortization relate primarily to the following (in thousands):\nWeighted-Average\n  Amortization\nPeriod\nHistorical\nCost\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nNet\nTrade names\n10.0 years\n$\n261,614 \n$\n125,422 \n$\n136,192 \nCustomer relationships \n7.9 years\n687,798 \n479,741 \n208,057 \nOther purchased intangibles\n8.3 years\n481,973 \n363,407 \n118,566 \nTotal\n \n$\n1,431,385 \n$\n968,570 \n$\n462,815 \n(1)\nThe Company amortizes customer relationship assets in a pattern that best reflects the pace at which the asset’s benefits are consumed. This pattern results in a substantial majority of the amortization expense being recognized in the first 4 to 5\nyears, despite the overall life of the asset.\n(1)\n-92-"

Beginning with the six-month interest period commencing on\nJune 15, 2021, the Company had to pay contingent interest on the 3.25% Convertible Notes during any six-month interest period if the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 3.25%\nConvertible Notes for each of the five trading days immediately preceding the first day of such interest period equaled or exceeded $1,300. Any contingent interest payable on the 3.25% Convertible\nNotes would have been in addition to the regular interest payable on the 3.25% Convertible Notes.\nIn connection with the Separation, the Company redeemed in full all of its outstanding 3.25% Convertible Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company satisfied its\nconversion obligation by paying the principal of $402.4 million in cash and issued 3,050,850 shares of the Company’s common stock. Refer to Note 14 - Stockholders’ Equity for additional details.\nThe redemption of the liability component of the 3.25% Convertible Notes, resulted in a gain of approximately $2.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 within ‘Gain (loss) on debt\nextinguishment, net’ on our Consolidated Statement of Operations.

The\nCompany received proceeds of $537.1 million in cash, net of purchasers’ discounts and commissions and other debt issuance costs. A portion of the net proceeds were used to pay off all amounts\noutstanding under the then-existing Credit Facility. The 1.75% Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.75% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year,\nbeginning on May 1, 2020.

On or after July 1, 2026, and prior to the close of business on the business day\nimmediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. The Company will settle conversions of the\n1.75% Convertible Notes by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination thereof at the Company’s election. The Company currently\nintends to satisfy its conversion obligation by paying and delivering a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock. Holders of the notes will have the right to require the Company\nto repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes upon the occurrence of certain corporate events, subject to certain conditions. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the market\ntrigger conditions did not meet the conversion requirements of the 1.75% Convertible Notes and, accordingly, the 1.75% Convertible Notes are classified as long-term debt on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets.\nPrior to the Separation, the conversion rate on the 1.75% Convertible Notes was 7.9864 shares of the Company’s common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of 1.75% Convertible\nNotes, which represents a conversion price of approximately $125.21 per share of the Company’s common stock. The Separation constituted an event under the 1.75% Convertible Notes that required\nan adjustment and the conversion rate increased to 9.3783 shares of the Company’s common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of 1.75% Convertible Notes (or 5,158,071 shares), which\nrepresents a conversion price of approximately $106.63 per share of the Company’s common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment for certain events as set forth in the indenture\ngoverning the 1.75% Convertible Notes, but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. In addition, upon the occurrence of a “Make-Whole Fundamental Change” (as defined in the 1.75% Convertible\nNote Indenture), the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 1.75% Convertible Notes in connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances.\nThe Company may not redeem the 1.75% Convertible Notes prior to November 1, 2026, and no sinking fund is provided for the 1.75% Convertible Notes.\nThe 1.75% Convertible Notes are the Company’s general senior unsecured obligations and rank: (i) senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s indebtedness that is expressly\nsubordinated in right of payment to the 1.75% Convertible Notes; (ii) equal in right of payment to the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (iii) effectively junior to\nany of the Company’s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities\nincurred by the Company’s subsidiaries.\nAccounting for the 1.75% Convertible Notes\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective method. As a result of this adoption, the Company de-recognized the remaining unamortized debt\ndiscount of $87.3 million on the 1.75% Convertible Notes and, therefore, no longer recognizes any amortization of debt discounts as interest expense. Refer to Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional details.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 1.75% Convertible Notes, the Company incurred $12.9 million of deferred issuance costs, which primarily consisted of the underwriters’ discount, legal\nand other professional service fees. Of the total deferred issuance costs incurred, $10.1 million of such deferred issuance costs were attributable to the liability component and are being amortized, at\nan effective interest rate of 5.5%, to interest expense through the maturity date. The remaining $2.8 million of the deferred issuance costs were netted with the equity component in additional paid-in\ncapital at the issuance date. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company reclassified the $2.8 million from additional paid-in-capital to long-term liability and recorded a cumulative adjustment to\nretained earnings for amortization from the issuance date through January 1, 2022 and will record amortization expense for these debt issuance costs through the maturity date.\nThe 1.75% Convertible Notes are carried at face value less any unamortized debt discount (prior to adoption of ASU 2020-06) and issuance costs. The fair value of the 1.75% Convertible\nNotes at each balance sheet date is determined based on recent quoted market prices or dealer quotes for the 1.75% Convertible Notes, which are Level 1 inputs (see Note 7 - Fair Value\nMeasurements). If such information is not available, the fair value is determined using cash-flow models of the scheduled payments discounted at market interest rates for comparable debt without the\nconversion feature. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the estimated fair value of the 1.75% Convertible Notes was approximately $548.4 million and $685.4 million, respectively.\n-97-"

The Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $12.1 million related to operating lease right-of-use\nassets for the affected facilities and an impairment charge of $3.6 million for associated property and equipment. The impairments were determined by comparing the fair value of the impacted right-\nof-use asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment measurement date, as required under ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. The fair value of the right-of-use asset was based on\nthe estimated sublease income for the affected facilities taking into consideration the time it will take to obtain a sublease tenant, the applicable discount rate and the sublease rate which represent\nLevel 3 unobservable inputs.

However, depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable resolution of some or all of these\nmatters could have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period.\nThe Company has not accrued for any material loss contingencies relating to these legal proceedings because materially unfavorable outcomes are not considered probable by management. It\nis the Company’s policy to expense as incurred legal fees related to various litigations.\nNon-Income Related Taxes\nThe Company does not collect and remit sales and use, telecommunication, or similar taxes and fees in certain jurisdictions where the Company believes such taxes are not applicable or\nlegally required. Several states and other taxing jurisdictions have presented or threatened the Company with assessments, alleging that the Company is required to collect and remit such taxes there.\nThe Company is currently under audit or is subject to audit for indirect taxes in various states, municipalities and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has a $25.5 million and $24.0 million\nreserve established for these matters as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which is included within ‘Accounts payable and accrued expenses’ and ‘Other long-term liabilities’ on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. It is reasonably possible that additional liabilities could be incurred resulting in additional expense, which could have a material impact to our financial results.\n13.\nIncome Taxes\nThe continuing operations income tax (expense) benefit consisted of the following (in thousands):\n \nYear ended December 31,\n \n2022\n2021\n \n2020\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$\n(42,698)\n$\n8,435 \n$\n(15,112)\nState\n(12,184)\n248 \n(4,300)\nForeign\n(16,066)\n(15,931)\n(18,631)\nTotal current\n(70,948)\n(7,248)\n(38,043)\n \nDeferred:\n \n \n \nFederal\n12,667 \n17,132 \n6,022 \nState\n(1,577)\n5,044 \n67 \nForeign\n1,901 \n(729)\n(6,396)\nTotal deferred\n12,991 \n21,447 \n(307)\nIncome tax (expense) benefit from continuing operations\n$\n(57,957)\n$\n14,199 \n$\n(38,350)\n-102-"

The Company recognized a deferred tax liability resulting in tax expense of $13.4 million on the outside\nbasis difference between the book basis exceeding the tax basis of the Investment in Consensus on October 7, 2022 due to future disposals of the shares being subject to tax based on guidance and\nrequirements set out by the Internal Revenue Service.\nAdditional reasons the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory tax rate is due to income earned in the United States also being subject to income taxes in various state jurisdictions\nwith statutory tax rates that can range from 2.5 percent to 11.5 percent. This increase in the effective income tax rate is offset by a decrease in the net reserve for uncertain tax positions during 2022\nand a tax benefit claimed in the United States related to a deduction for foreign-derived intangible income. The decrease in the reserve for uncertain tax positions is primarily due to the lapse of the\nstatute of limitations for U.S. tax reserves.\nThe effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2021 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to a book-tax difference related to the $298.5 million of book income recognized\nrelated to the Company’s shares held in Consensus stock. The income was not subject to tax since the Company had the ability to dispose of the investment in a tax-free manner based on guidance and\nrequirements set out by the Internal Revenue Service. Additionally, the Company recorded a decrease in the net reserve for uncertain tax positions during 2021 and a reduction in the valuation\nallowance on deferred tax assets related to realized and unrealized capital losses. The decrease in the reserve for uncertain tax positions is primarily due to the lapse of the statute of limitations for U.S.\ntax reserves. The reduction in the valuation allowance is primarily due to an increase in unrealized capital gains on investments held by the Company which can provide a source of capital gain income\nin future years to realize the benefit of the capital losses.\nThe effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2020 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the Company recording a net increase in the reserve for uncertain tax positions\nduring 2020 and recording a valuation allowance for a capital loss recognized due to the sale of assets related to its Voice business unit in Australia and New Zealand and the impairment of certain\nU.S. investments.\n-103-"

Based on the weight of available evidence, the Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred\ntax asset will not be realized. If necessary, the Company records a valuation allowance sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The deferred\ntax assets should be realized through future operating results and the reversal of temporary differences.\nThe Company had a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets from continuing operations of $1.7 million and $1.8 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

In addition, as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, we had available state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $3.5 million and $5.1 million, respectively, which last indefinitely. The Company had no\nforeign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company has not provided for deferred taxes on approximately $307.8 million of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022. The Company has not\nprovided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as foreign withholding taxes, state income tax or foreign exchange gain or loss that would be due when cash is actually repatriated to\nthe U.S. because those foreign earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the business or may be remitted substantially free of any additional taxes. Because of the various avenues in which to\nrepatriate the earnings, it is not practicable to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings if eventually remitted.\nCertain taxes are prepaid during the year and, where appropriate, included within ‘Prepaid expenses and other current assets’ on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company’s prepaid taxes\nwere $3.2 million and $0.8 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes included income from domestic operations of $71.8 million, $279.7 million, $(2.0) million  for the years ended December 31,\n2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and income from foreign operations of $59.4 million, $71.7 million and $80.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nUncertain Income Tax Positions\nTax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position\nmeets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount\nof benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in\npayment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for continuing operations was $34.2 million, of which $32.7 million, if recognized, would affect the Company’s\neffective tax rate. As of December 31, 2021, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for continuing operations was $39.5 million, of which $35.6 million, if recognized, would affect the\nCompany’s effective tax rate.

In connection with the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, the Company recognized interest and penalty expense (benefit) in 2022, 2021 and 2020 of $0.7 million, $(1.5) million\nand $2.8 million, respectively.\nUncertain income tax positions are reasonably possible to significantly change during the next 12 months as a result of completion of income tax audits and expiration of statutes of\nlimitations. At this point it is not possible to provide an estimate of the amount, if any, of significant changes in reserves for uncertain income tax positions as a result of the completion of income tax\naudits that are reasonably possible to occur in the next 12 months. In addition, the Company cannot currently estimate the amount of, if any, uncertain income tax positions which will be released in\nthe next 12 months as a result of expiration of statutes of limitations due to ongoing audits. As a result of ongoing federal, state and foreign income tax audits (discussed below), it is reasonably\npossible that the Company’s entire reserve for uncertain income tax positions for the periods under audit will be released. It is also reasonably possible that the Company’s reserves will be inadequate\nto cover the entire amount of any such income tax liability.\nIncome Tax Audits:\nThe Company is in various stages of audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for its 2012 through 2016 tax years. On February 24, 2021, the Company received a Notice of\nDeficiency for tax years 2012 through 2014 which disallowed certain deductions for domestic production. The Company disagrees with the Notice and has filed a petition with the United States Tax\nCourt on May 24, 2021 and has continued to work with the IRS to reach a conclusion. As of December 31, 2022, the audits are ongoing.\nThe Company is under audit by the California Franchise Tax Board (“FTB”) for its tax years 2012 and 2013. The FTB, however, has agreed to suspend its audit for 2012 and 2013 pending the\noutcome of the IRS audit for such tax years. In August 2018, the FTB notified the Company that it will commence an audit of tax years 2015 and 2016. The Company responded to the inquiries from\nthe FTB. The tax years remain open pending the outcome of the IRS audit for such tax years. As of December 31, 2022, the audits are ongoing.\nIn June 2019, the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance (“NYS”) notified the Company that it will commence an audit for tax year 2015. In April 2020, the NYS notified the\nCompany that it would also commence an audit for tax years 2016 and 2017. The tax years remain open pending the outcome of the IRS audit for such tax years. On October 2022, the Company\nsigned an additional extension of the statute of limitations for tax years 2015 to 2017 to September 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the audits are ongoing.\nWe conduct business on a global basis and as a result, one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and in multiple state, local, and foreign tax jurisdictions. As\nnoted previously, our U.S. federal income tax returns for years 2012 through 2016 are under various stages of audit by the IRS. We are also under audit for various U.S. state and local tax purposes as\nnoted above for our significant jurisdictions. With limited exception, our significant foreign tax jurisdictions are no longer subject to an income tax audit by the various tax authorities for tax years\nprior to 2017.\nIt is reasonably possible that these audits may conclude in the next twelve months and that the uncertain tax positions the Company has recorded in relation to these tax years may change\ncompared to the liabilities recorded for these periods.

However, it is not\ncurrently possible to estimate the amount, if any, of such change.\n14.\nStockholders’ Equity\nIn February 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a program authorizing the repurchase of up to five million shares of the Company’s common stock through February 20, 2013\n(the “2012 Program”) which was subsequently extended through February 20, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 1,140,819 shares at an aggregate cost of\n$87.5 million under the 2012 Program, which were subsequently retired in the same year. As of December 31, 2020, all of the available shares were repurchased under the 2012 Program.\nOn August 6, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a program authorizing the repurchase of up to ten million shares of the Company’s common stock through August 6, 2025\n(the “2020 Program”). The Company entered into certain Rule 10b5-1 trading plans during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 to execute repurchases under the 2020 Program. During\nthe years ended December  31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company repurchased 736,536, 445,711 and 2,490,599 shares, respectively, at an aggregate cost of $71.3  million, $47.7  million and\n$177.8 million, respectively (including an immaterial amount of commission fees) under the 2020 Program. These shares were subsequently retired. Cumulatively as of December 31, 2022, 3,672,846\nshares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of $296.9 million (including an immaterial amount of commission fees) under the 2020 Program. As a result of the repurchases, the number of shares of\nthe Company’s common stock available for purchase as of December 31, 2022 was 6,327,154 shares.\nIn connection with the Separation, the Company called its 3.25% Convertible Notes for redemption and during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company issued 3,050,850 shares of\nthe Company’s common stock in connection with that redemption (see Note 10 - Debt).\nPeriodically, participants in the Company’s stock plans surrender to the Company shares of stock to pay the exercise price or to satisfy tax withholding obligations arising upon the exercise of\nstock options or the vesting of restricted stock. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company purchased and retired 72,886, 251,946 and 111,451 shares, respectively, at an\naggregate cost of approximately $7.0 million, $30.6 million and $10.4 million, respectively, from plan participants for this purpose.\n15.\nStock Based Compensation\nThe Company’s share-based compensation plans include the 2015 Stock Option Plan (the “2015 Plan”) and 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”). Each plan is described\nbelow.\nThe  2015  Plan provides for the granting of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares,\nperformance share units and other share-based awards. 4,200,000 shares of the Company’s common stock are authorized to be used for 2015 Plan purposes. Options under the 2015 Plan may be\ngranted at exercise prices determined by the Board of Directors, provided that the exercise prices shall not be less than the higher of the par value or 100% of the fair market value of the Company’s\ncommon stock subject to the option on the date the option is granted. As of December 31, 2022, 435,135 shares underlying options and 464,354 shares of restricted stock units were outstanding under\nthe 2015 Plan. At December 31, 2022, there were 1,496,619 additional shares underlying options, shares of restricted stock and other share-based awards available for grant under the 2015 Plan.\nIn connection with the Separation and pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of the 2015 Plan, the number of shares underlying each stock-based award outstanding as of the date of the\nSeparation was multiplied by a factor of approximately 1.09 and the related exercise price for the stock options was divided by a factor of approximately 1.09, which was intended to preserve the\nintrinsic value of the awards prior to the Separation. Further, the price targets for the Company’s market-based restricted stock units were reduced by $21.41. These adjustments to the Company’s\nequity compensation awards did not result in additional compensation expense. Stock based compensation awards that were held by Consensus employees were terminated and replaced with awards\nissued under the Consensus stock compensation plan (including under the Purchase Plan). Stock-based compensation expense through the Separation date for Consensus employees is included in\nresults from discontinued operations.\nStock Options\nAt December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, options to purchase 217,567, 168,614 and 175,601 shares of common stock were exercisable under and outside of the 2015 Plan, at weighted average\nexercise prices of $68.97, $67.62, $60.35, respectively.

      "text": "ZIFF DAVIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\nFair Value Disclosure\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of each option grant. The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s common\nstock. The Company estimates the expected term based upon the historical exercise behavior of its employees. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a term equal\nto the expected term of the option assumed at the date of grant. The Company uses an annualized dividend yield based upon the per share dividends declared by its Board of Directors. There were no\ndividends declared during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Estimated forfeiture rates were 13.0%, 12.4% and 13.0% as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\nThe Company has awarded restricted stock and restricted stock units to its Board of Directors and senior staff pursuant to certain share-based compensation plans. Compensation expense\nresulting from restricted stock and restricted unit grants is measured at fair value on the date of grant and is recognized as share-based compensation expense over the applicable vesting period. Vesting\nperiods are approximately one year for awards to members of the Company’s Board of Directors, four or five years for senior staff (excluding market-based awards discussed below) and four to eight\nyears for the Chief Executive Officer. The Company granted 154,022, 246,251 and 129,786 shares of restricted stock and restricted units (excluding awards with market conditions below) during the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units with Market Conditions\nThe Company has awarded certain key employees market-based restricted stock and market-based restricted stock units pursuant to the 2015 Plan. The market-based awards have vesting\nconditions that are based on specified stock price targets of the Company’s common stock. Market conditions were factored into the grant date fair value using a Monte Carlo valuation model, which\nutilized multiple input variables to determine the probability of the Company achieving the specified stock price targets with a 20-day and 30-day lookback (trading days). Stock-based compensation\nexpense related to an award with a market condition will be recognized over the requisite service period using the graded-vesting method regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied,\nprovided that the requisite service period has been completed. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 the Company awarded 100,193, 73,094 and 82,112 market-based restricted\nstock units, respectively. The per share weighted average grant-date fair values of the market-based restricted stock units granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were\n$87.11, $94.40 and $70.99, respectively.\nThe weighted-average fair values of market-based restricted stock units granted have been estimated utilizing the following assumptions:\nDecember 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020\nUnderlying stock price at valuation date\n$\n99.32 \n$\n113.27 \n$\n91.17 \nExpected volatility\n36.7 %\n30.3 %\n27.0 %\nRisk-free interest rate\n1.8 %\n1.3 %\n0.7 %\n-109-"

The Company determined that Consensus is no longer a related party after September 30, 2022. Related party transactions with Consensus through September 30, 2022 are included within the\ndisclosures below.\nIn preparation for and in executing the Separation, the Company incurred transaction-related costs, some of which were reimbursed by Consensus, of approximately $23.3 million (excluding\ncosts associated with the debt exchange noted below), before reimbursement by Consensus. These transaction costs primarily related to professional fees associated with preparation of regulatory\nfilings and transaction execution and separation activities within finance, tax and legal functions. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Ziff Davis received or expected to receive approximately\n$11.7 million (excluding the reimbursement of a portion of the debt exchange noted below) from Consensus resulting in net transaction costs of $11.6 million. These net transaction-related costs were\nrecorded in ‘General and administrative expenses’ component of ‘Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes’ within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the year\nended December 31, 2021, Consensus also reimbursed Ziff Davis for certain costs associated with the debt exchange in connection with the Separation totaling $7.5 million, which was recorded as an\noffset to the loss on extinguishment of debt on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, Consensus paid the Company approximately $8.5 million subsequent to the Separation due to\nexcess cash held at the Separation date net of other related items pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement.\n-117-"

      "text": "ZIFF DAVIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\nIn connection with the Separation, Ziff Davis and Consensus entered into several agreements that govern the relationship of the parties following the Separation, including a separation and\ndistribution agreement, a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, an intellectual property license agreement, and a stockholder and registration rights\nagreement. The transition services agreement governs services including certain information technology services, finance and accounting services and human resource and employee benefit services.\nThe agreed-upon charges for such services are generally intended to allow the providing company to recover all costs and expenses of providing such services, and nearly all such services were\nterminated without extension twelve months after the Separation. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded an offset to expense of approximately $1.2 million and\n$2.1 million, respectively, from Consensus related to the transition services agreement within ‘General and administrative expenses’ within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Further, the\nCompany assigned its lease of office space in Los Angeles, California to Consensus. Ziff Davis remained the lessee under this lease and its obligations remained through October 7, 2022, after which\ntime Consensus took over the lease in full. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded an offset to lease expense of approximately $1.5 million and $0.5 million,\nrespectively, related to this lease, however, Consensus paid the landlord directly and not Ziff Davis. Amounts due from Consensus as of December 31, 2021 was $9.3 million (comprised of $2.1\nmillion related to services provided under the transition services agreement and $7.2 million related to reimbursement of certain transaction related costs and other reimbursements), and is included in\nwithin ‘Accounts receivable’ within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOCV\nOn September 25, 2017, the Company entered into a commitment to invest in the Fund. The manager, OCV, and general partner of the Fund are entities with respect to which Richard S.\nRessler, former Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, is indirectly the majority equity holder. Mr. Ressler’s tenure with the Board ended as of May 10, 2022. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company recognized expense for management fees of $1.5 million, $3.0 million, and $3.0 million, net of tax benefit, respectively. During the years ended\n2021 and 2020, the Company received capital call notices from the management of OCV Management, LLC for $22.2 million and $32.9 million, inclusive of certain management fees, of which $22.2\nmillion and $31.9 million had been paid as of the end of each respective year. In connection with the settlement of certain litigation generally related to the Company’s investment in the Fund (see\nNote 12 - Commitments and Contingencies), among other terms, no further capital calls were made during 2022 or will be made in the future in connection with the Company’s investment in the Fund,\nnor will any management fees be paid by the Company to the manager. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company received a distribution from OCV of zero, $15.3\nmillion, and zero respectively.\n-118-"

      "text": "Item 9. Changes In And Disagreements With Accountants On Accounting And Financial Disclosure\n   None.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the\nCompany’s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that\nsuch information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. Our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nZiff Davis’ management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)\nfor Ziff Davis. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment,\nincluding testing, using the criteria in Internal Control – Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) using the 2013\nframework. Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements\nfor external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that Ziff Davis’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.\nBecause of the timing of acquisitions in 2022, pursuant to applicable SEC staff guidance, management was not required to and therefore did not assess the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting of all of the 2022 acquisitions (see Note 4 - Business Acquisitions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements). These acquisitions combined constituted 5.4% of total\nassets as of December 31, 2022 and 2.4% of revenues for the year then ended.\nRemediation of Material Weakness\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we determined that we did not design and maintain effective controls over the accounting for certain elements related to the Consensus Cloud\nSolutions, Inc. (“Consensus”) Spin-off. The control activities were not designed to allow the Company to timely identify and account for (i) a debt exchange with a third-party lender that resulted in a\nloss on extinguishment of existing debt, (ii) the unrealized gain on the Company’s remaining 19.9% investment in Consensus, and (iii) the completeness and accuracy of certain amounts classified in\ndiscontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. Although this control weakness did not result in any material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements for the periods\npresented, it is reasonably possible that it could have led to a material misstatement of account balances or disclosures. Accordingly, management had concluded that this control weakness constituted\na material weakness.\nManagement has completed the execution of its remediation plan and remediated the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting that was reported as of December 31, 2021.\nDuring 2022, our management enhanced and revised the design of existing controls and procedures over our accounting for significant non-recurring transactions. These controls relate to the research,\nanalysis and documentation supporting our management’s evaluations, judgments, and conclusions that are required in order to account for significant unusual transactions. We enhanced our approach\nto and the execution of the research, analysis, and documentation related to these matters. Our process of consulting third-party experts was also enhanced and we continue to include outreach to and\ncoordination with experts with the relevant knowledge and experience to assist our management with the evaluation of our accounting for significant non-recurring transactions. During the fourth\nquarter of 2022, we completed our testing of the operating effectiveness of the implemented controls and found them to be effective. As a result, we have concluded the material weakness has been\nremediated as of December 31, 2022.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 have been audited by BDO USA, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in the attestation\nreport which is included herein.\n-119-"

      "text": "(d) Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nZiff Davis, Inc.\nNew York, New York\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Ziff Davis, Inc.’s (the “Company’s”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as\nof December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nDecember 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated March 1, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial\nreporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also\nincluded performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Item 9A, Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of 2022 acquisitions, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and\nthe related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These acquisitions combined constituted 5.4% of total assets as\nof December 31, 2022, and 2.4% of revenues for the year then ended. Management did not assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of the 2022 acquisitions because of the\ntiming of these acquisitions. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the 2022\nacquisitions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that\ntransactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n-121-"
