Our largest asset is a property located at 77\nGreenwich Street in Lower Manhattan (“77 Greenwich”), which is nearing completion as a mixed-use project consisting of\na 90-unit residential condominium tower, retail space and a New York City elementary school. We also own a 105-unit, 12-\nstory multi-family property located at 237 11th Street in Brooklyn, New York (“237 11th”) as well as a property occupied\nby a retail tenant in Paramus, New Jersey. In February 2023, we sold our 10% interest in a joint venture that owned a\nmultifamily property at 250 North 10th Street, Brooklyn, New York.  See Item 2. Properties below for a more detailed\ndescription of our properties owned at December 31, 2022. In addition to our real estate portfolio, we also control a variety\nof intellectual property assets focused on the consumer sector, a legacy of our predecessor, Syms Corp. (“Syms”). We also\nhad approximately $275.8 million of federal net operating loss carry forwards (“NOLs”) at December 31, 2022, which can\nbe used to reduce our future taxable income and capital gains.\nLiquidity and Going Concern; Management’s Plans; Recent Developments\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related matters, including government actions, shifts in residential consumer sentiment and\nchanges to the broader and local economies, had a significant adverse impact on our business.  More recently, the economic\ndownturn, increased interest rates and high inflation have also impacted our business.  While we believe many of these\ntrends will reverse or stabilize, and the New York City economy and residential real estate markets have generally seen\ncontinued improvement in 2022 and to date in 2023, given our focus on New York City residential real estate, our business\nhas been particularly impacted.  As of December 31, 2022, we had total cash and restricted cash of $22.1 million, of which\napproximately $1.5 million was cash and cash equivalents and approximately $20.5 million was restricted cash. We also\nhad $2.0 million available under our secured line of credit at December 31, 2022, which has since been drawn.   The\nCompany’s cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations, debt service, amortization\nand maturities and corporate expenses over the next 12 months, unless we are able to extend or refinance our maturing debt\nand raise additional capital, creating substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management is\nexploring opportunities to secure additional funding through the sale of assets, refinancings of outstanding indebtedness,\nand equity or debt financings or other sources.  The Company also continues to explore a range of strategic and financing\nalternatives to maximize stockholder value, and to engage with parties that have expressed interest in the Company’s\nattributes and assets and may see the Company as a potential vehicle for growth, with potential opportunities to recapitalize\nthe Company at a lower cost of capital.  The Company has engaged Houlihan Lokey and Ackman-Ziff to act as advisors\n(our “Advisors”) in connection with our strategic review process and to assist us in identifying and evaluating potential\nalternatives.  Potential strategic alternatives that may be evaluated include securing an equity and/or debt financing of the\nCompany, refinancing of existing debt, and/or a sale or merger or reverse merger of the Company.  The Company is also in\ndiscussions with its lenders regarding the deferment of upcoming interest, amortization and other payment obligations for\nthe period ending March 31, 2023 and going forward.  The Company is also exploring a refinancing of the debt in respect\nof 237 11th.   Given the current environment there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into any of the\ncontemplated or future extensions, amendments or waivers with our lenders, raise additional capital, refinance\nindebtedness or enter into other financing arrangements or engage in asset sales or strategic partnerships sufficient to fund\nour cash needs, on terms satisfactory to us, if at all.  Further, in the event that market conditions preclude our ability to\nconsummate such transactions, we will be required to evaluate additional alternatives in restructuring our business and our\ncapital structure, including but not limited to filing for bankruptcy protection or seeking an out-of-court restructuring of our\nliabilities. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors, Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operation and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements and of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nfurther information.\nWhile construction at 77 Greenwich has taken longer than projected due to the impacts of COVID-19 and supply-chain\nissues over the past years, and the impact of the pandemic and broader economic conditions have impeded the sale of\nresidential condominium units at 77 Greenwich, we continue to sign and close contracts for our residential condominium\nunits, including five units since December 31, 2022. The units that remain available to be sold are larger, higher floor"

Our strategies to\nachieve this objective have recently included (i) the sale and closing of residential condominium units at 77 Greenwich and\nthe development, redevelopment, repositioning and potential disposition of our legacy retail property in Paramus, New\nJersey; (ii) identifying additional acquisition and investment opportunities, including high-quality, multi-family real estate\nin New York City; (iii) entering into joint ventures in respect of attractive properties; and (iv) enhancing our capital\nstructure.   We are currently focused on exploring a range of strategic and financing alternatives to maximize stockholder\nvalue, which may include securing additional equity or debt financings, refinancings of existing debt, and/or a sale or\nmerger of the Company.\nCompetition\nThe markets in which our properties are located are inherently competitive. With respect to our operating properties\ncurrently located in Brooklyn, New York and Paramus, New Jersey, and any future real estate assets that we acquire, invest\nin or develop, we will be competing for some of the same tenants, contractors, lenders and potential purchasers or investors\nwith respect to other properties within the same markets, but owned by other investors, many of whom have greater\nresources than we do.\nCompetitive factors with respect to 77 Greenwich may have a more material effect on us as it is our most significant real\nestate asset. Various municipal entities are making and have indicated an intent to continue to make significant investments\nin the immediate vicinity of 77 Greenwich to support the growth of the downtown Manhattan neighborhood as a vibrant\n24/7 community to work, live and visit. Several privately funded commercial and residential developments are being\nconstructed or have been proposed and office buildings are being converted to residential use to take advantage of the\nincreasing desirability of the neighborhood. The impact of these changing supply and demand characteristics is uncertain,\nand they could positively or negatively impact our plan to maximize the value of 77 Greenwich.\nIn addition, we face competition in identifying and closing on new investment and acquisition opportunities, including\nfrom larger and more established real estate firms with greater capital resources and access to financing.\nRegulatory Matters\nEnvironmental Compliance\nUnder various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real\nestate may be required to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances at a property, and may be held liable to a\ngovernmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs\nincurred by the parties in connection with the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether\nthe owner or operator had knowledge of, or was responsible for, the release of the hazardous or toxic substances. The\npresence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or lease\nreal estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.\nOther federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations require abatement or removal of asbestos-containing\nmaterials in the event of demolition or certain renovations or remodeling, the cost of which may be substantial for certain\nredevelopment projects that a potential purchaser would want to undertake with respect to any particular parcel of real\nestate we own. Such laws, ordinances and regulations also govern emissions from and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air.\nFederal and state laws also regulate the operation and removal of underground storage tanks. In connection with the\nownership and management of certain properties, we could be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to\nthese regulated substances or related claims."

In\nmany cases, we are and will continue to be required to obtain governmental permits, site plan approvals and/or other\nauthorizations, or seek variances, prior to proceeding with planned development, acquisition or other activities.\nThe Zoning Resolution of the City of New York, effective as of December 15, 1961, as amended (the “Zoning\nResolution”), governs the use and development of properties in New York City.  Properties in New York City may be\ndeveloped on an as-of-right basis, i.e. without any discretionary city approvals, unless the proposed use or bulk does not\ncomply with the applicable provisions of the Zoning Resolution.  Discretionary approvals may be requested from the New\nYork City Planning Commission or the Board of Standards and Appeals.  Discretionary approvals are subject to hearing\nand public participation requirements and are also subject to environmental review pursuant to the State Environmental\nQuality Review Act, as implemented by the City Environmental Quality Review.\nChapter 11 Cases and Plan of Reorganization of Syms\nTrinity is the successor to Syms, which also owned Filene’s Basement. In September 2012, the Syms Plan of\nReorganization (the “Plan”) became effective and Syms and its subsidiaries consummated their reorganization under\nChapter 11 through a series of transactions and emerged from bankruptcy. As part of those transactions, reorganized Syms\nmerged with and into Trinity, with Trinity as the surviving corporation and successor issuer pursuant to Rule 12g-3 under\nSection 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\nIn March 2016, we satisfied our final payment and reserve obligations under the Plan.  In February 2018, the bankruptcy\ncourt entered the final decree pursuant to which the chapter 11 cases of the reorganized debtors were closed. In January\n2020, we made our final payment of $109,000 to the multiemployer pension plan claim, which was the final legacy claim\nof the Plan to be paid. As of December 31, 2022, the Syms sponsored pension plan was underfunded for accounting\npurposes by approximately $651,000 (see Note 9 – Pension Plans to our consolidated financial statements for further\ninformation).\nIntellectual Property Assets\nWe control a variety of intellectual property assets focused on the consumer sector, a legacy of our predecessor, Syms,\nincluding FilenesBasement.com, our rights to the Stanley Blacker® brand, as well as the intellectual property associated\nwith the Running of the Brides® event and An Educated Consumer is Our Best Customer® slogan. In addition, various\ntrademarks are controlled and/or owned by us, including “Filene’s Basement”®, “Stanley Blacker”®, “Running of the\nBrides”® and “An Educated Consumer is Our Best Customer,”® and have been registered with the United States Patent\nand Trademark Office.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had a total of seven employees, six of which were full-time and one part-time, in executive,\nmanagement, finance, accounting, operations and administrative capacities.  \nGeneral Information about Trinity\nTrinity is incorporated in Delaware.

Some of these risks are described below, and\nstockholders should take such risks into account when evaluating us or any investment decision involving us. This section\ndoes not describe all risks that may be applicable to us, our industry or our business, and it is intended only as a summary\nof certain material risk factors. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently\nbelieve are not material may also adversely affect our business. More detailed information concerning certain of the risk\nfactors described below is contained in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Stockholders should also refer\nto the other information contained in our periodic reports, including the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements section, our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations section for a further discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions\nrelating to our business.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Business\nWe have a limited amount of unrestricted cash and liquidity and variable cash needs. If we are not successful in\nconsummating a strategic transaction, raising significant additional capital and/or receiving significant amounts on\naccount of our claims involving 237 11th in a timely manner, we will have insufficient cash and liquidity to service our\ndebt and pay operating expenses and other obligations over the next 12 months, which would have a material adverse\neffect on our business and financial condition.\nWe have a limited amount of unrestricted cash and liquidity available for working capital and our cash needs are significant\nand variable under different circumstances, including near term debt maturities and other payment obligations.  The\nCompany’s cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations, debt service, amortization\nand maturities and corporate expenses over the next 12 months, unless we are able to extend or refinance our maturing debt\nand/or raise additional capital, creating substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Management is\ncurrently in discussions with the Company’s lenders regarding the deferment of upcoming payments and exploring\nopportunities to secure additional funding through the sale of assets, refinancings of outstanding indebtedness, and equity\nor debt financings or other sources.  The Company also continues to explore a range of strategic and financing alternatives\nto maximize stockholder value.   We have engaged our Advisors in connection with our strategic review process and to\nassist us in identifying and evaluating potential alternatives.  Potential strategic alternatives that may be evaluated include\nsecuring an equity and/or debt financing of the Company, refinancing of existing debt, and/or a sale or merger or reverse\nmerger of the Company. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in reaching agreements with our lenders,\nconsummating any such strategic transaction or obtaining capital sufficient to meet our operating needs, in each case, on\nterms or a timeframe acceptable to us or at all. In addition, if funds are raised by issuing equity securities, dilution to\nexisting shareholders will result and future investors may purchase shares at prices below current market values and/or be\ngranted rights superior to those of existing shareholders. Further, in the event that market conditions preclude our ability to\nconsummate such transactions, we may be required to evaluate additional alternatives in restructuring our business and our\ncapital structure, including but not limited to, filing for bankruptcy protection or seeking an out-of-court restructuring of\nour liabilities. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -\nLiquidity and Capital Resources and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our\nability to continue as a going concern and related matters.  \nWe have limited cash resources, generate minimal revenues from operations, and are reliant on external sources of\ncapital to fund ongoing operations.\nOur revenue generating activities have not yet produced sufficient funds for profitable operations and working capital.\nAccordingly, our continued operation will require raising additional capital on acceptable terms and entering into\nacceptable modifications to, or refinancings of, our indebtedness. We have relied and will continue to rely substantially\nupon equity and debt financing to fund our ongoing operations. There can be no assurance that additional sources of capital\nwill be available to us on commercially favorable terms. In addition, our inability to access the capital markets on favorable\nterms, because of a low stock price, unfavorable market conditions or otherwise, will affect our ability to execute our\nbusiness plan as scheduled. If we are unable to raise capital on market terms, our ability to run our operations and/or grow\nthrough new acquisitions and investments, and thus become profitable, will be materially adversely impacted."

The development of\nour business plan has required, and will continue to require, substantial capital expenditures. There can be no assurance\nthat our business will be successful, that we will be able to achieve or maintain a profitable operation, or that we will not\nencounter unforeseen difficulties that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated. There can be no\nassurance that we will achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from our operating activities.\nWe are subject to leverage at both our parent company and our subsidiaries and face risks generally associated with our\ndebt, including an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could\nadversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness in furtherance of our activities, at both the parent company level and subsidiary\nlevel, resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements, which\ncould adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  As a result, we are subject to the risks associated\nwith debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and\ninterest, the risk that we may fail to repay or refinance existing debt as it matures, which may result in forced disposition of\nassets on disadvantageous terms or have other adverse consequences, and the risk that if we refinance any of our debt, we\nmay do so on refinancing terms less favorable than the terms of our existing debt.\nSeveral of our loans have near-term maturities and other significant payment obligations.  In addition, several of our loans\nrequire interest rate cap agreements be in place for the duration of the loan. Although many of our loans contain extension\noptions, the 237 11th Loan and the 77 Mortgage Loan require replacement interest rate cap agreements be put in place in\norder to extend the loan maturity. With the significant increase in interest rates, the cost of purchasing such an interest rate\ncap has become material. Due to cash constrains, we may not have the funds available to purchase the required interest rate\ncap which, unless we can restructure or refinance the loan, would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.  If we are not successful in meeting the extension requirements, or amending, waiving\nor paying the near-term maturities and other payment obligations, or our lenders accelerated their respective loan, cross-\ndefaults would also exist and we would have insufficient cash and liquidity to service our debt and pay operating expenses\nand other obligations.\nAll of our properties secure loans. Certain of our loans contain cross-default provisions. The failure by us or our borrower\nsubsidiaries to make scheduled repayments under the loan agreements, or the default of any of the obligations under our\nloans, would have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Upon the occurrence\nof an event of default, we or our applicable subsidiary may be required to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under\nthe respective loan and the lenders may exercise other remedies available to them, including foreclosing on the respective\nproperty securing the loan.\nSee Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and\nCapital Resources and Note 11 – Loans Payable and Secured Line of Credit to our consolidated financial statements, for\nfurther discussion regarding our financing activities.\nCovenants in our loan agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur loan agreements contain a number of financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on debt, liens,\nbusiness activities, equity repurchases, distributions and dividends, disposition of assets and transactions with affiliates, as\nwell as financial covenants regarding loan to value and net worth. These covenants may limit our flexibility to pursue\ncertain acquisitions or investments or incur additional debt. If we fail to meet or satisfy any of these covenants, we would\nbe in default under these agreements and our indebtedness could be declared due and payable.  In addition, our lenders\ncould terminate their commitments, require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their interests against existing\ncollateral. If we were to default under our loan agreements, our financial condition would be adversely affected."

An inability to execute this business plan due to adverse trends in the New York City residential\ncondominium market or otherwise would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur business plan includes the development or redevelopment of our legacy commercial real estate properties and in\nparticular completion of and the sale of condominiums at 77 Greenwich, which currently is our largest asset. As a result,\nour revenues and future growth are heavily dependent on the success of implementing our business plan for 77 Greenwich.\n77 Greenwich consists of 90 luxury residential condominium apartments, in addition to a retail condominium unit and a\nNew York City elementary school condominium unit.   A variety of factors determine New York City residential\ncondominium trends and will impact the sales and pricing of the residential condominium units at 77 Greenwich. These\nfactors include, among others, available supply, changes in interest rates, the availability of home mortgages, foreign\nexchange rates, foreign buyer patterns, local employment trends, and prices and velocity of sales. Sales of residential\ncondominium units in general, and in particular in New York City, have historically experienced greater volatility than\ndetached single family houses, which may expose us to more risk.  These and other factors fluctuate over time. Based on a\nnumber of reports, there is a historically high number of unsold units in newly constructed luxury residential\ncondominiums in New York City, which has resulted in demand and pricing pressures. When we commenced sales in the\nspring of 2019, the New York City market, in particular downtown Manhattan, was in a period of softness.  This was\nexacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.   Due to current market conditions in New York City, several\ncompeting residential condominium projects located in downtown Manhattan, specifically in the Financial District, have\nbeen put on hold.  The status of unsold residential condominium units in 2023 and beyond is inherently uncertain. Closings\non sales commenced in September 2021 and are ongoing.  An inability to successfully execute our business plan with\nrespect to 77 Greenwich would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may evaluate and potentially consummate a strategic transaction, which could require significant management\nattention, consume our financial resources, disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, and we\nmay fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such a strategic transaction.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to consummate a strategic transaction in the near-term. The identification of\na suitable candidate for a strategic transaction can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and we may not be able to\nsuccessfully complete identified strategic transactions. Strategic transactions are inherently risky, and ultimately, if we do\nnot complete an announced strategic transaction successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the anticipated\nbenefits of the strategic transaction.  Achieving the anticipated benefits of any transaction involves a number of risks,\nincluding disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from daily operations or\nother opportunities and challenges, utilization of our financial resources for a transaction that may fail to realize the\nanticipated benefits, regulatory risks, including maintaining good standing with existing regulatory bodies or receiving any\nnecessary approvals, and the failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or challenges\nof the strategic partner.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with any strategic transaction could cause us\nto fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business\ngenerally. In addition, such a transaction could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of\ndebt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or the write-off of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial\ncondition."

The occurrence of any of these events,\nparticularly with respect to leases at our commercial real estate property, or issues that affect numerous residential units,\ncould adversely impact, and in the case of 237 11th, has adversely impacted, our results of operations, liquidity and\nfinancial condition.\nIn addition, if our competitors offer space at net effective rental rates below our current net effective rental rates or market\nrates, we may lose current or potential tenants to other properties in our markets. Additionally, we may need to reduce net\neffective rental rates below our current rates or offer incentives in order to retain tenants upon expiration of their leases or\nto attract new tenants. Our results of operations and cash flow may be adversely affected as a result of these factors.\nWe may be unable to lease vacant space, renew our current leases, or re-lease space as our current leases expire.\nThe lease of a long-term tenant at the outparcel of our Paramus property recently expired.  Leases at that or our other\nproperties may not be renewed or such properties may not be re-leased at favorable rental rates. If the rental rates for our\nproperties decrease, our tenants do not renew their leases or we do not re-lease a significant portion of our available space,\ntenant defaults or space that is currently unoccupied, and space for which leases are scheduled to expire, our financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. There are numerous commercial\ndevelopers, real estate companies, financial institutions and other investors with greater financial resources that compete\nwith us in seeking tenants who we desire to lease space in our properties.\nThe bankruptcy of, or a downturn in the business of, any of the major tenants at our commercial real estate properties that\ncauses them to reject their leases, or to not renew their leases as they expire, or renew at lower rental rates, may adversely\naffect our cash flows and property values. In addition, retailers at our properties face increasing competition from e-\ncommerce, outlet malls, discount shopping clubs, direct mail and telemarketing, which could reduce rents payable to us\nand reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties leading to increased vacancy rates at our properties.\nIn addition, if we are unable to renew leases or re-lease a property, the resale value of that property could be diminished\nbecause the market value of a particular property will depend in part upon the value of the leases of such property.\nWe may acquire properties subject to known and unknown liabilities and with limited or no recourse to the seller.\nProperties we acquire may be subject to known or unknown liabilities with no or minimal recourse to the seller.

We have purchased one property subject to unknown\nconstruction defects due to water penetration in the walls, 237 11th, and there can be no assurance that we will not do so\nagain. During the pendency of repairs, units were unable to be leased, and following completion of repairs, they needed to\nbe re-leased. Also, if a liability was asserted against us arising from our ownership of a property, we might have to pay\nsubstantial sums to settle it. Unknown liabilities with respect to properties acquired might include:\n●\nliabilities for repair of damaged properties or faulty construction;\n●\nclaims by tenants, vendors or other persons arising from dealing with the former owners of the properties;\n●\nliabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business;\n●\nclaims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of\nthe properties; and\n●\nliabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination and/or repair or other remediation of\nconstruction defects.\nAny of these occurrences could adversely affect our cash flow, even if some or all of the costs are ultimately borne by a\nthird party, and the impact could be material."

The rent\nstabilization regulations applicable to our multi-family residential properties set maximum rates for annual rent increases,\nentitle our tenants to receive required services from us and entitle our tenants to have their leases renewed. The limitations\nestablished by present or future rent stabilization regulations may impair our ability to maintain rents at market levels at\nproperties subject to such regulations.\nPursuant to the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, which is a set of New York State laws, vacancy lease\nincreases were eliminated, whereby the landlord was permitted to increase the rent by as much as 20% for a tenant moving\ninto a vacant apartment, to which significant increases in rent for New York City properties were historically attributed.\nWith respect to certain types of properties in New York City, solely by virtue of the real estate tax exemption under RPTL\nSection 421-a, the Rent Guidelines Board of New York City, approves renewal lease rent increases.  In 2022, the Rent\nGuidelines Board approved a 3.25% increase on 12-month lease renewals and a 5.0% increase on 24-month lease renewals.\n \nThe application of rent stabilization to apartments in our multi-family residential properties will limit the amount of rent we\nare able to collect, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fully take advantage of the investments that\nwe are making in our properties. In addition, there can be no assurances that changes to rent stabilization laws will not have\na similar or greater negative impact on our ability to collect rents.\nThere is a proposed New York State bill (Good Cause Eviction), which, if passed may impose restrictions on rent increases\nand the right not to renew market rate unit leases. If passed, there will be restrictions on an owner’s ability to grow market\nrents.\nCompetition for new acquisitions and investments may reduce the number of opportunities available to us and increase\nthe costs of those acquisitions and investments.\nWe face competition for acquisition and investment opportunities from other investors, particularly those investors who are\nwilling to incur more leverage. This competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks:\n●\nan inability to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors,\nmany of whom have greater resources than us, including publicly traded and privately held REITs, private real\nestate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds,\npension trusts, partnerships and individual investors; and\n●\nan increase in the purchase price for the acquisition of such property.\nIf we are unable to successfully acquire or invest in additional properties, our ability to grow our business would be\nadversely affected.

Any\nchanges announced by the FCA, ARRC, other regulators or any other successor governance or oversight body, or future\nchanges adopted by such body, in the method pursuant to which U.S. Dollar LIBOR, SOFR, or any other alternative rates\nare determined may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in the reported LIBOR rates. If that were to occur,\nthe levels of interest payments we incur and interest payments we receive may change. It is also uncertain whether SOFR\nor any other alternative rate will gain market acceptance. In addition, although our LIBOR based obligations and\ninvestments provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate if LIBOR is not reported, uncertainty as to the\nextent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, lower than or that do\nnot otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on our obligations if\nLIBOR rate was available in its current form. We may also need to renegotiate our LIBOR based obligations, which we\nmay not be successful in doing on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us.  In 2023, the 237 11th Loan was converted\nfrom LIBOR to SOFR.\nWe may not receive or be able to maintain certain tax benefits if we are not in compliance with certain requirements of\nthe NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development.\nWe may not receive or be able to maintain certain existing or anticipated tax benefits related to the 237 11th property or the\n250 N 10th property if we are not in compliance with certain requirements of the NYC Department of Housing Preservation\nand Development (“HPD”).

Under some\nenvironmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up\nhazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental\nentity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those\nparties because of the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator\nknew of the release of the substances or caused the release. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate\ncontamination may impair our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other laws\nand regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of\nasbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of\nand exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment\ncontaining polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are also regulated by federal and state laws. We are also subject to risks\nassociated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which,\nabove certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible\nindividuals. We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with\nrespect to the foregoing regulated substances or related claims arising out of environmental contamination or human\nexposure to contamination at or from our properties.\nEach of our properties has been subject to varying degrees of environmental assessment. To date, these environmental\nassessments have not revealed any environmental condition material to our business.

Section 382 of the Internal Revenue\nCode (the “Code”), limits the ability of a company to utilize its NOLs after an ownership change. For purposes of Section\n382, an ownership change occurs if the percentage of the stock of the company owned by persons holding 5% or more of\nthe stock increases by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three year lookback period.  Generally, if an ownership\nchange occurs, the annual taxable income limitation on our use of NOLs is equal to the product of the applicable long-term\ntax exempt rate and the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change. If we undergo an ownership change,\nour ability to utilize our NOLs would be subject to significant limitations. In addition, the 2017 tax legislation known as the\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) limited the deductibility of NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31,\n2017 to 80 percent of taxable income (computed without regard to the net operating loss deduction) for the taxable year,\nand eliminated the ability of taxpayers to carryback such NOLs to prior years. These limitations were modified by the\n“Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act,” signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act\nsuspended the 80% limitation on the use of NOLs for tax years beginning before January 1, 2021, and allowed losses\narising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021 to be carried back up to five years.\nPolitical and economic uncertainty, and developments related to outbreaks of contagious diseases could have an adverse\neffect on us.\nWe cannot predict how current and future political and economic uncertainty, including uncertainty related to taxation and\nincreases in interest rates, will affect our critical tenants, joint venture partners, lenders, financial institutions and general\neconomic conditions, including consumer confidence and the volatility of the stock market and real estate market.

As a result, for so long as these\nboard appointment rights are in effect, Third Avenue and the CCF Lender may be able to exert influence over our policies\nand management, potentially in a manner which may not be in our best interests or the best interests of the other\nstockholders.\nIn order to protect our ability to utilize our NOLs and certain other tax attributes, our certificate of incorporation\nincludes certain transfer restrictions with respect to our stock, which may limit the liquidity of our common stock.\nTo reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to use our NOLs and certain other tax attributes for U.S.\nFederal income tax purposes, our certificate of incorporation contains certain transfer restrictions with respect to our stock\nby substantial stockholders. These restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of our common stock to\ndispose of or acquire shares of our common stock and may have an adverse impact on the liquidity of our stock generally.\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock in the past and do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock\nfor the foreseeable future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never paid a cash dividend on our common stock. We expect that any income received from operations will be\ndevoted to our future operations and growth. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the near\nfuture. Payment of dividends in the future will depend upon our profitability at the time, cash available for those dividends,\nand such other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may\nbe less valuable because a return on an investor’s investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also\nreduce the market price of our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in\ncontrol of us. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate\nactions. In addition to the matters identified in the risk factors above relating to the provisions of our certificate of\nincorporation, these provisions include:\n●\na classified board of directors with two-year staggered terms;\n●\nlimitations in our certificate of incorporation on acquisitions and dispositions of our common stock designed to\nprotect our NOLs and certain other tax attributes; and\n●\nauthorization for blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other\nrights superior to our common stock.\nThese and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage\npotential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of common stock\nand result in the market price of the common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions."

To the extent the provision could be construed to apply to such claims, there is uncertainty as to whether a\ncourt would enforce the provision in such respect, and the Company’s stockholders will not be deemed to have waived the\nCompany’s compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThe exclusive forum provision may discourage claims or limit stockholders’ ability to submit claims in a judicial forum\nthat they find favorable and may create additional costs as a result. If a court were to determine the exclusive forum\nprovision to be inapplicable and unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs in conjunction with our efforts\nto resolve the dispute in an alternative jurisdiction, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nBecause we are a U.S. real property holding corporation, non-U.S. holders of our common stock could be subject to\nU.S. federal income tax on the gain from its sale, exchange or other disposition.\nBecause we are a U.S. real property holding corporation, which we refer to as \"USRPHC,\" under the Foreign Investment in\nReal Property Tax Act of 1980 and applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, which we refer to collectively as the \"FIRPTA\nRules,\" unless an exception applies, certain non-U.S. investors in our common stock could be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax on the gain from the sale, exchange or other disposition of shares of our common stock, and such non-U.S.\ninvestors could be required to file a United States federal income tax return. In addition, the purchaser of such common\nstock may be required to withhold 15% of the purchase price and remit such amount to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.\nUnder the FIRPTA Rules, we are a USRPHC because our interests in U.S. real property comprise at least 50% of the fair\nmarket value of our assets. Our common stock trades on the NYSE American. So long as it continues to do so, and is\nregularly quoted by brokers or dealers making a market in our common stock, our common stock will be treated as\n\"regularly traded on an established securities market\" (within the meaning of the FIRPTA Rules). As a result, (i) a non-U.S.\ninvestor who, actually or constructively, holds no more than 5% of our common stock would not be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax on the gain from the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common stock under the FIRPTA Rules, and (ii)\na purchaser of such stock from a non-U.S. investor would not be required to withhold any portion of the purchase price of\nsuch stock, regardless of the percentage of our common stock held by such non-U.S. investor.

We are nearing completion of an over 300,000 gross square foot mixed-use building that corresponds\nto the approximate total of 233,000 zoning square feet. The property consists of 90 luxury residential condominium\napartments, 7,500 square feet of retail space, almost all of which is street level, a 476-seat elementary school serving\nNew York City District 2, including the adaptive reuse of the landmarked Robert and Anne Dickey House.  As of\nDecember 31, 2022, all finishes were complete through the 35th floor.  As of December 31, 2022, we had received our\ntemporary certificates of occupancy (“TCOs”) for the condominium units on floors 11-35 (except the units noted\nbelow), lobby, Cloud Club (lounge, terrace, game room, dining room, kitchen and kids play room), mechanical rooms,\nand portions of the cellar (including the bike and storage rooms.)  As of March 1, 2023, we had received TCOs for\n100% of the residential units.   We have closed on the sale of 28 residential condominium units through December 31,\n2022, with 62 remaining units to sell as of December 31, 2022, and closed on the sale of five additional units since\nDecember 31, 2022.\nWe entered into an agreement with the New York City School Construction Authority (the “SCA”), whereby we\nconstructed a school sold to the SCA as part of our condominium development at 77 Greenwich. Pursuant to the\nagreement, the SCA agreed to pay us $41.5 million for the purchase of their condominium unit and reimburse us for\nthe costs associated with constructing the school, including a construction supervision fee of approximately $5.0\nmillion. Payments for construction are being made by the SCA to the general contractor in installments as construction\non their condominium unit progresses. Payments to us for the land and construction supervision fee commenced in\nJanuary 2018 and continued through October 2019 for the land and will continue through completion of the SCA\nbuildout for the construction supervision fee.  An aggregate of $46.3 million had been paid to us by the SCA as of\nDecember 31, 2022 with approximately $207,000 remaining to be paid. We have also received an aggregate of $54.7\nmillion in reimbursable construction costs from the SCA through December 31, 2022.  In April 2020, the SCA closed\non the purchase of the school condominium unit from us, at which point title transferred to the SCA.  The SCA has\ncompleted the buildout of the interior space, which is a public elementary school with approximately 476 seats.  The\nschool received its final TCO and opened to students in September 2022.    \n(2) Paramus Property. The Paramus property consists of a one-story and partial two-story, 73,000 square foot\nfreestanding building and an outparcel building of approximately 4,000 square feet, for approximately 77,000 total\nsquare feet of rentable space. The primary building is comprised of approximately 47,000 square feet of ground floor\nspace, and two separate mezzanine levels of approximately 21,000 and 5,000 square feet.

The land area of the Paramus property consists of approximately 292,000 square feet, or approximately 6.7\nacres.\nThe Paramus property had been under contract for sale pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement, which was subject\nto site plan approval.  The agreement was terminated by the buyer in January 2023. We are currently exploring options\nwith respect to the Paramus property, including development, redevelopment or sale, among others.\n(3) 237 11th Street. In 2018, we acquired a 105-unit, 12-story multi-family apartment building encompassing\napproximately 93,000 gross square feet (approximately 80,000 rentable square feet) located at 237 11th Street, Park\nSlope, Brooklyn, New York for a purchase price of $81.2 million, excluding transaction costs of approximately $0.7\nmillion. The property also includes 6,264 square feet of retail space, all of which is leased to Starbucks Inc.\n(NQGS:SBUX), an oral surgeon and a health and wellness tenant. Located on the border of the Park Slope and\nGowanus neighborhoods of Brooklyn, the property is located one block from the 4th Avenue/9th Street subway\nstation. The 237 11th property offers an array of modern amenities that surpass what is available in the neighborhood’s\n“brownstone” housing stock. The property also benefits from a 15-year Section 421-a real estate tax exemption.\nAlthough all apartments are market rate units, they are subject to New York City’s rent stabilization law during the\nremaining term of the Section 421-a real estate tax exemption. Due the approval of the Gowanus up-zoning, this\nproperty benefitted to the extent of approximately 30,000 square feet of air rights.\nDue to water damage in apartment units and other property at 237 11th resulting from construction defects which we\nbelieve were concealed by the prior ownership team and its contractor, we submitted a notice of claim to our insurance\ncarrier for property damage and business interruption (lost revenue) in September 2018.   The insurance carrier\nsubsequently disclaimed coverage for the losses and we filed a complaint against the carrier alleging that it breached\nthe insurance policy by denying coverage. We also filed legal claims against the seller, its parent company, and the\ngeneral contractor to recover damages arising from defective construction of the building, including defects that\nresulted in water damage as well as other defects. In addition, the general contractor impleaded into that litigation\nseveral subcontractors who performed work on the property. Management expects to recover some portion of the cost\nincurred to repair the property through the litigations and/or settlement negotiations with the seller, its parent company,\nthe general contractor, the subcontractors, and the insurance carrier, although the amount of damages that may be\nrecoverable in litigation and/or potential settlement negotiations are uncertain at this time, as is the timing of receipt of\nany such payments. We continue to pursue all legal remedies.   We incurred significant cash outflows for costs\nassociated with these repairs and remediation, which commenced in September 2019 and were completed as of\nDecember 31, 2021.  \n(4) 250 North 10th Street. As of December 31, 2022, through a joint venture, we owned a 10% interest in the entity\nformed to acquire and operate 250 North 10th Street, a 234-unit apartment building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New\nYork. We sold our interest to our JV Partner in February 2023, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1.2 million\nafter repayment of our Partner Loan.  \nLease Expirations\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have two retail leases at our Paramus property with 77,000 square feet of leased space with\nannualized rent of $638,000 per year.  The lease of the outparcel building expired in March 2023, and the lease for the\nprimary building expires in March 2024.  We also have a retail lease at the 237 11th property with 2,006 square feet of\nleased space with annualized rent of $130,000 per year that expires in 2027, a second retail lease at the 237 11th property\nwith 1,074 square feet of leased space with average annualized rent of $94,506 per year that expires in 2036 and a third\nretail lease at the 237 11th property with 2,208 square feet of leased space with average annualized rent of $153,366 per\nyear that expires in 2032.  We also have a retail lease at 77 Greenwich with 1,061 square feet of leased space with an\naverage annualized rent of $88,085 per year that expires in 2032.

Our largest asset is a property\nlocated at 77 Greenwich Street in Lower Manhattan (“77 Greenwich”), which is nearing completion   as a mixed-use\nproject consisting of a 90-unit residential condominium tower, retail space and a New York City elementary school. We\nalso own a 105-unit, 12-story multi-family property located at 237 11th Street in Brooklyn, New York (“237 11th”), as well\nas a property occupied by a retail tenant in Paramus, New Jersey. In February 2023, we sold our 10% interest in a joint\nventure that owned a multifamily property at 250 North 10th Street, Brooklyn, New York. See Item 2. Properties above for\na more detailed description of our properties that were owned at December 31, 2022. In addition to our real estate portfolio,\nwe also control a variety of intellectual property assets focused on the consumer sector, a legacy of our predecessor, Syms\nCorp. (“Syms”). We also had approximately $275.8 million of federal net operating loss carry forwards (“NOLs”) at\nDecember 31, 2022, which can be used to reduce our future taxable income and capital gains.\nLiquidity and Going Concern; Management’s Plans; Recent Developments\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related matters, including government actions, shifts in residential consumer sentiment and\nchanges to the broader and local economies, had a significant adverse impact on our business.  More recently, the economic\ndownturn, increased interest rates and high inflation have also impacted our business.  While we believe many of these\ntrends will reverse or stabilize, and the New York City economy and residential real estate markets have generally seen\ncontinued improvement in 2022 and to date in 2023, given our focus on New York City residential real estate, our business\nhas been particularly impacted.  As of December 31, 2022, we had total cash and restricted cash of $22.1 million, of which\napproximately $1.6 million was cash and cash equivalents and approximately $20.5 million was restricted cash.

Management is\nexploring opportunities to secure additional funding through the sale of assets, refinancings of outstanding indebtedness,\nand equity or debt financings or other sources.  The Company also continues to explore a range of strategic and financing\nalternatives to maximize stockholder value, and to engage with parties that have expressed interest in the Company’s\nattributes and assets and may see the Company as a potential vehicle for growth, with potential opportunities to recapitalize\nthe Company at a lower cost of capital.  The Company has engaged our Advisors in connection with our strategic review\nprocess and to assist us in identifying and evaluating potential alternatives.  Potential strategic alternatives that may be\nevaluated include securing an equity and/or debt financing of the Company, refinancing of existing debt, and/or a sale or\nmerger or reverse merger of the Company.  The Company is also in discussions with its lenders regarding the deferment of\nupcoming interest, amortization and other payment obligations for the period ending March 31, 2023 and going forward.\n The Company is also exploring a refinancing of the debt in respect of 237 11th.  Given the current environment there can\nbe no assurance that we will be able to enter into any of the contemplated or future extensions, amendments or waivers\nwith our lenders, raise additional capital, refinance indebtedness or enter into other financing arrangements or engage in\nasset sales or strategic partnerships sufficient to fund our cash needs, on terms satisfactory to us, if at all.  Further, in the\nevent that market conditions preclude our ability to consummate such transactions, we will be required to evaluate\nadditional alternatives in restructuring our business and our capital structure, including but not limited to filing for\nbankruptcy protection or seeking an out-of-court restructuring of our liabilities. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note\n1 to our consolidated financial statements and of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nWhile construction at 77 Greenwich has taken longer than projected due to the impacts of COVID-19 and supply-chain\nissues over the past years, and the impact of the pandemic and broader economic conditions have impeded the sale of\nresidential condominium units at 77 Greenwich, we continue to sign and close contracts for our residential condominium\nunits, including five units since December 31, 2022. The units that remain available to be sold are larger, higher floor\nunits.  The substantial majority of the construction is completed with amenity spaces and punch-list items anticipated to be\ncompleted by April 30, 2023.\nBusiness and Growth Strategies\nHistorically, our primary business objective has been to maximize the risk adjusted, time adjusted return on investment in\nour portfolio of properties and new acquisitions and investments across all points of the economic cycle. Our strategies to\nachieve this objective have recently included (i) the sale and closing of residential condominium units at 77 Greenwich and\nthe development, redevelopment, repositioning and potential disposition of our legacy retail property in Paramus, New\nJersey; (ii) identifying additional acquisition and investment opportunities, including high-quality, multi-family real estate\nin New York City; (iii) entering into joint ventures in respect of attractive properties; and (iv) enhancing our capital\nstructure.   We are currently focused on exploring a range of strategic and financing alternatives to maximize stockholder\nvalue, which may include securing additional equity or debt financings, refinancings of existing debt, and/or a sale or\nmerger of the Company.\nImpact of COVID-19\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price have been and may continue to be adversely\nimpacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 and resulting restrictions and such impact could continue to be material.  The\nextent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact the Company’s business, operations and financial results in the future\nwill depend on numerous evolving factors that the Company is not able to predict at this time, including, but not limited to,\nthe impact on sales of residential condominium units at 77 Greenwich, which has been material; the impact on the timing\nfor construction of 77 Greenwich; and the impact on the timing of the 237 11th litigation due to backlog in the New York\nCity court system and the slowdown in judicial proceedings.  With the implementation of COVID-19 vaccination programs\nand companies encouraging employees to return to the office, more potential tenants are moving back into New York City,\nwhich has resulted in an increase in face rents and a reduction in concessions.  Notwithstanding these broader market\ntrends, signs of distress, including discounted sales prices and debt workouts, in the New York City investment market\nhave been almost non-existent over the past several years. Multi-family property sales transaction volumes increased in\n2022 and 2021 compared to 2020 and properties have been sold at record prices, although market conditions continue to\nfluctuate."

The project was approximately 95% complete at December 31, 2022. As of March 1, 2023, we\nhad received TCOs for 100% of the residential units. As of December 31, 2022, we had closed on the sale of 28 residential\ncondominium units at 77 Greenwich, at an aggregate gross sales price of $63.6 million, and as of March 31, 2023 we had\nclosed on five additional residential condominium units at an aggregate gross sales price of $13.7 million. Other units are\nunder contract that are expected to close in the coming months. Units that closed during 2022 and 2021 were generally\nlower priced, smaller units on the building’s lower floors, many of which entered into contract during the height of the\npandemic.

The increase in total rental\nrevenues and its related components was due to higher occupancy, higher base rents and fewer rent concessions at 237 11th\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 which was due to completion of\nremediation of the construction related defects.  \nOther income, which consisted mainly of the SCA construction supervision fee, decreased by approximately $173,000 to\n$182,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $355,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of a\nreduction in the SCA’s construction.\nSales of residential condominium units at 77 Greenwich increased by approximately $13.6 million to $37.3 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022 from $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.  We closed on 14 residential\ncondominium units in each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.  Units that we closed during 2022 and 2021\nwere generally lower priced, smaller units on the building’s lower floors, many of which entered into contract during the\nheight of the pandemic.\nProperty operating expenses decreased by approximately $1.4 million to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31,\n2022 from $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was principally due to expenses associated\nwith 237 11th, including approximately $2.5 million in lower remediation related costs incurred during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting completion of remediation efforts by\nDecember 31, 2021, which was partially offset by less capitalized operating costs at 77 Greenwich.   Property operating\nexpenses consisted primarily of expenses incurred for utilities, payroll, COVID-19 related supplies and general operating\nexpenses as well as repairs and maintenance and leasing commission at 237 11th and 77 Greenwich, and to a lesser extent\nexpenses related to the Paramus, New Jersey property.\nReal estate tax expense increased by approximately $1.0 million to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022\nfrom $724,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021.  This increase was mainly due to less capitalized real estate tax\nexpenses for 77 Greenwich for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by approximately $621,000 to $5.7 million for the year ended December\n31, 2022 from $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

The\ndecrease in gross interest expense was mainly due to overall lower average borrowings during the year ended December\n31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 from the on-going paydown of the 77 Mortgage Loan and\nrepayment of the Berkley Partner Loan, partially offset by higher overall interest rates on our loans after December 31,\n2021.\nInterest expense - amortization of deferred finance costs increased approximately $932,000 to $2.4 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022 from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was principally due to\nless capitalized amortization of finance costs for our loans and secured line of credit as part of residential condominium\nunits for sale, partially offset by the write-off of deferred finance costs related to the refinancing of the 237 11th Loans that\nwe closed on in September 2021.\nWe recorded a $288,000 tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $265,000 for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders decreased by approximately $115,000 to $20.7 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 from $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.  This is a result of the changes discussed\nabove, principally due to the sale of The Berkley, increased rental revenue and lower property operating expenses at 237\n11th due to the completion of the remediation work by the end of 2021, 100% occupancy at 237 11th by the end of\nDecember 31, 2022, an increase in our equity in net income in our joint ventures, a larger unrealized gain on warrants and\nour net profit on the sale of residential condominium units at 77 Greenwich partially offset by increased operating and\ninterest expenses at 77 Greenwich.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related matters, including government actions, shifts in residential consumer sentiment and\nchanges to the broader and local economies, had a significant adverse impact on our business.  More recently, the economic\ndownturn, increased interest rates and high inflation have also impacted our business.  While we believe many of these\ntrends will reverse or stabilize, and the New York City economy and residential real estate markets have generally seen\ncontinued improvement in 2022 and to date in 2023, given our focus on New York City residential real estate, our business\nhas been particularly impacted, and may continue to be, as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  \nWe currently expect that our principal sources of funds to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements for\nworking capital and repayments of outstanding indebtedness and other costs will include some or all of the following:\n(1)\nnet proceeds from divestitures of properties or interest in properties;\n(2)\nproceeds from new debt financings, increases to existing debt financings and/or other forms of secured or\nunsecured debt financing;\n(3)\nproceeds from equity or equity-linked offerings, including rights offerings or convertible debt or equity or equity-\nlinked securities issued in connection with debt financings;\n(4)\ncash on hand; and\n(5)\ncash flow from operations.\nCash flow from operations is primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the net effective rental rates\nachieved on our leases, the collectability of rent, operating escalations and recoveries from our tenants and the level of\noperating and other costs which will be affected by inflation and rising interest rates, among other factors.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had total cash and restricted cash of $22.1 million, of which approximately $1.6 million was\ncash and cash equivalents and approximately $20.5 million was restricted cash.

We currently anticipate that the\nproceeds available under the 77 Mortgage Loan, together with equity funded by us to date, will be sufficient to close out\nthe construction project at 77 Greenwich without us making any further cash contributions.\nCash Position\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations, debt service,\namortization and maturities and corporate expenses over the next 12 months, unless we are able to extend or refinance our\nmaturing debt and raise additional capital, creating substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nManagement is exploring opportunities to secure additional funding through the sale of assets, refinancings of outstanding\nindebtedness, and equity or debt financings or other sources.  The Company also continues to explore a range of strategic\nand financing alternatives to maximize stockholder value, and to engage with parties that have expressed interest in the\nCompany’s attributes and assets and may see the Company as a potential vehicle for growth, with potential opportunities to\nrecapitalize the Company at a lower cost of capital.   The Company has engaged our Advisors in connection with our\nstrategic review process and to assist us in identifying and evaluating potential alternatives.  Potential strategic alternatives\nthat may be evaluated include securing an equity and/or debt financing of the Company, refinancing of existing debt,\nand/or a sale or merger or reverse merger of the Company.  The Company is also in discussions with its CCF Lender\nregarding the deferral of near term payment obligations, and recently agreed to a 60-day extension of the maturity of its\nsecured line of credit.  The Company is also exploring a refinancing of the debt in respect of 237 11th.  Given the current\nenvironment there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into extensions, amendments and/or waivers with our\nlenders, raise additional capital, refinance indebtedness or enter into other financing arrangements or engage in asset sales\nor strategic partnerships sufficient to fund our cash needs, on terms satisfactory to us, if at all.  Further, in the event that\nmarket conditions preclude our ability to consummate such transactions, we will be required to evaluate additional\nalternatives in restructuring our business and our capital structure, including but not limited to filing for\nbankruptcy protection or seeking an out-of-court restructuring of our liabilities. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note\n1 to our consolidated financial statements and of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nCorporate Credit Facility\nIn December 2019, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Corporate Credit Facility” or “CCF”) with an affiliate of a\nglobal institutional investment management firm as initial lender (the “CCF Lender”) and Trimont Real Estate Advisors,\nLLC, as administrative agent (the “Corporate Facility Administrative Agent”), pursuant to which the CCF Lender agreed to\nextend us credit in multiple draws aggregating $70.0 million, subject to increase by $25.0 million upon satisfaction of\ncertain conditions and the consent of the CCF Lender. The CCF matures on December 19, 2024, subject to extensions until\nDecember 19, 2025 and June 19, 2026, respectively, under certain circumstances. The CCF provided for the proceeds of\nthe Corporate Credit Facility to be used for investments in certain multi-family apartment buildings in the greater New\nYork City area and certain non-residential real estate investments approved by the CCF Lender in its reasonable discretion,\nas well as in connection with certain property recapitalizations and in specified amounts for general corporate purposes and\nworking capital. The CCF bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) 5.25% and (ii) a scheduled interest rate\n(the “Cash Pay Interest Rate”) based on six-month periods from the initial closing date, which Cash Pay Interest Rate, from\nthe Closing Date until the six-month anniversary of the initial closing date initially equaled 4.0% and increases by 125\nbasis points in each succeeding six-month period, subject to increase during the extension periods. A $2.45 million\ncommitment fee was payable 50% on the initial draw and 50% as amounts under the CCF are drawn, with any remaining\nbalance due on the last date of the draw period, and a 1.0% exit fee is payable in respect of CCF repayments. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, we had paid $1.85 million of the commitment fee. The CCF may be prepaid at any time subject to a\nprepayment premium on the portion of the CCF being repaid.\nAt December 31, 2022, the CCF had an outstanding balance of $35.75 million, excluding deferred finance fees of $1.3\nmillion, and an effective interest rate of 9.875%.

We borrowed $133.1 million on the closing\ndate of the 77 Mortgage Loan and the balance of the funds used to repay the construction facility were obtained from an\nincrease in the Mezzanine Loan, the Berkley Partner Loan and funds raised through the Private Placement.  At loan closing\nin October 2021, $33.6 million was available to be used to, among other things, complete construction of 77 Greenwich\nand fund carry costs while the residential condominium units are being sold, $30.6 million of such amount had been drawn\nby December 31, 2022.  The $3.0 million additional amount remained undrawn at December 31, 2022.  \nThe 77 Mortgage Loan has a two-year term with an option to extend for an additional year, if the loan balance is $70.0\nmillion or less and we purchase a new interest rate cap.  The 77 Mortgage Loan is secured by the Mortgage Borrower’s fee\ninterest in 77 Greenwich.

As advances of the 77\nMortgage Loan are made to Mortgage Borrower and the outstanding principal balance of the 77 Mortgage Loan increases,\nnet proceeds from the sales of condominium units will be paid to 77 Mortgage Lender to reduce the outstanding balance of\nthe 77 Mortgage Loan. A 1% per annum fee (the “Additional Unused Fee”) on a $3.0 million portion (the “Additional\nAmount”) of the 77 Mortgage Loan, is payable on a monthly basis on the undrawn portion of such Additional Amount.

Mortgage Borrower was required to achieve completion of the construction work\nand the improvements for the Project on or before July 1, 2022, subject to certain exceptions.  In November 2022, we\namended the 77 Mortgage Loan to, amongst other things, extend the Final Completion date to September 29, 2023 and\neliminate the liquidity requirement. At that time, we drew down $3.0 million under the letter of credit to fund an interest\nreserve and $1.0 million to pay down the PIK balance. The 77 Mortgage Loan Agreement also includes additional\ncustomary affirmative and negative covenants for loans of this type, with the first sales pace covenant in April 2023.\n Based on sales closed through March 31, 2023, we met this sales covenant.  \nIn connection with the 77 Mortgage Loan Agreement, we entered into guarantees with the 77 Mortgage Lender pursuant to\nwhich we guaranteed the completion and payment of costs and expenses related to the construction; the payment of\naccrued and unpaid interest and other fees, costs, expenses and payments due and payable with respect to the 77 Mortgage\nLoan or 77 Greenwich; and the payment when due of all amounts due to 77 Mortgage Lender, as a result of “bad-boy”\nprovisions. Mortgage Borrower and the Company also entered into an environmental compliance and indemnification\nundertaking for the benefit of 77 Mortgage Lender.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the 77 Mortgage Loan had been paid down by approximately $47.8 million of proceeds from\nclosed sales of residential condominium units to a balance of $120.5 million, which includes $4.7 million in PIK interest.  \nAs of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants of the 77 Mortgage Loan.  \nMezzanine Loan\nIn December 2020, we entered into a mezzanine loan agreement with an affiliate of the CCF Lender (the “Mezzanine Loan\nAgreement”, and the loan thereunder, the “Mezzanine Loan”).  The Mezzanine Loan was originally in the amount of $7.5\nmillion and has a term of three years with two one-year extension options, exercisable under certain circumstances. The\ncollateral for the Mezzanine Loan was the borrower’s equity interest in its direct, wholly-owned subsidiary. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the blended interest rate for the 77 Greenwich Construction Facility and the Mezzanine Loan was\n10.2% on an annual basis. Interest on the Mezzanine Loan is not payable on a monthly basis but instead is automatically\nadded to the unpaid principal amount on a monthly basis (and therefore accrues interest) and is payable in full on the\nmaturity date of the Mezzanine Loan. Upon final repayment of the Mezzanine Loan, a MOIC will be due on substantially\nthe same terms as provided for in the CCF. Subject to the prior sentence the Mezzanine Loan may be prepaid in whole or in\npart, without penalty or premium (other than payment of the MOIC amount, if applicable, as provided above), upon prior\nwritten notice to the lender under the Mezzanine Loan. In connection with the Mezzanine Loan, the Company entered into\na completion guaranty, carry guaranty, equity funding guaranty, recourse guaranty and environmental indemnification\nundertaking.\nIn October 2021, the Mezzanine Loan Agreement was amended and restated to, among other things, (i) increase the\namount of the loan thereunder by approximately $22.77 million, of which $0.77 million reflected interest previously\naccrued under the original Mezzanine Loan, (ii) reflect the pledge of the equity interests in the Mortgage Borrower to the\nMezzanine"

Additionally, the existing completion guaranty, carry guaranty, recourse\nguaranty and environmental indemnification executed in connection with the original Mezzanine Loan Agreement were\namended to conform to the mortgage guarantees and mortgage environmental indemnity made in connection with the 77\nMortgage Loan (and the existing equity funding guaranty was terminated).   In November 2022, the Mezzanine Loan was\namended to, amongst other things, extend the Final Completion date to September 29, 2023 and eliminate the liquidity\nrequirement.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Mezzanine Loan had a balance of $30.3 million and accrued interest totaled approximately\n$5.8 million.   See Note 11 – Loans Payable and Secured Line of Credit to our consolidated financial statements for further\ndiscussion.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Mezzanine Loan.\n237 11th Loans\nIn June 2021, we entered into a $50.0 million senior loan (the “237 11th Senior Loan”) and a $10 million mezzanine loan\n(the “237 11th Mezz Loan” and together with the 237 11th Senior Loan, the “237 11th Loans”), provided by Natixis, bearing\ninterest at a blended rate of 3.05% per annum. The LIBOR-based floating rate 237 11th Loans have an initial term of two\nyears and three one-year extension options. The first extension option is not subject to satisfaction of any financial tests but\nrequires a new interest rate cap be purchased by the Company.  $1.5 million of the 237 11th Senior Loan proceeds were\ninitially held back by Natixis to cover debt service and operating expense shortfalls, as well as leasing related costs, but\nwere drawn down in 2022.  There was an outstanding balance of $50.0 million on the 237 11th Senior Loan and $10.0\nmillion on the 237 11th Mezz Loan at December 31, 2022.  We are currently exploring a potential refinancing of our 237\n11th Loans.\nFrom time to time, properties that we own, acquire or develop may experience defects, including concealed defects, or\ndamage due to natural causes, defective workmanship or other reasons. In these situations, we pursue our rights and\nremedies as appropriate with insurers, contractors, sellers and others. Due to water damage in apartment units and other\nproperty at 237 11th resulting from construction defects which we believe were concealed by the prior ownership team and\nits contractor, we submitted a notice of claim to our insurance carrier for property damage and business interruption (lost\nrevenue) in September 2018.   The insurance carrier subsequently disclaimed coverage for the losses and we filed a\ncomplaint against the carrier alleging that it breached the insurance policy by denying coverage.  We also filed legal claims\nagainst the seller, its parent company, and the general contractor to recover damages arising from defective construction of\nthe building, including defects that resulted in water damage as well as other defects. In addition, the general contractor has\nimpleaded into that litigation several subcontractors who performed work on the property. Management expects to recover\nsome portion of the cost incurred to repair the property through the litigations and/or settlement negotiations with the seller,\nits parent company, the general contractor, the subcontractors, and the insurance carrier, although the amount of damages\nthat may be recoverable in litigation and/or potential settlement negotiations are uncertain at this time, as is the timing of\nreceipt of any such payments.  We continue to pursue all legal remedies.  We incurred significant cash outflows for costs\nassociated with these repairs and remediation, which commenced in September 2019 and was completed by December 31,\n2021.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants of the 237 11th Loans, except for the minimum\nliquidity requirement.  The lender has agreed in principle to waive this requirement through the initial maturity date of the\nloan of July 9, 2023 and the parties are working on documentation.\nThe Berkley Loan\nWe owned a 50% interest in a joint venture formed to acquire and operate The Berkley. On February 28, 2020, in\nconnection with a refinancing, The Berkley acquisition loan was repaid in full and was replaced with a new 7-year, $33.0\nmillion loan (the “New Berkley Loan”) which bore interest at a fixed rate of 2.717% and was interest only during the initial\nfive years. In connection with the sale of The Berkley in April 2022, the New Berkley Loan was repaid in full and retired."

The loan bore interest at a rate of 10% per year,\nwith a portion deferred until maturity.  This loan had a balance of $10.1 million when it was repaid in full in April 2022 in\nconnection with the sale of The Berkley.\nSecured Line of Credit\nOur $11.75 million line of credit with Webster Bank (formerly known as Sterling National Bank) is secured by the\nParamus, New Jersey property, and guaranteed by Trinity Place Holdings Inc.  The secured line of credit, which was\nscheduled to mature on March 23, 2023, was extended to May 22, 2023.  The Paramus property had been under contract\nfor sale pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement, which was subject to site plan approval. The agreement was terminated\nby the buyer in January 2023.  The Company is in discussions with the lender regarding a further extension. The secured\nline of credit bears interest at the prime rate.  The secured line of credit is pre-payable at any time without penalty. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the secured line of credit had an outstanding balance of $9.75 million and an effective interest rate of\n7.5%.  \n250 North 10th Note\nWe owned a 10% interest in a joint venture with TF Cornerstone (the “250 North 10th JV”) formed to acquire and operate\n250 North 10th, a 234-unit apartment building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York. In January 2020, the 250 North 10th\nJV closed on the acquisition of the property through a wholly-owned special purpose entity for a purchase price of $137.75\nmillion, of which $82.75 million was financed through a 15-year mortgage loan (the “250 North 10th Note”) secured by\n250 North 10th and the balance was paid in cash. Our share of the equity totaling approximately $5.9 million was funded\nthrough a loan (the “Partner Loan”) from our joint venture partner. The Partner Loan bore interest at 7.0% and was\nprepayable any time within its four year term.  We sold our interest in 250 N 10th Avenue to our joint venture partner in\nFebruary 2023 resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1.2 million after repayment of our Partner Loan and release\nfrom the mortgage guaranty.\nPrivate Placement Transaction and Rights Offering\nIn October 2021, we entered into a private placement agreement with certain existing shareholders (“Investors”), pursuant\nto which we issued to the Investors an aggregate of 2,539,473 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.90 per share,\nand we received gross proceeds of $4.8 million, which closed on the same day.\nIn December 2021, we closed on a common stock rights offering to existing shareholders at a price of $1.90 per share,\nwhich resulted in the issuance of 903,576 shares of our common stock and we received gross proceeds of $1.7 million.\nAt-The-Market Equity Offering Program\nIn August 2021, we entered into an \"at-the-market\" equity offering program (the “ATM Program”), to sell up to an\naggregate of $10.0 million in shares of our common stock.\nWe sold no shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2022.  During the year ended December 31,\n2021, we sold 701,327 shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $1.4 million (excluding\napproximately $169,000 in professional and brokerage fees) at a weighted average price of $1.95 per share.  \nThe ATM Program is currently unavailable as a result of the late filing of the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nfor the second quarter of 2022.  The Company currently anticipates it will become available again later in 2023."

This increase was mainly\ndue to the less capitalized costs at 77 Greenwich this year compared to last year, and an increase in accounts payable and\naccrued expenses of $1.3 million over the same period last year, partially offset by a larger decrease in prepaid expenses\nand other assets, net and receivables of approximately $2.6 million compared to the same period last year.\nNet cash provided by investing activities increased by approximately $17.5 million to $17.3 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 from net cash used of $140,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net cash\nprovided by investing activities was due to $17.4 million in net proceeds from the closing on the sale of The Berkley in\nApril 2022.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased by approximately $51.6 million to $21.5 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 from net cash provided of $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net\ncash used in financing activities primarily relates to the approximate $38.3 million of loan paydowns from the 77\nGreenwich Mortgage Loan from the proceeds of residential condominium sales, the $10.1 million payoff of the Berkley\nPartner Loan after the sale of The Berkley, and a $3.0 million net paydown of the Secured Line of Credit, partially offset by\n$2.3 million less in net borrowings from the loans and secured line of credit this period compared to the same period last\nyear as well as $7.6 million from the sale of common stock in 2021.\nNet Operating Losses\nWe believe that our U.S. federal NOLs as of the emergence date of the Syms bankruptcy were approximately $162.8\nmillion and believe our U.S. federal NOLs as of December 31, 2022 were approximately $275.8 million.  In connection\nwith the conveyance of the school condominium to the SCA, we applied approximately $11.6 million of federal NOLs\nagainst taxable capital gains of approximately $18.5 million.  Since 2009 through December 31, 2022, we have utilized\napproximately $20.1 million of the federal NOLs.\nBased on management’s assessment, it is more likely than not that the entire deferred tax assets will not be realized by\nfuture taxable income or tax planning strategies. Accordingly, a valuation allowance of $78.3 million was recorded as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\nWe believe that certain of the transactions that occurred in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy in September\n2012, including the rights offering and the redemption of the Syms shares owned by the former majority shareholder of\nSyms in accordance with the Plan, resulted in us undergoing an “ownership change,” as that term is used in Section 382 of\nthe Code. However, while the analysis is complex and subject to subjective determinations and uncertainties, we believe\nthat we should qualify for treatment under Section 382(l)(5) of the Code. As a result, we believe that our NOLs are not\nsubject to an annual limitation under Section 382. However, if we were to undergo a subsequent ownership change in the\nfuture, our ability to utilize our NOLs could be subject to limitation under Section 382. In addition, the TCJA limited the\ndeductibility of NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 to 80 percent of taxable income (computed\nwithout regard to the net operating loss deduction) for the taxable year. However, the CARES Act suspended the 80%\nlimitation on the use of NOLs for tax years beginning before January 1, 2021, and allowed losses arising in taxable years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021 to be carried back up to five years.\nEven if all of our regular U.S. federal income tax liability for a given year is reduced to zero by virtue of utilizing our\nNOLs, we may still be subject to state, local or other non-federal income taxes.\nOur certificate of incorporation includes a provision intended to help preserve certain tax benefits primarily associated with\nour NOLs. This provision generally prohibits transfers of stock that would result in a person or group of persons becoming\na 4.75% stockholder, or that would result in an increase or decrease in stock ownership by a person or group of persons that\nis an existing 4.75% stockholder."

      "text": "Table of Contents\n32\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated\nfinancial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of\nestimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Actual results\ncould differ from these estimates. A summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in Note 2 – Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting\npolicies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this\nreport. Certain of the accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are particularly\nimportant for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations presented in the historical consolidated\nfinancial statements included in this report and require the application of significant judgment by management and, as a\nresult, are subject to a degree of uncertainty.\nCritical Accounting Policies\na.\nReal Estate - Real estate assets are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. All costs\nrelated to the improvement or replacement of real estate properties are capitalized. Additions, renovations and\nimprovements that enhance and/or extend the useful life of a property are also capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary\nmaintenance, repairs and improvements that do not materially prolong the useful life of an asset are charged to\noperations as incurred.   Depreciation and amortization are determined using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful lives as described in the table below:  \nCategory\n    Terms\nBuildings and improvements\n \n10 - 39 years\nTenant improvements\n \nShorter of remaining term of the lease or useful life\nFurniture and fixtures\n \n5 - 8 years\nb.\nResidential Condominium Units for Sale - We capitalize certain costs related to the development and redevelopment of\nreal estate including initial project acquisition costs, pre-construction costs and construction costs for each specific\nproperty. Additionally, we capitalize operating costs, interest, real estate taxes, insurance and compensation and related\ncosts of personnel directly involved with the specific project related to real estate that is under development.\nCapitalization of these costs begin when the activities and related expenditures commence, and cease as the\ncondominium units receives its temporary certificates of occupancy (“TCOs”).  \n77 Greenwich is a condominium development project which includes residential condominium units that are ready for\nsale.  Residential condominium units for sale as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 includes 77 Greenwich, and in all\ncases, excludes costs of development for the residential condominium units at 77 Greenwich that were sold.  The\nresidential condominium units for sale are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Management considers\nrelevant cash flows relating to budgeted project costs and estimated costs to complete, estimated sales velocity,\nexpected proceeds from the sales of completed condominium units, including any potential declines in market values,\nand other available information in assessing whether the 77 Greenwich development project is impaired.  Residential\ncondominium units are evaluated for impairment based on the contracted and projected sales prices compared to the\ntotal estimated cost to construct. Any calculated impairments are recorded immediately in cost of sales.  No provision\nfor impairment was recorded for our unsold residential condominium units at either December 31, 2022 or 2021,\nrespectively.\nc.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets - We periodically review long-lived assets for impairment whenever changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We consider relevant cash\nflow, management’s strategic plans and significant decreases, if any, in the market value of the asset and other\navailable information in assessing whether the carrying value of the assets can be recovered. When such events occur,\nwe compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows, excluding interest\ncharges, from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If this comparison indicates an impairment, the carrying\namount would then be compared to the estimated fair value of the long-lived asset. An impairment loss would be\nmeasured as the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its estimated fair value. We"

We provide a valuation allowance for deferred\ntax assets for which we do not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not.\nASC 740-10-65 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return\nshould be recorded in the financial statements. Under ASC 740-10-65, we may recognize the tax benefit from an\nuncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the\ntaxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements\nfrom such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of\nbeing realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740-10-65 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification,\ninterest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and increased other disclosures. As of both\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, we had determined that no liabilities are required in connection with unrecognized tax\npositions. As of December 31, 2022, our tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2018 through December 31,\n2021 are subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service. Our state returns are open to examination for the years\nDecember 31, 2017 or 2018 through December 31, 2021, depending on the jurisdiction.\ne.\nRevenue Recognition – Leases with tenants are accounted for as operating leases. Minimum rents are recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the term of the respective lease, beginning when the tenant takes possession of the space. The\nexcess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in deferred\nrents receivable. In addition, retail leases typically provide for the reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance and\nother property operating expenses. As lessor, when reporting revenue, we have elected to combine the lease and non-\nlease components of our operating lease agreements and account for the components as a single lease component in\naccordance with ASC Topic 842.  Lease revenues and reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance and other property\noperating expenses are presented in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income as\n“rental revenues.”  Also, these reimbursements of expenses are recognized within revenue in the period the expenses\nare incurred. We assess the collectability of our accounts receivable related to tenant revenues. We applied the\nguidance under ASC 842 in assessing our lease payments: if collection of rents under specific operating leases is not\nprobable, then we recognize the lesser of that lease’s rental income on a straight-line basis or cash received, plus\nvariable rents as earned. Once this assessment is completed, we apply a general reserve, as provided under ASC 450-\n20, if applicable.  \nRevenues on sale of residential condominiums reflects the gross sales price from sales of residential condominium\nunits which are recognized at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the units are transferred\nto the buyer. Our performance obligation, to deliver the agreed-upon condominium, is generally satisfied in less than\none year from the original contract date. Cash proceeds from unit closings held in escrow for our benefit are included\nin restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheets. Customer cash deposits on residential condominiums that are in\ncontract are recorded as restricted cash and the related liability is recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses\nin our consolidated balance sheets. Our cost of sales consists of allocated expenses related to the initial acquisition,\ndemolition, construction and development of the condominium complex, including associated building costs,\ndevelopment fees, as well as salaries, benefits, bonuses and share-based compensation expense, including other\ndirectly associated overhead costs, in addition to qualifying interest and financing costs.   See b. Residential\nCondominium Units for Sale above.\nf.\nStock-Based Compensation – We have granted stock-based compensation, which is described below in Note 13 –\nStock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation-\nStock Compensation,” which establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services and\nASU No. 2018-07, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based\nPayment Accounting,” which provides additional guidance related to share-based payment transactions for acquiring"

Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of\nDecember 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as a result\nof the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement evaluated its internal controls over financial reporting and found them to not be effective.  Other than in\nconnection with the material weakness described below, there were no changes in our internal control over financial\nreporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the\nperiod from October 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially\naffect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPreviously Reported Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that\nthere is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be"

There was also a restatement on\nthe statement of cash flows from investing activities to operating activities related to this error. Our management\ncommunicated the results of its assessment to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. \nAs disclosed in Item 4. “Controls and Procedures” of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending\nMarch 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, we previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial\nreporting related to an error identified in connection with the classification of a property as real estate under development\nwhich was not subsequently reported as an operating property when circumstances at the property changed, resulting in the\nincorrect capitalization of certain costs.\nManagement is in the process of remediating the material weakness and believes that the consolidated financial statements,\nand related notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material aspects, the\nCompany’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.\nRemediation\nWe have commenced measures to remediate the identified material weaknesses. We performed additional procedures to\nensure the properties we own are properly classified as either an operating property or property under development, and\nthat we are capitalizing the appropriate amount of internally allocated construction related costs related to the development\nproject at 77 Greenwich Street.  Until the material weakness is remediated, we will continue to perform additional analysis\nand other post-closing procedures to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S.\nGAAP. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until management designs and implements effective\ncontrols that operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are\neffective.\nItem 9B.     OTHER INFORMATION\nNone.\nItem 9C.     DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\nNone.\nPART III\nItem 10.     DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nWe maintain a code of ethics applicable to our Principal Executive Officer and senior financial and professional personnel\n(including our Principal Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer or controller and persons performing similar\nfunctions).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations\nand its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern Uncertainty\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As\ndiscussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has loans with varying debt maturities during the next 12 months\nfor which there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to refinance or extend the maturity dates of the loans. This condition raises\nsubstantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding this matter are also described in\nNote 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part\nof our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an\nopinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles\nused and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to\nthe consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a\ncritical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to\nwhich it relates."

Residential\ncondominium units for sale are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and evaluated for impairment based on the contracted and\nprojected sales prices compared to the total estimated cost to construct. The Company tests the recoverability of the residential condominium\nunits for sale whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate those amounts may not be recoverable. The Company identified\nimpairment indicators and performed an impairment assessment on residential condominium units for sale.\nWe identified the assessment of impairment of residential condominium units for sale as a critical audit matter due to the subjectivity and\ncomplexity of management’s judgments in the future cash flow projections, including expected sales proceeds from the sale of completed\ncondominium units. Auditing management’s determination of the expected sales proceeds from the sale of completed condominium units\nused in the cash flow projections involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to\naddress these matters, including the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n- Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s determination of the expected sales proceeds from the sale of completed condominium\nunits.\n- Using personnel with specialized skill and knowledge in valuation to assist in evaluating management’s determination of the expected sales\nproceeds from the sale of completed condominium units.\n/s/ BDO USA, LLP\nNew York, New York\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2003.\nMarch 31, 2023"

Our largest asset is currently a property located at 77 Greenwich Street in Lower\nManhattan (“77 Greenwich”), which is nearing completion as a mixed-use project consisting of a 90-unit residential condominium tower,\nretail space and a New York City elementary school. We also own a 105-unit, 12-story multi-family property located at 237 11th Street in\nBrooklyn, New York (“237 11th”), and, through a joint venture, a 10% interest in a 234-unit multi-family property at 250 North 10th street in\nBrooklyn, New York (“250 North 10th”) that we sold to our joint venture partner in February 2023, as well as a property occupied by a retail\ntenant in Paramus, New Jersey.\nWe also control a variety of intellectual property assets focused on the consumer sector, a legacy of our predecessor, Syms Corp. (“Syms”),\nincluding FilenesBasement.com, our rights to the Stanley Blacker® brand, as well as the intellectual property associated with the Running of\nthe Brides® event and An Educated Consumer is Our Best Customer® slogan. In addition, we had approximately $275.8 million of federal\nnet operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) at December 31, 2022, which can be used to reduce our future taxable income and capital gains.\nSquare footage, leased occupancy percentage and residential unit disclosures in the notes to consolidated financial statements are unaudited.\nLiquidity and Going Concern; Management’s Plans; Recent Developments\nOur financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going\nconcern, which contemplate the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.   The COVID-19 pandemic\nand related matters, including government actions, shifts in residential consumer sentiment and changes to the broader and local economies,\nhad a significant adverse impact on our business.  More recently, the economic downturn, increased interest rates and high inflation have also\nimpacted our business.   As of December 31, 2022, we had total cash and restricted cash of $22.1 million, of which approximately $1.5\nmillion was cash and cash equivalents and approximately $20.5 million was restricted cash. We also had $2.0 million available under our\nsecured line of credit at December 31, 2022, which has since been drawn.  The Company’s cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to\nfund the Company’s operations, debt service, amortization and maturities and corporate expenses over the next 12 months, unless we are able\nto extend or refinance our maturing debt and raise additional capital, creating substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going\nconcern. Management is exploring opportunities to secure additional funding through the sale of assets, refinancings of outstanding\nindebtedness, and equity or debt financings or other sources.  The Company also continues to explore a range of strategic and financing\nalternatives.   Potential strategic alternatives that may be evaluated include securing an equity and/or debt financing of the Company,\nrefinancing of existing debt, and/or a sale or merger or reverse merger of the Company.  The Company is also in discussions with its lenders\nregarding the deferment of upcoming interest, amortization and other payment obligations for the period ending March 31, 2023 and going\nforward.  The Company is also exploring a refinancing of the debt in respect of 237 11th.  Given the current environment there can be no\nassurance that we will be able to enter into any of the contemplated or future extensions, amendments or waivers with our lenders, raise\nadditional capital, refinance indebtedness or enter into other financing arrangements or engage in asset sales or strategic partnerships\nsufficient to fund our cash needs, on terms satisfactory to us, if at all.  Further, in the event that market conditions preclude our ability to\nconsummate such transactions, we will be required to evaluate additional alternatives in restructuring our business and our capital structure,\nincluding but not limited to filing for bankruptcy protection or seeking an out-of-court restructuring of our liabilities.\nWhile construction at 77 Greenwich has taken longer than projected and the impact of the pandemic and broader economic conditions have\nimpeded the sale of residential condominium units at 77 Greenwich, we continue to sign and close contracts for our residential condominium\nunits, including five units since December 31, 2022.\nThe financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any uncertainty as to our ability to continue as\na going concern."

      "text": "Table of Contents\nF-8\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\na.    Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries which are or\nwere wholly-owned or controlled by us. Entities which we do not control through our voting interest and entities which are variable\ninterest entities, but where we are not the primary beneficiary, are accounted for under the equity method. Accordingly, our share of\nthe earnings or losses of our unconsolidated joint ventures, The Berkley, which was sold in April 2022, and 250 North 10th, are\nincluded in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income (see Note 14 – Investments in\nUnconsolidated Joint Ventures for further information). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been\neliminated.\nWe are required to consolidate a variable interest entity (the “VIE”) in which we are considered the primary beneficiary. The\nprimary beneficiary is the entity that has (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic\nperformance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant\nto the VIE. As of December 31, 2022, we concluded that 250 North 10th continues to be a VIE.  Due to our lack of control and no\nequity at risk, we determined that we are not the primary beneficiary and we accounted for this investment under the equity method\n(see Note 15 – Subsequent Events for sale of our interest in our joint venture. \nWe assess the accounting treatment for joint venture investments, which includes a review of the joint venture or limited liability\ncompany agreement to determine which party has what rights and whether those rights are protective or participating. For potential\nVIEs, we review such agreements in order to determine which party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly\nimpact the entity’s economic performance. In situations where we and our partner equally share authority, we do not consolidate the\njoint venture as we consider these to be substantive participation rights that result in shared power of the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the performance of the joint venture. Our joint venture agreements may contain certain protective rights such as\nrequiring partner approval to sell, finance or refinance the property and the payment of capital expenditures and operating\nexpenditures outside of the approved budget or operating plan.\nb.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - We account for our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, namely, The\nBerkley, which was sold in April 2022, and 250 North 10th, under the equity method of accounting (see Note 14 - Investments in\nUnconsolidated Joint Ventures for further information). We also assess our investments in our unconsolidated joint ventures for\nrecoverability, and if it is determined that a loss in value of an investment is other than temporary, we write down the investment to\nits fair value. We evaluate each equity investment for impairment based on each joint ventures' projected cash flows. No provision\nfor impairment was recorded for the value of our equity investments at either December 31, 2022 or 2021.\nc.   Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates (see Note 2g. for\nfurther discussion).\nd.    Reportable Segments - We operate in one reportable segment, commercial real estate.\ne.    Concentrations of Credit Risk - Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash\nand cash equivalents. We hold substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents in banks. Such cash balances at times exceed\nfederally insured limits.\nf.     Real Estate - Real estate assets are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. All costs related to the\nimprovement or replacement of real estate properties are capitalized. Additions, renovations and improvements that enhance and/or\nextend the useful life of a property are also capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance, repairs and improvements that do\nnot materially prolong the useful life of an asset are charged to operations as incurred.   Depreciation and amortization are\ndetermined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as described in the table below:\nCategory\n     Terms\nBuildings and improvements\n \n10 - 39 years\nTenant improvements\n \nShorter of remaining term of the lease or useful life\nFurniture and fixtures\n \n5 - 8 years"

Capitalization of these costs begin when the activities and\nrelated expenditures commence, and cease as the condominium units receives its temporary certificates of occupancy (“TCOs”).  \n77 Greenwich is a condominium development project which includes residential condominium units that are ready for sale.\n Residential condominium units for sale as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 includes 77 Greenwich, and in all cases, excludes costs\nof development for the residential condominium units at 77 Greenwich that were sold.  The residential condominium units for sale\nare stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Management considers relevant cash flows relating to budgeted project costs\nand estimated costs to complete, estimated sales velocity, expected proceeds from the sales of completed condominium units,\nincluding any potential declines in market values, and other available information in assessing whether the 77 Greenwich\ndevelopment project is impaired.   Residential condominium units are evaluated for impairment based on the contracted and\nprojected sales prices compared to the total estimated cost to construct. Any calculated impairments are recorded immediately in\ncost of sales.  No provision for impairment was recorded for our unsold residential condominium units at either December 31, 2022\nor 2021.\nh.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets - We periodically review long-lived assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We consider relevant cash flow, management’s strategic\nplans and significant decreases, if any, in the market value of the asset and other available information in assessing whether the\ncarrying value of the assets can be recovered. When such events occur, we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the\nundiscounted expected future cash flows, excluding interest charges, from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If this\ncomparison indicates an impairment, the carrying amount would then be compared to the estimated fair value of the long-lived asset.\nAn impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its estimated fair\nvalue. We considered all the aforementioned indicators of impairment for our real estate and condominium units for sale for the\nyears ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and no provision for impairment was recorded during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 or 2021, respectively.\ni.\nFair Value Measurements - We determine fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820, “Fair\nValue Measurement,” for financial assets and liabilities. This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value\nand requires certain disclosures.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or\nderived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These\nvaluation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price\ntransparency for the instruments or market and the instruments’ complexity. Assets and liabilities disclosed at fair value are\ncategorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Hierarchical levels, which\nare defined by ASC 820-10-35, are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to the fair valuation of\nthese assets and liabilities. Determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment\nand we evaluate our hierarchy disclosures each quarter.\nLevel 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets\nand liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other\ninputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3 - Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting management’s own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available\nassumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\nj.     Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include securities with original maturities of three months or less when\npurchased.\nk.       Restricted Cash  - Restricted cash represents amounts required to be restricted under our loan agreements, letter of credit (see\nNote  11  - Loans Payable and Secured Line of Credit for further information), deposits on residential condominium sales at 77\nGreenwich, condominium sales proceeds that have not yet been transferred to the lender and tenant related security deposits."

Minimum rents are recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the term of the respective lease, beginning when the tenant takes possession of the space. The excess of rents recognized\nover amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in deferred rents receivable. In addition, retail leases\ntypically provide for the reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance and other property operating expenses. As lessor, when\nreporting revenue, we have elected to combine the lease and non-lease components of our operating lease agreements and account\nfor the components as a single lease component in accordance with ASC Topic 842.  Lease revenues and reimbursement of real\nestate taxes, insurance and other property operating expenses are presented in the consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive (loss) income as “rental revenues.”  Also, these reimbursements of expenses are recognized within revenue in the\nperiod the expenses are incurred. We assess the collectability of our accounts receivable related to tenant revenues. We applied the\nguidance under ASC 842 in assessing our lease payments: if collection of rents under specific operating leases is not probable, then\nwe recognize the lesser of that lease’s rental income on a straight-line basis or cash received, plus variable rents as earned. Once this\nassessment is completed, we apply a general reserve, as provided under ASC 450-20, if applicable.  \nRevenues on sale of residential condominiums reflects the gross sales price from sales of residential condominium units which are\nrecognized at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the units are transferred to the buyer. Our performance\nobligation, to deliver the agreed-upon condominium, is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date. Cash\nproceeds from unit closings held in escrow for our benefit are included in restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheets.\nCustomer cash deposits on residential condominiums that are in contract are recorded as restricted cash and the related liability is\nrecorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets. Our cost of sales consists of allocated\nexpenses related to the initial acquisition, demolition, construction and development of the condominium complex, including\nassociated building costs, development fees, as well as salaries, benefits, bonuses and share-based compensation expense, including\nother directly associated overhead costs, in addition to qualifying interest and financing costs.  See also g. Residential Condominium\nUnits for Sale above.\nm. Stock-Based Compensation – We have granted stock-based compensation, which is described below in Note 12 – Stock-Based\nCompensation. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award on that date, and is\nexpensed at the grant date (for the portion that vests immediately) or ratably over the related vesting periods.   Shares that are\nforfeited are added back into the pool of shares available under the Stock Incentive Plan, see Note 13 – Stock-Based Compensation,\nPlan, and any recorded expense related to forfeited shares are reversed in the year of forfeiture.\nn.\nIncome Taxes - We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as required by the provisions of ASC 740, “Income\nTaxes.” Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and\ntax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are\nexpected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which we do not consider realization of such assets\nto be more likely than not.\nASC 740-10-65 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be\nrecorded in the financial statements. Under ASC 740-10-65, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if\nit is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits\nof the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest\nbenefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740-10-65 also provides\nguidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and increased other\ndisclosures. As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had determined that no liabilities are required in connection with\nunrecognized tax positions. As of December 31, 2022, our tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2018 through December 31,\n2021 are subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service. Our state returns are open to examination for the years December 31,\n2017 or 2018 through December 31, 2021, depending on the jurisdiction.\nWe are subject to certain federal, state and local income and franchise taxes.\no.    Earnings (loss) Per Share - We present both basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed\nby dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock\noutstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other\ncontracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock, where such exercise or conversion would result in\na lower per share amount. 7,179,000 warrants exercisable at $4.31 per share were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings\n(loss) per share because the awards would have been antidilutive for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.  Shares issuable\nat December 31, 2022 comprising 238,060 restricted stock units that have vested but not yet settled were excluded from the\ncomputation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because the awards would have been antidilutive for the year ended December"

These costs are being\noffset against loans payable and secured line of credit in the consolidated balance sheets for mortgage financings and had an\nunamortized balance of $2.1 million and $5.1 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Costs for our corporate credit\nfacility are being offset against corporate credit facility, net, in the consolidated balance sheets and had an unamortized balance of\n$1.3 million and $2.9 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Unamortized deferred finance costs are expensed when\nthe associated debt is refinanced with a new lender or repaid before maturity. Costs incurred in seeking financing transactions which\ndo not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not close.\nq.    Deferred Lease Costs – Deferred lease costs consist of fees and direct costs incurred to initiate and renew retail operating leases and\nare amortized to depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the related non-cancelable lease term. Lease costs\nincurred under our residential leases are expensed as incurred.\nr.     Underwriting Commissions and Costs – Underwriting commissions and costs incurred in connection with our stock offerings are\nreflected as a reduction of additional paid-in-capital in stockholders’ equity.\ns.\nReclassifications - Certain reclassifications have been made to enhance comparability and consistency with the current period\npresentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations.\nAccounting Standards Updates\nRecently Adopted Accounting and Reporting Guidance\nIn July 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Updated (“ASU”) No. 2021-05 Leases\n(Topic 842) Lessors - Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments. ASU 2021-05 amends the lease classification requirements for lessors\nwhen classifying and accounting for a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on a reference rate index or a rate. The update\nprovides criteria, that if met, the lease would be classified and accounted for as an operating lease. ASU 2021-05 is effective for reporting\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2022 and it did not have a material impact on\nthe Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), changing the impairment model for\nmost financial instruments by requiring companies to recognize an allowance for expected losses, rather than incurred losses. The ASU will\napply to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans,\navailable-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases, and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. The Company has\nadopted this standard effective January 1, 2023. The adoption of this standard primarily applied to the valuation of the Company’s accounts\nreceivable. Implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04).\nASU 2020-04 provides companies with optional guidance to ease the potential accounting burden associated with transitioning away from\nreference rates that are expected to be discontinued. This guidance is effective beginning on March 12, 2020, and all entities may elect to\napply the amendments prospectively through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Deferral of the Sunset\nDate of Topic 848, to extend the temporary accounting rules under Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company\nis currently evaluating the impact of these accounting standards updates but do not expect that the adoption of ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2022-\n06 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNOTE 3 – RESIDENTIAL CONDOMINIUM UNITS FOR SALE\nResidential condominium units for sale as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 includes 77 Greenwich, and in all cases, excludes costs of\ndevelopment for the residential condominium units at 77 Greenwich that were sold.   Closings on residential condominium units started in\nSeptember 2021 with 14 closings having occurred through December 31, 2021 and an additional 14 closings during the year ended December\n31, 2022."

Due to water damage\nin apartment units and other property at 237 11th resulting from construction defects, we submitted a notice of claim to our insurance carrier\nfor property damage and business interruption (lost revenue) in September 2018.  The insurance carrier subsequently disclaimed coverage for\nthe losses and we filed a complaint against the carrier alleging that it breached the insurance policy by denying coverage. We also filed legal\nclaims against the seller, its parent company, and the general contractor to recover damages arising from the defective construction.

The CARES Act also accelerated the\nability of corporations to recover AMT credits, permitting a full refund for tax years 2018 and 2019. Additionally, the CARES Act included\nprovisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferral of employer side social security payments, modifications to the net interest\ndeduction limitations, increased limitations on qualified charitable contributions, and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for\nqualified improvement property. It also appropriated funds for the SBA Paycheck Protection Program loans that are forgivable in certain\nsituations to promote continued employment, as well as Economic Injury Disaster Loans to provide liquidity to small businesses harmed by\nCOVID-19.\nPursuant to the tax legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"TCJA\") of 2017, corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) credit\ncarryforwards are eligible for a 50% refund in tax years 2018 through 2020, and beginning in tax year 2021, any remaining AMT credit\ncarryforwards are 100% refundable. As a result of these new rules, we had recorded a tax benefit and refund receivable of $3.1 million in\nconnection with our valuation allowance release. We received approximately $1.6 million of the refund receivable in October 2019 and the\nbalance of approximately $1.5 million became fully refundable in 2020 as a result of the CARES Act, and was received in July 2020."

The gain resulting from the conveyance of the school\ncondominium to the SCA was fully offset by our available NOL carryforward.  Since 2009 through December 31, 2022, we have utilized\napproximately $20.1 million of our federal NOLs.  As of December 31, 2022, we also had state NOLs of approximately $193.8 million.\nThese state NOLs have various expiration dates through 2021, if applicable.

Fair value is defined as the price that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe guidance requires disclosure of the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall, including\nmeasurements using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), quoted prices for similar instruments in active\nmarkets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active (Level 2), and significant valuation assumptions\nthat are not readily observable in the market (Level 3).\nThe fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and other liabilities approximated their\ncarrying value because of their short-term nature. The fair value of the consolidated loans payable, Corporate Credit Facility, the secured line\nof credit and note payable approximated their carrying values as they are variable-rate instruments under Level 1.  The warrant liability is\nrecorded at fair value under Level 2.\nOn an annual recurring basis, we are required to use fair value measures when measuring plan assets of our pension plans. As we elected to\nadopt the measurement date provisions of ASC 715, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,”\nas of March 4, 2007, we are required to determine the fair value of our pension plan assets as of December 31, 2022. The fair value of\npension plan assets was $12.6 million at December 31, 2022. These assets are valued in active liquid markets under Level 2."

In the event we terminate the plan, we intend that any such termination would be a standard\ntermination. We have not taken any steps to commence such a termination and currently have no intention of terminating the pension plan.  In\naccordance with minimum funding requirements and court ordered allowed claims distributions, we paid approximately $6.1 million to the\nSyms sponsored plan from September 17, 2012 through December 31, 2022.

We\nentered into an amendment in November 2022, which eliminated the minimum liquidity requirement.\nThe CCF had an outstanding balance of $35.75 million at both December 31, 2022 and 2021, excluding deferred finance fees of $1.3 million\nand $2.9 million, respectively.  Accrued interest, which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses, totaled approximately $6.1\nmillion at December 31, 2022, of which approximately $419,000 was paid during the first week of January 2023, and $3.8 million at\nDecember 31, 2021, of which approximately $413,000 was paid during the first week of January 2022.  We are in discussions with the CCF\nLender regarding the deferment of upcoming interest payments and a $7.0 million amortization payment due on May 1, 2023.    As of\nDecember 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants of the CCF.\nThe CCF bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) 5.25% and (ii) a scheduled interest rate of 4% (the “Cash Pay Interest\nRate”) which increases by 0.125% every six-month period from the Closing Date, subject to increase during the extension periods.

As of December 31, 2022, we had paid $1.85 million of the commitment fee.  With\nthe reduction in the committed amount under the CCF, no further commitment fee is due.  The CCF may be prepaid at any time subject to a\nprepayment premium on the portion of the CCF being repaid. The CCF is subject to certain mandatory prepayment provisions, including that,\nsubject to the terms of the mortgage loan documents applicable to the Company’s 77 Greenwich property, 90% or 100% of the net cash\nproceeds of residential condominium sales, depending on the circumstances, and 70% of the net cash proceeds of retail condominium sales at\nthe Company’s 77 Greenwich property shall be used to repay the CCF.

The collateral for the CCF consists of (i) 100%\nof the equity interests in our direct subsidiaries, to the extent such a pledge is permitted by the organizational documents of such subsidiary\nand any financing agreements to which such subsidiary is a party, (ii) our cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash and cash\napplied toward certain liquidity requirements under existing financing arrangements, and (iii) other non-real estate assets of ours, including\nintellectual property.\nThe CCF provides that we and our subsidiaries must comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including restrictions on debt,\nliens, business activities, equity repurchases, distributions and dividends, disposition of assets and transactions with affiliates, as well as\nfinancial covenants regarding corporate loan to value and net worth. Under the CCF, we are permitted to repurchase up to $2.0 million of our\ncommon stock pursuant to board approved programs with CCF proceeds, $1.5 million with other sources of cash and otherwise subject to the\nconsent of the required lenders. The CCF also provides for certain events of default, including cross-defaults to our other loans, and for a\nguaranty of the CCF obligations by our loan party subsidiaries.\nPursuant to the terms of the CCF, so long as the CCF is outstanding and the CCF Lender is owed or holds greater than 50% of the sum of (x)\nthe aggregate principal amount of the balance outstanding and (y) the aggregate unused commitments, the CCF Lender will have the right to\nappoint one member to our and each of our subsidiary’s board of directors or equivalent governing body (the “Designee”).

The 77 Greenwich\nConstruction Facility had an aggregate balance of $159.4 million at the time it was repaid in full at closing of the 77 Mortgage Loan.  We\nborrowed $133.1 million on the closing date of the 77 Mortgage Loan and the balance of the funds used to repay the facility were obtained\nfrom an increase in the Mezzanine Loan, the Berkley Partner Loan as well as funds raised through the Private Placement.   At loan closing in\nOctober 2021, $33.6 million was available to be used to, among other things, complete construction of 77 Greenwich and fund carry costs\nwhile the residential condominium units are being sold.  \nThe 77 Mortgage Loan has a two-year term, maturing on October 1, 2023, with an option to extend for an additional year, if the loan balance\nis $70.0 million or less and we purchase a new interest rate cap.  The 77 Mortgage Loan is secured by the Mortgage Borrower’s fee interest in\n77 Greenwich. The 77 Mortgage Loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) 7.00% in excess of LIBOR and (ii) 7.25%;\nprovided that, if, on April 22, 2023, the outstanding principal balance of the 77 Mortgage Loan, together with any accrued and unpaid PIK\nInterest and unpaid Additional Unused Fee (as those terms are defined below) is equal to or greater than $91.0 million, the rate per annum\nwill be equal to the greater of (i) 9.00% in excess of LIBOR and (ii) 9.25%. If cash flow from 77 Greenwich (including proceeds from the\nsales of residential condominium units) is insufficient to pay interest payments when due, any accrued but unpaid interest will remain unpaid\nand interest will continue to accrue on such unpaid amounts (“PIK Interest”) until the cumulative PIK Interest and Additional Unused Fee\naccrues to $4.5 million (the “Threshold Amount”), after which all such amounts in excess of the Threshold Amount shall be paid in cash on a\nmonthly basis until such amounts are less than the Threshold Amount. As advances of the 77 Mortgage Loan are made to Mortgage Borrower\nand the outstanding principal balance of the 77 Mortgage Loan increases, net proceeds from the sales of condominium units will be paid to 77\nMortgage Lender to reduce the outstanding balance of the 77 Mortgage Loan. A 1% per annum fee (the “Additional Unused Fee”) on a $3.0\nmillion portion (the “Additional Amount”) of the 77 Mortgage Loan, is payable on a monthly basis on the undrawn portion of such\nAdditional Amount. To the extent the 77 Mortgage Loan is not fully funded by October 22, 2022 (April 22, 2023 in the case of amounts with\nrespect to construction work related to the new handicapped accessible subway entrance on Trinity Place), 77 Mortgage Lender may in its\ndiscretion force fund the remaining balance other than the Additional Amount into a reserve account held by 77 Mortgage Lender and\ndisbursed in accordance with the terms of the 77 Mortgage Loan Agreement. The 77 Mortgage Lender elected to force fund the 77 Mortgage\nLoan in October 2022.  The 77 Mortgage Loan is prepayable without penalty, subject to 77 Mortgage Lender receiving a minimum total\nreturn of $15.26 million, or if an advance has been made of the Additional Amount, the sum of $15.26 million, plus 10% of the Additional\nAmount that has been disbursed, in each case, inclusive of interest and fees, and must be prepaid in part in certain circumstances such as in\nthe event of the sale of residential and retail condominium units. Mortgage Borrower is required to achieve completion of the construction\nwork and the improvements for the Project on or before July 1, 2022, subject to certain exceptions. The 77 Mortgage Loan Agreement also\nincludes additional customary affirmative and negative covenants for loans of this type, with the first sales pace covenant in April 2023.\n Based on sales closed through March 31, 2023, we met this sales covenant.  In November 2022, we amended the 77 Mortgage Loan to,\namongst other things, extend the Final Completion date to September 29, 2023 and eliminate the liquidity requirement. At that time, we drew\ndown $3.0 million under the letter of credit to fund an interest reserve and $1.0 million to pay down the PIK balance. The Company\ndetermined that the 77 Mortgage Loan was considered a troubled debt restructuring due to a decrease in the post restructuring effective\ninterest rate. The Company determined that the 77 Mortgage Loan will be treated as a modification with no gain or loss recognized during the\nyear ended December 31, 2022 as the carrying amount of the loan was not greater than the respective undiscounted cash flows of the\nmodified loan.\nIn connection with the 77 Mortgage Loan Agreement, we entered into guarantees with the 77 Mortgage Lender pursuant to which we\nguaranteed the completion and payment of costs and expenses related to the construction; the payment of accrued and unpaid interest and\nother fees, costs, expenses and payments due and payable with respect to the 77 Mortgage Loan or 77 Greenwich; and the payment when"

Mortgage Borrower and the Company also entered into an\nenvironmental compliance and indemnification undertaking for the benefit of 77 Mortgage Lender.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the 77 Mortgage Loan had a balance of $120.5 million, which includes $4.7 million in PIK interest.  In 2022, the\n77 Mortgage loan was paid down by approximately $47.8 million through closed sales of residential condominium units.  As of December\n31, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants under the 77 Mortgage Loan.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had received our TCOs for the condominium units on floors 11-35 (except the units noted below), lobby, Cloud\nClub (lounge, terrace, game room, dining room, kitchen and kids play room), mechanical rooms, and portions of the cellar (including the bike\nand storage rooms.)  As of March 1, 2023, we had received TCOs for 100% of the residential units.  Upon the granting of our first TCO in\nMarch 2021 and having 16 units under contract, our offering plan was declared effective.    In connection with the December 2020\namendment, we paid down $8.0 million of the 77 Greenwich Construction Facility and funded certain reserves to the lender, a portion of\nwhich was funded by a release of certain cash collateral and the balance of which was funded by the Mezzanine loan (see below).\nMezzanine Loan\nIn December 2020, we entered into a mezzanine loan agreement with an affiliate of the CCF Lender (the “Mezzanine Loan Agreement”, and\nthe loan thereunder, the “Mezzanine Loan”).  The Mezzanine Loan was originally for the amount of $7.5 million and has a term of three years\nwith two one-year extension options, exercisable under certain circumstances. The collateral for the Mezzanine Loan was the borrower’s\nequity interest in its direct, wholly-owned subsidiary, which owns 100% of the equity interests in the borrower under the 77 Greenwich\nConstruction Facility. At closing the blended interest rate for the 77 Greenwich Construction Facility and the Mezzanine Loan, assuming the\n77 Greenwich Construction Facility and the Mezzanine Loan are fully drawn, was 9.44% on an annual basis. As of December 31, 2022, the\nblended interest rate was 10.2%.  Interest on the Mezzanine Loan is not payable on a monthly basis but instead is automatically added to the\nunpaid principal amount on a monthly basis (and therefore accrues interest) and is payable in full on the maturity date of the Mezzanine\nLoan. Upon final repayment of the Mezzanine Loan, a MOIC will be due on substantially the same terms as provided for in the CCF. The\nMezzanine Loan may not be prepaid prior to prepayment in full of the 77 Greenwich Construction Facility, but if the 77 Greenwich\nConstruction Facility is being prepaid in full, the Mezzanine Loan may be prepaid simultaneously therewith. Subject to the prior sentence the\nMezzanine Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part, without penalty or premium (other than payment of the MOIC amount, if applicable, as\nprovided above), upon prior written notice to the lender under the Mezzanine Loan. In connection with the Mezzanine Loan, the Company\nentered into a completion guaranty, carry guaranty, equity funding guaranty, recourse guaranty and environmental indemnification\nundertaking substantially consistent with the Company’s existing guarantees made to the 77 Greenwich Lender in connection with the 77\nGreenwich Construction Facility.\nIn October 2021, the Mezzanine Loan Agreement was amended and restated to, among other things, (i) increase the amount of the loan\nthereunder by approximately $22.77 million, of which $0.77 million reflects interest previously accrued under the original Mezzanine Loan,\n(ii) reflected the pledge of the equity interests in the Mortgage Borrower to the Mezzanine Lender as additional collateral for the Mezzanine\nLoan and (iii) conform certain of the covenants to those included in the 77 Mortgage Loan Agreement, as applicable. Additionally, the\nexisting completion guaranty, carry guaranty, recourse guaranty and environmental indemnification executed in connection with the original\nMezzanine Loan Agreement were amended to conform to the mortgage guarantees and mortgage environmental indemnity made in\nconnection with the 77 Mortgage Loan (and the existing equity funding guaranty was terminated). In November 2022, we amended the\nMezzanine Loan Agreement to, amongst other things, extend the Final Completion date to September 29, 2023 and eliminate the liquidity\nrequirement.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Mezzanine Loan had a balance of $30.3 million and accrued interest totaled approximately $5.8 million.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Mezzanine Loan.\n237 11th Loans\nIn May 2018, in connection with the acquisition of 237 11th, we entered into two-year interest-only financings with an aggregate principal\namount of $67.8 million, which was comprised of a $52.4 million mortgage loan and a $15.4 million mezzanine loan. The mezzanine loan\nwas repaid in full in February 2020.   In June 2021, we repaid the mortgage loan’s balance of $56.4 million in full and paid an exit fee of\n$567,000.  \nSimultaneously, in June 2021, in connection with the refinancing of the mortgage loan, we entered into a $50.0 million senior loan (the “237\n11th Senior Loan”) and a $10 million mezzanine loan (the “237 11th Mezz Loan” and together with the 237 11th Senior Loan, the “237 11th\nLoans”), provided by Natixis, bearing interest at a blended rate of 3.05% per annum.

The first extension option is not subject to satisfaction of any financial tests,\nbut requires a new interest rate cap be purchased by the Company.  $1.5 million of the 237 11th Senior Loan proceeds were initially held back\nby Natixis to cover debt service and operating expense shortfalls, as well as leasing related costs.  \nIn December 2022, we amended the 237 11th Loans to allow for the funding of the undrawn operating expense shortfall holdback, force fund\nthe undrawn portion of the leasing related costs and convert the loan benchmark from LIBOR to SOFR. The Company determined that the\n237 11th Loans are considered a troubled debt restructuring due to a decrease in the post restructuring effective interest rate. The Company\ndetermined that the 237 11th Loans will be treated as modifications with no gain or loss recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022\nas the carrying amount of each loan was not greater than the respective undiscounted cash flows of the modified loans.  As of December 31,\n2022, there was an outstanding balance of $50.0 million on the 237 11th Senior Loan and $10.0 million on the 237 11th Mezz Loan.  We are\ncurrently exploring a potential refinancing of our 237 11th Loans.\nIn June 2021, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement as required under the 237 11th Loans. The interest rate cap agreement provided\nthe right to receive cash if the reference interest rate rose above a contractual rate. We paid a premium of approximately $32,500 for the 2.5%\ninterest rate cap on the 30-day LIBOR rate on a notional amount of $60.0 million. The interest rate cap matures in July 2023.  We did not\ndesignate this interest rate cap as a hedge and are recognizing the change in estimated fair value in interest expense.\nThe 237 11th Loans require us to comply with various customary affirmative and negative covenants and provide for certain events of default,\nthe occurrence of which would permit the lender to declare the 237 11th Loans due and payable, among other remedies. As of December 31,\n2022, we were in compliance with the covenants of the 237 11th Loans, except for the minimum liquidity requirement.  The lender has agreed\nin principle to waive this requirement through the initial maturity date of the loan of July 9, 2023 and the parties are working on\ndocumentation.\nThe Berkley Partner Loan\nIn October 2021, we entered into a loan agreement with our partner in The Berkley JV, pursuant to which our partner agreed to lend us up to\n$10.5 million principal amount, $500,000 of which is available only to be applied to interest payments, secured by our interest in the joint\nventure entity, maturing in one year. The loan bore interest at a rate of 10% per year, with a portion deferred until maturity.  This loan had a\nbalance of $10.1 million when it was repaid in full in April 2022 in connection with the sale of the Berkley.  \nSecured Line of Credit\nOur $11.75 million secured line of credit is secured by the Paramus, New Jersey property.  The secured line of credit, which was scheduled to\nmature on March 23, 2023, was extended to May 22, 2023.  The Paramus property had been under contract for sale pursuant to a purchase\nand sale agreement, which was subject to site plan approval.  The agreement was terminated by the buyer in January 2023.  The Company is\nin discussions with the lender regarding a further extension. The secured line of credit bears interest at the prime rate. The secured line of\ncredit is pre-payable at any time without penalty. This secured line of credit had an outstanding balance of $9.75 million and $12.75 million\nat December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and an effective interest rate of 7.5% and 3.25% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\nNote Payable (250 North 10th Note)\nWe owned a 10% interest in a joint venture with TF Cornerstone (the “250 North 10th JV”) formed to acquire and operate 250 North 10th, a\n234-unit apartment building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York.  On January 15, 2020, the 250 North 10th JV closed on the acquisition of\nthe property through a wholly-owned special purpose entity. Our share of the equity totaling approximately $5.9 million was funded through\na loan (the “Partner Loan”) from our joint venture partner. The Partner Loan had a balance of $5.9 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, bore interest at 7.0% and was prepayable any time within its four year term.  We sold our interest in the joint venture to our joint\nventure partner in February 2023.  See also Note 14 – Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures."

On December 22, 2020, the\nCompany entered into the Warrant Agreement Amendment, whereby the exercise price of the warrants issued in connection with the\nCorporate Credit Facility was amended to be $4.50 per share.  In connection with the October 2021 Private Placement, the exercise price of\nthe warrants were further reduced to $4.31 per share (the “Exercise Price”), which is payable in cash or pursuant to a cashless exercise.

The private placement agreement contained customary representations, warranties, covenants,\nconditions and indemnities for agreements of this type.  We also entered into a registration rights agreement with the Investors pursuant to\nwhich it agreed to file a shelf registration statement registering offers and sales of the private placement shares.  The sale of the private\nplacement shares in accordance with the private placement agreement was made in reliance on the exemption from registration of Section\n4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. \nOn December 8, 2021, we consummated our common stock rights offering of 2,650,000 shares of common stock to existing shareholders of\nours on the record date of November 3, 2021, at a price of $1.90 per share.  The consummation of the rights offering resulted in the issuance\nof 903,576 shares of our common stock and we received gross proceeds of $1.7 million.\nAt-The-Market Equity Offering Program\nIn August 2021, we entered into an \"at-the-market\" equity offering program (the “ATM Program”), to sell up to an aggregate of $10.0 million\nin shares of our common stock.  \nWe sold no shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2022.  During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold\n701,327 shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $1.4 million (excluding approximately $169,000 in\nprofessional and brokerage fees) at a weighted average price of $1.95 per share.\nThe ATM Program is currently unavailable as a result of the late filing of the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second\nquarter of 2022.  \nShare Repurchase Program\nIn December 2019, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which we can purchase up to $5.0 million of shares of\nour common stock, which is now subject to the terms of our Corporate Credit Facility.

Any deferred amounts are paid under the SIP (as is non-\nemployee directors’ annual equity compensation that is not deferred). Compensation deferred under the Deferral Program is reflected by the\ngrant of stock units equal to the number of shares that would have been received absent a deferral election. The stock units, which are fully\nvested at grant, generally will be settled under the SIP for an equal number of shares of common stock within 10 days after the participant\nceases to be a director.

On February 28, 2020,\nin connection with a refinancing, the Berkley JV repaid the Berkley Loan in full and replaced it with a new 7-year, $33.0 million loan (the\n“New Berkley Loan”) which bore interest at a fixed rate of 2.717% and was interest only during the initial five years.  We and our joint\nventure partner were joint and several recourse carve-out guarantors under the New Berkley Loan. In October 2021, we entered into a loan\nagreement with our joint venture partner (see Note 11 – Loans Payable and Secured Line of Credit – The Berkley Partner Loan),  which was\nrepaid in full when this property was sold in April 2022 for $70.8 million. In connection with the sale of the property, the Berkley JV\nrecognized a gain on sale of approximately $9.0 million as well as a gain of $2.0 million upon settlement of the underlying interest rate swap.\n \nAs of December 31, 2022 we owned a 10% interest in the 250 North 10th JV formed to acquire and operate 250 North 10th, a 234-unit\napartment building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York.
