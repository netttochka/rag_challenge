      "text": "Chairman’s Report\nDear Shareholder\nThe year under review has been exceptional from many\npoints of view and the Company now has a suite of assets,\nwhich we consider to be above average with a number of\nthem being individual company makers in their own right.\nKalahari Copperbelt: Botswana\nWe reported during May 2021 that we have completed\nour processing, interpretation and drill target selection of\nthe helicopter geophysical fly-over of the Kalahari licences\nand that a number of the concessions have favourable\nresults, producing the typical signature that warrants further\ninvestigation.\nWe announced in September 2021 that we completed\nthe conditional sale of approximately 50% of our licences to\nSandfire Resources Limited (“Sandfire”), with a deferred\npayment of up to US$80 million should any of the projects\nproduce certain levels of contained copper. On completion\nof this agreement, Sandfire agreed to pay Galileo\nUS$1.5 million of cash and issue 370,477 Sandfire ordinary\nshares, which at the time were worth approximately\nUS$1.8 million. Sandfire agreed to an aggressive two-year\nexploration budget of US$4 million, and these work\nprogrammes are currently underway. Sandfire has had\nconsiderable success with its own exploration activities and\nis well advanced in constructing its’ first mine in the vicinity\nof licences that Galileo sold to Sandfire.\nWe undertook exploration on our own retained licences,\nand although we did not intercept mineralisation in all\ncases, we intercepted the typical lithology that hosts copper\nand silver mineralisation. We intend to follow up with these\nresults in the 4th quarter of this year.\nGlenover Project: South Africa\nIn February 2022, we announced that we had completed\nthe partial sale of the Glenover assets to Afrimat Limited\n(“Afrimat”) for ZAR 50.7 million (approximately £2.4 million),\nwith the remainder of the sale to be completed or\nabandoned before mid-November 2022. A further interim\npayment of ZAR 10 million (approximately £0.5 million) was\npaid to the company in March 2022 for the sale of vermiculite\nmining rights. Should Afrimat complete the entire transaction,\nGalileo will be due another ZAR 102 million (approximately\n£5.2 million) on completion.\nLuansobe & Shinganda projects: Zambia\nDecember 2021 was a very acquisitive month for the\nCompany in that we acquired the exploration rights to two\nmajor exploration projects in Zambia namely Luansobe and\nShinganda. During the post review period, both of these\nprojects have been subjected to desk re-evaluation, legacy\ncore examination and reinterpretation. I am pleased to say\nat the time of writing this report both projects are showing\nextremely good potential of certainly achieving small mine\nstatus and equally the prospects for a large discovery of\ncopper and possibly gold in the case of Shinganda.\nLithium & Gold projects: Zimbabwe\nIn March 2022, we announced that we entered into a\njoint venture relationship with B.C. Ventures Limited (“BC\nVentures”) for the rights to acquire a 51% interest against\nan expenditure of US$1.5 million for lithium and gold\nexploration properties in Zimbabwe. The agreement also\nallows for BC Ventures to sell up to 29% at a negotiated\nvalue in exchange for Galileo ordinary shares. In August\n2022, we announced that the Company acquired 29% of\nBC Ventures for 50 million Galileo ordinary shares.\nThe Zimbabwean assets are very high in potential and\nwide-ranging\nexploration\nprogrammes\nhave\nalready\ncommenced at both sites. The lithium asset is located\naround the area of the old Kamativi tin mine where the\nmine dumps are known to contain 0.58% lithium oxide. The\nlithium oxide is hosted by pegmatites, often in association\nwith tin and the presence of the same prospective geology\nextending from the Kamativi mine onto our licence is good\nreason for optimism for a new lithium discovery. Post\nbalance sheet we have carried out desk research and\nfieldwork exploration. We have taken a suite of samples\nover a number of target areas and await the assay results.\nAn airborne geophysical survey has already been\nconducted over the area covered by the gold asset, located\nin the vicinity of Bulawayo. Interpreted results are strongly\nsuggestive of greenstone gold terrane and potentially base\nmetal lithology. We intend to generate drill targets and hope\nto drill during the 4th quarter of 2022.\nThese two exploration projects are a very exciting\naddition to the Company’s portfolio, with high potential and\nwe will update the market as the results begin to emerge.\nZimbabwe has expressed its welcome to foreign mining\ncompanies to explore and develop and we look forward to\nestablishing a solid exploration capability in the country.\nStrategic Report –\nChairman’s Report\nANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS – 31 March 2022\n3\nColin Bird\nChairman"

The\npossibility of blasting and the use of large trucks appears to\nbe a limitation on the project, since housing and population\ndensity has increased further since project initiation.\nFerber Project: Nevada USA\nThe Ferber project in the US, remains in good standing\nand we hope to commence a limited drill programme,\nbefore the calendar year end. This programme will\nessentially test the prognosis that a large gold-copper skarn\ndeposit may occur in the project area.\nProspects\nThe small cap sector of the natural resource stock\nmarkets has been the worst I have experienced in my\ncareer and there remains little sign of recovery. This is\ncaused generally by the war in the Ukraine, rampant\ninflation, and other global geopolitical uncertainty.\nAt the time of writing all commodities have come off\ntheir price highs, although there are already signs of\nrecovery, suggesting that the drop off was short lived and\nunlikely to be maintained.\nMany influential commentators in the commodity sector\nare strongly predicting scarcity and thus strong metal prices\nfor those companies engaged in the electric vehicle\nmanufacturing. Recently there have been a number of\nexamples of manufacturers making arrangements and\ncontracts with producers, thereby eliminating the trader.\nThis is unique and strongly suggests that both the EV and\nassociated industries have real concern over sustainable and\nstable supply of critical metals.\nAgainst this background we are convinced that our\nportfolio is very well placed with quality projects in the right\narena. The investor “stand-off” cannot be maintained since\nhistory says that the smaller cap explorers are the call\noption for tomorrow’s metals. That being so, Galileo is\nextremely well placed.\nI would like to thank my fellow directors and\nmanagement of Galileo for their excellent efforts in what\nhas been a unique year, producing an enviable portfolio,\nwhilst – like all small companies – experiencing considerable\nhead winds against progress.\nColin Bird\nChairman\n20 September 2022"

It forms part of the northwestern limb of the\nnorthwest – southeast trending Mufulira syncline and is\nessentially a strike continuation of Mufulira, with copper\nmineralisation hosted in the same stratigraphic horizons. At\nthe Luansobe prospect mineralisation occurs over two\ncontiguous zones, dipping at 20-30 degrees to the\nnortheast, over a strike length of about 3km and to a\nvertical depth of at least 1,250m. Two concurrent\ndevelopment options are being reviewed:\n●\nThe potential for a small open pit mine of circa\n3-5 million tonnes to exploit the up-dip portion of the\ncopper deposit in the northwest of the licence area\n●\nThe prospect for a larger mine to develop the resources\ndown-dip and along strike to the southeast where drill\ndata is more sparse\nThe Company undertook raw data investigation of the\ntechnical information available in relation to the Project and\ndevised an exploration programme to maximise the value\nof the Luansobe Project with a view to completing a Project\nFeasibility Study within 18 months of 20 February 2022.\nPost period under review\nThe Company engaged Addison Mining Services (“AMS”)\nof the UK to assist with compilation of drill data for 154\nholes (drilled 1921 to 2007) and initial 3D modelling of the\ndeposit. Much historic drill core completed at the Luansobe\nCopper Project by Roan Consolidated Mines Ltd (‘RCM’) from\n1950 to 1970 was located in remarkably good condition at\nthe ZCCM-IH archive at Kalulushi on the Copperbelt. In order\nto improve confidence in the historic drill data and to\npotentially identify unsampled/partially sampled mineral\nzones of interest, GeoQuest Consultants of Lusaka was\ncontracted to evaluate the old holes by carrying out\ngeotechnical\nlogging,\ncore\nphotography,\nsummary\ngeological logging, pXRF geochemical screening, core\ncutting and re-sampling of drill core. The pXRF testing of\nhistoric drill core at Luansobe, which is subject to full assay\nchecking, provisionally identified an upper mineralised zone\nof moderate copper grade, with some higher-grade\nintervals, in several holes extending up to 36m in thickness,\nwhich was not previously reported. The newly discovered\nmineralisation is considered by the Company to have the\npotential to add incremental value to an open pit mining\noperation. Core was cut from a number of these new\nintervals for assay testing at a local analytical laboratory.\nAt the Project site, historic drill collars were re-located\nwhich will assist with siting of future confirmatory twin\nholes and infill/extension drilling planned for Q3 2022.\nLuansobe conceptual open pit cross-section, facing NW"

The\nprincipal terms of the agreement are as follows:\n●\nThe option agreement gives Galileo the right to earn an\ninitial 51% interest in the Shinganda copper-gold project\nin central Zambia by spending US$0.5m on exploration\nand evaluation over two years.\n●\nThe Company can subsequently increase its interest\nthrough entering into a Joint Venture to develop a\nmining operation, ranging from 65% interest for a large\ndeposit of greater than 1Mt of contained copper\nequivalent, up to an 85% interest in a smaller deposit\nof less than 200,000 tonnes of contained copper\nequivalent.\nThe project area covers part of a major 10km structural\ntrend (the Gerhard Trend) with two previously developed\nsmall-scale open pit copper-gold mines off the property.\nVery limited historic drilling on the property in 1959 is\nreported to have intersected 1.07% Cu over a true width of\n28.3m at shallow depth within supergene copper oxides.\nNo gold assays were carried out during this phase of\ndrilling. Drilling on the Gerhard Trend structure towards the\nwest of the property by Vale S.A. recorded 2m @ 3.93%\nCu, 1.72g/t Au.\nDuring Q1 2022 Galileo undertook a full review of past\nexploration data and prepared a follow-up programme to\ncomprise grid mapping/prospecting traverses and a\ndetailed ground magnetic survey around the Shinganda\noutcrop area, to be followed by a drilling programme\nfocussed on testing the tenor and extent of the shallow\ncopper/gold mineralisation indicated by previous drilling\nand nearby mining.\nPost period under review\nGalileo completed the planned reconnaissance mapping\nand sampling exercise over the most prospective western\nsector of the exploration licence. A series of north-south\nlines about 1km apart were traversed, covering a total of\nabout 95-line kilometres. The main aim of the survey was\nto characterise the lithology, structure and mineralisation of\nthe licence. Much of the area is covered by a layer of\noverburden and duricrust, nevertheless nine target areas\nwith mineralisation or alteration of interest were identified\nduring mapping. Almost all were artisanal pit working\nexposures with visible copper oxide mineralisation.\nAltogether 27 rock grab samples were collected for copper\nand gold analysis from the exposed rocks, which were\nsubmitted to the SGS laboratory on the Zambian Copperbelt\nfor copper and gold assay.\nAssay results, as shown in Table 1, returned strongly\nanomalous values for copper and gold from many of these,\nincluding 1.42% Cu, 3.14g/t Au from the Shinganda outcrop\nand 1.79% Cu, 10.19g/t Au & 3.77% Cu, 1.24g/t Au from\nother occurrences within the licence area. The outcome of\nthe prospecting, showing the presence of copper and gold\nmineralisation over an area of at least 12km x 6km on the\nShinganda licence, points to the potential for several\nshallow copper-gold deposits on the property or for a\npotentially larger target.\nTable 1 – Shinganda Prospecting Programme – Selected Grab Sample Assay Results\nSample No. Description\nCu%\nAu g/t\nSHR007\nShinganda outcrop area – massive hematite, silicified, with disseminated malachite\n1.42\n3.14\nSHR009\nShinganda outcrop area – semi-massive hematite, weak visible copper mineralisation\n1.78\n0.24\nSHR014\nSouth Pit – description as above\n1.07\n0.29\nSHR016\nSouth Pit – description as above\n0.19\n9.76\nSHR019\nPit near centre of licence – silicified hematite + disseminated malachite\n3.77\n1.24\nSHR023\nPit and outcrop of bleached shale with disseminated malachite\n1.10\n0.63\nSHR025\nSmall artisanal pit – massive hematite, silicified, with disseminated magnetite\n1.79\n10.19\nSHR026\nAs above\n1.28\n6.08"

      "text": "Directors’ Report\nANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS – 31 March 2022\n19\n1. REVIEW OF ACTIVITIES\nPrincipal activities\nGalileo Resources Plc (AIM: GLR) is an opportunity driven\ncompany seeking opportunities for projects where potential\nvalue has not been realised. The current focus is on our\ncopper and zinc projects in Zambia and gold and lithium\nprojects in Zimbabwe.\nBusiness review\nThe function of the business review is to provide a\nbalanced and comprehensive review of the Group’s\nperformance and developments during the year and its\nposition at the year-end. The review also covers the\nprincipal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group. At this\nstage in the Group’s development, the key performance\nindicators that the directors monitor on a regular basis are\nmanagement of liquid resources, which are cash flows and\nbank balances. The results of the Company and the Group\nfor the year are set out in the audited financial statements\non pages 36 to 42.\nA review of the Group’s operations during the year ended\n31 March 2022 and future developments are contained in\nthe Strategic Report on pages 5 to 18.\nFinancial review\nThe Group reported earnings of £1,542,576 (2021:\nearnings of £87,872) before and after taxation. Basic\nearnings are 0.15 pence (2021: earnings of 0.01 pence) per\nshare.\nRisk review\nThe board and the executive committee keep the risks\ninherent in an exploration business under constant review.\nThe principal risks for an exploration company and the\nmeasures taken by the Company to mitigate them are\ndetailed below:\nPolitical risk\nPolitical risk is the risk that assets will be lost through\nexpropriation and unrest or war. The Group minimises\npolitical risk by operating in countries with relatively stable\npolitical systems, established fiscal and mining codes and a\nrespect for the rule of law. The Company has instigated a\nblack economic empowerment policy to comply with the\nSouth African mining charter, code of practice and black\neconomic legislation.\nCommodity risk\nCommodity risk is the risk that the price earned for\nminerals will fall to a point where it becomes uneconomic\nto extract them from the ground and process. The principal\nmetals in the Group’s portfolio are gold, copper, lithium, rare\nearth elements (REEs) and phosphorus (as phosphate). The\nprices of these elements have been volatile during the year\nbut an uptrend is in place. However, commodity prices are\ncyclical and prices are subject to fluctuations. These\nfluctuations could adversely affect the Group’s operations.\nThe potential economics of all the Group’s projects are kept\nunder close review on a regular basis.\nFinancial risk\nThe three main types of financial risk faced by the Group\nare credit risk, liquidity risk and currency risk. Liquidity risk\nis the risk of insufficient working and investment capital.\nThe Group’s goal is to finance its exploration and activities\nfrom operational cash flow from operations but in the\nabsence of such cash flow, and from time to time the Group\nrelies on the issue of equity share capital to finance its\nactivities.\nThe Group finances its overseas operations by purchasing\nUS Dollar, Zambian Kwacha, Botswana Pula and South\nAfrican Rand with Pound Sterling in the United Kingdom and\ntransferring it to meet local operating costs. The Group does\nnot hedge its exposure and is therefore exposed to currency\nfluctuations between these three currencies and local\ncurrencies, but this policy will be reviewed from time to\ntime. The Group maintains tight financial and budgetary\ncontrol to keep its operations cost effective to mitigate\nthese financial risks.\nStrategic risk\nSignificant and increasing competition exists for mineral\nacquisition opportunities throughout the world. As a result\nof this competition, the Group may be unable to acquire\nrights to exploit additional attractive mining properties on\nterms it considers acceptable. Accordingly, there can be no\nassurance that the Group will acquire any interest in\nadditional operations that would yield reserves or result in\ncommercial mining operations. The Group expects to\nundertake sufficient due diligence where warranted, to help\nensure opportunities are subjected to proper evaluation.\nFunding risk\nThe Group has raised funds via equity contributions from\nnew and existing shareholders ensuring the Company\nremains a going concern until such time that it enters an\nofftake\nagreement/debt\nfinancial\narrangement.\nThe\ndirectors regularly review cash flow requirements to ensure\nthe Company can meet financial obligations as and when\nthey fall due.\nDirectors’ Report"

      "text": "Exploration risk\nExploration risk is the risk of investing cash and resources\non projects, which may not provide a return. The Group\naddresses this risk by using its skills, experience and local\nknowledge to select only the most promising areas to\nexplore. Mineral exploration and development of the\nGroup’s mineral exploration properties is speculative in\nnature and is contingent upon obtaining satisfactory\nexploration results. Mineral exploration and development\ninvolve substantial expenses and a high degree of risk,\nwhich even a combination of experience, knowledge and\ncareful evaluation may not be able adequately mitigate. The\ndegree of risk reduces substantially when a Group’s\nproperties move from the exploration phase to the\ndevelopment phase.\nOperational risk\nExploration and subsequent mining operations are\nsubject to hazards normally encountered in exploration,\ndevelopment and production. Although it is intended to take\nadequate precautions during each stage of development to\nminimise risk, there is a possibility of a material adverse\nimpact on the Group’s operations and its financial results.\nThe Group will develop and maintain policies appropriate\nto the stage of development of its various projects.\nRecruiting and retaining skilled and qualified personnel are\ncritical to the Group’s success. The number of persons skilled\nin the acquisition, exploration and development of mining\nproperties is limited and competition for such persons is\nintense. While the Group has good relations with its\nemployees, these relations may be impacted by changes\nin the scheme of labour relations, which may be introduced\nby the relevant governmental authorities. Adverse changes\nin such legislation may have a material adverse effect on\nthe Group’s business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. Members of staff are encouraged to discuss with\nmanagement matters of interest to the employees and\nsubjects affecting day-to-day operations of the Group.\nMining risk\nThere is no guarantee that the minerals contained in the\nvarious assets can be mined either practically, technically\nor at a cost less than the realisable value of the contained\nminerals. The cost of development and access may preclude\nthe development of the mine. Should a mine be developed\nthere is no assurance that operations can continue since\noperations are dependent on product prices, direct\noperating cost and the cost of “stay in business” capital.\nMining operations are often challenged by difficult mining\nand/or slope stability conditions, variability of grade, excess\nwater and small faulting. All of these factors could adversely\naffect mining production rate and therefore profitability.\nProcessing risk\nREEs are relatively difficult to process and require\ncomplex chemistry solutions to gain satisfactory recovery\nand quality. The recovery of one element may be at the\nsacrifice of another rare-earth element and no assurance\ncan be given that the ultimate suite of elements that can be\nrecovered can be done so economically. Should the\nCompany elect to progress to recovery only to concentrate,\nthen there is no assurance that a global market exists for\nthe concentrate. Shareholders and investors should be\naware that the cost of building a rare-earth processing plant\nis considerably higher than other mineral processing plants\nand that the Company may not be able to raise sufficient\nfinance to build such a plant.\nPolitical stability\nThe Group is conducting its activities in Botswana, South\nAfrica, Zambia, Zimbabwe and the United States of America.\nBotswana is one of the most stable and low-risk countries\nin Africa with a long-established mining industry and\nrelatively good infrastructure. It built a tradition of\ndemocratic values which helped maintain political and\nsocial stability. Mining is a significant contributor to\nBotswana’s GDP, and minerals comprise almost 80% of\nexport earnings. Over the last half century, Botswana has\ntransformed itself from a severely impoverished nation to a\nhigh-middle-income country and achieving substantial\nreductions in poverty and rapid improvements in living\nstandards. It has managed its diamond revenues in a\nprudent and transparent manner contributing to sizable\nsavings that can be used to stabilize the economy in case\nof a downturn and save for investments and future\ngenerations. It has allocated a good share of government\nspending to health, education, social assistance, and\ninvestment in public infrastructure.\nThe directors believe that the government of South Africa\nsupports the development of natural resources by foreign\ninvestors and actively monitors the situation. However,\nthere is no assurance that future political and economic\nconditions in South Africa will not result in the government\nof South Africa adopting different policies regarding foreign\ndevelopment and ownership of mineral resources. Any\nchanges in policy affecting ownership of assets, taxation,\nrates of exchange, environmental protection, labour\nrelations, repatriation of income and return of capital, may\naffect the Group’s ability to develop the projects. The\nCompany is complying with current South African mining\ncharter code of practice and black economic empowerment\nlegislation (refer to the directors’ report). The politics of the\nUSA are well understood and transparent with full\ndemocracy. Federal law could change in the USA thereby\naffecting the cost of mineral concession ownership. Nevada\nMining Law could change to the detriment of future mining\ndevelopment. Zambia boasts 10% of the world’s copper\nreserves, is the second largest copper producer in Africa and\nthe eighth globally, remains one of the world’s largest cobalt\nproducers, and has the world’s largest emerald mine. The\nmining industry is an important pillar of the economy\ncontributing about 12% and 75% of GDP and exports,\nrespectively. The government is reliant on the mining\nindustry. Any changes in policy affecting ownership of\nassets, taxation, and exchange controls may affect the\nGroup’s ability to continue with the projects in Zambia.\nDirectors’ Report\n20\nGALILEO RESOURCES PLC"

      "text": "Directors’ Report\nANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS – 31 March 2022\n21\nUninsurable risks\nThe Group may become subject to liability for accidents,\npollution and other hazards, which it cannot insure or\nagainst which it may elect not to insure because of\npremium costs or for other reasons, such as in amounts,\nwhich exceed policy limits.\nSecurity of tenure\nThe Group investigates its rights to explore and extract\nminerals from all of its material properties and, to the best\nof its knowledge; those rights are expected to be in good\nstanding. However, no assurance can be given that the\nGroup will be able to secure the grant or the renewal of\nexisting mineral rights and tenures on terms satisfactory to\nit, or that governments in the jurisdiction in which the Group\noperates will not revoke or significantly alter such rights or\ntenures or that such rights or tenures will not be challenged\nor impugned by third parties, including local governments\nor other claimants. Although the Group is not aware of any\nexisting title uncertainties with respect to any of its future\nmaterial properties, there is no assurance that such\nuncertainties, if negative, will not result in future losses or\nadditional expenditures, which could have an adverse\nimpact on the Group’s future cash flows, earnings, results\nof operations and financial condition.\nMarket perception\nMarket perception of mining and exploration companies\nmay change which could impact on the value of investors’\nholdings and impact on the ability of the Company to raise\nfurther funds by issue of further shares in the Company.\nEnvironmental factors\nAll mining operations have some degree of an\nenvironmental risk. Although the directors have made\nreasonable assessment, no assurance can be given that no\noutstanding or intended claims against disturbance of the\nenvironment exist. Rare earths are often associated with\nradioactivity and the Glenover project has amongst other\nminerals, radioactive thorium present in the ore. The\ndirectors have considered the significance of this and what\npotential problems may be presented due to the presence\nof radioactive minerals. They have concluded that the\npotential radioactivity will not prevent operations, but no\nassurance can be given that the presence of radioactivity\nwill impact on either capital or operating cost or both. In\naddition, the Group will also be subjected to, where\nappropriate, clean-up costs and for any toxic or hazardous\nsubstances, which may be produced as a result of its\noperation. Environmental legislation and permitting are\nevolving in a non-mining supportive manner, which could\nresult in onerous standards and enforcement with the risk\nof consequential fines, penalties and closure. As the\nCompany develops, the directors intend to carry out the\nappropriate environmental base-line studies with experts\noutsourced from independent environmental consultancies.\nReserve and resource estimates\nThe Group’s future reported reserves and resources of\nGlenover are only estimates. No assurance can be given\nthat the estimated reserves and resources will be recovered\nor that they will be recovered at the rates estimated.\nMineral and metal reserve and resource estimates are\nbased on limited sampling and, consequently, are uncertain\nbecause the samples may not be representative. Mineral\nand metal reserve and resource estimates may require\nrevision (either up or down) based on actual production\nexperience or further sampling. Any future reserve and/or\nresource figures will be estimates and there can be no\nassurance that the minerals are present, will be recovered\nor can be brought into profitable production. Furthermore,\na decline in the market price for natural resources that the\nGroup may discover or invest in could render reserves\ncontaining relatively lower grades of these resources\nuneconomic to recover and may ultimately result in a\nrestatement of reserves.\nPandemic risk\nThe Group acknowledges the pandemic risk which has\nthe potential to cause further disruption and continues to\npose a further threat on similar operations worldwide. It\nremains the Group’s focus to protect all personnel, site\nvisitors and stakeholders and at the same time to ensure\nbusiness continuity. The necessary changes have taken place\nin all the relevant jurisdictions and the Group continues to\nmonitor government guidance to mitigate the above risk.\n2. GOING CONCERN\nThe Group has sufficient financial resources to enable it\nto continue in operational existence for the foreseeable\nfuture, to continue the current development programme\nand meet its liabilities as they fall due. The Company has no\nexternal debt or overdrafts. The directors have further\nreviewed the Group’s cash flow forecast, and in light of this\nreview and the financial position at the date of this report,\nthey are satisfied that the Company and Group have access\nto adequate resources to continue in operational existence\nfor the foreseeable future.\nAccordingly, the directors consider it appropriate to\ncontinue to adopt the going-concern basis in preparing\nthese financial statements. This basis presumes that funds\nwill be available to finance future operations and that the\nrealisation of assets and settlement of liabilities, contingent\nobligations and commitments will occur in the ordinary\ncourse of business.\n3. EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD\nOther than the events described in the Chairman’s and\nOperations Report and the transactions set out in note 32 of\nthese financial statements the directors are not aware of\nany matter or circumstances arising that should be disclosed\nsince the end of the financial year."

An internal audit function is\nnot considered necessary or practical due to the size of the\nCompany and the close day to day control exercised by the\nexecutive directors. However, the Board will continue to\nmonitor the need for an internal audit function. The Board\nworks closely with and has regular ongoing dialogue with\nthe Company’s financial director, Mr. J Silberstein and has\nestablished appropriate reporting and control mechanisms\nto ensure the effectiveness of its control systems.\n11.5 Principle Five – A Well-Functioning Board of\nDirectors\nAs at the date hereof the Board comprises, the Chairman\nand CEO Colin Bird, Technical Director Edward Slowey and\nFinance Director, Joel Silberstein and two non-executive\nDirectors, Christopher Molefe and Richard Wollenberg of\nwhom both are independent. The Company’s portfolio of\nnatural resource projects is not extensive.

However, the\nCompany reviews its governance policy annually having\ndue regard to the intent of Principle 5 and the Company’s\ndevelopment.

The Board elects a chairman to\nchair every meeting: normally this would be Colin Bird.\nThe Board endeavors to meet on a quarterly basis. It has\nestablished an Audit and Compliance Committee and a\nRemuneration Committee, particulars of which appear\nhereafter. The Board has agreed that appointments to the\nBoard are made by the Board as a whole and so has not\ncreated a Nominations Committee. The non-executive\nDirectors are considered to be part time but are expected\nto provide as much time to the Company as is required. The\nBoard considers that this is appropriate given the\nCompany’s current stage of operations. It shall continue to\nmonitor the need to match resources to its operational\nperformance and costs and the matter will be kept under\nreview going forward. The Board notes that the QCA\nrecommends a balance between executive and non-\nexecutive Directors and recommends that there should be\ntwo independent non-executives. As noted above the\nBoard will review annually further appointments as the\nCompany’s scale and operational complexity grows.\nAttendance at Board and Committee Meetings\nThe Board conducted three board meetings during the\nperiod to the date of this report. During the period under\nreview Committee matters were discussed at board level.\nExecutive and non-executive directors interact on a regular\nbasis via telephone or other electronic means.\n11.6 Principle Six – Appropriate Skills and Experience of\nthe Directors\nThe Board currently consists of five directors. In addition,\nthe Company has employed the outsourced services of Link\nGroup to act as the Company Secretary.\nThe Company believes that the current balance of skills\nin the Board as a whole reflects a very broad range of\ncommercial and professional skills across geographies and\nindustries and each director has experience in public\nmarkets.\nThe Board recognises that it currently has a limited\ndiversity and this will form a part of any future recruitment\nconsideration, if the Board concludes that replacement or\nadditional directors are required.\nThe Board shall review annually the appropriateness and\nopportunity for continuing professional development\nwhether formal or informal.\nColin Bird – Executive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer\nColin Bird has a Diploma in Mining Engineering, is a\nFellow of the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining\nand is a certified mine manager both in the UK and in the\nUnited States of America.

Our\nresponsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial\nstatements section of our report. We are independent of the Group and Company in accordance with the ethical\nrequirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as\napplied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nConclusions relating to going concern\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the director’s use of the going concern basis of accounting\nin the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s\nand Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n●Reviewing the inputs to the forecast financial information and agreeing these to the underlying supporting\ndocumentation\n●Audit procedures to ensure that the calculations applied in the forecasts were in accordance with the method and were\nmathematically accurate\n●Challenging the key assumptions and estimates\n●Comparing prior year forecast to actual results\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions\nthat, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s or Company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant\nsections of this report.\nOur application of materiality\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for\nmateriality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature,\ntiming and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating\nthe effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.\nIndependent Auditors’ Report\nTO THE MEMBERS OF GALILEO RESOURCES PLC"

The range of materiality allocated across components was between £70,600 and £83,400 (2021: between\n£43,000 and £47,500).

In particular, we looked at areas involving significant accounting estimates and judgement by the\ndirectors and considered future events that are inherently uncertain, such as valuation and capitalisation of the exploration\nand evaluation intangible assets. Our Group audit scope focused on the principal areas of operation, being North America,\nSouth Africa, Zambia, Botswana and the United Kingdom. We also addressed the risk of material misstatement in the\naccounting for the shared profits from joint ventures as this is financially significant to the Group; and the risk of\nmanagement override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that\nrepresented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\nThe audit was performed by us as Group auditors based in London. Each component within the Group was assessed as\nto whether they were significant or not significant to the Group by either their size or risk. The Company and subsidiaries\nincluding Galileo Resources SA Proprietary Limited and St. Vincent Minerals US Inc. were considered to be significant due\nto identified risk and size. A full scope audit was completed on these significant components.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the\nfinancial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement\n(whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy,\nthe allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed\nin the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not\nprovide a separate opinion on these matters.\nGross assets are considered to be an\nappropriate benchmark as group activities\nare\nin\nthe\nexploration\nstage.\nThe\nexploration assets and investments in\nthese exploration projects are the most\nsignificant\nbalances\nin\nthe\nfinancial\nstatements. We consider the users of the\nfinancial statements, such as investors,\nwould be most interested in the valuation\nof these assets.\n32\nGALILEO RESOURCES PLC"

The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual\nreport. Our opinion on the Group and Company financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to\nthe extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our\nresponsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially\ninconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to\nbe materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required\nto determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the\nwork we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required\nto report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\nShared profit and valuation of investments in joint\nventures (Note 5)\nThe Group has a joint venture interest over Glenover\nPhosphate (Proprietary) Limited. The balance is\naccounted for as an investment in joint venture and\nfollows equity accounting in accordance with IAS 28 –\nInvestments in Associates and Joint Ventures.\nDuring the year, the Group has shared a profit from this\njoint venture amounting to £3,433,000, followed by\ndividend distributions from the entity to the Group.\nThere is a risk that this treatment is not appropriate,\nand that indicators of impairment have not been\nidentified as at 31 March 2022.\nValuation and appropriate capitalisation of Intangible\nAssets (Note 3)\nThe Group has intangible assets in relation to capitalised\nexploration costs in respect of its exploration and\nevaluation in the United States, Zambia and Botswana.\nThere is the risk that these assets have been incorrectly\ncapitalised in accordance with IFRS 6 – Exploration for\nand Evaluation of Mineral Resources and that there\nis a risk that the indicators of impairment have not been\nidentified as at 31 March 2022.\nParticularly for early stage exploration projects where\nthe calculation of recoverable amount from value in\nuse calculations is not practical, management’s\nassessment of impairment under IFRS 6 requires\nestimation and judgement based on the costs that are\nbeing capitalised and whether they meet the criteria\nstipulated in IFRS 6."

Reasonable\nassurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will\nalways detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users\ntaken on the basis of these financial statements.\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line\nwith our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The\nextent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:\n●We obtained an understanding of the Group and Company and the sector in which they operate to identify laws and\nregulations that could reasonably be expected to have a direct effect on the financial statements. We obtained our\nunderstanding in this regard through discussions with management and our experience of the resource exploration\nsector.\n●We determined the principal laws and regulations relevant to the group and parent company in this regard to be those\narising from:\nH Listing Rules\nH Companies Act 2006\nH The Bribery Act 2010\nH Anti Money Laundering Legislation\nH Disclosure rules and Transparency rules for listed entities\nIndependent Auditors’ Report\n34\nGALILEO RESOURCES PLC"

      "text": "Independent Auditors’ Report\nANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS – 31 March 2022\n35\nH Local industry regulations where exploration activity took place; and\nH Local tax and employment laws\n●We designed our audit procedures to ensure the audit team considered whether there were any indications of non-\ncompliance by the Group and Company with those laws and regulations. These procedures included, but were not\nlimited to:\nH Make enquires of management\nH Review of board meeting minutes\nH Review of legal expenses\nH Review of RNS announcements\n●We also identified the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud. We considered, in addition\nto the non-rebuttable presumption of a risk of fraud arising from management override of controls, that the potential\nfor management bias was identified in relation to the impairment of the carrying value of intangible assets and we\naddressed this by challenging the assumptions and judgements made by management when auditing that significant\naccounting estimate.\n●We addressed the risk of fraud arising from management override of controls by performing audit procedures which\nincluded, but were not limited to: the testing of journals; reviewing accounting estimates for evidence of bias; and\nevaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business;\nand reviewing transactions through the bank statements to identify potentially large and unusual transactions that do\nnot appear to be in line with our understanding of business operations. Aside from the non-rebuttable presumption of\na risk of fraud arising from management override of controls, we did not identify any significant fraud risks.\n●We performed followings in respect of matters of non-compliance with laws and regulations including fraud at the\ngroup and component levels:\nH Make enquires of management\nH Review correspondences with authorities\nH Review nominals of legal expenses\nBecause of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those\nleading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk increases the\nmore that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial\nstatements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk is also greater regarding\nirregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission\nor misrepresentation.\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting\nCouncil’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

PRESENTATION OF ANNUAL FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS\nGalileo Resources PLC is a public company listed on AIM\nof the LSE, incorporated and existing under the laws of\nEngland and Wales, having its registered office at 1st Floor,\n7/8 Kendrick Mews, London, SW7 3HG, United Kingdom.\nThe consolidated annual financial statements have been\nprepared in accordance with UK-adopted International\nAccounting Standard and the Companies Act 2006. The\nconsolidated annual financial statements have been\nprepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain\nfinancial instruments and acquisitions at fair value, and\nincorporate the principal accounting policies set out below.\nCost is based on the fair values of the consideration given\nin exchange for assets and they are presented in Pound\nSterling. These annual financial statements were approved\nby the board of directors on 20 September 2022.\n1.1 Basis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated annual financial statements incorporate\nthe annual financial statements of the Company and all\nentities, including special purpose entities, which are\ncontrolled by the Company.\nControl exists when the Company has the power to\ngovern the financial and operating policies of an entity so\nas to obtain benefits from its activities.\nThe\nresults\nof\nsubsidiaries\nare\nincluded\nin\nthe\nconsolidated annual financial statements from the effective\ndate of acquisition to the effective date of disposal.\nAdjustments are made when necessary to the annual\nfinancial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting\npolicies in line with those of the Group.\nAll intra-group transactions, balances, income and\nexpenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated\nsubsidiaries are identified and recognised separately from\nthe Group’s interest therein, and are recognised within\nequity. Losses of subsidiaries attributable to non-controlling\ninterests are allocated to the non-controlling interest even\nif this results in a debit balance being recognised for non-\ncontrolling interest.\nTransactions, which result in changes in ownership levels,\nwhere the Group has control of the subsidiary both before\nand\nafter\nthe\ntransaction,\nare\nregarded\nas\nequity\ntransactions and are recognised directly in the statement of\nchanges in equity.\nThe difference between the fair value of consideration\npaid or received and the movement in non-controlling\ninterest for such transactions is recognised in equity\nattributable to the owners of the parent.\nWhere a subsidiary is disposed of and a non-controlling\nshareholding is retained, the remaining investment is\nmeasured to fair value with the adjustment to fair value\nrecognised in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on\ndisposal of the controlling interest.\nBusiness combinations\nThe Group accounts for business combinations using the\nacquisition method of accounting. The cost of the business\ncombination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values\nof assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity\ninstruments issued. Costs directly attributable to the\nbusiness combination are expensed as incurred, except the\ncosts to issue debt, which are amortised as part of the\neffective interest, and costs to issue equity, which are\nincluded in equity.\nContingent consideration is included in the cost of the\ncombination at fair value as at the date of acquisition.\nSubsequent changes to the assets, liability or equity, which\narise as a result of the contingent consideration, are not\naffected\nagainst\ngoodwill,\nunless\nthey\nare\nvalid\nmeasurement period adjustments.\nThe\nacquiree’s\nidentifiable\nassets,\nliabilities\nand\ncontingent liabilities which meet the recognition conditions\nof IFRS 3 Business combinations are recognised at their fair\nvalues at acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or\ndisposal group) that are classified as held-for-sale in\naccordance with IFRS 5 non-current assets held-for-sale and\ndiscontinued operations, which are recognised at fair value\nless costs to sell.\nContingent liabilities are only included in the identifiable\nassets and liabilities of the acquiree where there is a\npresent obligation at acquisition date.\nOn acquisition, the Group assesses the classification of\nthe acquiree’s assets and liabilities and reclassifies them\nwhere the classification is inappropriate for Group purposes.\nThis excludes lease agreements and insurance contracts,\nwhose classification remains as per their inception date.\nNon-controlling\ninterests\narising\nfrom\na\nbusiness\ncombination, which are present ownership interests, and\nentitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s\nnet assets in the event of liquidation, are measured either\nat the present ownership interests’ proportionate share in\nthe recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net\nassets or at fair value. The treatment is not an accounting\npolicy choice but is selected for each individual business\ncombination, and disclosed in the note for business\ncombinations. All other components of non-controlling\ninterests are measured at their acquisition date fair values,\nunless another measurement basis is required by IFRSs.\nANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS – 31 March 2022\n43\nNotes to the Financial Statements"

      "text": "Notes to the Financial Statements\nIn cases where the Group held a non-controlling\nshareholding in the acquiree prior to obtaining control, that\ninterest is measured to fair value as at acquisition date. The\nmeasurement to fair value is included in profit or loss for\nthe year. Where the existing shareholding was classified as\nan available-for-sale financial asset, the cumulative fair\nvalue\nadjustments\nrecognised\npreviously\nto\nother\ncomprehensive income and accumulated in equity are\nrecognised in profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment.\nGoodwill is determined as the consideration paid, plus\nthe fair value of any shareholding held prior to obtaining\ncontrol, plus non-controlling interest and less fair value of\nthe identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree. Where\nthe fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent\nliabilities exceed the fair value of consideration paid, the\ngain on bargain purchase is credited in full to the\nconsolidated statement of comprehensive income on the\nacquisition date.\nGoodwill is not amortised but is tested on an annual basis\nfor impairment. If goodwill is assessed to be impaired, that\nimpairment is not subsequently reversed.\nGoodwill arising on acquisition of foreign entities is\nconsidered an asset of the foreign entity. In such cases the\ngoodwill is translated to the functional currency of the\nGroup at the end of each reporting period with the\nadjustment\nrecognised\nin\nequity\nthrough\nto\nother\ncomprehensive income.\nInvestment in associates\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has\nsignificant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a\njoint venture. Significant influence is the power to\nparticipate in the financial and operating policy decisions of\nthe investee but is not control or joint control over\nthose policies.\nAn investment in associate is accounted for using the\nequity method, except when the investment is classified as\nheld-for-sale in accordance with IFRS 5 non-current assets\nheld-for-sale and discontinued operations. Under the equity\nmethod, investments in associates are carried in the\nconsolidated statement of financial position at cost adjusted\nfor post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net\nassets of the associate, less any impairment losses.\nLosses in an associate in excess of the Group’s interest in\nthat associate are recognised only to the extent that the\nGroup has incurred a legal or constructive obligation to\nmake payments on behalf of the associate.\nAny goodwill on acquisition of an associate is included\nin the carrying amount of the investment; however, a gain\non acquisition is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\nProfits or losses on transactions between the Group and\nan associate are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s\ninterest therein.\nWhen the Group reduces its level of significant influence\nor loses significant influence, the Group proportionately\nreclassifies the related items, which were previously\naccumulated in equity through other comprehensive income\nto profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. In such\ncases, if an investment remains, that investment is\nmeasured to fair value, with the fair value adjustment being\nrecognised in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on\ndisposal. Interests in joint ventures\nA joint venture is a contractual agreement whereby the\nGroup and other parties undertake an economic activity that\nis subject to joint control that is when the strategic financial\nand operating policy decisions relating to the activities of\nthe joint venture require the unanimous consent of the\nparties sharing control.\nJointly controlled entities\nAn interest in a jointly controlled entity is accounted for\nusing the equity method, except when the investment is\nclassified as held-for-sale in accordance with IFRS 5 non-\ncurrent assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations.\nUnder the equity method, interests in jointly controlled\nentities are carried in the consolidated statement of\nfinancial position at cost adjusted for post-acquisition\nchanges in the Group’s share of net assets of the jointly\ncontrolled entity, less any impairment losses. Profits or\nlosses on transactions between the Group and a joint\nventure are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s\ninterest therein.\nWhen\nthe\nGroup\nloses\njoint\ncontrol,\nthe\nGroup\nproportionately reclassifies the related items, which were\npreviously\naccumulated\nin\nequity\nthrough\nother\ncomprehensive income to profit or loss as a reclassification\nadjustment. In such cases, if an investment remains, that\ninvestment is measured to fair value, with the fair value\nadjustment being recognised in profit or loss as part of the\ngain or loss on disposal.\n1.2 Significant judgements and sources of estimation\nuncertainty\nIn\npreparing\nthe\nannual\nfinancial\nstatements,\nmanagement\nis\nrequired\nto\nmake\nestimates\nand\nassumptions that affect the amounts represented in the\nannual financial statements and related disclosures. Use of\navailable information and the application of judgement is\ninherent in the formation of estimates. Actual results in the\nfuture could differ from these estimates, which may be\nmaterial to the annual financial statements. Significant\njudgements include:\nOptions granted\nManagement uses the Black Scholes Formula for\nsubsequent options being granted.

These costs are capitalised to\neach individual project, pending a decision on the economic\nfeasibility of the project. The capitalisation of these costs\ngives rise to an intangible asset in the consolidated\nstatement of financial position. The costs are capitalised\nwhere it is considered likely that the amount will be\nrecovered by future exploitation. This requires management\nto make estimates and assumptions as to the future events\nand circumstances and whether an economically viable\nextraction operation can be established. The estimates are\nsubject to change and in the event that recovery of the\nexpenditure becomes unlikely, the relevant amount is\nwritten off in the statement of comprehensive income.\nReceivables from Group entities\nThe Company makes assumptions when implementing\nthe forward-looking ECL model. The model is used to assess\ngroup loans for impairment. Estimates are made regarding\nthe credit risk and underlying probability of default in each\nof the credit loss scenarios, which include production,\nfailure,\ndivestment\nand\nsale.\nThe\nDirectors\nmake\njudgements on the expected likelihood and outcome of\neach of the scenarios and these expected values are applied\nto the loan balances.\nFair value estimation\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in active\nmarkets is based on quoted market prices at the end of the\nreporting period. The quoted market price used for financial\nassets held by the Group is the current bid price.\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded\nin an active market (for example, over the counter\nderivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques.\nThe Group uses a variety of methods and makes\nassumptions that are based on market conditions existing at\nthe end of each reporting period. Quoted market prices or\ndealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term\ndebt. Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash\nflows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining\nfinancial instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps\nis calculated as the present value of the estimated future\ncash flows. The fair value of forward foreign exchange\ncontracts is determined using quoted forward exchange\nrates at the end of the reporting period.\nThe carrying value less impairment provision of trade\nreceivables and payables are assumed to approximate their\nfair values. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure\npurposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual\ncash flows at the current market interest rate that is\navailable to the Group for similar financial instruments.\n1.3 Exploration and evaluation costs\nExploration and evaluation costs, including the costs of\nacquiring licences, are capitalised as exploration and\nevaluation assets on an area of interest basis.\nExploration and evaluation assets are only recognised if\nthe rights of the area of interest are current and either:\n(i) the expenditures are expected to be recouped through\nsuccessful development and exploitation of the area of\ninterest; or\n(ii) activities in the area of interest have not at the reporting\ndate, reached a stage which permits a reasonable\nassessment\nof\nthe\nexistence\nor\notherwise\nof\neconomically recoverable reserves and active and\nsignificant operations in, or in relation to, the area of\ninterest are continuing.\nExploration and evaluation assets are assessed for\nimpairment if:\n(i) sufficient data exist to determine technical feasibility\nand commercial viability; and\n(ii) facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying\namount exceeds the recoverable amount. For the\npurposes of impairment testing, exploration and\nevaluation assets are allocated to cash-generating units\n(“CGU”) to which the exploration activity related.\nExploration and evaluation assets are carried forward in\nthe balance sheet under intangible assets.\n1.4 Investment in subsidiaries\nCompany annual financial statements\nIn the Company’s separate annual financial statements,\ninvestment in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any\naccumulated impairment.\nThe cost of an investment in a subsidiary is the aggregate\nof:\n●\nthe fair value, at the date of exchange, of assets given,\nliabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments\nissued by the Company; plus\n●\nany costs directly attributable to the purchase of the\nsubsidiary.\nAn adjustment to the cost of a business combination\ncontingent on future events is included in the cost of the\ncombination if the adjustment is probable and can be\nmeasured reliably.\n1.5 Investment in joint ventures\nCompany annual financial statements\nAn investment in a joint venture is carried at cost less\nany accumulated impairment.\nIn respect of its interests in jointly controlled operations,\nthe Company recognises in its annual financial statements:\n●\nthe assets that it controls and the liabilities that it incurs;\nand\n●\nthe expenses that it incurs and its share of the income\nthat it earns from the sale of goods or services by the\njoint venture.\nANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS – 31 March 2022\n45"

These are initially and subsequently recorded at\nfair value.\n1.8 Tax\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities\nCurrent tax for current and prior periods is, to the extent\nunpaid, recognised as a liability. If the amount already paid\nin respect of current and prior periods exceeds the amount\ndue for those periods, the excess is recognised as an asset.\nCurrent tax liabilities (assets) for the current and prior\nperiods are measured at the amount expected to be paid to\n(recovered from) the tax authorities, using the tax rates\n(and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively\nenacted by the end of the reporting period.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities\nA deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable\ntemporary differences, except to the extent that the\ndeferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an\nasset or liability in a transaction which at the time of the\ntransaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable\nprofit (tax loss).\nA deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible\ntemporary differences to the extent that it is probable that\ntaxable profit will be available against which the deductible\ntemporary difference can be utilised. A deferred tax asset is\nnot recognised when it arises from the initial recognition of\nan asset or liability in a transaction at the time of the\ntransaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable\nprofit/(tax loss).\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the\ntax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the\nasset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates\n(and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively\nenacted by the end of the reporting period.\nTax expenses\nCurrent and deferred taxes are recognised as income or\nan expense and included in profit or loss for the period,\nexcept to the extent that the tax arises from:\n●\na transaction or event which is recognised, in the same\nor a different period, to other comprehensive income; or\n●\na business combination.\nCurrent tax and deferred taxes are charged or credited to\nother comprehensive income if the tax relates to items that\nare credited or charged, in the same or a different period,\nto other comprehensive income.\nCurrent tax and deferred taxes are charged or credited\ndirectly to equity if the tax relates to items that are credited\nor charged, in the same or a different period, directly\nin equity.\n1.9 Share-capital and equity\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a\nresidual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all\nof its liabilities.\nIncremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new\nshares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of\ntax, from the proceeds.\n1.10 Share-based payments\nGoods or services received or acquired in a share based\npayment transaction are recognised when the goods or as\nthe services are received. A corresponding increase in equity\nis recognised if the goods or services were received in an\nequity-settled share-based payment transaction or a liability\nif the goods or services were acquired in a cash-settled\nshare based payment transaction.\nWhen the goods or services received or acquired in a\nshare-based payment transaction do not qualify for\nrecognition as assets, they are recognised as expenses.\nFor equity-settled share-based payment transactions the\ngoods or services received and the corresponding increase\nin equity are measured, directly, at the fair value of the\ngoods or services received provided that the fair value can\nbe estimated reliably.\nIf the fair value of the goods or services received cannot\nbe estimated reliably, or if the services received are\nemployee services, their value and the corresponding\nincrease in equity, are measured, indirectly, by reference to\nthe fair value of the equity instruments granted.\nVesting conditions, which are not market, related (i.e.\nservice conditions and non-market related performance\nconditions)\nare\nnot\ntaken\ninto\nconsideration\nwhen\ndetermining the fair value of the equity instruments\ngranted.

Market\nconditions, such as a target share price, are taken into\naccount when estimating the fair value of the equity\ninstruments granted. The number of equity instruments are\nnot adjusted to reflect equity instruments which are not\nexpected to vest or do not vest because the market\ncondition is not achieved.\nIf the share-based payments granted do not vest until\nthe counterparty completes a specified period of service,\nGroup accounts for those services as they are rendered by\nthe counterparty during the vesting period, (or on a straight-\nline basis over the vesting period).\nIf the share-based payments vest immediately the\nservices received are recognised in full.\nANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS – 31 March 2022\n47"

In the Kalahari Copper Belt (‘KCB’),\nthe Agreement covers 19 prospecting licences (‘PLs’) extending over 14,564km2 located approximately 500km to the northwest\nof Gaborone, the capital of Botswana. The KCB extends for over 800km of strike and contains multiple recent copper-silver\ndiscoveries, which are generally stratabound and hosted in metasedimentary rocks. The geological setting is comparable to that\nof the Central African Copper Belt and the Kupferschiefer in Poland. The Limpopo Mobile Belt (‘LMB’) project comprises 2 PLs\ncovering 311km2 on land located about 400km northeast of Gaborone, near the border with Zimbabwe, viz. PL048/2018\n(Sampowane) and PL049/2018.\nGalileo acquired its Kalahari Copper Belt portfolio with the acquisition of Africibum Co (Pty) Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of\nCrocus-Serv (Pty) Ltd. The Company acquired a 100% interest in five prospecting licences PL366/2018, PL367/2018, PL368/2018,\nPL122/2020, PL123/2020 and two mining tenement applications in Botswana (the “North East Kalahari Copper Belt Project”)\nBotswana – Kalahari Copper Belt Licenses held for sale\nOn 16 September 2021, Galileo completed its sale of 9 of its Company’s Kalahari Copper Belt Licences (“Included Licenses”) to\nSandfire Resources. Sandfire Resources is an Australian listed company and have an enviable track record of copper/gold discovery,\ndevelopment execution and operation.\nThe Included Licenses were sold for a consideration of US$1.5 million in cash. The Company agreed to allow Sandfire to have a\nfirst right of refusal in relation to the acquisition of the 15 Kalahari Copper Belt Licences being retained by the Company.\nConsideration for the right of first refusal was settled by the issue of 370,477 Sandfire ordinary shares to the Company equivalent\nof US$1.5 million.\nSandfire has an exploration commitment to spend US$4 million on the Included Licences within two years of settlement and if\nthe US$4 million is not spent, any shortfall will be paid to the Company. A one-off success payment will be paid to the Company\nfor the first ore reserve reported under JORC Code 2012 edition on the Included Licences which exceeds 200,000 tonnes of\ncontained copper (the “First Ore Reserve”) in the range of US$10 million to US$80 million depending on the amount of contained\ncopper in the First Ore Reserve (the “Success Payment”). US$2 million of the Success Payment will be held in escrow for up to\nthree years pending any claim by Sandfire under the Licence Sale Agreement.\nGiven the limited exploration conducted on the Included Licences to date and the many years that it could take to establish an\nOre Reserve, there can be no guarantee that any such Success Payment will be forthcoming."

The Company acquired its interest in the Star Zinc Project in 2017 and as at the period end its carrying\nvalue under exploration and evaluation assets in Zambia was £1,574,160. No income has to date been generated from the Star\nZinc Project. The Star Zinc Project costs to date have been capitalised as exploration and evaluation assets as the Project has been\nin the pre-production and pre-sales phase.\nOn 4 March 2021, the Company entered into a conditional agreement with Siege Mining Limited (“Siege”) in relation to the ceding\nof ownership and operation of the Star Zinc Project (the “Star Zinc Project”) for US$750,000 (being US$200,000 in relation to the\nlarge-scale exploration license 19653-HQ-LEL (the “Star Zinc Project License”) (the “License Consideration”) and US$550,000 for\nGalileo ceding its participation in the Star Zinc Project and all exploration information which it has in relation to the Star Zinc Project\n(the “Project Assets”) (the “Project Consideration”). Galileo will also be paid a royalty (proportion share) based on future sales\nof zinc from the Star Zinc Project for Galileo allowing Siege to use Galileo’s information, know-how and commercial experience\nin relation to the Star Zinc Project (the “Agreement”). To date, the Company has received US$50,000 from Siege Mining as per\nthe terms of the agreement entered in March 2021.\nRoyalties payable under the Agreement are dependent upon the zinc concentrate in ore sold, future price of Zinc and ore produced\nat the Star Zinc project. For information but not as a forecast of future production at the Star Zinc Project on 14 November 2018\nthe Company announced that following a second phase of drilling the tonnage target was between 600,000 to 900,000 tonnes\nwith an estimated average grade of 10-12% zinc at above 3% cut off grade.\nThe royalty will vary based on the contained zinc percentage of the ore sold (the “Contained Zinc Percentage”) and the LME Zinc\nprice at which the ore is sold (the “LME Zinc Price”) The base royalty rate is 3% and will increase by 1% for each US$250 increase\nin the Zinc sale price over US$2,500 per tonne up to a maximum of 10% (the “Royalty Rate”) The royalty will be calculated by\nmultiplying the Contained Zinc Percentage * the LME Zinc price * Royalty Rate.\nThe Company entered into the Agreement following a period in which it with stakeholders reviewed the options for putting the\nStar Zinc Project into operation taking into consideration operational, community and regulatory issues associated with mining a\nproject that is in the outskirts of Lusaka, and allowing ownership and operational responsibilities to be assumed by a Zambian\nmining company, whilst the Company can still participate in the future success of the Star Zinc Project.\nThe project has continued to encounter a number of challenges from the local community. The mine is situated close to Lusaka,\nwith its close proximity to housing and residents continuing to move into the area. This has made it increasingly difficult to carry\nout mining operations. Restrictions on the use of large trucks and the possibility of blasting has put limitations on the project.\nOpposition from local residents continues to grow and with the recent elections and change of government, there is less support\nfrom local authorities for the project.\nThe Company has not received royalty payments invoiced at year end in the amount of £174,863 and while the Company will\ncontinue to do its utmost to ensure that it receives what it is due in royalties, there remains an element of uncertainty and\ntherefore the Board are of the opinion that all the amounts relating to project which have been capitalised to date should be\nimpaired. An impairment of £1,574,160 was recognised in profit or loss after receipt of a £35,394 payment from Siege. Following\na prudent approach management also provided for bad debts against the royalty invoices payable.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n52\nGALILEO RESOURCES PLC\nFigures in Pound Sterling"

TAXATION (continued)\nAs announced on 16 September 2021, Galileo concluded the sale of 9 of its Company's Kalahari Copper Belt Licences to Sandfire\nResources. As part of the transaction, during the previous financial year when the transaction was still subject to certain conditions\nprecedent the Galileo recognised a deferred tax liability in the amount of £425,813. The transaction was completed during the\nperiod under review and the corresponding tax charge recognised in profit or loss.\nThe applicable tax rate is calculated with reference to the weighted average tax rate across the reporting jurisdictions for the\nperiod under review. The weighted average tax rate for the year under review was 17.79% (2021: 19.60%). No provision has\nbeen made for 2022 tax as the Group has no taxable income. The estimated Group tax losses available for set off against future\ntaxable income is £10,618,703 (2021: £6,868,214). The Group did not recognise a deferred tax asset in respect of the losses\ncarried forward as the Group is not expected to generate taxable profits in the foreseeable future.\nGroup\nCompany\n31 March\n31 March\n31 March\n31 March\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\n20.

RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\nFinancial risk management\nThe Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.\nThe Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise\npotential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. Risk management is carried out under policies approved by the\nBoard. Group treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. The\nBoard provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign\nexchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and\ninvestment of excess liquidity.\nLiquidity risk\nPrudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding\nthrough an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.\nThe Group’s risk to liquidity is a result of the funds available to cover future commitments. The Group manages liquidity risk\nthrough an ongoing review of future commitments and credit facilities.\nCash flow forecasts are prepared and adequate utilised borrowing facilities are monitored.\nThe table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities and net settled derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity\ngroupings based on the remaining period at the statement of financial position to the contractual maturity date. The amounts\ndisclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances\nas the impact of discounting is not significant.\nGroup\nLess than\nBetween 2\nAt 31 March 2022\n1 year\nand 5 years\nTrade and other payables\n380,482\n–\nOther financial liabilities\n–\n6\nLess than\nBetween 2\nAt 31 March 2021\n1 year\nand 5 years\nTrade and other payables\n326,916\n–\nOther financial liabilities\n–\n5\nCompany\nLess than\nBetween 2\nAt 31 March 2022\n1 year\nand 5 years\nTrade and other payables\n96,395\n–\nLess than\nBetween 2\nAt 31 March 2021\n1 year\nand 5 years\nTrade and other payables\n317,080\n–\nInterest rate risk\nThe Group’s interest rate risk arises from cash held and short-term deposits. The Company does not face any significant interest\nrate risk as it has no borrowings.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk consists mainly of cash deposits, cash equivalents, and trade debtors. The Company only deposits cash with major banks\nwith high quality credit standing and limits exposure to any one counterparty.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS – 31 March 2022\n69"

Galileo Group is exposed to currency risk on cash reserves,\ndeposits received, trade receivables, and trade payables. The most significant of these being the inter-company loans, which it\nholds with its subsidiaries Galileo Resources SA (ZAR) and St Vincent Minerals (USD).\nThe Group does not hedge its foreign exchange on funding of projects as management is of the opinion that it would not have\nreduced these foreign currency fluctuations. Currency movements mainly include movements that arise as a result of South\nAfrican Rand denominated projects that are revalued at each period end.\nThe Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.\nCurrency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations is managed primarily through borrowings\ndenominated in the relevant foreign currencies. This minimises the sensitivity to the exchange risk.\nThe table below classifies the Group’s foreign currency risk between the different functional currencies as at year-end, and the\nrespective balance thereof: Exchange rates used for conversion of foreign items were:\nZAR : £ (Average)\n1:0.0493\n(2021: 1 : 0.0469)\nZAR : £ (Spot)\n1:0.0524\n(2021: 1 : 0.0490)\nUSD : £ (Average)\n1:0.7319\n(2021: 1 : 0.7648)\nUSD : £ (Spot)\n1:0.7615\n(2021: 1 : 0.7264)\nBWP : £ (Average)\n1:0.0660\n(2021: 1 :0.0679)\nBWP : £ (Spot)\n1:0.0675\n(2021: 1 :0.0663)\nThe Group reviews its foreign currency exposure, including commitments on an ongoing basis.\n29. GOING CONCERN\nThe annual financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies applicable to a going concern. This basis\npresumes that funds will be available to finance future operations and that the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities,\ncontingent obligations and commitments will occur in the ordinary course of business.\nThe ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on a number of factors. The most significant of these is\nthat the directors continue to procure funding for the ongoing operations for the Company and that the operations have the\ncontinued support of the holding company.\nThe directors have also considered the Group’s ability to fund its planned projects and general operating costs. They consider the\nGroup as sufficiently funded and anticipate that as projects come on line, the new cash raised will be sufficient to further develop\ncurrent and future planned projects and provide adequate working capital. Throughout the development of projects, executive\nmanagement and the directors will monitor the timing and funding requirements of each project to ensure that the Group\nremains a going concern.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n70\nGALILEO RESOURCES PLC"
