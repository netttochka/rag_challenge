The price of Brent crude oil, one of the \nbenchmarks of international oil prices, jumped from around US$80 per barrel in December 2021, reached its \npeak of over US$130 per barrel in March 2022, and dropped back to around US$80 per barrel in December \n2022. Although international oil prices continue to fluctuate considerably recently, they are hovering at \ncomparatively high levels to their historical trends in the past five years and current market outlook of the \nindustry remains positive.\nLeveraging on the Group’s business experience of its oil operation in Argentina and with the intent of \ncontinuing its petroleum exploration and production business, as announced by the Company on 17 July \n2022, the Group has completed the acquisition of an operating oil field which comprises petroleum and \nnatural gas rights, facilities and pipelines, together with all other properties and assets located in Alberta \nProvince of Canada (the “Canadian Oil Assets”) for a final consideration of C$22,500,000 (equivalent to \nHK$135,461,000). Upon closing of the transactions, the financial results of the Canadian Oil Assets have \nbeen incorporated in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. For the period from 16 July 2022 to 31 \nDecember 2022, the Canadian Oil Assets contributed a revenue of HK$30,932,000 and an operating profit of \nHK$4,078,000 to the Group’s results for FY2022, and for the same period, the earnings before interest, taxes, \ndepreciation and amortisation generated by the Canadian Oil Assets was HK$13,178,000. The acquisition of \nthe Canadian Oil Assets represents a valuable and attractive opportunity for the Group to continue developing \nits petroleum exploration and production business.\nIn alignment with the Group’s strategic initiatives to develop a diversified and balanced energy business \nportfolio, in July 2021, the Group entered into a cooperation framework agreement (the “Cooperation \nAgreement”) with a specialist solar energy total solution and services provider to invest in solar energy power \ngeneration projects that are participating in the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff Scheme (the “FiT Scheme”), \nwhich is a scheme promoted by the Hong Kong Government to incentivise the private sector to produce \nclean energy for sale to the two power companies in Hong Kong. In August 2021, for further development of \nthe solar energy business, the Group entered into an acquisition agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) \nto acquire a portfolio of existing and to-be-completed solar energy power generation projects which are \nparticipating in the FiT Scheme. As of 31 December 2022, the Group has invested a sum of HK$51,516,000 in \nsolar energy power generation projects under the two aforementioned agreements.\nFor FY2022, the Group’s petroleum exploration and production business contributed a profit of HK$4,078,000 \n(2021: loss of HK$4,112,000), the solar energy business contributed a profit of HK$1,403,000 (2021: HK$89,000), \nthe money lending business recorded a loss of HK$16,237,000 (2021: profit of HK$17,440,000), and the Group’s \ninvestment in securities recorded a loss of HK$9,743,000 (2021: HK$32,533,000)."

Basic loss per share was HK0.89 cent (2021: HK0.56 \ncent).\nPROSPECTS\nIt is the Group’s business strategy to continue developing its petroleum exploration and production business, \nalong with expanding and diversifying its business in the energy sector to the next level by investing in \nrenewable energy assets, including solar energy projects, which would support the healthy and sustainable \nbusiness development of the Group in the long run and create new value to shareholders. In pursuance of \nthese strategic initiatives, the Group has successfully acquired the Canadian Oil Assets, and entered into the \nCooperation Agreement and Acquisition Agreement for the development of its solar energy business.\nThe Canadian Oil Assets are located near Calgary City, Alberta Province in Canada. The Group considers \nCanada is one of the ideal countries for developing petroleum exploration and production business as it has \na stable political environment, a well-established system of oil regulations and industrial policies, a well-\ndeveloped business infrastructure for the oil industry, and the third largest oil reserves in the world. There are \nthus enormous business opportunities available in Canada for the Group to develop its petroleum business.\nThe solar energy power generation projects the Group investing in are projects participating in the FiT \nScheme. The FiT Scheme is a policy initiative introduced by the Hong Kong Government to encourage the \nprivate sector to participate in producing cleaner fuel and developing renewable energy technologies. Under \nthe FiT Scheme, scheme participants who install solar or wind power generation system at their premises can \nsell the renewable energy generated to the two power companies in Hong Kong at a rate considerably higher \nthan the normal electricity tariff rate. The FiT Scheme will be offered until the end of 2033, through investing \nin solar energy power generation projects participating in the FiT Scheme, the Group is able to secure a long-\nterm and stable stream of revenue from the tariff income earning by the projects participating in the FiT \nScheme.\nLooking forward, the Group will continue to actively pursue its interests in the petroleum and solar energy \nbusinesses and will manage its businesses in a prudent approach in view of the business uncertainties brought \nby the heightened political and economic tensions between China and the US, and the war between Russia \nand Ukraine which brings significant volatilities to international prices of oil and gas.\nIt is the Group’s business strategy to build a diversified and balanced energy business portfolio, comprising \npetroleum as well as solar energy assets, which will present the Group with favourable long-term prospects, \nand is in line with the Group’s sustainable corporate strategy of broadening its income stream for the goal of \nachieving a stable, long-term and attractive return to shareholders."

As above mentioned, the acquisition of the Canadian \nOil Assets was completed on 16 July 2022, since then, the financial results of the Canadian Oil Assets have \nbeen incorporated in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. For FY2022, the Group’s petroleum \nexploration and production business (now constituted by the Canadian Oil Assets) generated a revenue \nof HK$30,932,000, an operating profit of HK$4,078,000 and an EBITDA of HK$13,178,000 whilst in last year, \nbefore the CHE Concession was taken over, it generated a revenue of HK$1,523,000 and incurred an operating \nlosses of HK$4,112,000. It is expected that the revenue and EBITDA generated by the Canadian Oil Assets will \ncontinue to grow in 2023 as their full year results, together with the production of new wells drilled, will be \nincorporated in the Group’s results.\nThe Canadian Oil Assets represent an operating oilfield comprising petroleum and natural gas rights, facilities \nand pipelines, together with other properties and assets spanned on 8,818 net acres of land in Windy Lake \nregion, near Calgary in Alberta Province of Canada.\nThe Canadian Oil Assets is managed under EP Resources Corporation (“EPR”), a Canadian incorporated wholly-\nowned subsidiary of the Company, by a team of local management with extensive experience in the oil and \ngas industry in Calgary, Canada. For the period from 16 July 2022 to 31 December 2022, the Canadian Oil \nAssets produced approximately 81,300 bbl and sold 81,100 bbl of crude oil, and generated a revenue of \napproximately C$6,618,000 (equivalent to HK$39,821,000) (before royalties payment) at an average selling \nprice of C$81.6 per bbl. The crude oil produced from the Canadian Oil Assets were trucked and sold to the \nindependent oil distributors located in the nearby regions who will largely resell the same to the American \nimporters."

(“Trimble”) on \nthe estimated oil reserves of the Canadian Oil Assets as at 31 December 2022, Trimble was the competent person \nengaged by the Company in preparing the competent person’s report (“CPR”) contained in the circular dated 11 \nMarch 2022 (the “Circular”) in relation to the acquisition of the Canadian Oil Assets. The same set of methodology \nadopted in preparing the CPR are adopted in preparing the Reserve Report. Further details of the Canadian Oil \nAssets were contained in the Circular.\n#\t\nThe Group acquired the Canadian Oil Assets in July 2022. The data of the estimated oil reserves of the Canadian Oil \nAssets as at 31 December 2021 are extracted from the Circular and are for illustration only.\nAccording to the Group’s initial four-year development plan for the Canadian Oil Assets, it was envisaged \nthat 6, 14, 18 and 11 new wells would be drilled in 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025. In respect of the 2022 drilling \nplan, for the reason that the completion time of acquiring the Canadian Oil Assets in July 2022 was later \nthan envisaged when the development plan was first made, the Group could only manage to complete the \ndrilling work for two new wells in January 2023 and one in February 2023. As for the planned drilling of the \nother three new wells, the plan is currently held up pending for further evaluation as based on the production \ndata that the Group has collected from the local government authorities for the oilfields located near the \ntarget new wells, and the updated geological information including seismic data of the target new wells \nand the oilfields nearby, the production of the target new wells may not meet the desired level as originally \nanticipated. In respect of the 2023 drilling plan, the work is progressing as planned except that the number \nof new wells to be drilled on a target site will be 8 instead of 14 while the forecasted production from the \nnew wells will remain the same. After further study of the geological information of the target site, the Group \ndecided to employ a different horizontal drilling technique which could be more cost effective than the one \noriginally planned, with the result that less wells will be drilled while the forecasted production level will \nremain the same. In respect of the drilling plans for 29 new wells in 2024 and 2025, based on the production \ndata of nearby oilfields and geological information recently collected, together with other technical reasons, \nthe plans will be revised with 14, 10 and 5 new wells to be drilled in 2024, 2025 and 2026, adding up to the \nsame number of new wells as originally planned. Primarily owing to the change of drilling plan for 2022 and \nthe completion time of the three new wells were deferred to before the end of February 2023, it caused a \nvariance to the cashflow expected to be generated from the Canadian Oil Assets in 2022.\nSolar Energy\nIn recent years, major countries in the world are actively formulating their energy policies to curb carbon \nemissions and it is the Group’s business strategy to expand its footprints in the energy sector through \ninvesting in renewable energy assets, including solar energy projects, which could support the Group’s \nhealthy and sustainable business development. On 23 July 2021, in order to capture the business \nopportunities in decarbonisation, the Group entered into the Cooperation Agreement with a specialist \nsolar energy total solution and services provider to invest in solar energy power generation projects, from \nwhich the electricity generated can be sold to the two power companies and thereby earning the feed-in \ntariff income under the FiT Scheme. Moreover, for further development of the solar energy business, on 30 \nAugust 2021, the Group entered into the Acquisition Agreement to acquire a portfolio of existing and to-be-\ncompleted solar energy power generation projects which are participating in the FiT Scheme. Further details \nof the transactions were stated in the Company’s announcements dated 23 July 2021, 30 August 2021 and 16 \nSeptember 2021."

Business units are responsible for identifying, assessing and monitoring risks (including ESG risks) \nassociated with their respective units regularly. The results of the assessment are reported to the management \nwhich subsequently assesses the likelihood of risk occurrence, provides remedial plan and monitors the \nprogress of rectification with the assistance of the head of the business units. The results of the assessment \nand effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems have been reported to the \nAudit Committee.\nIn connection with the controls on compliance aspect, guidelines are provided to the directors, officers, \nmanagement and relevant staff in handling and disseminating sensitive and confidential inside information \nwith due care. Only personnel at appropriate level can get reach of the sensitive and confidential inside \ninformation.\nThe Group does not have an internal audit function due to the size of the Group and consideration for \ncost effectiveness. Instead, the Company had engaged an external consultant to conduct a review on the \nGroup’s risk management and internal control systems to identify and evaluate significant risks (including \nESG risks) of the business operations for the year ended 31 December 2022. The Board believes that the \ninvolvement of the external consultant could enhance the objectivity and transparency of the evaluation \nprocess. The external consultant has conducted an annual review to identify risks (including ESG risks) that \ncould potentially impact the businesses of the Group, review key operational and financial processes as well \nas regulatory compliance and information security, and assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s \nrisk management and internal control systems. The review covered all material controls, including financial, \noperational and compliance controls. After the review, a Risk Management and Internal Control Report (the \n“RM and IC Report”) with findings and recommendations for improvement in relation to the systems has \nbeen provided to the Audit Committee and the management. The RM and IC Report has been endorsed by the \nAudit Committee and the management is required to establish remedial plans and take actions to rectify those \ninternal control deficiencies identified (which are all at low risk level) according to its respective risk level and \npriorities. Subsequent review will be performed by the external consultant to monitor the implementation of \nthose agreed recommendations and to report the results of the follow-up review to the Audit Committee.\nAfter reviewing the RM and IC Report, the Board is not aware of any significant risk management and internal \ncontrol weaknesses or inconsistencies with the Group’s risk management and internal control policies, and \nconsiders the existing risk management and internal control systems are effective and adequate. The Board \nis also of the opinion that the Group has adequate financial and human resources for its accounting and \nfinancial reporting function as well as those relating to the Group’s ESG performance. The Company has \ncomplied with the relevant code provisions of the CG Code relating to risk management and internal control."

Therefore, the Group is committed to maintaining the long-term sustainability of \nthe environment and community where the Group operates, and thus integrated environmental and \nsocial consideration into its decision making process and assumes the responsibilities of creating an \nenvironmentally sustainable business.\nAs the Group is engaged in the petroleum exploration and production business, it inevitably \ngenerates emissions and other pollutants during daily operations. Therefore, the Group recognises \nthe importance of continuous improvement on ESG performance and its responsibilities towards \nthe potential negative environmental impacts associated with its business operations, and thus has \nestablished relevant internal guidelines to ensure strict compliance with all local environmental-related \nlaws and regulations, as well as focuses on nurturing and strengthening its employees’ awareness of \nenvironmental protection in their daily work processes.\nOwing to the nature of the Canadian Oil Assets operation, GHG emissions from consumption of \ndifferent types of fuel and energy, together with hazardous and non-hazardous waste arising from \noperation will be inevitably produced, which will be discussed in the sections “A1. Emissions” and “A2. \nUse Of Resources” below. The daily operations of the oilfield, new wells drilling and other production \nenhancement activities consume different types of fuel and energy including (i) electricity and propane \nconsumed mainly for well fluid extraction from wells, water separation from the well fluid, and water \ninjection back into underground, and (ii) diesel and propane consumed mainly for running rigs for new \nwells drilling and other production enhancement works. The consumption of fuel and energy generated \nScope 1 GHG emissions, and purchased electricity generated Scope 2 GHG emissions. In addition, \nhazardous wastes including waste oil and fluid, and non-hazardous wastes including drill cuttings, will \nbe produced from the daily operations, new wells drilling and other production enhancement activities \nof the Canadian Oil Assets.\nThe Group commenced its solar energy business in 2021 through investing in solar energy power \ngeneration projects located in Hong Kong, under which solar photovoltaic (“SPV”) systems built are \nconnected to the power grid of CLP Power Hong Kong (“CLP”) under the Renewable Energy Feed-in \nTariff Scheme (the “FiT Scheme”), and electricity produced by the SPV systems is supplied and sold \nto CLP. The FiT Scheme is an initiative promoted by the two power companies and the Hong Kong \nGovernment aiming to incentivise the private sector to produce clean energy for consumption in \nHong Kong, which also serves as an important mean of the government’s plan of achieving carbon \nneutrality before 2025. The Group has successfully integrated the environmental protection aspect of \nits ESG-initiatives into a viable business model, and is committed to continue contributing its efforts \nin promoting the use of clean and renewable energy and building a greener environment for the \ncommunity.\nOwing to the change in reporting scope during the Reporting Period, the Group considered its ESG \ntargets set in 2021 were no longer applicable, and thus has revised its ESG targets in 2022. The revised \ntargets are described in the sections headed “Air and GHG Emissions”, “Waste Management” and \n“Energy Conservation Measures” below."

For the Group’s office-based operation in Hong Kong and Canada, its employees \nspend most of their working hours inside the office, implying that indoor air quality at workplace is \nof paramount importance. Therefore, indoor air quality is constantly monitored and improved by the \nutilisation of several measures. Such measures include cleaning air-conditioning systems regularly and \nchoosing products with low or zero volatile organic compounds where applicable. By adopting these \nmeasures, indoor air quality of the Group’s offices is maintained.\nA4.\t\nClimate Change\nClimate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and cause \ncatastrophic damage. Climate change is also changing seasonal and annual patterns of temperature, \nprecipitation, and other weather phenomena. The unprecedented crisis from the global spread of \nCOVID-19 has created significant challenges worldwide while the risks of climate change are imminent. \nUnderstanding of these trends and their relationships with the Group’s businesses can help the Group \nto prepare and analyse possible risks and opportunities, seize opportunities of potential benefits, and \nestablish the response capacity of the Group in the long-run. The Group believes that a robust response \nto climate change requires concerted efforts of all stakeholders. Therefore, it will continuously identify \nand address stakeholders’ expectations to optimise its environmental measures in order to achieve \nsustainable development and create long-term values for the stakeholders and society as a whole.\nTo handle the intensified threat of climate change, the Group has assessed the potential risks that may \narise from its business operations. These risks mainly stem from the following dimensions:\nPhysical Risks\nFor physical risks, increase in severity of extreme weather events such as stronger typhoons and floods, \nmay interrupt the water and electricity supplies, damage the Group’s properties, as well as threaten the \nsafety of the Group’s employees. This may cause interruption to the normal business operations and \nthus have an adverse effect on the Group’s financial performance.\nThe Group has implemented different measures to manage the abovementioned physical risks. For \nexample, the Group maintains comprehensive insurance coverage on assets that are prone to damage \nby extreme weather conditions. In addition, the Group has established the practice of communicating \nthe arrangements for extreme weather events to employees in advance. The Group recognises potential \nfinancial impacts can be minimised with adequate preparation for extreme weather events.\nTransition Risks\nFor transition risks, the Group expects policies and regulations in relation to climate change will \nbecome increasingly stringent. If the Group’s existing compliance procedures and business operations \ncould not fully comply with the new legal and regulatory requirements, it might incur additional \ncompliance costs and the reputation of the Group may also be adversely affected. In addition, the high-\ncarbon emitting industry will suffer from higher cost, lower returns or asset devaluation. Related climate \nchange risk might also impose an impact to the Group’s investment and financing activities regarding \nrelated industries."

For the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements information \nis considered material if such information is reasonably expected to influence decisions made by \nprimary users. In addition, the consolidated financial statements include applicable disclosures \nrequired by the Listing Rules and by the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for \ncertain financial instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period, \nas explained in the accounting policies set out below.\nHistorical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for \ngoods and services.\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an \norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether \nthat price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating \nthe fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the \nasset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing \nthe asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure \npurposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for \nshare-based payment transactions that are within the scope of HKFRS 2 “Share-based payment”, \nleasing transactions that are accounted for in accordance with HKFRS 16, and measurements that \nhave some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in HKAS 2 \n“Inventories” or value in use in HKAS 36 “Impairment of assets”.\nFor financial instruments which are transacted at fair value and a valuation technique that \nunobservable inputs are to be used to measure fair value in subsequent periods, the valuation \ntechnique is calibrated so that at initial recognition the results of the valuation technique equals \nthe transaction price."

Control is achieved when the Company:\n•\t\nhas power over the investee;\n•\t\nis exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and\n•\t\nhas the ability to use its power to affect its returns.\nThe Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate \nthat there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.\nConsolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and \nceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a \nsubsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of \nprofit or loss and other comprehensive income from the date the Group gains control until the \ndate when the Group ceases to control the subsidiary."

Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is \nattributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results \nin the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\nWhere necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their \naccounting policies in line with the Group’s accounting policies.\nAll intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to \ntransactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.\nNon-controlling interests in subsidiaries are presented separately from the Group’s equity \ntherein, which represent present ownership entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net \nassets of the relevant subsidiaries upon liquidation.\nChanges in the Group’s interests in existing subsidiaries\nWhen the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are \nderecognised. A gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss and is calculated as the difference \nbetween (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of \nany retained interest and (ii) the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary \nattributable to the owners of the Company. All amounts previously recognised in other \ncomprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had \ndirectly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified to profit or \nloss or transferred to another category of equity as specified/permitted by applicable HKFRSs).\nInterests in subsidiaries\nInterests in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment loss.\nInvestment in joint operations\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the \narrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the joint \narrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, \nwhich exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the \nparties sharing control.\nThe Group accounts for the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to its interest in \na joint operation in accordance with the HKFRSs applicable to the particular assets, liabilities, \nrevenues and expenses."

Lease payments on short-term leases are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis or \nanother systematic basis over the lease term."

The recoverable amount is \ndetermined for the cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units to which the \ncorporate asset belongs, and is compared with the carrying amount of the relevant cash-\ngenerating unit or group of cash-generating units.\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing \nvalue in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax \ndiscount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks \nspecific to the asset (or a cash-generating unit) for which the estimates of future cash flows have \nnot been adjusted.\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or a cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than \nits carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is reduced to \nits recoverable amount. For corporate assets or portion of corporate assets which cannot be \nallocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to a cash-generating unit, the Group compares \nthe carrying amount of a group of cash-generating units, including the carrying amounts of the \ncorporate assets or portion of corporate assets allocated to that group of cash-generating units, \nwith the recoverable amount of the group of cash-generating units. In allocating the impairment \nloss, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill (if \napplicable) and then to the other assets on a pro-rata basis based on the carrying amount of each \nasset in the unit or the group of cash-generating units. The carrying amount of an asset is not \nreduced below the highest of its fair value less costs of disposal (if measurable), its value in use \n(if determinable) and zero.

If it is not probable that the relevant taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax \ntreatment, the effect of each uncertainty is reflected by using either the most likely amount or \nthe expected value.\nEmployee benefits\nRetirement benefits costs\nPayments to state-managed retirement benefit schemes and Mandatory Provident Fund Scheme \n(“MPF Scheme”) and the Canada Pension Fund are recognised as an expense when employees \nhave rendered service entitling them to the contributions."

At the end of each reporting \nperiod, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest \nbased on assessment of all relevant non-market vesting conditions. The impact of the revision \nof the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense \nreflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the share options reserve. \nFor share options that vest immediately at the date of grant, the fair value of the share options \ngranted is expensed immediately to profit or loss.\nWhen share options are exercised, the amount previously recognised in share-based payments \nreserve will be transferred to share premium.

The estimates and underlying \nassumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. \nActual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting \nestimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that \nperiod, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future \nperiods.\nCritical judgments in applying accounting policies\nThe following are the critical judgments, apart from those involving estimations (see below), that \nthe directors of the Company have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies \nand that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial \nstatements.\nJudgment on whether there has been significant increase in credit risk in respect of the Group’s financial \nassets\nThe management assesses whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk for exposures \nsince initial recognition in respect of the Group’s loan and interest receivables and debt instruments at \nFVTOCI. If there has been a significant increase in credit risk, the Group will measure the loss allowance \nbased on lifetime ECL rather than 12-month ECL. In assessing whether the credit risk of an asset has \nsignificantly increased, the Group takes into account qualitative factors and quantitative modelling to \nsupport reasonable and supportable forward-looking information available without undue cost or effort \nwith significant judgments involved. The Group determines individually whether the loan and interest \nreceivables and debt instruments at FVTOCI have been credit impaired when one or more events that \nhave a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows have occurred. In addition, judgement \nis involved to assess whether a change in the contractual terms of the Group’s loan and interest \nreceivables and debt instruments at FVTOCI would lead to (1) an increase in credit risk; and (2) the need \nto derecognise the existing loan and interest receivables and debt instruments at FVTOCI and recognise \nnew loan and interest receivables and debt instruments at FVTOCI. The information about the ECL and \nthe Group’s loan and interest receivables and debt instruments at FVTOCI are disclosed in Notes 37, 22 \nand 21 respectively."

Appropriate impairment allowance is recognised in profit or loss.\nIn assessing whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group \ncompares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the reporting date with the \none as at the date of initial recognition. In making this assessment, the loan and interest receivables \nfrom borrowers are assessed individually by the management of the Group, based on the financial \nbackground, financial condition and the historical settlement records, including past due dates and \ndefault rates, of each borrower and reasonable and supportable forward-looking information (such as \nmacroeconomic factors including Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) growth and unemployment rate with \nadjustment on different scenarios of economic environment prospect) that is available without undue \ncost or effort.\nEach borrower is assigned a risk grading under internal credit ratings to calculate the ECL, taking into \nconsideration of the estimates of expected cash shortfalls which are driven by estimates of possibility of \ndefault and the amount and timing of cash flows that are expected from foreclosure on the collaterals \n(if any) less the costs of selling the collaterals. At every reporting date, the financial background, \nfinancial condition and the historical settlement records are reassessed and changes in the forward-\nlooking information are considered.\nThe management further assesses the amount of exposure of default to assess the potential loss as a \nresult of the risk on credit-impaired loan and interest receivables to which the Group is exposed and \ntake appropriate corrective actions. In assessing the amount of exposure of default, the Group takes \ninto account the timing of cash flows that are expected from foreclosure on the collaterals less the costs \nof selling the collaterals.\nThe provision of ECL is sensitive to changes in estimates. Owing to greater financial uncertainty \ntriggered by the COVID epidemic, the Group has increased the expected loss rates in the current \nyear as there is higher risk that a prolonged pandemic could led to increased credit default rates. The \ninformation about the ECL and the Group’s loan and interest receivables are disclosed in Notes 37 and \n22 respectively."

The determination of the loss allowances is dependent on the external macro environment \nand the credit rating of each debt securities. The management takes into consideration historical data \nfrom the international rating agency.\nThe Group determines individually whether the issuers of the debt instruments have been credit \nimpaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows \nhave occurred. Evidence that the debt instruments at FVTOCI are credit-impaired includes observable \ndata including significant financial difficulty of the issuer; and the issuer is engaging in business that is \nunstable.\nThe provision of ECL involves significant estimates and judgments, including determination of whether \nthere is significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, use of assumptions in determination \nof probability of default and loss given default, incorporation of forward looking information. \nThe information about the ECL and the Group’s financial assets are disclosed in Notes 37 and 21 \nrespectively.\nAt 31 December 2022, the carrying amounts of debt instruments at FVTOCI was HK$33,739,000 (2021: \nHK$78,396,000) with provision of ECL of HK$11,081,000 (2021: HK$49,247,000) recognised during the \nyear.\nEstimated impairment of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets\nProperty, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets are stated at costs less accumulated depreciation \nand impairment, if any. In determining whether an asset is impaired, the Group has to exercise \njudgment and make estimation, particularly in assessing whether an event has occurred or any \nindicators that may affect the recoverable amount of the assets. In estimating the value in use, the net \npresent value of future cash flows which are estimated based upon the continued use of the asset and \nkey assumptions applied, including cash flow projections and an appropriate discount rate. When it is \nnot possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset (including right-of-use assets), \nthe Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the assets belongs, \nincluding allocation of corporate assets when a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be \nestablished, otherwise recoverable amount is determined at the smallest group of cash generating \nunits, for which the relevant corporate assets have been allocated. Changing the assumptions and \nestimates, including the discount rates or the growth rate in the cash flow projections, could materially \naffect the recoverable amounts."

However, since the trade receivables are due from reputable oil distributors \nin Canada with good settlement history and a major electrical power company (2021: a major electrical \npower company) in Hong Kong of good creditability, the management considers that the Group’s credit \nrisk is low and ECL is minimal at 31 December 2022 and 2021.\nOther receivables and deposits\nFor other receivables and deposits, the management assessed individually on the recoverability of \nother receivables and deposits based on the financial background, financial condition and historical \nsettlement records of the debtors, and also quantitative and qualitative information that is reasonable \nand supportive forward-looking information. The management believes that there are no significant \nincrease in credit risk of other receivables and deposits of HK$10,713,000 (2021: HK$946,000) since \ninitial recognition and the Group performs impairment assessment based on 12m ECL. For the year \nended 31 December 2022 and 2021, the Group assessed the ECL for these other receivables and \ndeposits as insignificant and thus no loss allowance is recognised.\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2021, the management considered that the counterparty of the \ndeposits held for the petroleum exploration and production business in Argentina was in financial \ndifficulty since initial recognition and thus the amount of HK$1,680,000 was written-off.\nLoan and interest receivables\nAt 31 December 2022, the carrying amount of loan and interest receivables was HK$60,852,000 (2021: \nHK$115,001,000).

The Group assesses the financial strengths \nand performance of the issuers in satisfying the repayment of principal and interest of the debt \ninstruments as they fall due.

In managing liquidity risk, the Group monitors and maintains sufficient funds \nto meet all its potential liabilities as they fall due, including shareholder distributions. It is applicable to \nnormal market conditions as well as negative projections against expected outcomes, so as to avoid any \nrisk of incurring contractual penalties or damaging the Group’s reputation.\nThe following table details the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities based \non the agreed repayment terms.\nFor non-derivative financial liabilities, the table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash \nflows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The \ntable includes both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, \nthe undiscounted amount is derived from interest in effect at the end of the reporting period.\nLiquidity table\nWeighted \naverage \ninterest rate\nOn demand\n or less than \n1 month\n1 to 6 months\n7 months to \n1 year\nOver 1 year\n Total \nundiscounted \ncash flows\nCarrying \namount\n%\nHK$’000\nHK$’000\nHK$’000\nHK$’000\nHK$’000\nHK$’000\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt 31 December 2022\nNon-derivative financial liabilities\nOther payables\n–\n17,624\n–\n–\n–\n17,624\n17,624\nLease liabilities\n3.41\n187\n116\n139\n2,782\n3,224\n2,725\n \n \n \n \n \n \n17,811\n116\n139\n2,782\n20,848\n20,349\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt 31 December 2021\nNon-derivative financial liabilities\nTrade payables\n–\n129\n–\n–\n–\n129\n129\nOther payables\n–\n7,941\n–\n–\n–\n7,941\n7,941\n \n \n \n \n \n \n8,070\n–\n–\n–\n8,070\n8,070\nLease liabilities\n3.41\n141\n706\n847\n3,387\n5,081\n4,394\n \n \n \n \n \n \n8,211\n706\n847\n3,387\n13,151\n12,464"
