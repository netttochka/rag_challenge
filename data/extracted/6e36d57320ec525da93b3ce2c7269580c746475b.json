      "text": "Dear Shareholders, \n2022 was a challenging year for DiaMedica, facing the headwinds of enrolling a clinical trial during \na global pandemic combined with an unexpected voluntary pause in our ReMEDy2 Phase 2b/3 trial \nto further refine our dosing regimen of DM199. Despite these hurdles, I am pleased to report that the \nDiaMedica team has risen to the challenge to address these issues.  We remain steadfastly focused to \nbring DM199 to acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients – a leading cause of long-term disability and \nimpairment in adults - and to provide the first new pharmaceutical therapy for AIS in more than 25 \nyears. \nLet us recap the key challenges we encountered related to our ReMEDy2 trial and the steps we have \ntaken to resume full clinical trial activities. \nFirst, in early 2022, we were beginning to gain momentum in engaging clinical study sites and trial \nenrollment, both were drastically hindered by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We were able \nto identify key operational bottlenecks and deploy additional resources to support our clinical teams \nto make it simpler for investigators and qualified patients to participate in the ReMEDy2 trial. Today, \nthankfully, we believe that the constraints that were created due to the COVID-19 crisis have \nmarkedly abated and we anticipate timelier study site engagement and patient enrollment when the \nReMEDy2 trial resumes. \nSecondly, during the conduct of ReMEDy2 trial, three study participants were reported to experience \na sudden drop in blood pressure, or hypotension, when the intravenous (IV) dose of DM199 was \nadministered. Though DM199 is known to have blood pressure lowering effects, these episodes of \nsudden hypotension had not been observed in any prior clinical trial of DM199. The blood pressure \nof these participants recovered rapidly after the IV administration was discontinued, and the \nparticipants suffered no injuries; however, we had to further understand the cause of the unexpected \nhypotension. Therefore, in May 2022, we chose to voluntarily halt enrollment in the study until we \ncould investigate the cause. After reporting these adverse events to the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA), the FDA agreed with our decision to halt enrollment and issued a clinical \nhold for our ReMEDy2 trial. We have been in ongoing communication with the FDA to align with a \ncomprehensive analysis plan.  I am pleased to report that we have recently completed the analysis \nand have identified the key issues that we believe will satisfy the FDA’s requirements and allow us to \nrefine the dosing procedures. A final report to the FDA will be submitted along with a request to lift \nthe clinical hold. \nWhile 2022 was challenging on the clinical front, we made significant strides in broadening the \nexperience and capabilities of our management team. Kirsten Gruis, M.D. joined DiaMedica as our \nChief Medical Officer, Dominic Cundari joined as our Chief Commercial Officer and Julie Daves \njoined as our Senior Vice President, Clinical Development Operations. Kirsten has over 20 years of \nexperience in clinical medicine and drug development at both small and large biopharmaceutical \ncompanies, including as Head of the Neuromuscular Franchise at Roche.  Dom has over 30 years of \nexperience at Genentech, where he led the product launch of ACTIVASE® (tissue plasminogen \nactivator, or tPA) for acute ischemic stroke. Julie is a recognized leader in managing global clinical \nstudies with over two decades of clinical development operations experience across a wide breadth of \npharmaceutical therapeutic areas, including Phase 3 pivotal programs."

      "text": "We also added key regulatory expertise to our Board of Directors. In March 2023, Tanya Lewis, a \nrecognized leader in the biopharma industry, with over 25 years of experience in global drug \ndevelopment, having played a key role in the approval of multiple new drugs, joined our Board. Ms. \nLewis currently serves as the Chief Development Operations Officer at Replimune Group, Inc. where \nshe has oversight for development of an integrated clinical, regulatory and CMC strategy for the \nsuccessful registration of the company’s compounds including: VELCADE®, VARUBI®, \nINTEGRILIN® and ZEJULA®. \nOur cash position remains strong with $33.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable \nsecurities as of December 31, 2022. We anticipate this will take us into the fourth quarter of calendar \nyear 2024. \n2022 forced us to deal with situations that provided us the opportunity to learn from those \nexperiences.  As a result, we used this time to update our practices, strengthen our protocols and \nimprove our clinical investor brochure. Upon re-starting the ReMEDy2 trial, we are confident we \nwill see a smoother transition from activating study sites to identifying and enrolling participants. \nWe remain very excited about the potential for DM199 as a therapeutic treatment. The blood \npressure drops which gave rise to the clinical hold are an indication that DM199 is biologically \nactive. The team is committed to establishing the correct IV dose to avoid similar blood pressure \ndrops going forward. With that, we will be able to focus on resuming the ReMEDy2 trial and \nclinically advancing what we expect will be the first new therapeutic tool for neurologists to use in \ntreating acute ischemic stroke for the millions of patients around the world with no other treatment \noptions. \nWe recognize that we cannot execute our strategy without the purposeful work and perseverance of \nour talented colleagues of dedicated professionals who have worked tirelessly in 2022.  And, of \ncourse, underlying our efforts are our shareholders, and we are deeply grateful for your support. \nWith Best Wishes, \nRick Pauls \nRichard Pilnik \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nChairman of the Board"

      "text": "17 \nVOTING PROPOSAL THREE—APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO ARTICLES REGARDING \nDIRECTOR NOMINATIONS BY SHAREHOLDERS  \n________________ \nBackground \nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved new universal proxy rules to, \namong other things, mandate the use of a universal proxy card in public solicitations involving contested \ndirector elections.  The universal proxy rules became effective for shareholder meetings held after August \n31, 2022.  It is generally thought that these new rules will lead to more proxy contests.  \nArticle 10 of our current Articles does not provide for the universal proxy rules, nor does it specify the \ninformation that must be included in a shareholder notice related to a proposed director nominee, and our \nBoard of Directors believes that it would be beneficial to amend our Articles to incorporate the universal \nproxy rules, tailoring them to DiaMedica, and to incorporate additional advance notice provisions to \nensure that, should there be a contested election, the nomination and election process is orderly and \nDiaMedica has sufficient information to ensure that a dissident’s interests are fully disclosed to \nDiaMedica and our shareholders.   \nAccordingly, on March 9, 2023, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Nominating and \nCorporate Governance Committee, approved, subject to shareholder approval, a proposed amendment to \nour Articles to enhance the procedural mechanics and disclosure requirements relating to director \nnominations made by our shareholders in order to make reference to the SEC’s universal proxy rules, to \nensure an orderly nomination and election process, and to ensure that a dissident’s interests are fully \ndisclosed to DiaMedica and our shareholders.  These objectives and related benefits to DiaMedica and our \nshareholders are described below. \nText of Proposed Articles Amendment  \nOur Articles currently do not reflect the universal proxy rules, nor do they provide advance notice \nprovisions apart from satisfying the minimum requirements under the British Columbia Business \nCorporations Act (BCBCA).  To incorporate these matters in our Articles, we propose to amend Article \n10 by adding Article 10.10, which is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix A. \nReasons for Proposed Articles Amendment \nDue to a change in SEC rules, known as the universal proxy rules, many U.S. public companies have \nrevised provisions in their governing documents requiring advance notice requirements in the event of \ndirector nominations from our shareholders to incorporate these new rules and add additional \nrequirements.  The universal proxy rules apply to public companies regardless of whether or not a \ncompany has otherwise incorporated the rules into its governing documents.  However, because the \nuniversal proxy rules set forth the minimum standards but permit companies to, among other things, \nincrease how far in advance notice under the universal proxy rules is required to be provided, many U.S. \npublic companies have revised their advance notice provisions to better tailor these requirements to their \ninterests as well as the interests of their shareholders, including specifying how far in advance notice \nunder the universal proxy rules is required to be provided.  The proposed Articles amendment would \nincorporate these provisions and would set forth other related requirements.  \nUnder the proposed Articles amendment, notice of a director nomination by a shareholder must generally \nbe provided not later than 5:00 p.m., CDT, on the 90th day nor earlier than 5:00 p.m., CDT, on the 120th \nday prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual general meeting of shareholders.

For example, the proposed Articles amendment provides that if \napplicable procedures are not followed, DiaMedica may disregard any proxies or votes solicited for any \nproposed nominees on DiaMedica’s proxy card other than DiaMedica’s nominees and such nomination \nwill be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in favor thereof may have been received by DiaMedica.  \nOur Board of Directors believe incorporating these provisions is in the best interests of DiaMedica as well \nas our shareholders since they would establish a framework more robust than the minimums established \nin the universal proxy rules. \nAdditionally, our current Articles do not include advance notice provisions for the nomination of directors \nby our shareholders.  As currently drafted, our Articles require our shareholders to submit nominations in \nwriting to our Corporate Secretary in accordance with the BCBCA. Nominations must be delivered to or \nmailed and received at our registered office no later than the close of business on the date that is three \nmonths before the anniversary of the previous year’s annual reference date. The submission must satisfy \nthe requirements of the BCBCA.  However, we may include requirements that go beyond the minimum \nrequirements of the BCBCA.  The Board of Directors believes that, in light of the updates being made to \naddress the universal proxy rules, this is also an appropriate time to enhance our advance notice \nprocedures in order to ensure an orderly nomination and election process and ensure that DiaMedica has \nsufficient information, beyond what is required by the BCBCA, to ensure that a dissident’s interests are \nfully disclosed to DiaMedica and our shareholders. These new provisions would, among other things: \n \nRequire notice to be provided by a shareholder not later than the 90th day nor earlier than the 120th \nday prior to the annual general meeting at which the shareholder wishes to submit a director \nnominee, subject to certain exceptions, or not later than the 10th day following the day on which \npublic announcement of the date of a special meeting is made by DiaMedica; \n \nSpecify information required to be included in the notice about the proposed nominee, including \nall information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies \nfor the election of directors in a contested election, or is otherwise required, the proposed \nnominee’s written consent to serving as a director for the entire term, and a statement whether \nsuch proposed nominee would comply with all applicable Company policies. \n \nSpecify information required to be included in the notice about each nominating shareholder and \nany beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made, including the name \nand address of such parties, the class or series and number of DiaMedica’s shares owned by such \nparties, the existence of certain agreements or arrangements, and certain other specified \ninformation known to such persons.  \n \nRequire compliance with the SEC’s universal proxy rules.  \n \nRequire the proposed nominee to complete a written questionnaire and provide a written \nrepresentation and agreement in the form provided by DiaMedica. \nFor the reasons stated above, on March 9, 2023, our Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the \nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee, approved, subject to shareholder approval, a \nproposed amendment to our Articles to enhance the procedural mechanics and disclosure requirements \nrelating to director nominations made by our shareholders in order to make reference to the SEC’s \nuniversal proxy rules, to ensure an orderly nomination and election process, and to ensure that a \ndissident’s interests are fully disclosed to DiaMedica and our shareholders."

      "text": "21 \n \nVOTING PROPOSAL FOUR—APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO ARTICLES REGARDING \nBOARD AUTHORITY TO FIX NUMBER OF DIRECTORS  \n________________ \nBackground \nPursuant to Article 13.1 of our current Articles, the number of directors is set at the greater of three and \nthe most recently set of (i) the number of directors set by ordinary resolution (whether or not previous \nnotice of the resolution was given); and (ii) the number of directors set pursuant to Article 14.4, which \naddresses circumstances in which the places of retiring directors are not filled. Accordingly, Article 13.1 \ncurrently gives our shareholders, as well as the Board of Directors, the ability to fix the number of \ndirectors on our Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors believes that vesting this power solely in the \nBoard of Directors is better aligned with typical corporate governance practices and decreases the \nlikelihood of an unsolicited take-over attempt.  \nAccordingly, on March 9, 2023, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Nominating and \nCorporate Governance Committee, approved, subject to shareholder approval, a proposed amendment to \nour Articles to provide that only the Board of Directors fix the number of directors, taking into account \nthe benefits to DiaMedica and our shareholders, which are described below.  \nText of Proposed Articles Amendment \nOur Articles currently provide that the number of directors on our Board of Directors may be set by \nordinary resolution of our shareholders.  To ensure our Articles are aligned with typical corporate \ngovernance practices and decrease the likelihood of an unsolicited take-over attempt, we propose to \namend Articles 13.1 and 13.2 so that each would state in its entirety as follows (new language is double \nunderlined and deleted language is stricken): \n13.1 \nFirst Director; Number of Directors \nThe first directors are the persons designated as directors of the Company in the Notice of \nArticles that applies to the Company when it is recognized under the Business Corporations Act. \nThe number of directors, excluding additional directors appointed under Article 14.8, is set at: \n(a) \nif the Company is a public company, the greater of three and the most recently set of: \n \n(i) \nthe number of directors set by ordinary resolution (whether or not previous notice \nof the resolution was given); the board of directors; and \n \n(ii) \nthe number of directors set under Article 14.4. \n(b) \nif the Company is not a public company, the greater of the most recently set of: \n \n(i) \nthe number of directors set by the board of directors; and \n \n(ii)  \nthe number of directors set under Article 14.4."

      "text": "22 \n13.2 \nElection or Appointment of Directors \nIf the number of directors is set under Article 13.1(a)(i) or 13.1(b)(i): \n(a) \nthe shareholders may elect or appoint the directors needed to fill any vacancies in the \nboard of directors up to that number; \n(b) \nif the shareholders do not elect or appoint the directors needed to fill any vacancies in the \nboard of directors up to that number contemporaneously with the setting of that number, then the \ndirectors, subject to Article 14.8, may appoint, or the shareholders may elect or appoint, directors \nto fill those vacancies.  \nReasons for Proposed Articles Amendment \nWe believe the proposed Articles amendment to provide that only the Board of Directors fix the number \nof directors would be in the best interests of DiaMedica as well as our shareholders for two reasons.  First, \nwe believe it more closely conforms to the corporate governance practices of U.S. public companies, \nwhich generally provide that only the board of directors fix the number of directors.  Our Board of \nDirectors believes that it is in the best interests of DiaMedica and our shareholders for our corporate \ngovernance practices to be aligned with the standard practices of other U.S. public companies while \nremaining tailored to the needs of DiaMedica and compliant with the BCBCA.  Our Board of Directors \nbelieves the proposed amendment satisfies this objective by better aligning our Articles with the \ngoverning documents of similarly situated public companies with securities listed on a U.S. national \nsecurities exchange. \nSecond, this change decreases the likelihood of an unsolicited take-over attempt.  As currently drafted, the \nArticles would permit an activist or hostile shareholder to propose an increase to our Board of Directors \nwith a view to have its own board members elected and eventually gain control of the Board of Directors.  \nAn activist or hostile shareholder may take this action in order to eventually influence the direction of \nDiaMedica in a manner that is favorable to them, which may not be beneficial to DiaMedica or other \nshareholders.  Such an attempt could ultimately have the effect of adversely impacting the strategic \ndirection of DiaMedica, divert management attention and other resources away from our current strategic \nobjectives, and otherwise cause instability within DiaMedica, any of which may hinder our business plans \nand decrease the value of our common shares as a result.  Approving the proposed amendment to our \nArticles would prohibit a shareholder from having the ability to increase the size of the Board of \nDirectors, providing DiaMedica and our shareholders protection from the effects described above and \nensuring greater stability in DiaMedica’s trajectory.   \nThe proposed amendment to our Articles additionally stipulates that, if DiaMedica is no longer a public \ncompany, the number of directors would be either the number of directors set by the Board of Directors or \nthe number of directors set under Article 14.4.  This removes the requirement that our Board of Directors \nbe comprised of at least three directors in the event that DiaMedica is no longer a public company, which \nis a standard imposed by the Nasdaq Listing Rules.  The Board of Directors believes that making this \nupdate would provide DiaMedica with greater flexibility in the event that DiaMedica was no longer a \npublic company and, therefore, no longer required to comply with the Nasdaq Listing Rules.  \nFor the reasons stated above, on March 9, 2023, our Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the \nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee, approved, subject to shareholder approval, a \nproposed amendment to our Articles to provide that only the Board of Directors fix the number of \ndirectors."

The lead director will have the following duties and responsibilities in addition to such \nother duties and responsibilities as may be determined by the Board of Directors from time to time. \n \nchairing the executive sessions of the independent directors and calling meetings of the \nindependent directors; \n \ndetermining the agenda for the executive sessions of the independent directors and participating \nwith the Chairman of the Board in establishing the agenda for Board meetings; \n \ncoordinating feedback among the independent directors and the Chief Executive Officer; \n \noverseeing the development of appropriate responses to communications from shareholders and \nother interested persons addressed to the independent directors as a group; \n \non behalf of the independent directors, retaining legal counsel or other advisors as they deem \nappropriate in the conduct of their duties and responsibilities; and \n \nperforming such other duties as the Board of Directors deems appropriate from time to time. \nMr. Pilnik currently serves as Chairman of the Board and Rick Pauls currently serves as President and \nChief Executive Officer. \nWe currently believe this leadership structure is in the best interests of DiaMedica and our shareholders \nand strikes the appropriate balance between the President and Chief Executive Officer’s responsibility for \nthe strategic direction, day-to-day leadership and performance of our company and the Chairman of our \nBoard’s responsibility to guide overall strategic direction of our company and provide oversight of our \ncorporate governance and guidance to our President and Chief Executive Officer and to set the agenda for \nand preside over board meetings.  We recognize that different leadership structures may be appropriate \nfor companies in different situations and believe that no one structure is suitable for all companies.

After each such executive session, and as otherwise necessary, our Chairman of the Board \nprovides our Chief Executive Officer with any actionable feedback from our independent directors.  The \nBoard of Directors met six times in executive session during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. \nDirector Independence  \nThe Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that five of DiaMedica’s current six directors are \n“independent directors” under the Nasdaq Listing Rules: Michael Giuffre, M.D., Tanya Lewis, James \nParsons, Richard Pilnik and Charles Semba, M.D.  In addition, Amy L.

In making these affirmative determinations that such \nindividuals are “independent directors,” the Board of Directors reviewed and discussed information \nprovided by the directors and by DiaMedica with regard to each director’s business and personal activities \nas they may relate to DiaMedica and our management. \nBoard Committees \nThe Board of Directors has a standing Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and \nCorporate Governance Committee.

The current members of the Compensation Committee are Dr. Giuffre,  Ms. Lewis, \nMr. Parsons, and Dr. Semba.  Dr. Giuffre is the Chair of the Compensation Committee.  The Board of \nDirectors has determined that each of the members of the Compensation Committee is an “independent \ndirector” under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, a “non-employee director” within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 \nunder the Exchange Act, and otherwise independent under the rules and regulations of the SEC. \nProcesses and Procedures for Consideration and Determination of Executive Compensation.  As \ndescribed in more detail above under “—Responsibilities,” the Board of Directors has delegated to the \nCompensation Committee the responsibility, among other things, to determine any and all compensation \npayable to our executive officers, including annual salaries, short-term incentive compensation, long-term \nincentive compensation, perquisites and any and all other compensation, and to administer our equity-\nbased compensation plans.

In making final decisions \nregarding compensation to be paid to our executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers \nseveral factors, including the benchmarking information gathered by its compensation consultants, the \nachievement by DiaMedica of pre-established performance objectives, the general performance of \nDiaMedica and the individual officers, and other factors that may be relevant. \nFinal deliberations and decisions by the Compensation Committee regarding the form and amount of \ncompensation to be paid to our executive officers are made by the Compensation Committee, without the \npresence of any executive officer of our company. \nProcesses and Procedures for Consideration and Determination of Director Compensation.  As \nmentioned above under “—Responsibilities,” the Board of Directors has delegated to the Compensation \nCommittee the responsibility, among other things, to review and make recommendations to the Board of \nDirectors concerning compensation for non-employee members of the Board of Directors, including but \nnot limited to retainers, meeting fees, committee chair and member retainers and equity compensation.  \nDecisions regarding director compensation made by the Compensation Committee are not considered \nfinal and are subject to final review and approval by the entire Board of Directors.  In making \nrecommendations to the Board of Directors regarding compensation to be paid to our non-employee \ndirectors, the Compensation Committee considers fees and other compensation paid to directors of \nbenchmark companies as gathered by its compensation consultants, the number of Board and committee \nmeetings that our directors are expected to attend, the duties and responsibilities of individual Board \nmembers, and other factors that may be relevant.  In making final decisions regarding non-employee \ndirector compensation, the Board of Directors considers the same factors and the recommendation of the \nCompensation Committee. \nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee  \nResponsibilities.

Effective as of the first trading day of each year, each of our non-\nemployee directors who elected to receive DSUs or RSUs in lieu of all or a portion of such director’s \nannual cash retainers, will be granted DSU or RSU awards under the 2019 Plan or any other shareholder-\napproved plan covering that number of shares as determined based on the following formula (rounding \ndown to the nearest whole share): \n \nthe aggregate dollar amount of the elected portion of the annual cash retainers that otherwise \nwould have been payable to the non-employee director for services to be rendered as a non-\nemployee director, Chairman of the Board and Chair or member of any Board committee during \nthe year (or transition or other period, if applicable) based on such director’s Board committee \nmemberships and Chair positions as of the date of grant, divided by \n \nthe 10-trading day average closing sale price of our common shares, as reported by the Nasdaq \nCapital Market, and as determined on the third (3rd) trading day prior to the anticipated grant date \nof the award. \nSuch DSU and RSU awards vest in four as nearly equal as possible quarterly installments, on March 31, \nJune 30, September 30 and December 31, in each case so long as the non-employee director is a director \nof DiaMedica as of such date.  DSU awards are settled following a separation from service by such \ndirector and RSU awards are settled immediately upon vesting or, if earlier, the death of the director. \nIf a non-employee director who elected to receive a DSU or RSU award in lieu of all or a portion of such \ndirector’s annual cash retainers is no longer a director of DiaMedica before such director’s interest in all \nof the shares underlying the DSU or RSU award have vested, the director will forfeit his or her rights to \nreceive all of such unvested shares on the day his or her status as a director of DiaMedica terminates.  \nHowever, shares underlying the DSU or RSU award corresponding to the elected cash retainers for such \nquarter in which the director’s status changed will vest ratably for such quarter based on the number of \ndays of service as a director of DiaMedica during such quarter. \nIf a non-employee director of DiaMedica who elected to receive a DSU or RSU award in lieu of his or her \nannual cash retainers becomes entitled to receive an increased or additional annual cash retainer during \nthe year, the director will receive such increased or additional annual cash retainer in cash until the \ndirector makes his or her election for the following year.  Conversely, if a non-employee director of \nDiaMedica who elected to receive a DSU or RSU award in lieu of such director’s annual cash retainers \nexperiences a change in committee membership or Chair positions prior to year end, such that the \naggregate amount of annual cash retainers for the year to which the director is entitled is less than the \naggregate amount used to calculate the director’s most recent DSU or RSU award, the director will forfeit \neffective as of such change his or her rights to receive the corresponding portion of the shares underlying \nsuch DSU or RSU award; provided, however, that in the event the director elected to receive only a \nportion of his or her cash retainers in the form of a DSU or RSU  award, the amount of cash retainers to \nbe received will be reduced first.  In addition, in the event shares underlying the DSU or RSU award are \nforfeited, the vesting of the DSU or RSU award will be revised accordingly as of the date of such change.   \nDirector Compensation Table \nThe table below provides summary information concerning the compensation of each individual who \nserved as a director of our company during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, other than Rick \nPauls, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who was not compensated separately for serving on the \nBoard of Directors during fiscal 2022.

This \nExecutive Compensation Overview is intended to supplement the SEC-required disclosure, which is \nincluded in this section, and it is not a Compensation Discussion and Analysis. \nCompensation Philosophy \nThe Compensation Committee generally targets executive compensation at the 50th percentile of our peer \ngroup as discussed below under “—Elements of Our Executive Compensation Program.” \nUse of Market Data  \nWe strive to compensate our executive officers competitively relative to other companies that are similar \nto us from a market capitalization, revenue, number of employees and clinical development perspective.  \nTo ensure reasonableness and competitiveness of our executive compensation packages relative to our \npeer companies, the Compensation Committee evaluates our peer group with the aid of our independent \ncompensation consultant and with input from management.  The peer group used to help determine 2022 \ncompensation was prepared by our independent compensation consultant in 2021 and consisted of the \nfollowing 15 other companies in the same industry and with similar characteristics from a market \ncapitalization, revenue, number of employees and clinical development perspective. \nAbeona Therapeutics \nAclaris Therapeutics \nActinium Pharmaceuticals \nAVEO Pharmaceuticals \nCatalyst Biosciences \nGalectin Therapeutics \nGlycoMimetics \nHeat Biologics \nIdera Pharmaceuticals \nLipocine \nOncoSec Medical \nSoleno Therapeutics \nTRACON Pharmaceuticals \nTyme Technologies \nZynerba Pharmaceuticals \nData from this peer group, therefore, was considered in the compensation benchmarking process as one \ninput in helping us determine appropriate pay levels. \nUse of Consultants \nThe Compensation Committee has the authority to engage the services of outside experts and advisors as \nit deems necessary or appropriate to carry out its duties and responsibilities, and prior to doing so, \nassesses the independence of such experts and advisors from management.

We recognize the need for most executives to receive at least a portion of their total \ncompensation in the form of a guaranteed base salary that is paid in cash regularly throughout the year.  \nThe base salaries set for our named executive officers are intended to provide a steady income regardless \nof share price performance, allowing executives to focus on both near-term and long-term goals and \nobjectives without undue reliance on short-term share price performance or market fluctuations. \nWe initially fix base salaries for our executives at a level that we believe enables us to hire and retain \nthem in a competitive environment and to reward satisfactory individual performance and a satisfactory \nlevel of contribution to our overall business objectives.

The base salary increases were \nintended to bring their base salaries closer to our target positioning in our peer group and provide for cost \nof living adjustments. Our CMO was hired in 2022 and, therefore, did not receive a base salary increase \nin 2022. \nAnnual Short-Term Incentive Compensation \nIn addition to base compensation, we provide our named executive officers the opportunity to earn short-\nterm incentive (STI) compensation based on the achievement of certain annual corporate and individual \nperformance goals.  Our STI program directly aligns the interests of our executive officers and \nshareholders by providing an incentive for the achievement of key corporate and individual performance \nobjectives that are critical to the success of our company and linking a significant portion of each \nexecutive’s annual compensation to the achievement of such objectives. \nUnder the 2022 STI program, each named executive officer had a target incentive percentage that was a \npercentage of their base salary.   \nName \nPercentage of Base Salary \nRick Pauls \n50% \nKirsten Gruis, M.D. \n40% \nScott Kellen \n40% \n2022 STI payouts were based primarily on actions taken by management after the clinical hold was \nimposed by the United States Food and Drug Administration on the investigational new drug application \nfor our ReMEDy2 trial, and to a lesser extent, our financial and operating performance, including clinical \nactivities, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 against three pre-established corporate \nperformance objectives that related to clinical development milestones and either two or three individual \nperformance objectives that related to each named executive’s corporate responsibilities. 2022 STI \npayouts were as follows: \n \n \nOfficer Name and Position  \n \n2022 Base \nSalary \nTarget Incentive \nPercentage of \nBase Salary \n \nTarget Bonus \nOpportunity \n \n2022 Actual \nPayout \nRick Pauls \n$    529,000 \n50% \n$    264,500   \n$    198,342 \nKirsten Gruis, M.D.  \n380,000 \n40% \n152,000 \n137,085 \nScott Kellen \n340,000 \n40% \n136,000 \n101,983 \nLong-Term Equity-Based Incentive Compensation \nThe long-term equity-based incentive compensation component consists of stock options granted under \nthe DiaMedica Therapeutics Inc.

Stock options also provide an effective retention mechanism because of \nvesting provisions.  An important objective of our long-term equity-based incentive program is to \nstrengthen the relationship between the long-term value of our common shares and the potential financial \ngain for our executives.  Stock options provide recipients with the opportunity to purchase our common \nshares at a price fixed on the grant date regardless of future market price.  Because stock options become \nvaluable only if the share price increases above the exercise price and the option holder remains employed \nduring the period required for the option to vest, they provide an incentive for an executive to remain \nemployed.  In addition, stock options link a portion of an executive’s compensation to the interests of our \nshareholders by providing an incentive to achieve corporate goals and increase the market price of our \ncommon shares over time. \nThe table below sets forth the stock options that we granted to our named executive officers in 2022, \nwhich options vest with respect to 25% of the underlying common shares on the one-year anniversary of \nthe grant date, and with respect to the remaining 75% of the underlying common shares in 36 as nearly \nequal as possible monthly installments commencing one month after the one-year anniversary of the grant \ndate: \nName \nGrant Date \nGrant Date \nFair Value \nNumber of Shares \nUnderlying Options \nExercise Price \nRick Pauls ............................ \n06/01/22 \n$ \n343,819 \n177,000 \n$           2.45 \nKirsten Gruis, M.D.(1) .......... \n01/03/22 \n487,789 \n160,000 \n3.88 \nScott Kellen .......................... \n06/01/22 \n116,549 \n60,000 \n2.45 \n(1) \nPursuant to the DiaMedica Therapeutics Inc. 2021 Employment Inducement Incentive Plan, \nDr. Kirsten Gruis was granted a stock option to purchase 160,000 common shares in connection \nwith the commencement of her employment.

Our executives receive benefits that are also received by our other employees, \nincluding participation in the DiaMedica USA, Inc. 401(k) Plan and health, dental, disability and life \ninsurance benefits. \nEmployment Agreements \nIn September 2018, we entered into employment agreements with our CEO and CFO, and in January \n2022, we entered into an employment agreement with our CMO, each of which provide for an annual \nbase salary, subject to periodic reviews, incentive based compensation, equity-based compensation and \nbenefits, in each case as determined by the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) from time to time.  \nThe agreements contain standard confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation and assignment of \nintellectual property provisions.

Under the terms of the employment agreements with our executive officers, if \nwe terminate the executive’s employment without “cause”, the executive will be entitled to: (i) salary \ncontinuation payments for 12 months in the case of Mr. Pauls and nine months in the case of each of the \nother executives, (ii) Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) premium \nreimbursement during the salary continuation period, (iii) a pro rata portion of the executive’s target \nannual bonus for the year of termination, and (iv) immediate acceleration of the executive’s equity \nawards.  These severance benefits are subject to the executive executing a separation agreement and \nrelease of claims.  “Cause” is defined in the employment agreements as: (i) gross negligence or willful \nfailure to perform the executive’s duties and responsibilities to DiaMedica; (ii) commission of any act of \nfraud, theft, embezzlement, financial dishonesty or any other willful misconduct that has caused or is \nreasonably expected to result in injury to DiaMedica; (iii) conviction of, or pleading guilty or nolo \ncontendere to, any felony or a lesser crime involving dishonesty or moral turpitude; (iv) material breach \nby the executive of any of their obligations under the agreement or any written agreement or covenant \nwith DiaMedica, including the policies adopted from time to time by DiaMedica applicable to all \nexecutives, that has not been cured within 30 days of notice of such breach; or (v) we terminate the \nemployment of the executive in connection with a liquidation, dissolution or winding down of \nDiaMedica.  We believe that the form and amount of these severance benefits are fair and reasonable to \nboth DiaMedica and our executives.  The Compensation Committee reviews our severance arrangements \nperiodically to ensure that they remain necessary and appropriate. \nChange in Control Arrangements.  To encourage continuity, stability and retention when considering the \npotential disruptive impact of an actual or potential corporate transaction, we have established change in \ncontrol arrangements, including provisions in the 2019 Plan and executive employment agreements.  \nThese arrangements are designed to incentivize our executives to remain with our company in the event \nof a change in control or potential change in control. \nUnder the terms of the 2019 Plan, subject to the terms of the applicable award agreement or an individual \nagreement between DiaMedica and a participant, upon a change in control, the Board of Directors may, in \nits discretion, determine whether some or all outstanding options and stock appreciation rights shall \nbecome exercisable in full or in part, whether the restriction period and performance period applicable to \nsome or all outstanding restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards shall lapse in full or in \npart and whether the performance measures applicable to some or all outstanding awards shall be deemed \nto be satisfied.  The Board of Directors may further require that shares of stock of the corporation \nresulting from such a change in control, or a parent corporation thereof, be substituted for some or all of \nour common shares subject to an outstanding award and that any outstanding awards, in whole or in part, \nbe surrendered to us by the holder, to be immediately cancelled by us, in exchange for a cash payment, \nshares of capital stock of the corporation resulting from or succeeding us or a combination of both cash \nand such shares of stock. \nUnder the terms of the employment agreements, if we terminate the executive’s employment without \n“cause” or the executive terminates their employment with “good reason” in connection with or within \n12 months after a “change in control,” the executive will be entitled to:  (i) salary continuation payments \nfor 18 months in the case of Mr. Pauls and 12 months in the case of each of the other executives, \n(ii) COBRA premium reimbursement during the salary continuation period, (iii) a pro rata portion of their \ntarget annual bonus for the year of termination, and (iv) immediate acceleration of their equity awards.  \nThese severance benefits are subject to the executive executing a separation agreement and release of \nclaims."

Change in control benefits are \nintended to attract and retain qualified executives who, absent these arrangements and in anticipation of a \npossible change in control of our company, might consider seeking employment alternatives to be less \nrisky than remaining with our company through the transaction.  We believe that the form and amount of \nthese change in control benefits are fair and reasonable to both our company and our executives.  The \nCompensation Committee periodically reviews our change in control arrangements to ensure that they \nremain necessary and appropriate. \nIndemnification Agreements \nWe have entered into indemnification agreements with all of our executive officers.  The indemnification \nagreements are governed exclusively by and construed according to the substantive laws of the BCBCA, \nwithout regard to conflicts-of-laws principles that would require the application of any other law, and \nprovide, among other things, for indemnification, to the fullest extent permitted by law and our Articles, \nagainst any and all expenses (including attorneys’ fees) and liabilities, judgments, fines and amounts paid \nin settlement that are paid or incurred by the executive or on his or her behalf in connection with such \naction, suit or proceeding.  We will be obligated to pay these amounts only if the executive acted in good \nfaith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of our \ncompany and, in the case of a criminal or administrative proceeding that is enforced by a monetary \npenalty, he or she had reasonable grounds for believing that his or her conduct was lawful.  The \nindemnification agreements provide that the executive will not be indemnified and expenses advanced \nwith respect to an action, suit or proceeding initiated by the executive unless (i) so authorized or \nconsented to by the Board of Directors or DiaMedica has joined in such action, suit or proceeding or \n(ii) the action, suit or proceeding is one to enforce the executive’s rights under the indemnification \nagreement.  Our indemnification and expense advance obligations are subject to the condition that an \nappropriate person or body not party to the particular action, suit or proceeding shall not have determined \nthat the executive is not permitted to be indemnified under applicable law.  The indemnification \nagreements also set forth procedures that apply in the event an executive requests indemnification or an \nexpense advance."

Subject to adjustment (as described below), the maximum number of our common \nshares authorized for issuance under the 2019 Plan is 4,000,000 shares.  No more than 2,000,000 shares \nmay be granted as incentive stock options, and no awards granted to a non-employee director as \ncompensation for services as a non-employee director during any fiscal year may exceed $400,000 \n(increased to $600,000 with respect to any non-employee director serving as Chairman of the Board or \nlead independent director or in the fiscal year of a non-employee director’s initial service as a non-\nemployee director). \nEligible Participants.  Awards may be granted to employees, non-employee directors and consultants of \nDiaMedica or any of our subsidiaries. A “consultant” for purposes of the 2019 Plan is one who renders \nservices to DiaMedica or its subsidiaries that are not in connection with the offer and sale of our securities \nin a capital raising transaction and do not directly or indirectly promote or maintain a market for our \nsecurities. \nAwards Available.  The 2019 Plan permits us to grant non-statutory and incentive stock options, stock \nappreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, deferred stock units, performance \nawards, non-employee director awards, and other stock based awards.  Awards may be granted either \nalone or in addition to or in tandem with any other type of award. \nTransferability.  Except pursuant to a testamentary will or the laws of descent and distribution or as \notherwise expressly permitted by the 2019 Plan, no right or interest of any participant in an award prior to \nthe exercise (in the case of options or stock appreciation rights) or vesting, issuance or settlement of such \naward will be assignable or transferable, or subjected to any lien, during the lifetime of the participant, \neither voluntarily or involuntarily, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise. \nTermination of Employment or Other Service.  The 2019 Plan provides for certain default rules in the \nevent of a termination of a participant’s employment or other service.  These default rules may be \nmodified in an award agreement or an individual agreement between DiaMedica and a participant.  If a \nparticipant’s employment or other service with DiaMedica is terminated for cause, then all outstanding \nawards held by such participant will be terminated and forfeited.  In the event a participant’s employment \nor other service with DiaMedica is terminated by reason of death, disability, or retirement, then: \n \nAll outstanding stock options (excluding non-employee director options in the case of retirement) \nand stock appreciation rights held by the participant will, to the extent exercisable, remain \nexercisable for a period of one year after such termination, but not later than the date the stock \noptions or stock appreciation rights would otherwise expire; \n \nAll outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights that are not exercisable and all \noutstanding restricted stock will be terminated and forfeited; and \n \nAll outstanding unvested restricted stock units, performance awards, and other stock-based \nawards held by the participant will terminate and be forfeited.

Unless sooner terminated by the Board of Directors, the 2019 Plan \nwill terminate at midnight on May 21, 2029.  No award will be granted after termination of the 2019 Plan, \nbut awards outstanding upon termination of the 2019 Plan will remain outstanding in accordance with \ntheir applicable terms and conditions and the terms and conditions of the 2019 Plan. \nSubject to certain exceptions as set forth in the 2019 Plan, the Board of Directors has the authority to \nterminate and the Board of Directors has the authority to amend the 2019 Plan or any outstanding award \nagreement at any time and from time to time.  No termination or amendment of the 2019 Plan or an award \nagreement shall adversely affect in any material way any award previously granted under the 2019 Plan \nwithout the written consent of the participant holding such award."

The Employment Inducement Plan was \nadopted without shareholder approval pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4) and is administered by \nthe Compensation Committee. \nThe Board of Directors reserved 1,000,000 common shares for issuance under the Employment \nInducement Plan, which permits the grant of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, \nrestricted stock units, performance awards and other stock-based awards, to eligible recipients.  The only \npersons eligible to receive awards under the Inducement Plan are individuals who are new employees and \nsatisfy the standards for inducement grants under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4) or 5635(c)(3), as \napplicable. \nPrior Stock Option Plan \nThe DiaMedica Therapeutics Inc.

The \nOption Plan was terminated with respect to future grants upon the approval by the shareholders of the \n2019 Plan.

Subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors, if a participant is terminated for \ncause, all options received will terminate and cease to be exercisable upon such termination. \nIn the event of any change in our outstanding common shares by reason of any stock dividend, split, \nrecapitalization, reclassification, amalgamation, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares \nor distribution of rights to holders of shares or any other form of corporate reorganization whatsoever, an \nequitable adjustment will be made to the share limits in the Option Plan and any options then outstanding \nand the exercise price in respect of such options.  \nPrior Deferred Share Unit Plan \nThe DiaMedica Therapeutics Inc.

      "text": "53 \nofficers, directors and employees must comply with the following policies with respect to certain \ntransactions in DiaMedica’s securities: \n \nShort Sales.  Short sales of DiaMedica’s securities evidence an expectation on the part of the \nseller that the securities will decline in value, and therefore signal to the market that the seller has \nno confidence in DiaMedica or its short-term prospects.  In addition, short sales may reduce the \nseller’s incentive to improve DiaMedica’s performance.  For these reasons, short sales of \nDiaMedica’s securities are prohibited. \n \nPublicly Traded Options.  A transaction in options is, in effect, a bet on the short-term movement \nof DiaMedica’s common shares and therefore creates the appearance that an officer, director or \nemployee is trading based on inside information.  Transactions in options also may focus an \nofficer’s, director’s or employee’s attention on short-term performance at the expense of \nDiaMedica’s long-term objectives.  Accordingly, transactions in puts, calls or other derivative \nsecurities involving DiaMedica’s equity securities, on an exchange or in any other organized \nmarket, are prohibited. \n \nHedging Transactions.  Certain forms of hedging or monetization transactions, such as zero-cost \ncollars and forward sale contracts, allow an officer, director or employee to lock in much of the \nvalue of his or her stock holdings, often in exchange for all or part of the potential for upside \nappreciation in the stock.  These transactions allow the officer, director or employee to continue \nto own the covered securities, but without the full risks and rewards of ownership.  When that \noccurs, the officer, director or employee may no longer have the same objectives as DiaMedica’s \nother shareholders.  Therefore, such transactions involving DiaMedica’s equity securities are \nprohibited. \n \nPurchases of DiaMedica’s Securities on Margin; Pledging DiaMedica’s Securities to Secure \nMargin or Other Loans.  Purchasing on margin means borrowing from a brokerage firm, bank or \nother entity in order to purchase DiaMedica’s securities (other than in connection with a cashless \nexercise of stock options through a broker under DiaMedica’s equity plans).  Margin purchases of \nDiaMedica’s securities are prohibited.  Pledging DiaMedica’s securities as collateral to secure \nloans is also prohibited.  This prohibition means, among other things, that directors, officers and \nemployees cannot hold DiaMedica’s securities in a “margin account.”"

Subject to the BCBCA, a registered owner or beneficial owner of one or \nmore shares that carry the right to vote at general meetings and who has been a registered owner or \nbeneficial owner of one or more such shares for an uninterrupted period of at least two years may submit \nto us a notice of any matter that the person wishes to have considered at our next annual general meeting. \nIf our shareholders approve Voting Proposal Three, a shareholder wishing to nominate a candidate for \nelection to the Board of Directors at the 2024 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders will be required to \ngive notice of such shareholder’s intention to make such a nomination to our Chief Executive Officer at \nour principal executive offices at 301 Carlson Parkway, Suite 210, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55305, or our \nregistered office not later than 5:00 p.m. (CDT) on the 90th day nor earlier than 5:00 p.m. (CDT) on the \n120th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual general meeting of shareholders so \nno earlier than January 18, 2024 and no later than February 17, 2024.  The notice of nomination also will \nbe required to contain specific information as required by our amended Articles.  A nomination that does \nnot comply with these requirements may not be considered.  \nIn addition, to comply with the universal proxy rules, shareholders who intend to solicit proxies in \nsupport of director nominees other than DiaMedica’s nominees at the 2024 Annual General Meeting of \nShareholders must provide notice that sets forth the information required by Rule 14a-19 under the \nExchange Act no later than March 18, 2024. If our shareholders approve Voting Proposal Three, \nshareholders who intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than DiaMedica’s \nnominees at the 2024 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders will be required to comply with the \nuniversal proxy rules as required by and in addition to our amended Articles, including providing written \nnotice on a timely basis as set forth in the above paragraph and providing certain information required by \nRule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act (including a statement that such shareholder intends to solicit the \nholders of shares representing at least 67% of the voting power of DiaMedica’s shares entitled to vote on \nthe election of directors in support of director nominees other than DiaMedica’s nominees), and our \namended Articles. \nWe encourage shareholders who wish to submit a proposal or nomination to seek independent counsel. \nDiaMedica will not consider any proposal or nomination that is not timely or otherwise does not meet the \nrequirements set forth in our Articles, as may be amended in accordance with Voting Proposal Three, and \nSEC requirements.  We reserve the right to reject, rule out of order, or take other appropriate action with \nrespect to any proposal that does not comply with these and other applicable requirements."

      "text": "3 \nPART I \nItem 1. \nBusiness \nOverview \nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of people suffering \nfrom serious diseases. DiaMedica’s lead candidate DM199 is the first pharmaceutically active recombinant \n(synthetic) form of the human tissue kallikrein-1 (KLK1) protein to be studied in patients. KLK1 is an \nestablished therapeutic modality in Asia for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke and chronic kidney \ndisease, including hypertensive nephrosclerosis (hypertension). We have also identified a potential novel \ntreatment for inflammatory diseases, DM300, which is currently early in the preclinical stage of \ndevelopment. Our long-term goal is to use our patented and in-licensed technologies to establish our \nCompany as a leader in the development and commercialization of therapeutic treatments from novel \nrecombinant proteins. Our current focus is on the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and chronic \nkidney disease (CKD). We plan to advance DM199, our lead drug candidate, through required clinical trials \nto create shareholder value by establishing its clinical and commercial potential as a therapy for AIS and \nCKD.  \nAIS and CKD patients suffer from impaired blood flow in the brain and kidneys, respectively. These patients \nalso tend to exhibit lower than normal levels of endogenous (produced by the body) KLK1 protein, which is \nproduced primarily in the kidneys, pancreas and salivary glands. We believe treatment with DM199 could \nreplenish levels of KLK1, thereby allowing the natural function of kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) to release \nbradykinin (BK) in the body where and when needed, releasing nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins (PG) in \nsynergy, via the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic nucleotides cyclic adenosine \nmonophosphate (cAMP) pathways, to relax smooth muscle in arteries to vasodilate the arteries and increase \nblood flow and oxygen. \nIn September 2021, we announced the initiation of the first site for our pivotal ReMEDy2 trial, a Phase \n2/3 clinical trial of DM199 for the treatment of AIS and the first participant was enrolled in November \n2021. The ReMEDy2 trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 adaptive trial \nintended to enroll approximately 350 participants at up to 75 sites in the United States. Participants \nenrolled in the trial will be treated with either DM199 or placebo within 24 hours of the onset of AIS \nsymptoms. The trial excludes patients with large vessel occlusions and imaging evidence of brain \ndamage and those treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or any other thrombolytic. The study \npopulation is representative of the approximately 80% of AIS patients who do not have treatment \noptions today, primarily due to the limitations on treatment with mechanical thrombectomy or tPA, \nwhich must be dosed within 4.5 hours from symptom onset.  \nThe ReMEDy2 trial has two separate, independent, primary endpoints and is powered for success with \neither endpoint: 1) physical recovery from stroke as measured by the well-established modified Rankin \nScale (mRS) at day 90, and 2) the rate of ischemic stroke recurrence through day 90. Secondary \nendpoints for the trial will evaluate, among other things, mRS shift (which shows the treatment effect on \nparticipants across the full spectrum of stroke severity), participant deaths and the National Institute of \nHealth Stroke Score (NIHSS) and Barthel Index stroke scale. Recurrent strokes represent 25% of all \nischemic strokes, often occurring in the first few weeks after an initial stroke and are typically more \ndisabling, costly, and fatal than initial strokes.  \nOn July 6, 2022, we announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed a clinical \nhold on the investigational new drug application (IND) for our Phase 2/3 ReMEDy2 trial. The clinical hold \nwas issued following the Company voluntarily pausing participant enrollment in the trial to investigate three"

      "text": "4 \nunexpected instances of clinically significant hypotension (low blood pressure) occurring shortly after \ninitiation of the intravenous (IV) dose of DM199. The acutely low blood pressure levels in the three \nparticipants recovered back to their baseline blood pressure within minutes after the IV infusion was stopped, \nand the participants suffered no injuries. In response to the FDA’s clinical hold letter, on September 16, \n2022, we submitted to the FDA supporting in-vitro data that the cause of the hypotensive events was likely \nrelated to switching to a new type of IV bag for use in the ReMEDy2 trial rather than continue with the type \nof IV bag used in the prior ReMEDy 1 trial, where DM199 was generally safe and well tolerated and no \nhypotensive episodes were reported. While there were no differences in the compatibility of DM199 with \neither type of IV bag, we observed significant differences in DM199 binding between the two types of IV \nbags used in the studies that we believe altered, and unintentionally elevated, the total amount of DM199 \nbeing administered to participants in the ReMEDy2 trial and thereby triggering the hypotensive events. In \naddition to our analysis of the events leading to and causing the hypotensive events, we also included in this \nFDA submission, proposed protocol modifications to address the mitigation of these events, including a \nreduction in the DM199 dose level for the initial IV dose to effectively match the well tolerated IV dose \nadministered in the ReMEDy1 trial. Following review of this data, the FDA responded to our submission, \nindicating that the FDA was continuing the clinical hold and requesting, among other items, an additional in-\nuse in vitro stability study of the IV administration of DM199, which includes testing the combination of the \nIV bag, IV tubing and any materials used during the infusion that come in contact with DM199 and the \nmechanical infusion pump, to further rule out any other cause of the hypotension events. In December 2022, \nwe received written comments from the FDA clarifying its expectations for the design of the in-use study. \nThese comments were incorporated into the study protocol and submitted to the FDA. In response the FDA \nrecently indicated that the protocol appeared to be reasonable. The requested in-use study has been initiated \nand is being performed at an independent laboratory. The study is being conducted in two parts. Part 1 \nsimulates actual use in the hospital and part 2 tests worst-case scenarios such as varying storage durations, \ntemperature(s) and light. Part 1 is complete. We believe data from part 1 confirms our conclusions from prior \ntesting that the IV dose administered in the ReMEDy2 study was higher than planned due to the change in IV \nbag materials and was the cause of the hypotension, and that a dose revision in ReMEDy2 should avoid the \nclinically significant hypotension. We have submitted these results and conclusions to the FDA for feedback \nand to request confirmation that all issues of the clinical hold will have been addressed after submission of \ndata from part 2 of the in-use testing anticipated in April 2023.  \nWe have also proactively initiated a Phase 1C open label, single ascending dose (SAD) study of DM199 \nadministered with the PVC IV bags used in the ReMEDy2 trial.  The purpose of the study is to confirm, with \nhuman data, the DM199 serum concentration level achieved with the IV dose and further evaluate safety and \ntolerability. In the event that the FDA does not agree that the results of the in-use study support the proposed \ndose revision, the data from this Phase 1C study can be used to support the rationale for the IV dose selected \nfor the ReMEDy2 trial.  The Phase 1C study is being conducted in Australia and is intended to enroll up to \n15 healthy, adult participants. Enrollment in the study has commenced and preliminary data is expected to be \navailable in May 2023.  \nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to fully respond to the FDA’s latest questions sufficiently for \nthe FDA to lift the clinical hold on a timely basis or at all. It is also possible that the FDA may subsequently \nmake additional requests that we would need to fulfill prior to the lifting of the clinical hold, such as \nrequiring us to complete additional clinical testing or imposing stricter approval conditions than we recently \nproposed for our DM199 product candidate. We may not enroll any additional participants in the ReMEDy2 \ntrial until we provide the FDA with the requested data and the FDA notifies us that the FDA has lifted the \nclinical hold and we may resume enrollment in the clinical trial. \nIn September 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to DM199 for the treatment of AIS where tPA \nand/or mechanical thrombectomy are not indicated or medically appropriate. The FDA may grant Fast \nTrack designation to a drug that is intended to treat a serious condition and nonclinical or clinical data"

The FDA provides opportunities for frequent \ninteractions with the review team for a Fast Track product, including pre-IND meetings, end-of-phase 1 \nmeetings and end-of-phase 2 meetings with the FDA to discuss study design, extent of safety data required to \nsupport approval, dose-response concerns, and use of biomarkers. A Fast Track product may also be eligible \nfor rolling review, where the FDA reviews portions of a marketing application before the sponsor submits the \ncomplete application. \nWith respect to our Phase 2 REDUX trial of DM199 in CKD, interim data was presented at the American \nSociety of Nephrology’s (ASN) annual Kidney Week meeting in November 2021. In the IgA Nephropathy \n(IgAN) cohort, in addition to continuing to show statistically significant reductions (averaging over 30% \ndecrease) in albuminuria in participants with moderate to severe baseline albuminuria, the trial also \ndemonstrated early signals of potential disease modification with the APRIL and IgA1 biomarkers showing \nmean decreases of 35% and 22% overall, respectively, after three months of treatment. In the African \nAmerican cohort, participants were hypertensive with CKD and non-diabetic. Participants in this cohort with \nmoderate to severe baseline albuminuria saw a mean decrease in albuminuria of over 50%, improvement in \nblood pressure and stable estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). As of March 31, 2022, all participants \nhad completed their treatment periods. We are currently evaluating next steps for our CKD program as we \nproceed with analyzing the complete data set from the REDUX trial. \nWe believe DM199 has the potential to treat a variety of diseases where restoring healthy function requires \nsufficient activity of KLK1 and its system, KKS. Today, forms of KLK1 derived from human urine and the \npancreas of pigs are approved and sold in Japan, China and Korea to treat AIS, CKD, retinopathy, \nhypertension and related vascular diseases. We believe millions of patients have been treated with these \nKLK1 therapies and the data from more than 200 published papers and studies support its clinical benefit. \nHowever, there are numerous regulatory, commercial and clinical drawbacks associated with KLK1 derived \nfrom these sources which can be overcome by developing a synthetic version of KLK1 such as DM199. We \nbelieve higher regulatory standards and potential antibody reactions are the primary reasons why KLK1 \nderived from these sources are not currently available and used in the United States or Europe. We are not \naware of any recombinant version of KLK1 with regulatory approval for human use in any country, nor are \nwe aware of any recombinant version in development other than our drug candidate, DM199. \nKallikrein-Kinin System \nKLK1 is a serine protease, or protein, produced primarily in the kidneys, pancreas and salivary glands. \nKLK1 plays a critical role in the regulation of local blood flow and vasodilation (the widening of blood \nvessels, which decreases vascular resistance) in the body, as well as an important role in reducing \ninflammation and oxidative stress (an imbalance between potentially damaging reactive oxygen species, or \nfree radicals, and antioxidants in the body). \nKLK1 is involved in multiple biochemical processes. The most well-characterized activity of KLK1 is the \nenzymatic cleavage of low molecular weight kininogen (LMWK) to produce Lys-bradykinin (BK)-like \npeptides, collectively known as kinins, which activate BK receptors (primarily BK2R with some BK1R), see \ngraphic below. Activation of BK receptors by kinins sets in motion metabolic pathways which locally \nproduce nitric oxide, prostaglandins and other anti-inflammatory mediators that can improve blood flow \n(through vasodilation), dampen inflammation and protect tissues and end-organs from ischemic damage. \nScientific literature, including publications in Circulation Research, Immunopharmacology and Kidney \nInternational, suggests that lower endogenous KLK1 levels in patients are associated with diseases related to \nvascular disorders, such as stroke, kidney diseases and hypertension. DM199, as a protein replacement \ntherapy, may replenish KLK1 levels to properly activate the KKS driving the local production of nitric oxide, \nprostaglandins and other anti-inflammatory mediators, to promote endothelial health and protect the brain \nand kidney from damage. By providing additional supply of the KLK1 protein, DM199 treatment could"

Specifically, the amino acid structure of \nDM199 is effectively identical to the human urine form, and the enzymatic and pharmacokinetic profiles are \nsubstantially similar to both human urine and porcine derived KLK1. The physiological effects of DM199 on \nblood pressure, from our completed studies, is similar to that of human urine and porcine-derived forms of \nKLK1. We believe that the results of this work suggest that the therapeutic action of DM199 will be the same \nor, potentially, better than that of the forms of KLK1 marketed in Asia. \nWe believe DM199 may provide new treatment options with significant benefits over the current standards \nof care by offering a therapeutic treatment option to a greater number of patients with the potential for fewer \nside effects.  \nSummary of Clinical Results \nTo date, clinical trials have been and/or are being conducted in the United States, Europe and Australia. We \nbelieve the clinical data generated to date by DM199 supports the continued development of DM199 as a \ntreatment for AIS and CKD. \n \nOur Phase 2 ReMEDy1 trial of DM199 in the treatment of AIS (n=91) met our primary safety \nand tolerability end points and demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the number of \nparticipants with recurrent ischemic stroke (reported as stroke in evolution or stroke progression \nby the investigators) in the active treatment group: 0 (0%) participants treated with DM199 vs. 6 \n(13%) on placebo (p=0.012), with 4 of the 6 resulting in participant death. In a subgroup analysis \nof participants not receiving mechanical thrombectomy prior to enrollment (n=46), patients \ntreated with DM199 demonstrated a 22% absolute improvement in excellent outcomes \n(recovering to an NIHS score of 0-1). In participants treated with DM199 (n=25) vs. supportive \ncare and/or tPA (n=21), the results showed that 36% of participants receiving DM199 progressed \nto a full or nearly full recovery at 90 days (NIHSS: 0-1), compared to 14% of participants in the \nplacebo group. This represents a 22% absolute increase in the proportion of participants \nachieving a full or nearly full recovery. Additionally, subject deaths decreased from 24% in the \nplacebo group to 12% in the DM199 treatment group, a 50% relative reduction. This subgroup"

In the \nhypertensive African American cohort demonstrated an over 50% mean reduction in albuminuria \nin participants with moderate to severe baseline albuminuria and significant reductions in \nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure levels at the 2µg/kg dose level after three months of \ntreatment. The IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) cohort, in addition to showing statistically significant \nreductions (averaging an over 30% decrease) in albuminuria in participants with moderate to \nsevere baseline albuminuria, the trial also demonstrated early signals of potential disease \nmodification with the APRIL and IgA1 average biomarker decreases of 35% and 22% overall, \nrespectively, after three months of treatment.  \nIn all completed studies, DM199 was shown to be generally safe and well tolerated. The primary adverse \nevents noted in our studies with healthy volunteers included headache, erythema (redness), dizziness, venous \npuncture (blood draw) site reaction. The most common adverse events in people with diabetes with or \nwithout chronic kidney disease included orthostatic hypotension, local injection site irritation/redness, and \ndiarrhea. The most common adverse events seen in people with acute ischemic stroke include constipation, \noral candidiasis (yeast/fungal infection of mouth) and nausea. \nSupporting Data for Use of DM199 (KLK1): \nKLK1 derived from human urine was approved in China in 2005 and became the standard of care in 2010. \nKLK1 derived from the pancreas of pigs has been approved in Japan for several decades. There is one \ncompany selling human urine derived KLK1 in China. We believe that approximately 20 companies are \nmarketing porcine KLK1 in Japan, China and Korea for hypertension, certain chronic kidney and other \nvascular diseases. We have identified several hundred papers supporting the clinical use of urinary and \nporcine derived KLK1 from China, Japan and Korea.  \nStudies have shown that lower KLK1 levels are also a predictor of stroke recurrence.

      "text": "9 \nMore specifically, with respect to an ischemic stroke, at the site of a blood flow blockage in the brain, there \nexist two major ischemic zones – the core ischemic zone with nearly complete loss of blood flow (blood flow \nbelow 10% to 25%), and the surrounding ischemic penumbra, a rim of mild to moderately ischemic tissue \nsurrounding the core ischemic zone. Within minutes, the significant lack of blood flow in the core ischemic \nzone deprives these cells of glucose and oxygen which rapidly depletes energy stores and triggers the loss of \nion gradients, ultimately leading to neuronal cell death, or apoptosis. The ischemic penumbra zone, however, \nmay remain viable for several hours via collateral arteries that branch from the main occluded artery in the \ncore ischemic zone. Unfortunately, the penumbra is at great risk of delayed tissue damage due to \ninflammation which may also lead to neuronal cell death. As time goes on, a lack of blood flow in the core \nischemic zone (infarct) may lead to fluid buildup (edema) and swelling which creates intracranial pressure. \nThis pressure on the brain leads to tissue compression resulting in additional ischemia. Additional events in \nAIS include vascular damage to the blood vessel lining or endothelium, loss of structural integrity of brain \ntissue and blood vessels and inflammation. A stroke can lead to permanent damage with memory loss, \nspeech problems, reading and comprehension difficulties, physical disabilities and emotional/behavioral \nproblems. The long-term costs of stroke are substantial, with many patients requiring extended \nhospitalization, extended physical therapy or rehabilitation and/or long-term institutional or family care. \nHowever, provided the extended window of viability in the penumbra, next generation stroke therapies are \nbeing developed to protect valuable brain tissue during the hours to a week after a stroke. \nUnmet Medical Need in AIS \nAccording to the World Health Organization, each year approximately 1.7 million people in the U.S., Europe \nand Japan and approximately 15 million people worldwide suffer a stroke, of which 5 million will die and 5 \nmillion will be permanently disabled. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n(CDC) approximately 87% of all strokes are ischemic in nature, meaning a blockage of blood flow in/to the \nbrain. We believe that stroke represents an area of significant unmet medical need and a KLK1 therapy (such \nas DM199) could provide a significant patient benefit, in particular given its proposed treatment window of \nup to 24 hours after the first sign of symptoms. Currently, the only FDA-approved pharmacological \nintervention for AIS is tPA, which is approved to be given within 3 hours of symptom onset; however, we \nunderstand that based upon supplemental clinical research and common practice, it is typically administered \nup to 4.5 hours from symptom onset. Treating patients with tPA during this time window can be challenging \nbecause it is difficult to determine precisely when symptoms began and a patient must undergo brain imaging \nbefore treatment to rule out a hemorrhagic stroke, a ruptured blood vessel causing bleeding within the brain. \nMechanical thrombectomy, a procedure which attempts to remove the clot using catheter-based tools, is also \navailable to certain patients. Despite the availability of these treatments, we believe they are relevant to \napproximately 20% of ischemic stroke patients due to the location of the clot, the elapsed time after the \nstroke occurred or other safety considerations. Thus, we believe DM199 may offer significant advantages \nover the current treatment options in that it fills a serious, unmet need for patients who cannot receive tPA or \nmechanical thrombectomy. Additionally, we believe DM199 may also offer a complementary follow-on \ntreatment for patients who initially receive tPA or mechanical thrombectomy by enabling sustained blood"

Approximately 600,000 of these are first events and approximately 25%, or \n200,000, are recurrent stroke events. \n \nApproximately one of every 20 deaths in the United States is caused by stroke and is the fifth \nleading cause of death. On average, someone in the United States has a stroke every 40 seconds \nand someone dies from a stroke every 3.5 minutes. \n \nStroke is the leading cause of serious long-term disability and reduces mobility in more than half \nof stroke survivors aged 65 and over. \n \nRisk of having a first stroke is nearly twice as high for African Americans as for Caucasians, and \nAfrican Americans have the highest rate of death due to stroke. \n \nStroke-related costs in the United States came to nearly $53 billion between 2017 and 2018, \nincluding the cost of health care services, medications and missed days of work. \nDM199 – Our Novel Solution for the Treatment of AIS \nAs depicted in the graphic below, we believe DM199 has the potential to preserve “at risk” brain tissue by \nincreasing cerebral blood flow.

      "text": "11 \nDM199 Acute Ischemic Stroke: Proposed Mechanism \n \nIn January 2019, we published a paper titled “Human Tissue Kallikrein in the Treatment of Acute Ischemic \nStroke” in the peer reviewed journal, Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders. The paper reviews \nthe scientific literature covering the biochemical role of KLK1 and presents the mechanistic rationale for \nusing KLK1 as an additional pharmacological treatment for AIS. In addition to the biochemical mechanism \nof KLK1, the review highlights supporting results from human genetics and preclinical animal models of \nbrain ischemia. It also reviews published clinical results for treatment of AIS by a form of KLK1 that is \nisolated from human urine. This form has been approved for post-infarct treatment of AIS in China and data \nhas been published from clinical trials involving over 4,000 patients. The paper offers a series of testable \ntherapeutic hypotheses for demonstrating the long-term beneficial effect of KLK1 treatment in AIS patients \nand the reasons for this action. \nWe are developing DM199 to treat AIS patients with a therapeutic window of up to 24 hours after the first \nsign of symptoms, well beyond the current window of up to 4.5 hours from symptom onset for tPA, thereby \nfilling a large unmet need for those patients who cannot receive tPA under the currently available treatment \nwindow of tPA. This important attribute could potentially make therapy available to the millions of patients \nworldwide who currently have limited treatment options. \nSupporting Data from the Use of Urine-derived KLK1 for the Treatment of AIS in China \nIn China, Kailikang® is approved and marketed by Techpool Bio-Pharma Inc., a company controlled by \nShanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co. Ltd. Kailikang has been approved for the treatment of AIS in China. \nWe believe the initial treatment window is up to 48 hours after stroke symptom onset. Based on IQVIA data, \nother publications and our own internal analysis, we estimate that over 600,000 stroke patients were treated \nin 2021 with Kailikang in China. More than 50 published clinical studies, covering over 4,000 stroke \npatients, have demonstrated a beneficial effect of Kailikang treatment in AIS including improvements in \nstandard stroke scores, increased blood flow, reduced infarct size/ischemia in the brain. According to a \npublication in the China Journal of Neurology, in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 446 \nparticipants treated with either Kailikang or a placebo with initial treatment administered up to 48 hours after \nsymptom onset showed significantly better scores on the European Stroke Scale and Activities of Daily \nLiving at three weeks post-treatment and after three months using the Barthel Index. \nAdditionally, a comprehensive meta-analysis covering 24 clinical studies involving 2,433 patients published \nin the Journal of Evidence-Based Medicine concluded that human urinary KLK1 appears to ameliorate \nneurological deficits for patients with AIS and improves long-term outcomes, though a few treated patients \nsuffered from transient hypotension."

      "text": "12 \nFurthermore, in a retrospective study covering 300 consecutive AIS patients, published in Brain and \nBehavior March 2018, patients treated with human urinary KLK1 experienced a 6.5% absolute reduction \n(p=0.009) in recurrent strokes (39% relative) within one year. \nCKD Background and Disease Pathology \nChronic Kidney Disease Background \nCKD is characterized by a progressive decline in overall kidney function as measured by the eGFR, a test \nused to evaluate blood flow through the kidneys, and albuminuria, a marker for glomerular injury which is a \nmeasure of the amount of albumin protein excreted in your urine and an indicator for how well the kidneys \nare filtering excess fluid and waste products out of your blood. As glomerular filtration decreases, the body’s \nability to continue to regulate its many functions, including the elimination of metabolic waste, is lost and \nultimately, may result in severe physiologic consequences. Among multiple underlying causes, CKD often \nbegins with an increase in blood glucose which leads to the thickening of the glomerular membrane, known \nas fibrosis. As the kidney function becomes impaired, eGFR generally decreases and albuminuria generally \nincreases. Increased albuminuria means that abnormal amounts of protein are released into the urine \ncollecting tubules of the kidney through damaged capillary pores in the glomerular floor. Additionally, \nincreased blood glucose leads to increased blood pressure, elevated reactive oxygen species, advanced \nglycation end product formation (harmful compounds that are formed when protein or fat combine with \nsugar in the bloodstream) and inflammation. As these continue, structural components of the kidney begin to \ncollapse, resulting in cell ischemia and cell death. As the renal damage continues, a progressive thickening of \nthe glomerular basement membrane is seen along with continued pathological changes in the cells and \ninflammation. Early stages of CKD are characterized as microalbuminuria (small amounts of protein leak \ninto the urine). Late stages are characterized as macroalbuminuria (large amounts of protein leak into the \nurine). The rate of decline depends on a number of factors including the type of diabetes, genetic \npredisposition, glycemic controls and blood pressure. At the final stages of CKD, the kidneys fail completely \nand dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed. \nUnmet Medical Need in CKD \nCKD is a widespread health problem that generates significant economic burden throughout the world: \n \nAccording to the National Kidney Foundation, 37 million Americans have CKD and 1 in 3 \nAmericans are at-risk for kidney disease. \n \nThe primary causes of CKD are diabetes (Type 2 and Type 1) and hypertension. The Medical \nClinics of North America estimates that over 40% of those with Type 2 diabetes and 20% of \nthose with Type 1 diabetes will eventually develop CKD, making it one of the more common \nrisks for diabetics. \n \nPatients with CKD are at greater risk for hypertension and heart disease. \nCurrently, there is no cure for CKD and treatment primarily involves management of the symptoms of the \ndisease in order to reduce the rate of decline in kidney function. Blood pressure medications, such as \nangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), are often \nprescribed to control hypertension, and hopefully, slow the progression of CKD. Recently sodium glucose \nco-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2) have received approval to expand their label to treat diabetic kidney \ndisease to reduce the rate of cardiovascular events. Nevertheless, according to the National Kidney \nFoundation, many of these patients continue to show declining kidney function and 3.6% of the overall \npopulation has a lifetime risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD), where dialysis or a kidney \ntransplant is needed. We believe DM199 offers a potentially novel approach for the treatment of CKD \nbecause KLK1 protein plays a vital role in normal kidney function."

      "text": "13 \nDM199 – Our Novel Solution for the Treatment of CKD, Including Hypertensive Nephrosclerosis \nWe believe DM199 has the potential to offer meaningful therapeutic benefits for CKD patients. We believe \nthat the KLK1 protein plays a vital role in maintaining normal kidney function, promoting the production of \nnitric oxide, prostaglandin and other anti-inflammatory mediators which are important for kidney health and \nintegrity. Patients with moderate to severe CKD often excrete abnormally low levels of KLK1 in their urine, \nleading to the hypothesis that a KLK1 deficit contributes to disease progression.  \nAdditionally, KLK1 is the main source of bradykinin (BK) in resting conditions. BK opposes the \nprohypertensive renin, angiotensin, aldosterone system (RAAS) by restoring regulation of the epithelial \nsodium channel (EnaC) and increasing sodium and fluid excretion. DM199 augments low KLK1 levels and \npromotes natriuresis (excretion of sodium in urine). This regulation of EnaC with DM199 may contribute to \nlowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients and in particular in patient’s considered to be salt-sensitive. \nBy providing additional KLK1, we believe DM199 has the potential to: \n \nFurther supporting the hypothesis that an intact KKS is critical for normal kidney function, a series of \nobservational studies published in Immunopharmacology showed the amount of KLK1 released into the \nurine appears to be inversely correlated with the severity of disease in patients with CKD. Urinary KLK1 \nexcretion was decreased in patients with both mild (not requiring dialysis) and severe (kidney \nfailure/hemodialysis) renal disease compared to controls. Decreases in urinary KLK1 activity were seen \nespecially when the reduction was associated with decreased glomerular filtration rate.  \nDM199 treatment is intended to directly replenish KLK1 levels to maintain, or possibly restore, kidney \nfunction. Current treatment options, especially ACEi drugs, primarily slow the rate of decline in kidney \nfunction but are associated with side effects. Importantly, it is becoming increasingly clear that part of the \nbeneficial effect of ACEi drugs involves preventing the normal breakdown of BK leading to substantial \nincreases in BK levels throughout the body. However, these effects can be unregulated and ACEi drugs \ntherefore can generate excessive BK where it is not needed, potentially leading to side effects such as \npersistent cough, angioedema (swelling of skin and tissue) and hyperkalemia (abnormally high potassium \nlevels that can lead to cardiac arrest and sudden death). Most importantly, even with the use of ACEi or ARB \nmedications in CKD patients, there remains high unmet need as a majority of CKD patients still experience a \nprogressive loss of renal function over time. We believe DM199 treatment, either alone or in combination \nwith an ARB, could potentially restore normal KLK1 levels allowing the KKS to perform its normal \nphysiological processes and release BK when and where it is needed, avoiding these side effects."

Protein replacement therapy with \nDM199, through the activation of the KKS, may complement and balance RAAS, primarily targeted by \nACEis and ARBs, and may potentially improve the function of the diseased renal system by improving blood \nflow and vasodilation, as well as reducing blood pressure. \nSupporting Data from the Use of Porcine-Derived KLK1 for the Treatment of CKD in Japan, China and \nKorea \nKLK1 derived from the pancreas of pigs is currently used to treat CKD in Japan, China and Korea. \nSpecifically, porcine KLK1 is also used to treat hypertension and retinopathy. Based on data published by \nthe data analytics company IQVIA and our own internal analysis, we estimate that millions of patients have \nbeen treated with porcine KLK1 for these and other vascular diseases. We have identified 17 clinical papers, \nsupporting the therapeutic activity of porcine KLK1 in CKD patients, whether given alone or in combination \nwith an ARB. These unblinded studies involve treatment durations ranging from a few weeks up to six \nmonths and report improvement in kidney disease based on decreased urinary albumin excretion rates and \nother clinical endpoints of kidney disease. \nOur Competition and Current Treatments for Acute Ischemic Stroke and Chronic Kidney Disease  \nThe biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapidly advancing technologies \nthat focus on rapid development of proprietary drugs. We believe that our DM199 product candidate, \ndevelopment capabilities, experience and scientific knowledge provide us with certain competitive \nadvantages. However, we face significant potential competition from many different sources, including \nmajor pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, \ngovernmental agencies and other research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop \nand commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the \nfuture. \nMany of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, \ntechnical and human resources than we do, and experience in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals \nof treatments and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful \nthan us in obtaining approval for competitive products and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our \ncompetitors’ treatments may be more effectively marketed and sold than any products we may \ncommercialize, thus limiting our market share and resulting in a longer period before we can recover the \nexpenses of developing and commercializing our DM199 product candidate. \nMergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more \nresources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies \nmay also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and \nestablished companies. These activities may lead to consolidated efforts that allow for more rapid \ndevelopment of competitive product candidates. \nWe also compete for staff, development and clinical resources. These competitors may impair our ability to \nrecruit or retain qualified scientific and management personnel, our ability to work with specific advisors, or \nour ability to work with clinical contract organizations due to conflicts of interest or capacity constraints, and \nmay also delay recruitment of clinical study sites and study volunteers, impeding progress in our \ndevelopment programs. \nWe expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, \nefficacy, safety, price and the availability of reimbursement from government or other third-party payers."

That treatment is tPA (marketed under \nthe brand name Activase®), and its therapeutic window is limited to up to 4.5 hours after the AIS. There are, \nhowever, a number of companies that are actively pursuing a variety of approaches to develop \npharmaceutical products for the treatment of AIS including, among others: \n \nStem cells (Athersys, Inc.) \n \ntPA extended treatment window (Genentech / Boehringer Ingelheim) \n \nTenecteplase (Genentech / Boehringer Ingelheim) \n \nCerebral edema (Biogen Inc.) \n \nAnti-inflammatory and clot dissolving (Biogen Inc.) \n \nCell protection and anti-inflammation (ZZ Biotech LLC) \n \nInhibiting platelet aggregation (Acticor Biotech SAS) \n \nNeuroprotector (Mitsubishi) \nThere is a large unmet therapeutic need for AIS treatments that can be administered beyond the 4.5-hour time \nwindow of tPA. With this large unmet therapeutic need, there is significant competition to develop new \ntherapeutic options. New therapeutic options in development include tissue protection focused therapies \n(deliverable from hours to days after the stroke) that are intended to preserve and protect brain cells beyond \nthe tPA therapeutic window. Currently, the most advanced treatments involve the mechanical removal of \nblood clots in the large arteries supplying blood to the brain through sophisticated catheter-based approaches, \nreferred to as mechanical thrombectomy. According to published research, use of mechanical thrombectomy \nis growing and the window of time after a stroke where the procedure can be used is widening. The goal is to \nprovide treatment options for the vast majority of AIS patients who do not receive hospital care early enough \nto qualify for tPA therapy. We believe there is a very significant market opportunity for a drug that has a \ntherapeutic window beyond that of tPA and is able to obtain regulatory approval. \nChronic Kidney Disease \nCKD is primarily associated with diabetes and hypertension along with other disease states. In the United \nStates, we are aware of only two currently approved treatments for CKD. These treatments include an ACEi \n(marketed under the brand name Captopril®) which is approved for the treatment of patients with CKD \ncaused by Type 1 diabetes and a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (marketed under the brand names \nINVOKANA® and Farxiga®) is approved to reduce the risk of ESRD, worsening of kidney function, \ncardiovascular (CV) death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes and diabetic \nkidney disease (nephropathy) with a certain amount of protein in the urine. \nThere are several pharmaceutical products for the treatment of CKD currently in clinical development, some \nof which include: \n \nMineralcorticortisteroid receptor agonist (Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals LLC) \n \nChymase inhibitor (Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals LLC) \n \nTransient receptor potential canonical channel 5 (Goldfinch Bio) \n \nCCR2 receptor antagonists (ChemoCentryx, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company) \n \nOxidative stress, cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitors (Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) \n \nGlycosylation inhibitors (Glycadia, Inc. aka Glycadia Pharmaceuticals)"

Note however that the treatment with \nACEi has been linked to hyperkalemia (elevated blood potassium levels), which increases the risk for \nabnormal heart rhythms and sudden death. In fact, two clinical trials investigating the use of ACEi and ARB \ncombination therapy in kidney disease were stopped prematurely because participants developed \nhyperkalemia. The added complication of hyperkalemia may result in patients receiving smaller, or \nsuboptimal, doses or patients being untreated because they cannot tolerate the treatment. Additional side \neffects with ACEi treatment are angioedema (swelling of skin tissue) and persistent cough. \nINVOKANA® (canagliflozin) and other SGLT-2 inhibitors are approved for use in patients to reduce the risk \nof ESRD, worsening of kidney function, cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults \nwith Type 2 diabetes and DKD with a certain amount of protein in the urine. Potential side effects of SGLT-\n2 inhibitors include lower limb amputations, dehydration, diabetic ketoacidosis and genital mycotic \ninfections. \nWe are aware of one approved treatment for IgAN, a disease which leads to CKD. On December 15, 2021, \nthe FDA granted accelerated approval to Calliditas Therapeutics AB’s “TARPEYO™” (budesonide) for the \nreduction of albuminuria in adult primary IgAN patients at risk of rapid disease progression, generally \nindicated by a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥1.5g/g. TARPEYO (developed under the project \nname NEFECON) was specifically designed for and is the first and only FDA-approved treatment in this \ndisease. It has not been established whether TARPEYO slows kidney function decline in patients with IgAN \nand continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical \nbenefit in a confirmatory clinical trial. Additionally, there are several pharmaceutical products specifically \nfor the treatment of IgAN currently in clinical development, some of which include: \n \nDual acting ARB and endothelin receptor antagonist (Travere Therapeutics, Inc.) \n \nAntibody MASP-2 inhibitor (Omeros Corporation) \n \nSmall-molecule inhibitor of complement factor B (Novartis AG) \n \nSmall-molecule inhibitor Nrf2 activator/NFkB inhibitor (Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) \n \nAPRIL inhibitor (Vera Therapeutic and Chinook Therapeutics) \nDM199 treatment is intended to directly replenish KLK1 levels, maintaining or potentially restoring kidney \nfunction. Current treatment options, especially ACEi drugs, only partially restore kidney function and are \nassociated with high-risk side effects. ACEi drugs can generate excessive BK where it is not needed, \npotentially leading to side effects such as cough and angioedema. DM199 treatment may potentially allow \nKLK1 to follow its normal physiological processes and release BK when and where it is needed, avoiding \nthese side effects. \nDM199 Clinical Trials \nAIS Phase 2/3 ReMEDy2 Trial \nIn September 2021, we announced the initiation of the first site for our pivotal ReMEDy2 trial, a Phase \n2/3 clinical trial of DM199 for the treatment of AIS and the first participant was enrolled in November"

The ReMEDy2 trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 adaptive trial \nintended to enroll approximately 350 participants at up to 75 sites in the United States. Participants \nenrolled in the trial will be treated with either DM199 or placebo within 24 hours of the onset of AIS \nsymptoms. The trial excludes patients with large vessel occlusions and imaging evidence of brain \ndamage and those treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or any other thrombolytic. The study \npopulation is representative of the approximately 80% of AIS patients who do not have treatment \noptions today, primarily due to the limitations on treatment with mechanical thrombectomy or tPA, \nwhich must be dosed within 4.5 hours from symptom onset. \nThe ReMEDy2 trial has two separate, independent, primary endpoints and is powered for success with \neither endpoint: 1) physical recovery from stroke as measured by the well-established modified Rankin \nScale (mRS) at day 90, and 2) the rate of ischemic stroke recurrence through day 90. Secondary \nendpoints for the trial will evaluate, among other things, mRS shift (which shows the treatment effect on \nparticipants across the full spectrum of stroke severity), participant deaths and the National Institute of \nHealth Stroke Score (NIHSS) and Barthel Index stroke scale. Recurrent strokes represent 25% of all \nischemic strokes, often occurring in the first few weeks after an initial stroke and are typically more \ndisabling, costly, and fatal than initial strokes. \nOn July 6, 2022, we announced that the FDA placed a clinical hold on the IND for our Phase 2/3 ReMEDy2 \ntrial. The clinical hold was issued following the Company voluntarily pausing participant enrollment in the \ntrial to investigate three unexpected instances of clinically significant hypotension (low blood pressure) \noccurring shortly after initiation of the intravenous (IV) dose of DM199. The acutely low blood pressure \nlevels in the three participants recovered back to their baseline blood pressure within minutes after the IV \ninfusion was stopped, and the participants suffered no injuries. In response to the FDA’s clinical hold letter, \non September 16, 2022, we submitted to the FDA supporting in-vitro data that the cause of the hypotensive \nevents was likely related to switching to a new type of IV bag for use in the ReMEDy2 trial rather than \ncontinue with the type of IV bag used in the prior ReMEDy 1 trial, where DM199 was generally safe and \nwell tolerated and no hypotensive episodes were reported. While there were no differences in the \ncompatibility of DM199 with either type of IV bag, we observed significant differences in DM199 binding \nbetween the two types of IV bags used in the studies that we believe altered, and unintentionally elevated, the \ntotal amount of DM199 being administered to participants in the ReMEDy2 trial and thereby triggering the \nhypotensive events. In addition to our analysis of the events leading to and causing the hypotensive events, \nwe also included in this FDA submission, proposed protocol modifications to address the mitigation of these \nevents, including a reduction in the DM199 dose level for the initial IV dose to effectively match the well \ntolerated IV dose administered in the ReMEDy1 trial. Following review of this data, the FDA responded to \nour submission, indicating that the FDA was continuing the clinical hold and requesting, among other items, \nan additional in-use in vitro stability study of the IV administration of DM199, which includes testing the \ncombination of the IV bag, IV tubing and any materials used during the infusion that come in contact with \nDM199 and the mechanical infusion pump, to further rule out any other cause of the hypotension events. In \nDecember 2022, we received written comments from the FDA clarifying its expectations for the design of \nthe in-use study. These comments were incorporated into the study protocol and submitted to the FDA. In \nresponse the FDA recently indicated that the protocol appeared to be reasonable.

Part 1 simulates actual use in the hospital and part 2 tests worst-case scenarios such as varying storage \ndurations, temperature(s) and light. Part 1 is complete. DiaMedica believes data from part 1 confirms its \nconclusions from prior testing that the IV dose administered in the ReMEDy2 study was higher than planned \ndue to the change in IV bag materials and was the cause of the hypotension, and that a dose revision in \nReMEDy2 should avoid the clinically significant hypotension.

The purpose of the study is to confirm, with \nhuman data, the DM199 serum concentration level achieved with the IV dose and further evaluate safety and \ntolerability. In the event that the FDA does not agree that the results of the in-use study support the proposed \ndose revision, the data from this Phase 1C study can be used to support the rationale for the IV dose selected \nfor the ReMEDy2 trial.

We may not enroll any additional participants in the ReMEDy2 \ntrial until we provide the FDA with the requested data and the FDA notifies us that the FDA has lifted the \nclinical hold and we may resume enrollment in the clinical trial. \nPrior to voluntarily halting enrollment, we had experienced slower than expected site activations and \nenrollment in our ReMEDy2 trial and may continue to experience these conditions if and when we are able \nto resume enrollment. We believe this was due to a number of factors, including the reduction or suspension \nof research activities at our current and targeted clinical study sites, as well as staffing shortages, due to \nCOVID-19 and concerns managing logistics and protocol compliance for participants discharged from the \nhospital to an intermediate care facility. We intend to continue to take certain actions, including bringing \ncertain site engagement responsibilities in-house and engaging a clinical services consulting firm to provide \nstaff support to study sites as needed, to assist study sites in overcoming these issues, if and when we resume \nenrollment in the ReMEDy2 trial, however no assurances can be provided as to if and when these issues will \nresolve. \nIn September 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to DM199 for the treatment of AIS where tPA \nand/or mechanical thrombectomy are not indicated or medically appropriate. The FDA may grant Fast \nTrack designation to a drug that is intended to treat a serious condition and nonclinical or clinical data \ndemonstrate the potential to address unmet medical need. The FDA provides opportunities for frequent \ninteractions with the review team for a Fast Track product, including pre-IND meetings, end-of-phase 1 \nmeetings and end-of-phase 2 meetings with the FDA to discuss study design, extent of safety data required to \nsupport approval, dose-response concerns, and use of biomarkers. A Fast Track product may also be eligible \nfor rolling review, where the FDA reviews portions of a marketing application before the sponsor submits the \ncomplete application. \nAIS Phase 2 ReMEDy1 Trial \nIn May 2020, we announced top-line data from our Phase 2 ReMEDy1 trial assessing the safety, tolerability \nand markers of therapeutic efficacy of DM199 in patients suffering from AIS. We initiated treatment in this \ntrial in February 2018 and completed enrollment in October 2019 with 92 participants. The study drug \n(DM199 or placebo) was administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion within 24 hours of stroke symptom \nonset, followed by subcutaneous injections later that day and once every 3 days for 21 days. The trial was \ndesigned to measure safety and tolerability along with multiple tests designed to investigate DM199’s \ntherapeutic potential including plasma-based biomarkers and standard functional stroke measures assessed at \n90 days post-stroke.

The \ntrial met primary safety and tolerability endpoints and was generally safe and well tolerated. In addition, \nthere was a demonstrated therapeutic effect on the rate of severe stroke recurrence inclusive of all \nparticipants and there was also a demonstrated therapeutic effect on the physical recoveries of participants \nthat received tPA prior to enrollment but not in participants receiving mechanical thrombectomy prior to \nenrollment. \nPrior to enrollment, 44 of the 91 evaluable participants (48%) received mechanical thrombectomy \nintervention, a catheter-based treatment intended to physically remove clots and potentially available for \npatients who have a large vessel occlusion and can be treated within 6 to 24 hours of the onset of stroke \nsymptoms. While approximately 20% of AIS patients are believed to be eligible for a mechanical \nthrombectomy, currently only about 5% to 10% receive the treatment due to elapsed time post-stroke or \nunavailability of the therapy at the hospital where the patient presents. DM199 is intended to treat the \napproximately 80% of AIS patients who are not eligible for either mechanical thrombectomy or tPA. \nTreatment for these patients is limited to supportive care. Due to the large volume of participants receiving \nmechanical thrombectomy prior to enrollment in the ReMEDy1 trial, and a disproportionate distribution of \nthese participants between the active treatment and placebo groups, DM199 did not produce a therapeutic \neffect on physical recoveries in the overall trial analysis. \nWhen participants treated with mechanical thrombectomy are excluded from the trial data set, which \nrepresents the group of participants most closely aligned with the target treatment population for DM199 in \nthe ReMEDy2 trial, a positive therapeutic effect on participant physical recoveries was demonstrated. As \nshown in the table below, when evaluating the participants treated with DM199 (n=25) vs. supportive care \nand/or tPA (n=21), the results showed that 36% of participants receiving DM199 progressed to a full or \nnearly full recovery at 90 days (NIHSS: 0-1), compared to 14% of participants in the placebo group. This \nrepresents a 22% absolute increase in the proportion of participants achieving a full or nearly full recovery. \nAdditionally, subject deaths decreased from 24% in the placebo group to 12% in the active therapy group, a \n50% relative reduction. Note that the number of subjects in these subsets were insufficient for statistical \nsignificance. \nDM199 vs. Supportive Care and/or tPA \n \nNIHSS Outcomes at 90 Days \n \n0-1 \n2-8 \n≥ 9 \nDeath \nPlacebo (n=21) \n14% \n57% \n5% \n24% \nDM199 (n=25) \n36% \n36% \n16% \n12% \n \nIn addition, in the evaluable participants (n=91), a significant reduction in the number of participants with \nrecurrent ischemic stroke was noted in the active treatment group: 0 (0%) participants treated with DM199 \nvs. 6 (13%) on placebo (p=0.012), with 4 of the 6 resulting in participant death. \nWe believe these findings from our Phase 2 ReMEDy1 trial, which are consistent with the use of Kailikang \nin China, provide a signal that recombinant human KLK1 appears safe and may have promise as a new \ntreatment for physicians who have limited options for the treatment of patients following an AIS. \nCKD Phase 2 REDUX Trial \nIn October 2019, the FDA accepted our Phase 2 clinical trial protocol for the treatment of CKD caused by \nrare or significant unmet diseases. Enrollment commenced in December 2019 and was completed in \nDecember 2021.

African Americans are at greater risk for \nCKD than Caucasians, and those African Americans who have the APOL1 gene mutation are at an even \nhigher risk. Cohort 2 was focused on participants with IgA Nephropathy. Cohort 3 was focused on \nparticipants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus with CKD, hypertension and albuminuria (DKD). The trial \nevaluated two dose levels of DM199 within each cohort. Study participants received DM199 by \nsubcutaneous injection twice weekly for 95 days. The primary study endpoints, evaluated after three months \nof treatment, included safety, tolerability, blood pressure, albuminuria and kidney function, which are \nevaluated by changes from baseline in estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria, as measured by \nthe urinary albumin to creatinine ratio. \nIn June 2021 we announced interim results and in November 2021 we announced additional interim results. \nThe interim results indicated that DM199, after three months of treatment, was demonstrating clinically \nmeaningful improvements in kidney function in Cohorts 1 and 2, as measured by simultaneously stabilizing \nestimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and decreasing the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). \nAdditionally, in participants who were hypertensive (Cohorts 1 and 3), DM199 reduced blood pressure by \nclinically significant levels and importantly, there was no effect on participants who were not hypertensive \n(Cohort 2). We reported the following preliminary data: \n \nAA: Geometric mean decrease in UACR of -55% in moderate to severe albuminuria (baseline \nUACR >500 µg/mg) (n=3), Stable eGFR from baseline (n=12) and a mean decrease in \nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure -19/-13 mmHg (n=8) at the 2 µg/kg dose level; \n \nIgAN: UACR geometric mean decrease of -34% (p=0.002) (baseline UACR>500 µg/mg) \n(n=11), eGFR and blood pressure were stable (n=16) and mean decreases in the biomarkers \nApril and IgA1 of 35% and 22% overall, respectively; and \n \nDKD: No overall treatment effect was observed for UACR, however, reductions in systolic and \ndiastolic blood pressure (n=28) were observed. \nDM199 was generally safe and well tolerated across all cohorts. AEs were generally mild to moderate in \nseverity, with the most common being local injection site irritation, and all resolved without medical \nintervention. \nWe completed enrollment in REDUX with a total 84 subjects enrolled, including 24 African American \nsubjects into Cohort 1, 25 subjects with IgAN into Cohort 2 and 35 subjects with Type 2 diabetes in Cohort \n3. As of March 31, 2022, all participants had completed their treatment periods. We are currently evaluating \nnext steps for our CKD program as we proceed with continuing to analyze the complete data set from the \nREDUX trial. \nCKD Phase 1b \nIn July 2019, we completed a Phase 1b clinical trial of DM199 in participants with moderate or severe CKD \ncaused by Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The trial was performed to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of three \ndose levels of DM199 (3, 5 and 8 µg/kg), administered in a single subcutaneous dose, as well as the \nevaluation of safety, tolerability and secondary pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints. The trial results \ndemonstrated that at the 3µg/kg dose level, the PK profiles were similar between moderate and severe CKD \nparticipants, and consistent with healthy subjects (normal kidney function) tested previously. Additionally, \nDM199 was well tolerated with no dose-limiting tolerability observed. There were no deaths, no \ndiscontinuations due to a treatment-related adverse event (AE) and no treatment-related significant adverse \nevents (SAEs). AEs were minor and consistent with standard treatment(s) in the CKD patient population. We"

PD results appeared to be drug related in that the greatest improvements occurred \napproximately 24 hours after DM199 administration and subsequently declined. \nPotential DM199 Commercial Advantages \nSeveral researchers have studied the structural and functional properties of KLK1. This deep body of \nknowledge has revealed the potential clinical benefits of KLK1 treatments. Today, forms of KLK1 derived \nfrom human urine and the pancreas of pigs are approved and sold in Japan, China and Korea to treat AIS, \nCKD, retinopathy, hypertension and related diseases. We are not aware of any recombinant version of KLK1 \nwith regulatory approval for human use in any country, nor any recombinant version in development other \nthan our drug candidate DM199. We believe at least five companies have attempted, unsuccessfully, to \ncreate a recombinant version of KLK1. \nThe growing understanding of the role of KLK1 in human health and its use in Asia as an approved \ntherapeutic highlight two important potential commercial advantages for DM199: \n \nKLK1 treatment is sold in Japan, China and Korea. Research has shown that patients with \nlow levels of KLK1 are associated with a variety of diseases related to vascular dysfunction, \nsuch as AIS, CKD, retinopathy and hypertension. Clinical trial data with human urine and \nporcine derived KLK1 has demonstrated statistically significant clinical benefits in treating a \nvariety of patients with KLK1 compared to placebo. These efficacy results are further \nsubstantiated by established markets in Japan, China and Korea for pharmaceutical sales of \nKLK1 derived from human urine and the pancreas of pigs. We estimate that millions of patients \nhave been treated with these forms of KLK1 in Asia. Altogether, we believe this supports a \nstrong market opportunity for a recombinant version of KLK1 such as DM199. \n \n \nKLK1 treatment has had limited side effects and has been well tolerated in studies to date. \nKLK1 is naturally produced by the human body; and, therefore, the body’s own control \nmechanisms act to limit potential side effects. The side effect observed to limit participant \ntolerability in our clinical trials was orthostatic hypotension, or a sudden drop in blood pressure, \nwhich has been primarily seen at doses 10 to 20 times higher than our anticipated therapeutic \ndose levels. Most recently, clinically significant, transient hypotension (low blood pressure) \noccurring shortly after initiation of the intravenous (IV) dose of DM199 was experienced by \nthree participants in our ReMEDy2 trial which were the cause of the Company pausing \nparticipant enrollment and the FDA placing a clinical hold on the IND for our ReMEDy2 trial. \nThe blood pressure levels of the three participants recovered back to their baseline blood \npressure within minutes after IV infusion was stopped and the participants suffered no injuries. \nWe believe that these events were caused by our switching away from the type of IV bag used in \nthe prior ReMEDy1 trial, where no hypotensive episodes were reported, which resulted in an \nunintended, elevated dose of DM199 being delivered in the ReMEDy2 trial. We believe that by \nreducing the dose rate for the IV infusion to a level that matches the effective dose rate in the \nReMEDy1 trial, we can manage and/or eliminate the clinically significant hypotensive events. \nMoreover, we understand that routine clinical use of KLK1 treatment in Asia has been well-\ntolerated by patients for several decades. In 2017, we completed a clinical trial comparing the \npharmacokinetic profile of DM199 to the human urinary form of KLK1 (Kailikang), which \nshowed DM199, when administered in intravenous form, had a similar pharmacokinetic profile."

      "text": "22 \nFurther, when DM199 was administered subcutaneously, DM199 demonstrated a longer acting \npharmacokinetic profile, superior to the intravenously administered Kailikang and DM199. \nIn addition, we believe that there are also significant formulation, manufacturing, regulatory and other \nadvantages for recombinant human KLK1 drug candidate DM199: \n \nPotency and Impurity Considerations. KLK1 produced from human urine or the pancreas of \npigs presents risks related to preventing impurities, endotoxins, and chemical byproducts due to \nthe inherent variability of the isolation and purification process. We believe that this creates the \nrisk of inconsistencies in potency and impurities from one production run to the next. However, \nwe expect to produce a consistent formulation of KLK1 that is free of endotoxins and other \nimpurities. \n \n \nCost and Scalability. Large quantities of human urine and the pancreas of pigs must be obtained \nto derive a small amount of KLK1. This creates potential procurement, cost and logistical \nchallenges to source the necessary raw material, particularly for human urine sourced KLK1. \nOnce sourced, the raw material is processed using chemicals and costly capital equipment and \nproduces a significant amount of byproduct waste. Our novel recombinant manufacturing \nprocess utilizes widely available raw materials and can be readily scaled for commercial \nproduction. Accordingly, we believe our manufacturing process will have significant cost and \nscalability advantages. \n \n \nRegulatory. We are not aware of any attempts by manufacturers of the urine or porcine based \nKLK1 products to pursue regulatory approvals in the United States. We believe that this is \nrelated to challenges presented by using inconsistent and potentially hazardous biomaterials, \nsuch as human urine and the pancreas of pigs, and their resulting ability to produce a consistent \ndrug product. Our novel recombinant manufacturing process utilizes widely available raw \nmaterials which we believe provides a significant regulatory advantage, particularly in regions \nsuch as the United States, Europe and Canada, where safety standards are high. In addition, we \nbelieve that DM199 could qualify for 12 years of data exclusivity under the Biologics Price \nCompetition and Innovation Act of 2009, which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. \n \nFrom a strategic perspective, we continue to believe that strategic alternatives with respect to our DM199 \nproduct candidate, including licenses and business collaborations, with other regional and global \npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be important in advancing the clinical development of \nDM199. Therefore, as a matter of course and from time to time, we engage in discussions with third parties \nregarding these matters. \nRegulatory Approval \nSecuring regulatory approval for the manufacture and sale of human therapeutic products in the United \nStates, Europe, Canada and other commercial territories is a long and costly process that is controlled by \neach territory’s national regulatory agency. The national regulatory agency in the United States is the FDA, \nin Europe it is the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and in Canada it is Health Canada. Other national \nregulatory agencies have similar regulatory approval processes, but each national regulatory agency has its \nown approval processes. Approval in the United States, Europe or Canada does not assure approval by other \nnational regulatory agencies, although often test results from one country may be used in applications for \nregulatory approval in another country."

      "text": "23 \nPrior to obtaining regulatory approval to market a drug product, every national regulatory agency has a \nvariety of statutes and regulations which govern the principal development activities. These laws require \ncontrolled research and testing of products, governmental review, and approval of a submission containing \npreclinical and clinical data establishing the safety and efficacy of the product for each use sought, approval \nof manufacturing facilities including adherence to good manufacturing practices (GMP) during production \nand storage, and control of marketing activities, including advertising, labeling and pricing approval. \nNone of our product candidates have been completely developed or tested; and, therefore, we are not yet in a \nposition to seek regulatory approval in any territory to market any of our product candidates. \nThe clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, \nimport, export and marketing, among other things, of our current or future product candidates, are subject to \nextensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The process of \nobtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and \nforeign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to \ncomply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval \nprocess, or after approval may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal \nby the applicable regulatory authority to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, \nimposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product \nseizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government \ncontracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the \nFDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities. \nU.S. Approval Process \nIn the United States, the FDA is responsible for the drug approval process. The FDA’s mission is to ensure \nthat all medications on the market are safe and effective. The FDA’s approval process examines and \nthoroughly reviews potential new drugs; only those that are in compliance with the Code of Regulations, 21 \nCFR 312 and 21 CFR 314 are approved. \nThe U.S. food and drug regulations require licensing of manufacturing facilities, carefully controlled \nresearch and testing of products, governmental review and approval of test results prior to marketing of \ntherapeutic products, and adherence to GMP, as defined by each licensing jurisdiction, during production. \nA description of the different stages in the drug approval process in the United States follows. \nStage 1: Preclinical Research. After an experimental drug is discovered, research is conducted to help \ndetermine its potential for treating or curing an illness. This is called preclinical research. Animal and/or \nbench studies are conducted to determine if there are any harmful effects of the drug and to help understand \nhow the drug works. Information from these experiments is submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The \nFDA reviews the information in the IND and decides if the drug is safe to study in humans. \nStage 2: Clinical Research. The experimental drug is studied in humans. The studies are known as clinical \ntrials. Clinical trials are carefully designed and controlled experiments in which the experimental drug is \nadministered to patients to test its safety and to determine the effectiveness of an experimental drug. The four \ngeneral phases of clinical research are described below. \n \nPhase 1 Clinical Studies. Phase 1 clinical studies are generally conducted with healthy \nvolunteers who are not taking other medicines; patients with the illness that the drug is intended \nto treat are not tested at this stage. Ultimately, Phase 1 studies demonstrate how an experimental \ndrug affects the body of a healthy individual. Phase 1 consists of a series of small studies"

Low doses and high \ndoses of the drug are usually studied, resulting in the determination of the safe dosage range in \nvolunteers by the end of Phase 1. This information will determine whether the drug proceeds to \nPhase 2. \n \nPhase 2 Clinical Studies. Phase 2 clinical studies are conducted in order to determine how an \nexperimental drug affects people who have the disease to be treated. Phase 2 usually consists of \na limited number of studies that help determine the drug’s short-term safety, side effects, and \ngeneral effectiveness. The studies in Phase 2 often are controlled investigations involving \ncomparison between the experimental drug and a placebo, or between the experimental drug and \nan existing drug. Information gathered in Phase 2 studies will determine whether the drug \nproceeds to Phase 3. \n \nPhase 3 Clinical Studies. Phase 3 clinical studies are expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials \nthat are used to more fully investigate the safety and effectiveness of the drug. These trials differ \nfrom Phase 2 trials because a larger number of patients are studied (sometimes in the thousands) \nand because the studies are usually double blinded, placebo controlled and of longer duration. As \nwell, Phase 3 studies can include patients who have more than one illness and are taking \nmedications in addition to the experimental drug used in the study. Therefore, the patients in \nPhase 3 studies more closely reflect the general population. The information from Phase 3 forms \nthe basis for most of the drug’s initial labeling, which will guide physicians on how to use the \ndrug. \n \nPhase 4 Clinical Studies. Phase 4 clinical studies are conducted after a drug is approved. Phase 4 \nstudies may be required by the FDA or conducted by companies to more fully understand how \ntheir drug compares to other drugs. FDA-required Phase 4 studies often investigate the drug in \nspecific types of patients that may not have been included in the Phase 3 studies and can involve \nvery large numbers of patients to further assess the drug’s safety. \nStage 3: FDA Review for Approval. Following the completion of Phase 3 clinical studies, the \npharmaceutical company prepares an electronic common technical document reporting all clinical \nnonclinical and chemistry, manufacturing and control studies conducted on the drug that is transmitted to the \nFDA as a New Drug Application (NDA). The FDA reviews the information in the NDA to determine if the \ndrug is safe and effective for its intended use. An advisory panel meeting is scheduled for a new drug \nallowing the FDA to gain feedback from experts. If the FDA determines that the drug is safe and effective, \nthe drug will be approved. \nStage 4: Marketing. After the FDA has approved the experimental drug, the pharmaceutical company can \nmake it available to physicians and their patients. A company also may continue to conduct research to \ndiscover new uses for the drug. Each time a new use for a drug is discovered, the drug once again is subject \nto the entire FDA approval process before it can be marketed for that purpose. \nAny FDA approved pharmaceutical products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, \namong other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, \nproviding the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution \nrequirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with \nFDA guidance documents, and promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, \nstandards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient \npopulations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label \nuse”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the"

Failure to comply with FDA requirements is likely to have negative consequences, \nincluding adverse publicity, warning or enforcement letters from the FDA or the Federal Trade Commission \n(FTC), mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, product seizures or recalls and state \nor federal civil or criminal prosecution, injunctions and penalties. \nThe FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation \nstrategies and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval \nthat could restrict the distribution or use of the product. \nDM199 may qualify for 12 years of data exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation \nAct of 2009 (the BPCIA), which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Under the BPCIA, \nan application for a biosimilar product (BLA) cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years, or if approved \nby the FDA, until 12 years, after the original brand product identified as the reference product is approved \nunder a BLA. The BPCIA provides an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and \ninterchangeable biological products. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for \nthe FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \n“interchangeable” based on its similarity to an existing brand product. The new law is complex and is only \nbeginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. \nEuropean Approval Process \nThe EMA is roughly parallel to the FDA in terms of the drug approval process and the strict requirements for \napproval. The EMA was set up in 1995 in an attempt to harmonize, but not replace, the work of existing \nnational medicine regulatory bodies in individual European countries. As with the FDA, the EMA drug \nreview and approval process follows similar stages from preclinical testing through clinical testing in Phase \n1, 2, and 3. There are some differences between the FDA and EMA review process, specifically the review \nprocess in individual European countries. Such differences may allow certain drug products to be tested in \npatients at an earlier stage of development. \nOther Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements \nIn the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local \nauthorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other \ndivisions of the U.S. government, including, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department \nof Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local \ngovernments. For example, if a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal or state \nhealthcare programs, a company, including its sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs, \nmust comply with the federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act as it relates to advertising and promotion of drugs, \nthe federal False Claims Act, as amended, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, as amended, the Physician \nPayments Sunshine Act, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), \nand similar state laws. If a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs \nmust comply with, as applicable, the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation \nAct of 1990 (OBRA), and the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. \nAmong other things, OBRA requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates on prescription drugs to state \nMedicaid programs and empowers states to negotiate rebates on pharmaceutical prices, which may result in \nprices for our future products being lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Additionally, the ACA \nsubstantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. There may \ncontinue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, in the future, some of \nwhich could further limit coverage and reimbursement of drug products. If drug products are made available \nto authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws \nand requirements may apply."

In the United States, private health insurers and other third-\nparty payers often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the \ngovernment (through the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. \nThird-party payers are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical \nproducts and services in addition to their safety and efficacy; and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists \nregarding the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. In particular, in the United \nStates, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government \nauthorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical \nproducts and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in \nlower average selling prices. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and \non country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional \npressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales \nand results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial \ndecisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, \npharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. As a result, coverage and adequate third party \nreimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our \ninvestment in research and product development. \nThe market for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend \nsignificantly on access to third-party payers’ drug formularies or lists of medications for which third-party \npayers provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies \noften leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payers may refuse \nto include a particular branded drug in their formularies or may otherwise restrict patient access to a branded \ndrug when a less costly generic equivalent or another alternative is available. In addition, because each third-\nparty payer individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate \nreimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process. We would be required to provide scientific and \nclinical support for the use of any product candidate to each third-party payer separately with no assurance \nthat approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to \ndemonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates. This process could delay the market acceptance \nof any of our product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our \nfuture revenues and operating results. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered \ncost-effective. If we are unable to obtain coverage and adequate payment levels for our product candidates \nfrom third-party payers, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or \nadminister them and patients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our ability to \nsuccessfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial \ncondition, and future success. \nResearch and Development \nWe have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development (R&D) which therefore \ncomprises the largest component of our operating costs. Our primary focus over the past approximately \n10 years has been our lead product candidate, DM199, which is currently in clinical development for the \ntreatment of AIS and CKD. \nWe expect our R&D expenses will continue to increase in the future as we continue the development and \nclinical study of our initial product candidate, DM199, in AIS and CKD and seek to expand our product"

The process of conducting the necessary development and clinical research to obtain \nregulatory approval is costly and time-consuming and we consider the active management and development \nof our clinical pipeline to be integral to our long-term success. The actual probability of success for each \nproduct candidate, clinical indication and preclinical program may be affected by a variety of factors \nincluding, among other things, the safety and efficacy data for each product candidate, amounts invested in \ntheir respective programs, competition and competitive developments, manufacturing capability and \ncommercial viability. \nR&D expenses include: \n \nexpenses incurred under contract research agreements and other agreements with third parties; \n \nexpenses incurred under agreements with clinical trial sites that conduct research and \ndevelopment activities on our behalf; \n \nlaboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of clinical trials and non-clinical studies; \n \nthe cost of acquiring, developing, manufacturing, and distributing clinical trial materials; \n \nemployee and consultant-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits, travel and share-\nbased compensation; and \n \nfacilities and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and \nmaintenance of facilities, insurance, and other supply costs. \nR&D costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities such as clinical trials are \nrecognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data \nprovided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites. \nProvided that the FDA lifts the clinical hold on the IND for our ReMEDy2 clinical trial, we expect that it will \nbe at least three to four years, if ever, before we have any product candidates ready for commercialization. \nManufacturing \nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical quantities of DM199 nor do \nwe have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We rely on Catalent \nPharma Solutions, LLC (Catalent), a contract manufacturing organization (CMO) with proven GMP \nexperience in the manufacturing of recombinant proteins for clinical trials, for all of our required raw \nmaterials and active pharmaceutical ingredients for our clinical trials. We have licensed certain gene \nexpression technology and we contract with Catalent for the manufacture of DM199. We currently employ \ninternal resources and third-party consultants to manage our manufacturing relationship with Catalent. \nSales and Marketing \nWe have not yet defined our sales, marketing or product distribution strategy for our initial product \ncandidate, DM199, or any future product candidates. We currently expect to partner with a large \npharmaceutical company for sales execution. However, our future commercial strategy may include the use \nof distributors, a contract sales force or the establishment of our own commercial and specialty sales force, as \nwell as similar strategies for regions and territories outside the United States. \nIntellectual Property \nWe view patents and other means of intellectual property protection, including trade secrets, as an important \ncomponent of our core business. We focus on translating our innovations into intellectual property protecting \nour proprietary technology from infringement by competitors. To that end, patents are reviewed frequently \nand continue to be sought in relation to those components or concepts of our preclinical and clinical products"

Our strategy, where possible, is to file patent applications to protect our product \ncandidates, as well as methods of manufacturing, administering and using a product candidate. Prior art \nsearches of both patent and scientific databases are performed to evaluate novelty, inventiveness and \nfreedom-to-operate. We require all employees, consultants and parties to a collaborative research agreement \nto execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment, consulting relationships or a \ncollaboration with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed or made known \nduring the course of the engagement with us is to be kept confidential. We also maintain agreements with our \nscientific staff and all parties contracted in a scientific capacity affirming that all inventions resulting from \nwork performed for us, using our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the \nperiod covered by the agreement are the exclusive property of DiaMedica. \nOur DM199 patent portfolio includes three granted U.S. patents, a granted European patent, a granted \nCanadian patent, and pending applications in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, Hong \nKong and the United States. Granted or pending claims offer various forms of protection for DM199 \nincluding claims to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, specific formulations and dosing \nlevels and methods for treating a variety of diseases, including stroke, chronic kidney disease and related \ndisorders. These U.S. patents and applications, and their foreign equivalents, are described in more detail \nbelow. \nIssued patents held by us cover the DM199 composition of matter based on an optimized combination of \nclosely-related isoforms that differ in the extent of glycosylation (process by which sugars are chemically \nattached to proteins). Issued claims in this patent family cover the most pharmacologically active variants of \nDM199 and methods of using the same for treating ischemic conditions and these patents are due to expire in \n2033. A second patent family includes an issued U.S. patent with claims directed to methods of treating \nsubjects by administering a SC formulation of DM199 or related recombinant kallikrein-1 (KLK1) \npolypeptides and is predicted to expire in 2033. The pending applications are directed to a range of dose \nlevels and dosing regimens of DM199 that are potentially useful for treating a wide range of diseases \nincluding, e.g. pulmonary arterial hypertension, cardiac ischemia, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, stroke \nand vascular dementia which, if granted, are predicted to expire in 2038. \nAs previously discussed, we do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or \ncommercial quantities of DM199. We are contracting with Catalent for the manufacture of DM199. We have \nlicensed certain gene expression technology and we contract with Catalent for the manufacture of DM199. \nUnder the terms of this license, certain milestone and royalty payments may become due and are dependent \nupon, among other factors, performing clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and ultimately the \nsuccessful commercialization of a new drug, the outcome and timing of which is uncertain. The royalty term \nis indefinite but the license agreement may be canceled by us on 90 days’ prior written notice. The license \nmay not be terminated by Catalent unless we fail to make required milestone and royalty payments. \nMethods and reagents required for commercial scale manufacture of DM199 are subject to a series of patents \nissued to Catalent. We license these patents from Catalent, and such license is exclusive as it relates to the \nproduction of DM199 or any human KLK1 protein. \nWe believe that our proprietary technology along with trade secrets and specialized knowledge of the \nmanufacturing process will provide substantial protection from third-party competitors. We also believe that \nDM199 cannot be easily reverse engineered for the production of a copycat version."

The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term \nadjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the U.S. PTO. In some \ncases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-\nexpiring patent. \nThe term of a U.S. patent may also be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition \nand Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some \nof the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a \ndrug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman \nAct allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the \ncomposition of matter of an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug, \nand/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the \nshorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA \napproval of the drug. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, also have patent term \nextension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the \napplicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA \napproval, we expect to apply for patent term extension on patents covering those products, their methods of \nuse, and/or methods of manufacture. \nIn addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive \nposition. Companies typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of their business that are not amenable \nto, or that they do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.

The summary of risk factors is not complete and should be read in conjunction \nwith the more complete and detailed descriptions of risk factors that follow. Risks and uncertainties not \ncurrently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our \nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. \nRisk Factors Summary \nRisks Related to Our ReMEDy2 Trial, Future Clinical Trials and DM199 Product Candidate \n \nThe FDA placed a clinical hold on the IND for our Phase 2/3 ReMEDy2 trial and it may take \nconsiderable time and expense to respond to the clinical hold and no assurance can be given that the \nFDA will remove the clinical hold, which would substantially harm our business and prospects. \n \nIf we are able to get the clinical hold on the IND for our ReMEDy2 trial lifted and resume \nenrollment in the trial, we may have difficulty engaging clinical trial sites for, or enrolling patients \nin, the trial or we may experience other clinical testing delays or setbacks, which would delay our \nability to obtain regulatory approval for DM199 to treat AIS and commercialize it, or partner with a \nthird party to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialization of DM199 to treat AIS, which \nwould substantially harm our business and prospects. \n \nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in delays in clinical trial site activations and patient enrollments \nand hospital and medical facility staffing shortages which adversely affected our ReMEDy2 trial \nprior to the clinical hold and could continue to adversely affect the trial if the clinical hold is lifted. \n \nThe adaptive design of our ReMEDy2 trial could result in the trial being required to enroll more \npatients than anticipated, increasing the time and costs to complete the trial, which may require \nadditional funding that may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.  \n \nIf our ReMEDy2 trial fails to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of DM199 to treat AIS, we will not \nbe able to obtain the regulatory approvals required to market and commercialize the product, which \nwould substantially harm our business and prospects.  \n \nWe may be required to suspend, repeat or terminate our ReMEDy2 trial or future clinical trials if \nthey are deemed not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, the results are negative \nor inconclusive or the trials are not well designed. \nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital \n \nSince we have no revenue from product sales and do not expect any revenue from product sales for \nat least three or four years, we will likely need additional funding to continue our clinical \ndevelopment activities and other operations, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, \nor at all. \n \nWe have incurred substantial losses since our inception and expect to continue to incur substantial \nlosses for at least three or four years and may never become profitable, or if achieved, be able to \nsustain profitability. \nRisks Related to Governmental and Regulatory Compliance and Approvals \n \nThe regulatory approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us or \nany future partner or collaborator from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of DM199 or \nany future product candidate. \n \nAny product candidate for which we or any future partner or collaborator obtains marketing approval \ncould be subject to post-marketing restrictions or recall or withdrawal from the market, and we may \nbe subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience \nunanticipated problems with the product candidate."

In September 2021, we announced the initiation of the first site \nfor our pivotal ReMEDy2 trial, a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of DM199 for the treatment of AIS. The first patient \nwas enrolled in November 2021. On July 6, 2022, we announced that the FDA placed a clinical hold on the \nIND for our ReMEDy2 trial. The clinical hold was issued following us voluntarily pausing patient \nenrollment in the trial to investigate three unexpected instances of clinically significant hypotension (low \nblood pressure) occurring shortly after initiation of the intravenous (IV) dose of DM199. On September 16, \n2022, we submitted to the FDA our analysis of the events leading to and causing the hypotension, including \nour rationale and supporting non-clinical data that the cause was likely related to switching away from the \ntype of IV bag used in the prior ReMEDy1 trial, where no hypotensive episodes were reported. We also \nsubmitted proposed protocol modifications to address the cause of the clinically significant hypotension and \nmitigate the potential for these events. Following review of this data, the FDA responded to our submission, \nindicating that it was continuing the clinical hold and requesting an additional in-use in vitro stability study \nof the IV administration of DM199, which includes testing the combination of the IV bag, IV tubing and \nmechanical infusion pump, to further rule out any other potential cause of hypotension. We have initiated the \nrequested study and it is expected to complete in April 2023. Although we believe that these adverse \nhypotension events likely resulted from a changing to a new formulation of IV bag in the ReMEDy2 trial, as \ncompared to the IV bag used in the ReMEDy1 trial, it is possible that we may not be able to provide \nobjective evidence acceptable to the FDA substantiating our belief. Therefore, there is no assurance that we \nwill be able to fully respond to the FDA’s latest questions sufficiently for the FDA to lift the clinical hold or \nthat the FDA won’t make additional requests that we would need to fulfill prior to the lifting of the clinical \nhold, such as requiring us to complete additional clinical testing or imposing stricter approval conditions than \nwe recently proposed for our DM199 product candidate. It is possible that we will be unable to fully address \nthe FDA’s questions and as a result, the clinical hold may never be lifted and we may never be able to \nresume enrollment in our ReMEDy2 trial.  \nIf we are able to get the clinical hold on the IND for our ReMEDy2 trial lifted and resume enrollment in \nthe trial, we may have difficulty engaging clinical trial sites for, or enrolling patients in, the trial or we \nmay experience other clinical testing delays or setbacks, which would delay our ability to obtain regulatory \napproval for DM199 to treat AIS and commercialize it, or partner with a third party to obtain regulatory \napproval for or commercialization of DM199 to treat AIS, which would substantially harm our business \nand prospects. \nEven if we are able to get the clinical hold on the IND for our ReMEDy2 trial lifted, it is possible that \nbecause of the clinical hold and the hypotension events, we may have difficulty engaging clinical trial sites \nfor, or enrolling patients in, the ReMEDy2 trial, which would delay the completion of the trial. In addition, it \nis possible that we may experience other clinical testing delays or setbacks, which would further delay the"

Significant clinical trial delays could not only extend the time period for obtaining regulatory \napproval of DM199 to treat AIS, but also shorten any periods during which we or a future partner may have \nthe exclusive right to commercialize DM199 to treat AIS or allow our competitors to bring competitive \nproducts to market before us, which would impair the ability to successfully commercialize DM199 and may \nharm our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If and when re-initiated, the ReMEDy2 trial \nmay be delayed again for a number of reasons, including among others: \n \nconcerns regarding the prior clinically significant hypotension events and circumstances \nsurrounding the clinical hold; \n \npatients choosing to participate in competing clinical trials or not at all; \n \nscheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical sites; \n \nsuspension or termination of the ReMEDy2 trial by regulators for any reason, including concerns \nabout patient safety or failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with current Good \nManufacturing Practices (cGMP) requirements; \n \nany changes to our manufacturing process that may be necessary or desired which affect our \nability to produce adequate or timely clinical drug supply; \n \ndelays or failure to obtain clinical drug supply of DM199 from contract manufacturers necessary \nto conduct clinical trials; \n \nthe product candidate demonstrating a lack of safety or efficacy at the planned interim analysis \nof the ReMEDy2 trial; \n \npatients failing to enroll or complete the ReMEDy2 trial at the rates and within the timelines we \nexpect due to dissatisfaction with the treatment, side effects, or other reasons; \n \nclinical investigators not performing the ReMEDy2 trial on their anticipated schedule, dropping \nout of a trial or employing methods not consistent with the clinical trial protocol and regulatory \nrequirements or other third parties not performing data collection and analysis in a timely or \naccurate manner; \n \ninspections of our clinical trial sites by regulatory authorities, Institutional Review Boards \n(IRBs) or ethics committees finding regulatory violations that require us to undertake corrective \naction, resulting in suspension or termination of one or more sites or the imposition of another \nclinical hold on the IND for our ReMEDy2 trial; or \n \npublic health crises, epidemics and pandemics, such as COVID-19, which may adversely impact \nour ability to engage and activate clinical trial sites, recruit or enroll subjects for our ReMEDy2 \ntrial or any future trial and obtain the requisite staffing for our ReMEDy2 trial or any future trial. \nOur product development costs may also increase if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than \nplanned. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur, and we may need to \namend trial protocols or alter our manufacturing processes to reflect these changes. Amendments typically \nrequire us to resubmit our trial protocols to regulatory authorities or IRBs or ethics committees for re-\nexamination, which may impact the cost, timing or successful completion of our ReMEDy2 trial. Delays or \nincreased product development costs or any of these events would likely have a material adverse effect on \nour business, financial condition, and prospects. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in delays in clinical trial site activations and patient enrollments and \nhospital and medical facility staffing shortages which adversely affected our ReMEDy2 trial prior to the \nclinical hold and could continue to adversely affect the trial if the clinical hold is lifted. \nCOVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, a severe effect on the clinical trials of many drug candidates, \nincluding our ReMEDy2 trial. Prior to the clinical hold of our ReMEDy2 trial, we experienced challenges \nwith engaging and activating clinical trial sites. We believe this was due primarily to clinical staff shortages"

Hospital study sites \nhave been especially impacted by these factors. Additionally, prior to the clinical hold of our ReMEDy2 trial, \nwe experienced slower than expected enrollments in the trial due to these factors and patient concerns related \nto visiting clinical trial sites. In an effort to mitigate the impact of these factors, we brought certain site \nengagement responsibilities in-house and engaged a clinical services consulting firm to provide staff support \nto study sites as needed. We may need to continue these efforts or implement additional actions to mitigate \nthe impact of these factors on our ReMEDy2 trial, if and when we are able to re-initiate the trial. It is also \npossible that these efforts may draw our employees away from their core responsibilities and create \nadditional expenses, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Note however that \nthese efforts may not be effective if patients are unwilling to enroll in our ReMEDy2 trial. We anticipate that \nCOVID-19, and variants of COVID-19, will likely continue to adversely affect our ability to initiate new \nclinical trial sites and recruit or enroll subjects, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to \nresolve these issues. Although the severity of the COVID-19 virus has decreased during the past year, the \nextent to which COVID-19 may impact our ReMEDy2 trial if the clinical hold is lifted will depend on future \ndevelopments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the emergence of \nnew variants, the duration and severity of each variant, and the effectiveness of actions to contain, treat and \nprevent COVID-19, including the availability, effectiveness and acceptance of vaccines and vaccine booster \nshots. The resurgence of COVID-19 caused by any new variants in the future or another pandemic could \ncause us to experience continued and/or additional disruptions that could severely impact our ReMEDy2 \ntrial, as well as our business. \nThe adaptive design of our ReMEDy2 trial could result in the trial being required to enroll more patients \nthan anticipated, increasing the time and costs to complete the trial, which may require additional funding \nthat may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all. \nOur ReMEDy2 trial is currently targeted to enroll approximately 350 patients at up to 75 sites in the United \nStates if the clinical hold imposed by the FDA is lifted. However, with the trial’s adaptive design, it is \npossible that the number of patients required to complete the trial may increase significantly. If we are \nrequired to enroll more patients than currently anticipated, it will increase the time and costs to complete the \ntrial, which may result in a need for additional funding that may not be available to us on acceptable terms, \nor at all. \nIf our ReMEDy2 trial fails to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of DM199 to treat AIS, we will not be \nable to obtain the regulatory approvals required to market and commercialize the product, which would \nsubstantially harm our business and prospects. \nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of DM199 to treat AIS, we must \ndemonstrate the safety and efficacy of DM199 to treat AIS, including through the successful completion of \nour ReMEDy2 trial, if we can get the clinical hold lifted. Clinical testing is expensive and difficult to design \nand implement, can take many years to complete, and has uncertain outcomes. The outcome of preclinical \ntrials and early clinical trials may not predict the success of later clinical trials, and the interim results of \nReMEDy2 may not necessarily predict final results. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and \nbiotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy \nor unacceptable safety profiles, including the emergence of undesirable side effects, notwithstanding \npromising results in earlier trials. We do not know whether our ReMEDy2 trial by itself will demonstrate \nadequate efficacy and safety to support regulatory approvals to market DM199 to treat AIS in the United \nStates, or in any jurisdiction, or that a second confirmatory trial will be required. A product candidate may \nfail for safety or efficacy reasons at any stage of the testing process. In addition, the patient populations in \nour current clinical trial for DM199, and anticipated future clinical trials for DM199, often have co-"

If the results of our ReMEDy2 trial are \ninconclusive with respect to efficacy, if we do not meet our clinical endpoints with statistical significance, or \nif there are unanticipated safety concerns or adverse events that emerge during the ReMEDy2 trial or other \nclinical trials, such as the events that caused the FDA to place a clinical hold on the IND for our ReMEDy2 \ntrial, we may be prevented from or delayed in obtaining marketing approval, and even if we obtain marketing \napproval, any sales of DM199 for the treatment of AIS may be limited.  \nWe may be required to suspend, repeat or terminate our ReMEDy2 trial or other clinical trials if they \nare deemed not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, the results are negative or \ninconclusive or the trials are not well designed. \nClinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Clinical Practices (cGCP) \nrequirements, or analogous requirements of applicable foreign regulatory authorities, and designed to provide \nstatistically significant evidence predictive of patient benefit. Clinical trials are subject to oversight by the \nFDA, other foreign governmental agencies and IRBs or ethics committees at the trial sites where the clinical \ntrials are conducted. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates produced in \naccordance with applicable cGMP. Clinical trials may be suspended by us or by the FDA, other foreign \nregulatory authorities, or by an IRB or ethics committee with respect to a particular clinical trial site, for \nvarious reasons, including: \n \ndeficiencies in the conduct of the clinical trials, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in \naccordance with regulatory requirements or trial protocols; \n \ndeficiencies in the clinical trial operations or trial sites; \n \nunforeseen adverse side effects or the emergence of undue risks to trial subjects; \n \ndeficiencies in the trial design necessary to demonstrate efficacy; \n \nthe product candidate may not appear to offer benefits over current therapies; or \n \nthe quality or stability of the product candidate may fall below acceptable standards. \nThe design and implementation of clinical trials is a complex process. As a Company, we have limited \nexperience designing and implementing clinical trials. We may not successfully or cost-effectively design \nand implement clinical trials that achieve our desired clinical endpoints. A clinical trial that is not well \ndesigned or that yields unforeseen adverse side effects or undue risks to trial subjects may delay or even \nprevent initiation of the trial, can lead to increased difficulty in site activations and enrolling patients, may \nmake it more difficult to obtain regulatory approval for the product candidate on the basis of the trial results \nor, even if a product candidate is approved, could make it more difficult to commercialize the product \nsuccessfully or obtain reimbursement from third party payers. Additionally, a trial that is not well designed \nor that yields unforeseen adverse side effects or undue risks to trial subjects could be delayed and more \nexpensive than it otherwise would have been, or we may incorrectly estimate the costs to complete the \nclinical trial, which could lead to a shortfall in funding. We can provide no assurance that our ReMEDy2 trial \nor any other clinical trial conducted by us has been or will be designed and implemented successfully or \nachieve its desired clinical endpoints. \nFuture legislation in the United States, Europe or other countries, and/or regulations and policies \nadopted by the FDA, the EMA or comparable regulatory authorities, may increase the time and cost \nrequired for us or any future partners or collaborators to conduct and complete clinical trials of our \ncurrent or any future product candidates. \nThe FDA and the EMA have each established regulations to govern the drug product development and \napproval process, as have other foreign regulatory authorities. The policies of the FDA, the EMA and other \nregulatory authorities may change. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act)"

The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and \nspur innovation, but not all of its provisions have yet been implemented. Additionally, in August 2017, the \nFDA issued final guidance setting forth its current thinking with respect to development programs and \nclinical trial designs for antibacterial drugs to treat serious bacterial diseases in patients with an unmet \nmedical need. We cannot predict what if any effect the Cures Act or any existing or future guidance from the \nFDA or other regulatory authorities will have on the development of DM199 or any future product candidate. \nOur prospects depend on the clinical and commercial success of our DM199 product candidate which \nis in the clinical stage of development. \nWe are highly dependent on the success of DM199 and we may not be able to successfully obtain regulatory \nor marketing approval for, or successfully commercialize, this product candidate. To date, we have expended \nsignificant time, resources and effort on the development of DM199, including conducting preclinical and \nclinical trials, for the treatment of AIS and CKD. DM199 requires significant additional clinical testing and \ninvestment prior to seeking marketing approval. A commitment of substantial resources by ourselves and any \npotential partner or collaborator to continue to conduct the clinical trials for DM199 will be required to \nobtain required regulatory approvals and successfully commercialize this product candidate. Although we \nintend to study the use of DM199 to treat multiple diseases, we have no other product candidates in our \ncurrent clinical development pipeline, with the exception of our new product candidate, DM300, which is in \nthe early, preclinical stage of development and is intended to treat other inflammatory diseases, such as acute \npancreatitis. Our ability to generate revenue from product sales and to achieve commercial success with \nDM199 will depend almost entirely on our ability to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain \nregulatory approval for DM199. We may fail to complete required clinical trials successfully and not be able \nto obtain regulatory approvals or commercialize DM199. Competitors may develop alternative products and \nmethodologies to treat the diseases or indications that we are pursuing, thus reducing or eliminating the \nanticipated competitive advantages of DM199. We do not know whether any of our product development \nefforts will prove to be effective, meet applicable regulatory standards required to obtain the requisite \nregulatory approvals, be capable of being manufactured at a reasonable cost or be successfully marketed. \nDM199 is not expected to be commercially viable for at least three or four years. In addition, although the \nonly significant adverse events that have occurred to date in our clinical trials have been three unexpected \ninstances of transient, clinically significant, hypotension (low blood pressure), as described above, it is \npossible that DM199 may be observed to cause undesirable side effects. Results of early preclinical and \nclinical research may not be indicative of the results that will be obtained in later stages of clinical research. \nIf regulatory authorities do not approve DM199 for the treatment of AIS and/or CKD or any other \nindications, or if we fail to maintain regulatory compliance, we would be unable to commercialize DM199 \nand our business and results of operations would be harmed. If we do succeed in developing viable products \nfrom DM199, we will face many potential future obstacles, such as the need to develop or obtain \nmanufacturing, sales and marketing and distribution capabilities. \nThe clinical success and commercial potential of our DM199 product candidate will depend on a number \nof factors, many of which are beyond our control. \nThe clinical success and commercial potential of our DM199 product candidate to treat AIS, CKD or any \nother indication will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, \namong others: \n \nthe timely initiation, continuation and completion of clinical trials, including the re-initiation of \nour Phase 2/3 ReMEDy2 trial and future clinical trials for DM199, which will depend \nsubstantially upon requirements for such trials or partial or full clinical holds imposed by the \nFDA and other regulatory agencies and bodies;"

We may elect to raise additional funds even \nbefore we need them if market conditions for raising additional capital are favorable. \nSince our inception, we have financed our operations primarily from public and private sales of equity \nsecurities, the exercise of warrants and stock options, interest income on funds available for investment, and \ngovernment grants and tax incentives, and we expect to continue this practice for the foreseeable future. We \ndo not have any existing credit facilities under which we could borrow funds. We may seek to raise \nadditional funds through various sources, such as equity and debt financings, or through strategic \ncollaborations and license agreements. We can give no assurances that we will be able to secure additional \nsources of funds to support our operations, or if such funds are available to us, that such additional financing \nwill be sufficient to meet our needs or on terms acceptable to us. This is particularly true if we are unable to \nlift the clinical hold on the IND for our ReMEDy2 trial, if we experience additional adverse events, if our \nclinical data is not positive or economic and market conditions deteriorate. \nAlthough we previously have been successful in obtaining financing through our equity securities offerings, \nthere can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. To the extent we raise additional capital \nthrough the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our shareholders will be \ndiluted. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include conversion discounts or covenants \nlimiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital \nexpenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through government or other third-party \nfunding, marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations or strategic alliances or licensing \narrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future \nrevenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be \nfavorable to us.

Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails \nsubstantial upfront financial expenditures and significant risk that a product candidate will fail to prove \neffective, gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. Additionally, there has been a general \ndecline in the biotech sector since February 2021, which has further increased the risks associated with \ninvestment in biopharmaceutical product development. We do not have any products approved by regulatory \nauthorities and have not generated any revenues from product sales to date, and do not expect to generate any \nrevenue from the sale of products for at least three or four years. We have incurred significant R&D and \nother administrative expenses related to our ongoing operations and expect to continue to incur such \nexpenses. As a result, we have not been profitable and have incurred significant operating losses in every \nreporting period since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we incurred a net \nloss of $13.7 million and $13.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated \ndeficit of $96.2 million. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue \nto have an adverse effect on our shareholders’ equity and working capital. We expect to continue to incur \nsubstantial operating losses as we continue our R&D activities, planned clinical trials and actions taken in \norder to lift the clinical hold imposed by the FDA on the IND for our the Phase 2/3 ReMEDy2 trial, \nregulatory activities and other administrative expenses and to support the development of DM199 or any \nfuture product candidate to a point where it can be out-licensed or receives required regulatory approvals and \nmay be commercially sold and we begin to recognize future product sales, or receive royalty payments, \nlicensing fees and/or milestone payments sufficient to generate revenues to fund our continuing operations. \nWe expect our operating losses to increase in the near term as we continue development of DM199 and the \nclinical trials required to seek regulatory approval for DM199, or any future product candidate. We are \nunable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if ever. Our failure to \nbecome and remain profitable may depress the market price of our common shares and could impair our \nability to raise capital, continue to develop DM199, or any future product candidate, expand our business and \nproduct offerings or continue our operations. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to \nsustain or increase profitability on an ongoing basis. \nRisks Related to Governmental and Regulatory Compliance and Approvals \nThe regulatory approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us or any \nfuture partner or collaborator from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of DM199 or any \nfuture product candidate.  \nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive and may \ntake many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, \nincluding the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate involved. Our DM199 or any future \nproduct candidate, and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including \ndesign, research, testing, manufacture, quality control, recordkeeping, labeling, packaging, storage, \nadvertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import, export and reporting of safety and other post-market \ninformation, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA, the EMA and other similar foreign \nregulatory agencies.

We have only \nlimited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect \nto rely on a future partner, collaborator or third-parties to assist us in this process. Securing marketing \napproval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to \nregulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate’s safety and efficacy. \nSecuring marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing \nprocess to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. The FDA, EMA or other \nregulatory authorities may determine that DM199 or any future product candidate may not be effective, may \nbe only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other \ncharacteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit its commercial use. As \na result, any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-\napproval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. Our or any future partner’s \ninability to obtain regulatory approval for DM199 or any future product candidate, or if such approval is \nlimited, could substantially harm our business. \nAny product candidate for which we or any future partner or collaborator obtains marketing \napproval could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or recall or withdrawal from the market, and \nwe may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience \nunanticipated problems with the product candidate. \nThe FDA and other federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), closely \nregulate compliance with all requirements governing prescription drug products, including requirements \npertaining to marketing and promotion of drugs in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling \nand manufacturing of products. The FDA and DOJ impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ \ncommunications regarding off-label use, and if we do not market our products for their approved indications, \nwe may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of such requirements may lead \nto investigations alleging violations of the FDCA and other statutes, including the False Claims Act and other \nfederal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws. \nOur or any future partner’s failure to comply with all regulatory requirements, or the later discovery of \npreviously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing \nprocesses, may yield various results, including: \n \nlitigation involving patients using our products; \n \nrestrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes; \n \nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product; \n \nrestrictions on product distribution or use; \n \nrequirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials; \n \nwarning or untitled letters; \n \nwithdrawal of the products from the market; \n \nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit; \n \nrecall of products; \n \nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues; \n \nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals; \n \ndamage to relationships with any then current or potential partners; \n \nunfavorable press coverage and damage to our or any future partner’s reputation; \n \nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products; \n \nproduct seizure; or \n \ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties."

Similarly, failure to comply with regulatory requirements \nregarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions. \nWe may not be able to obtain FDA acceptance of INDs to commence future clinical trials in the United \nStates or on the timelines we expect, and even if we are able to, the FDA may not permit us to proceed in a \ntimely manner. \nPrior to commencing additional clinical trials in the United States for DM199 or any future product \ncandidate, we will be required to have an accepted IND for each product candidate and for each targeted \nindication. In April 2021, we filed, and in May 2021, the FDA accepted, an IND for the Phase 2/3 ReMEDy2 \ntrial in patients with AIS. However, in July 2022, the FDA imposed a clinical hold on the IND under which \nwe are conducting our Phase 2/3 ReMEDy2 trial. A submission of an IND may not necessarily result in the \nFDA allowing further clinical trials to begin and, once begun, issues, such as clinical holds, may arise that \nwill require us to suspend or terminate such clinical trials. Additionally, even if relevant regulatory \nauthorities agree with the design and implementation of the clinical trials set forth in an IND, these \nregulatory authorities may change their requirements in the future. Failure to obtain a lifting of the clinical \nhold on the IND for our ReMEDy2 trial or to obtain acceptance of any future INDs may cause the \ndevelopment of DM199 or any future product candidate to be delayed or terminated, which could materially \nand adversely affect our business and prospects. \nWe have received Fast Track designation for DM199 for the treatment of AIS, and we may seek such \ndesignation for other uses of DM199 or future product candidates. Fast Track designation may not lead to \nfaster development, FDA review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that DM199 \nwill receive marketing approval in the United States. Further, there is no guarantee we will be able to \nmaintain such designation. \nIn September 2021, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for DM199 for the treatment of AIS \nwhere tPA and/or mechanical thrombectomy are not indicated or medically appropriate. The FDA may grant \nFast Track designation to a drug that is intended to treat a serious condition and nonclinical or clinical data \ndemonstrate the potential to address unmet medical need. The FDA provides opportunities for frequent \ninteractions with the review team for a Fast Track product, including pre-IND meetings, end-of-phase 1 \nmeetings, and end-of-phase 2 meetings with the FDA to discuss study design, extent of safety data required \nto support approval, dose-response concerns, and use of biomarkers. A Fast Track product may also be \neligible for rolling review, where the FDA reviews portions of a marketing application before the sponsor \nsubmits the complete application.  \nHowever, Fast Track designation for DM199 may not result in a faster development process, review or \napproval compared to products considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not \nassure ultimate approval by the FDA. Any delay in the review process or in the approval of DM199 will \ndelay revenue from potential sales and will increase the capital necessary to fund our development programs \nand operations. In addition, the FDA may rescind the Fast Track designation for DM199 if the FDA later \ndetermines that DM199 no longer meets the qualifying criteria for Fast Track designation. \nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us and any future partner or \ncollaborator to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize DM199 or any future product \ncandidate and affect the prices we may obtain. \nIn the United States and many foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory \nchanges and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system and data privacy that could prevent or delay"

For example, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) enacted in the United States \nin 2010, and principally taking effect in 2014, included measures to change health care delivery, decrease the \nnumber of individuals without insurance, ensure access to certain basic health care services, and contain the \nrising cost of care. This healthcare reform movement, including the enactment of the ACA, has significantly \nchanged health care financing by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. With respect to \npharmaceutical manufacturers, the ACA increased the number of individuals with access to health care \ncoverage, including prescription drug coverage, but it simultaneously imposed, among other things, \nincreased liability for rebates and discounts owed to certain entities and government health care programs, \nfees for the manufacture or importation of certain branded drugs and transparency reporting requirements \nunder the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. In addition to the ACA, other federal health reform measures \nhave been proposed and adopted in the United States. We expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare \nreform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and \nadditional downward pressure on the price that we may receive for any product, if approved. Any reduction \nin reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in \npayments from private payers. \nThe 117th United States Congress (2021-2022) closely monitored drug pricing and healthcare spending in \nthe United States. Many members of Congress have prioritized and will likely continue to prioritize policies \ntargeting reducing drug prices and healthcare spending and are committed to lowering spending in federal \ngovernment programs. Pending legislation, such as the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act and the \nElijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, could significantly change healthcare spending. \nAdditionally, the current U.S. presidential administration has prioritized reducing drug pricing and price \ntransparency in the healthcare industry. On July 9, 2021, an Executive Order was signed directing federal \nagencies to develop and implement policies to lower drug prices. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act of \n2022, which was signed into law on August 16, 2022, includes provisions aimed at lowering prescription \ndrug costs for Medicare patients and reducing the federal government’s spending on prescription drugs by \nrequiring certain prescription drug prices to be negotiated directly with the government, certain rebates to be \npaid by prescription drug companies, and certain spending caps to be implemented, among other measures. \nThe implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us or a future \npartner from being able to generate sufficient revenue, attain profitability or even commercialize at all \nDM199 or any future product candidate. \nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties \nWe rely and will continue to rely on third parties to support the planning, execution and/or monitoring \nof our preclinical and clinical trials, and their failure to perform as required could cause delays in \ncompleting our product development and substantial harm to our business. \nWe rely and will continue to rely on third parties to conduct a significant portion of our preclinical and \nclinical development activities. Preclinical activities include in vivo studies in specific disease models, \npharmacology and toxicology studies and assay development. Clinical development activities include trial \ndesign, regulatory submissions, clinical site and patient recruitment, clinical trial monitoring, clinical data \nmanagement and analysis, safety monitoring and project management. If there is any dispute or disruption in \nour relationship with third parties, or if they are unable to provide quality services in a timely manner and at \na feasible cost, including as a result of staffing disruptions, our development programs may face delays."

It is not possible for us to be certain that we are the creator of inventions covered by \npending patent applications or that we were the first to invent or file patent applications for any such \ninventions.

Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical \nindustry involves technological and legal complexity, and obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents \nis costly, time consuming, and inherently uncertain. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent \ncases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or \nweakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard \nto our or any licensors’ or collaborators’ ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has \ncreated uncertainty with respect to the value of patents once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. \nCongress, the federal courts, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the laws and regulations \ngoverning patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our or any licensors’ or \ncollaborators’ ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents and patents we or any licensors or \ncollaborators may obtain in the future. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws \nin the United States or other countries could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution \nof patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. \nAssuming that other requirements for patentability are met, prior to March 2013, in the United States, the \nfirst to invent the claimed invention was entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file \na patent application was entitled to the patent. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents \nAct (the America Invents Act), enacted in September 2011, the United States transitioned to a first inventor \nto file system in which, assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a \npatent application is entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to \ninvent the claimed invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after March 2013, but \nbefore us could, therefore, be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the \ninvention before it was made by such third party. This will require us to be cognizant of the time from \ninvention to filing of a patent application. Since patent applications in the United States and most other \ncountries are confidential for a period of time after filing or until issuance, we cannot be certain that we or \nany licensor were the first to either (i) file any patent application related to our product candidates or \n(ii) invent any of the inventions claimed in our or any licensor’s patents or patent applications. \nThe America Invents Act also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent \napplications will be prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation. These include allowing third party \nsubmission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the \nvalidity of a patent in USPTO-administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter partes \nreview, and derivation proceedings. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings \ncompared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a \nthird party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a \nclaim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in \na district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our \npatent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a \ndistrict court action. Therefore, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the \nuncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our owned or in-licensed patent applications and the \nenforcement or defense of our owned or in-licensed issued patents, all of which could have a material \nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects."

We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any of these types of actions or that \nany required license would be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Some of our competitors \nmay be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have \nsubstantially greater resources. \nCompetitors may infringe our patents or other intellectual property. If we were to initiate legal proceedings \nagainst a third party to enforce a patent covering our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim \nthat the patent covering our product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the \nUnited States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. \nGrounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, \nincluding lack of novelty, obviousness, written description or non-enablement. Grounds for an \nunenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent \nwithheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The \noutcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. Moreover, similar \nchallenges may be made by third parties outside the context of litigation, e.g., via administrative proceedings \nsuch as post grant or inter partes review in the United States or via oppositions or other similar proceedings \nin other countries/regions. \nInterference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO \nmay be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. \nAn unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights \nto it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a \nlicense on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or if a non-exclusive license is offered and our \ncompetitors gain access to the same technology. Our defense of litigation, validity or enforceability, \ninterference or derivation proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and \ndistract our management and other employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation or such \nother proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue \nour clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter \ninto development partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market. \nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property \nlitigation or administrative proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be \ncompromised by disclosure. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or \nother interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be \nnegative, it could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common shares."

We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality \nagreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, collaborative research agreements, employment \nor consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees, and \nconsultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically \nrestrict the ability of our collaborators, advisors, employees, and consultants to publish data potentially \nrelating to our trade secrets. In the future, we may also conduct joint R&D programs which may require us to \nshare trade secrets under the terms of R&D collaboration or similar agreements. We cannot be certain that \nour current or any future agreements have been or will be entered into with all relevant parties. Moreover, \ndespite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, our competitors may discover our trade secrets, either through \nbreach of these agreements, independent development or publication of information including our trade \nsecrets in cases where we do not have proprietary or otherwise protected rights at the time of publication. \nTrade secrets can be difficult to protect. If the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed \ninadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating any trade secrets. A \ncompetitor’s discovery of our trade secrets may impair our competitive position and could have a material \nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. \nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect the competitive position of DM199 or any future product \ncandidate for an adequate amount of time. \nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural \nexpiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Certain \nextensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents \ncovering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to \ncompetition from competitive products, including generics or biosimilars. Given the amount of time required \nfor the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such \ncandidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned \nand licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from \ncommercializing products similar or identical to ours. \nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have \nwrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have \nwrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers. \nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we employ individuals who were \npreviously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our \ncompetitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and \nindependent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, \nwe may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have \ninadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary \ninformation, of any of our employees’ former employers or other third parties. Litigation may be necessary \nto defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary \ndamages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our \nbusiness. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial \ncosts and be a distraction to management and other employees."

We have systems in place \nto remind us to pay these fees, and we employ an outside firm and rely on our outside counsel to pay these \nfees due to non-U.S. patent agencies. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies \nrequire compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions \nduring the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us \ncomply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in \naccordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in \nabandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights \nin the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this \ncircumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business. \nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. \nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates in all countries throughout the world \nwould be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United \nStates can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do \nnot protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. \nConsequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries \noutside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the \nUnited States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not \nobtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export infringing products to \nterritories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. \nThese products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not \nbe effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. \nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property \nrights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing \ncountries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, \nparticularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the \ninfringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights \ngenerally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could \nresult in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put \nour patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of \nnot issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits \nthat we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. \nAccordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to \nobtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. \nMany countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant \nlicenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government \nagencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which \ncould materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to \nthird parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, \nand our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may be adversely affected."

The degree of market acceptance for DM199 or any product \ncandidate we develop will depend on a number of factors including, among others: \n \ndemonstration of sufficient clinical efficacy and safety; \n \nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects; \n \nlimitations or warnings contained in the product’s approved labeling; \n \ncost-effectiveness and availability of acceptable pricing; \n \nthe availability of alternative treatment methods and the superiority of alternative treatment \nmethods; \n \nthe effectiveness of marketing and distribution methods and support for the product; and \n \ncoverage and reimbursement policies of government and third-party payers to the extent that the \nproduct could receive regulatory approval but not be approved for coverage by or receive \nadequate reimbursement from government and quasi-government agencies or other third-party \npayers. \nIf we fail to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for DM199 or any future product candidate, its \nrevenue-generating ability will be diminished and there is no assurance that the anticipated market for the \nproduct will develop or be sustained. \nOur or any future partner’s ability to successfully commercialize DM199 or any future product candidate will \ndepend, in part, on the extent to which coverage of and adequate reimbursement for such product and related \ntreatments will be available from governmental health payer programs at the federal and state levels, \nincluding Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, managed care plans and other organizations. No \nassurance can be given that third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available that will allow \nus or any future partner to obtain or maintain price levels sufficient for the realization of an appropriate \nreturn on our investment in product development. Coverage and adequate reimbursement are critical to new \nproduct acceptance by healthcare providers. There is no uniform coverage and reimbursement policy among \nthird-party payers in the United States; however, private third-party payers may follow Medicare coverage \nand reimbursement policy in setting their own coverage policy and reimbursement rates. Additionally, \ncoverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when \nmore established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are or subsequently become available. Even if \ncoverage is obtained for DM199 or any future product candidate, the related reimbursement rates might not \nbe adequate to make the product attractive to providers, or may require patient cost sharing (e.g., copayments \nand/or deductibles) that patients find unacceptably high. In addition, healthcare reform and controls on \nhealthcare spending may limit coverage of the product and the price we charge and get paid for the product \nand the volumes thereof that we can sell. Patients are unlikely to use DM199 or any future product candidate \nunless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of its cost. \nOutside of the United States, the successful commercialization of DM199 or any future product candidate \nwill depend largely on obtaining and maintaining government coverage, because in many countries, patients \nare unlikely to use prescription drugs that are not covered by their government healthcare programs. \nNegotiating coverage and reimbursement with governmental authorities can delay commercialization by 12 \nmonths or more.

In many international markets, \ngovernments control the prices of prescription pharmaceuticals, including through the implementation of \nreference pricing, price cuts, rebates, revenue-related taxes and profit control, and we expect prices of \nprescription pharmaceuticals to decline over the life of the product or as volumes increase. \nWe or any future partner will likely face competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical \ncompanies, many of which have substantially greater resources, and our DM199 product candidate \nmay face competition sooner than expected and our financial condition and operations will suffer if we \nfail to compete effectively. \nTechnological competition is intense in the industry in which we operate. Development of new, potentially \ncompetitive therapies comes from pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and universities, as \nwell as companies that offer non-pharmaceutical solutions. Many of our competitors have substantially \ngreater financial and technical resources; more extensive R&D capabilities; and greater marketing, \ndistribution, production and human resources than we do. Moreover, competitors may develop products more \nquickly than us and may obtain regulatory approval for such products more rapidly than we do. Products and \nprocesses which are more effective than those that we intend to develop may be developed by our \ncompetitors. R&D by others may render our product candidates non-competitive or obsolete. \nOur DM199 product candidate may face competition sooner than expected. \nWe believe that DM199 could qualify for 12 years of data exclusivity in the United States under the \nBiologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), which was enacted as part of the ACA. \nUnder the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product, or BLA, cannot be submitted to the FDA until \nfour years, or if approved by the FDA, until 12 years, after the original brand product identified as the \nreference product is approved under a BLA. The BPCIA provides an abbreviated pathway for the approval of \nbiosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes \nlegal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of \na biosimilar as “interchangeable” based on its similarity to an existing brand product. This law is complex \nand is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. While it is uncertain when any such \nprocesses may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the \nfuture commercial prospects for DM199 or any future product candidate that is a biologic. There is also a \nrisk that the U.S. Congress could repeal or amend the BPCIA to shorten this exclusivity period, potentially \ncreating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated after the expiration of our patent \nprotection. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any reference \nproduct in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, \nand will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. \nEven if, as we expect, our DM199 product candidate is considered to be a reference product eligible for 12 \nyears of exclusivity under the BPCIA, another company could market competing products if the FDA \napproves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate \nand well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the products. Moreover, an \namendment or repeal of the BPCIA could result in a shorter exclusivity period for our DM199 product \ncandidate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of \noperations, and prospects."

For any taxable year in which 75% or more of our gross income is passive income, or at least \n50% of the value of our assets (where the value of our total assets is determined based upon the market value \nof our common shares at the end of each quarter) are held for the production of, or produce, passive income, \nwe would be characterized as a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) for U.S. federal income tax \npurposes. The percentage of a corporation’s assets that produce or are held for the production of passive \nincome generally is determined based upon the average ratio of passive assets to total assets calculated at the \nend of each measuring period. Calculation of the value of assets at the end of each measuring period is \ngenerally made at the end of each of the four quarters that make up the company’s taxable year, unless an \nelection is made to use an alternative measuring period (such as a week or month). The “weighted average” \nof those periodic values is then used to determine the value of assets for the passive asset test for the taxable \nyear. In proposed regulations section 1.1297-1(d)(2), a limited exception to the passive asset test valuation \nrules is provided for the treatment of working capital in order to take into account the short-term cash needs \nof operating companies. This new rule provides that an amount of cash held in a non-interest bearing account \nthat is held for the present needs of an active trade or business and is no greater than the amount reasonably \nexpected to cover 90 days of operating expenses incurred in the ordinary course of the trade or business of \nthe foreign corporation (for example, accounts payable for ordinary operating expenses or employee \ncompensation) is not treated as a passive asset. The Treasury Department and the IRS indicated that they \ncontinue to study the appropriate treatment of working capital for purposes of the passive asset test. \nPFIC Status Determination. The tests for determining PFIC status for any taxable year are dependent upon a \nnumber of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the value of our assets, the market price \nof our common shares, and the amount and type of our gross income. Based on these tests (i) we believe that \nwe were a PFIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2016, (ii) we do not believe that we were a PFIC \nfor any of the taxable years ended December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2021, and (iii) we believe that \nwe were a PFIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2022. Our status as a PFIC is a fact-intensive \ndetermination made for each taxable year, and we cannot provide any assurance regarding our PFIC status \nfor the taxable year ending December 31, 2023 or for future taxable years. U.S. shareholders who own our \ncommon shares for any period during which we are a PFIC (which we believe would currently only be those \nshareholders that held our common shares in the taxable year ended December 31, 2016 or December 31, \n2022) will be required to file IRS Form 8621 for each tax year during which they hold our common shares, \nunless, after we are no longer a PFIC, any such shareholder makes the “purging election” discussed below. \nPFIC Consequences.

Pursuant to the specific provisions of the PFIC rules, a taxpayer may realize gain on \nthe disposition of common shares if the securities are disposed of by a holder whose securities are attributed \nto the U.S. shareholder, if the securities are pledged as security for a loan, transferred by gift or death, or are \nsubject to certain corporate distributions. Additionally, if we are a PFIC, a U.S. shareholder who acquires our \ncommon shares from a decedent would be denied normally available step-up in tax basis for our common \nshares to fair market value at the date of death but instead would have a tax basis equal to the lower of the \nfair market value of such common shares or the decedent’s tax basis in such common shares. Newly \nproposed regulations, that are not yet effective, address domestic partnerships and S corporations that own \nstock in a PFIC for which a QEF election or “mark-to-market” election could be made. Currently, only the \ndomestic partnership or S corporation (and not the partners or S corporation shareholders) can make these \nelections. The proposed regulations would reverse the current rule so that only the partners or S corporation \nshareholders — not the partnership or S corporation — could make the elections. These proposed regulations \nwould only apply to partnership or S corporation shareholders’ tax years beginning on or after the date they \nare issued in final form. \nQEF Election. A U.S. shareholder may avoid the adverse tax consequences described above by making a \ntimely and effective QEF election. A U.S. shareholder who makes a QEF election generally must report, on a \ncurrent basis, its share of our ordinary earnings and net capital gains, whether or not we distribute any \namounts to our shareholders, and would be required to comply with specified information reporting \nrequirements. Any gain subsequently recognized upon the sale by that U.S. shareholder of the common \nshares generally would be taxed as capital gain and the denial of the basis step-up at death described above \nwould not apply. The QEF election is available only if the company characterized as a PFIC provides a U.S. \nshareholder with certain information regarding its earnings and capital gains, as required under applicable \nU.S. Treasury regulations. We intend to provide all information and documentation that a U.S. shareholder \nmaking a QEF election is required to obtain for U.S. federal income tax purposes (e.g., the U.S. \nshareholder’s pro rata share of ordinary income and net capital gain, and a “PFIC Annual Information \nStatement” as described in applicable U.S. Treasury regulations). \nMark-to-Market Election. As an alternative to a QEF Election, a U.S. shareholder may also mitigate the \nadverse tax consequences of PFIC status by timely making a “mark-to-market” election. A U.S. shareholder \nwho makes the mark-to-market election generally must include as ordinary income each year the increase in \nthe fair market value of the common shares and deduct from gross income the decrease in the value of such \nshares during each of its taxable years. Losses would be allowed only to the extent of the net mark-to-market \ngain accrued under the election. If a mark-to-market election with respect to our common shares is in effect \non the date of a U.S. shareholder’s death, the tax basis of the common shares in the hands of a U.S. \nshareholder who acquired them from a decedent will be the lesser of the decedent’s tax basis or the fair \nmarket value of the common shares. A mark-to-market election may be made and maintained only if our \ncommon shares are regularly traded on a qualified exchange, including The Nasdaq Capital Market. Whether \nour common shares are regularly traded on a qualified exchange is an annual determination based on facts \nthat, in part, are beyond our control. Accordingly, a U.S. shareholder might not be eligible to make a mark-\nto-market election to mitigate the adverse tax consequences if we are characterized as a PFIC. \nElection Tax Risks. Certain economic risks are inherent in making either a QEF Election or a mark-to-market \nelection. If a QEF Election is made, it is possible that earned income will be reported to a U.S. shareholder as \ntaxable income and income taxes will be due and payable on such an amount. A U.S. shareholder of our \ncommon shares may pay tax on such “phantom” income, i.e., where income is reported to it pursuant to the \nQEF Election, but no cash is distributed with respect to such income. There is no assurance that any \ndistribution or profitable sale will ever be made regarding our common shares, so the tax liability may result \nin a net economic loss. A mark-to-market election may result in significant share price gains in one year"

If a \nmark-to-market election is made, this highly variable tax gain or loss may result in substantial and \nunpredictable changes in taxable income. The amount included in income under a mark-to-market election \nmay be substantially greater than the amount included under a QEF election. Both the QEF and mark-to-\nmarket elections are binding on the U.S. shareholder for all subsequent years that the U.S. shareholder owns \nour shares unless permission to revoke the election is granted by the IRS. \nPurging Election. Although we generally will continue to be treated as a PFIC as to any U.S. shareholder if \nwe are a PFIC for any year during a U.S. shareholder’s holding period, if we cease to satisfy the \nrequirements for PFIC classification, the U.S. shareholder may avoid PFIC classification for subsequent \nyears if the U.S. shareholder elects to make a so-called “purging election,” by recognizing income based on \nthe unrealized appreciation in the common shares through the close of the tax year in which we cease to be a \nPFIC. When a foreign corporation no longer qualifies as a PFIC (due to a change in facts or law), the foreign \ncorporation nonetheless retains its PFIC status with respect to a shareholder unless and until the shareholder \nmakes an election under Code section 1298(b)(1) and regulations section 1.1298–3 (purging election) on IRS \nForm 8621 attached to the shareholder’s tax return (including an amended return), or requests the consent of \nthe IRS Commissioner to make a late election under Code section 1298(b)(1) and regulations section \n1.1298–3(e) (late purging election) on Form 8621-A. \nRULES RELATING TO A PFIC ARE VERY COMPLEX.

In addition, the possibility of us being classified as a PFIC may deter certain U.S. investors \nfrom purchasing our common shares, which could have an adverse impact on the market price of our \ncommon shares and our ability to raise additional financing by selling equity securities, including our \ncommon shares. \nIt may be difficult for non-Canadian shareholders or investors to obtain and enforce judgments \nagainst us because of our organization as a British Columbia corporation. \nWe are a corporation governed under the BCBCA. Two of our directors are residents of Canada, and all or a \nsubstantial portion of their assets, and a small portion of our assets, are located outside the United States. \nConsequently, it may be difficult for holders of our securities who reside in the United States to effect service \nwithin the United States upon those directors who are not residents of the United States. It may also be \ndifficult for holders of our securities who reside in the United States to realize in the United States upon \njudgments of courts of the United States predicated upon our civil liability and the civil liability of our \ndirectors, and officers under the United States federal securities laws.

We are exposed to the risk of product liability claims alleging that use of DM199 or any future \nproduct candidate caused an injury or harm. These claims can arise at any point in the development, testing, \nmanufacture, marketing or sale of a product candidate and may be made directly by patients involved in \nclinical trials of our product candidate, by consumers or healthcare providers, or by individuals, \norganizations or companies selling our products, if and when approved. Product liability claims can be \nexpensive to defend, even if the product or product candidate did not actually cause the alleged injury or \nharm, and could lead to clinical trial delays and could negatively impact existing or future collaborations. \nInsurance covering product liability claims becomes increasingly expensive as a product candidate moves \nthrough the development pipeline to commercialization. To protect against potential product liability risks, \nwe carry product liability insurance coverage at a level we deem appropriate for our stage of development. \nHowever, there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage is or will continue to be adequate or \navailable to us at a cost acceptable to us or at all. We may choose or find it necessary under our collaboration \nagreements to increase our insurance coverage in the future. We may not be able to secure greater or broader \nproduct liability insurance coverage on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed. Any liability \nfor damages resulting from a product liability claim could exceed the amount of our coverage, require us to \npay a substantial monetary award from our own cash resources, and otherwise have a material adverse effect \non our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \nIf we are unable to maintain product liability insurance required by third parties, certain agreements, \nsuch as those with clinical trial sites, contract research organizations and other supporting vendors, \nwould be subject to termination, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations. \nSome of our agreements with third parties require, and in the future will likely require, us to maintain \nproduct liability insurance in at least certain specified minimum amounts. If we cannot maintain acceptable \namounts of coverage on commercially reasonable terms in accordance with the terms set forth in these \nagreements, the corresponding agreements would be subject to termination, which could have a material \nadverse impact on our operations. \nOur insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from certain business risks, which could leave \nus exposed to significant uninsured liabilities. Additionally, future fluctuations in insurance cost and \navailability could adversely affect our operating results or risk management profile. \nWe hold a number of insurance policies, including product and general liability insurance, directors’ and \nofficers’ liability insurance, property insurance and workers’ compensation insurance. The costs of \nmaintaining adequate insurance coverage, most notably directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, have \nincreased significantly the last few years and may continue to do so in the future, thereby adversely affecting \nour operating results. If such costs continue to increase, we may be forced to accept lower coverage levels \nand higher deductibles, which, in the event of a claim, could require significant, unplanned expenditures of \ncash, which could adversely affect our business. Future potential directors and officers could view our \ndirectors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage as limited or even inadequate. Limited directors’ and \nofficers’ liability insurance coverage, or the perception that our directors’ and officers’ liability insurance \ncoverage is inadequate, may make it difficult to attract and retain directors and officers, and we may lose \npotential independent board members and management candidates to other companies that have more \nextensive directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage. In addition, if any of our current insurance \ncoverages should become unavailable to us or become economically impractical, we would be required to \noperate our business without indemnity from commercial insurance providers."

For example, during 2022, the SEC \nproposed new climate disclosure rules, which, if adopted, would require new climate-related disclosure in \nSEC filings, including certain climate-related metrics and greenhouse gas emissions data, information about \nclimate-related targets and goals, transition plans, if any, and extensive attestation requirements. In addition \nto requiring companies to quantify and disclose direct emissions data, the new rules also would require \ndisclosure of climate impact arising from the operations and uses by the company’s business partners and \ncontractors and end-users of the company’s products and/or services. We are currently assessing the impact \nof the new rules, if adopted as proposed, but at this time, we cannot predict the costs of implementation or \nany potential adverse impacts resulting from the new rules if adopted. However, we may incur increased \ncosts relating to the assessment and disclosure of climate-related risks and increased litigation risks related to \ndisclosures made pursuant to the new rules, either of which could materially and adversely affect our future \nresults of operations and financial condition. \nFurther, investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused \non these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, climate change, health and safety, supply \nchain management, diversity, labor conditions and human rights, both in our own operations and in our \nsupply chain. Increased ESG-related compliance costs could result in material increases to our overall \noperational costs. Our ESG practices may not meet the standards of all of our stakeholders and advocacy \ngroups may campaign for further changes.

At that \npoint, we will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. As such, we will be subject to certain \ndisclosure and compliance requirements that apply to other public companies but did not previously apply to \nus due to our status as an emerging growth company. While we will likely remain a smaller reporting \ncompany and still be subject to certain scaled disclosure requirements, we expect that the loss of emerging \ngrowth company status may still increase our legal and financial compliance costs and cause management \nand other personnel to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time \nto public company reporting requirements, all of which may have a negative impact on our business and \nresults of operations."

In one arm of this study, we enrolled 36 patients with Type 2 diabetes who were treated with two \nsubcutaneous dose levels of DM199 over a 28-day period. This study achieved its primary endpoint and \ndemonstrated that DM199 was well-tolerated. The secondary endpoints for this study, however, were not \nmet. The secondary efficacy endpoints were confounded due to what we believe were significant execution \nerrors caused by protocol deviations occurring at the clinical study site that were unable to be reconciled. To \ndate, we have been unable to obtain the complete study records from PRA Netherlands necessary to generate \na final study report. On November 14, 2017, we initiated litigation with PRA Netherlands in the United \nStates District Court, Southern District of New York,. The complaint alleged, among other things, that PRA \nNetherlands failed to conduct the study in accordance with the study protocol and with generally accepted \nstandards for conducting such clinical studies and that PRA Netherlands further refused to provide us with all \ndata, records and documentation, and/or access thereto, related to the study in accordance with the clinical \ntrial study agreement. The complaint sought to compel PRA Netherlands to comply with the terms of the \nclinical trial study agreement, including providing full study records and to recover damages. After PRA \nNetherlands objected to personal jurisdiction and venue, on August 24, 2018, we re-filed our complaint \nagainst both PRA Netherlands and its U.S. parent, PRA Health Sciences, Inc. (PRA USA and collectively \nwith PRA Netherlands, PRA), in the United States District Court, District of Delaware. PRA again objected \nto the venue and personal jurisdiction. On November 19, 2018, PRA Netherlands and PRA USA filed \nmotions to dismiss the lawsuit. On February 20, 2019, we filed a motion seeking to transfer the Delaware \naction to the United States District Court, District of Minnesota. PRA Netherlands and PRA USA filed an \nopposition to our motion. On September 21, 2020, the District Court judge issued a ruling denying our \nmotion to transfer indicating that DiaMedica had not met the required standards to support a venue transfer \nand on November 2, 2020, a final dismissal order was issued by the District Court judge. Due to the \nuncertainty inherent in appealing this ruling, we have chosen to cease action in the United States and file our \nclaims against PRA Netherlands directly in a Dutch Court. On November 13, 2020, PRA Netherlands was \nserved with our complaint. PRA Netherlands and PRA USA filed their initial appearances with the Dutch \nCourt on February 24, 2021.

This discussion \ndoes not address any U.S. state or local or non-U.S. tax considerations or any U.S. federal estate, gift or \nalternative minimum tax considerations. In addition, except as specifically set forth below, this summary \ndoes not discuss applicable tax reporting requirements. \nAs used in this discussion, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of common shares that is, for \nU.S. federal income tax purposes, (1) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (2) a \ncorporation (or entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in \nor under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, (3) an estate the income \nof which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source or (4) a trust (x) with respect to which \na court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or \nmore United States persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions or (y) that has elected \nunder applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a domestic trust for U.S. federal income tax \npurposes. \nIf an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the common shares, the U.S. \nfederal income tax considerations relating to an investment in the common shares will depend in part upon \nthe status and activities of such entity and the particular partner. Any such entity should consult its own tax \nadvisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to it and its partners of the purchase, \nownership and disposition of the common shares. \nPersons holding common shares should consult their own tax advisors as to the particular tax \nconsiderations applicable to them relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of common shares, \nincluding the applicability of U.S. federal, state and local tax laws and non-U.S. tax laws. \nDistributions \nSubject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations,” a U.S. Holder \nthat receives a distribution with respect to the common shares generally will be required to include the gross \namount of such distribution (before reduction for any Canadian withholding taxes) in gross income as a \ndividend when actually or constructively received to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of our \ncurrent and/or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). To \nthe extent a distribution received by a U.S. Holder is not a dividend because it exceeds the U.S. Holder’s pro \nrata share of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, it will be treated first as a tax-free return of \ncapital and reduce (but not below zero) the adjusted tax basis of the U.S. Holder’s common shares. To the \nextent the distribution exceeds the adjusted tax basis of the U.S. Holder’s common shares, the remainder will \nbe taxed as capital gain. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will maintain or provide \nearnings and profits determinations in accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles. Therefore, U.S. \nHolders should expect that a distribution will generally be treated as a dividend even if that distribution \nwould otherwise be treated as a non-taxable return of capital or as capital gain under the rules described \nabove."

If the Canadian dollars \nreceived are converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt (or deemed receipt), a U.S. Holder generally \nshould not recognize currency gain or loss on such conversion. If the Canadian dollars received are not \nconverted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt (or deemed receipt), a U.S. Holder generally will have a \nbasis in such Canadian dollars equal to the U.S. dollar value of such Canadian dollars on the date of receipt \n(or deemed receipt). Any gain or loss on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of such Canadian \ndollars by such U.S. Holder generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be income \nor loss from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. Different rules apply to \nU.S. Holders who use the accrual method of tax accounting. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own U.S. \ntax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of receiving, owning, and disposing of \nforeign currency. \nDistributions on the common shares that are treated as dividends generally will constitute income from \nsources outside the United States for foreign tax credit purposes and generally will constitute “passive \ncategory income.” Because we are not a United States corporation, such dividends will not be eligible for the \n“dividends received” deduction generally allowed to corporate shareholders with respect to dividends \nreceived from U.S. corporations. Dividends paid by a “qualified foreign corporation” to a U.S. Holder who is \nan individual, trust or estate will generally be treated as “qualified dividend income” and are eligible for \ntaxation at a reduced capital gains rate rather than the marginal tax rates generally applicable to ordinary \nincome provided that a holding period requirement (more than 60 days of ownership, without protection \nfrom the risk of loss, during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date) and certain \nother requirements are met. However, if we are a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or \nthe preceding taxable year (see discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company \nConsiderations”), we will not be treated as a qualified foreign corporation, and therefore the reduced capital \ngains tax rate described above will not apply. Each U.S. Holder is advised to consult its own tax advisors \nregarding the availability of the reduced tax rate on dividends. \nIf a U.S. Holder is subject to Canadian withholding tax on dividends paid on the holder’s common shares \n(see discussion above under “Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders—\nDividends”), the U.S. Holder may be eligible, subject to a number of complex limitations, to claim a credit \nagainst its U.S. federal income tax for the Canadian withholding tax imposed on the dividends. However, if \nU.S. persons collectively own, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the voting power or value of our \ncommon shares it is possible that a portion of any dividends we pay will be considered U.S. source income in \nproportion to our U.S. source earnings and profits, which could limit the ability of a U.S. Holder to claim a \nforeign tax credit for the Canadian withholding taxes imposed in respect of such a dividend, although certain \nelections may be available under the Code and the Convention to mitigate these effects. A U.S. Holder may \nclaim a deduction for the Canadian withholding tax in lieu of a credit, but only for a year in which the U.S. \nHolder elects to do so for all creditable foreign income taxes. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are \ncomplex. Each U.S. Holder is advised to consult its tax advisor regarding the availability of the foreign tax \ncredit under its particular circumstances."

      "text": "75 \nSale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Shares \nSubject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations,” a U.S. Holder \ngenerally will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the sale, exchange or \nother disposition of common shares. The amount of gain recognized will equal the excess of the amount \nrealized (i.e., the amount of cash plus the fair market value of any property received) over the U.S. Holder’s \nadjusted tax basis in the common shares sold or exchanged. The amount of loss recognized will equal the \nexcess of the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares sold or exchanged over the amount \nrealized. Such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if, on the date of sale, \nexchange or other disposition, the common shares were held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year. Net \nlong-term capital gain derived by a non-corporate U.S. Holder with respect to capital assets is currently \nsubject to tax at reduced rates. The deductibility of a capital loss is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss \nrecognized from the sale, exchange or other disposition of common shares will generally be gain or loss from \nsources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes, except as otherwise provided in an \napplicable income tax treaty and if an election is properly made under the Code. \nPassive Foreign Investment Company Considerations \nGeneral Rule. In general, a corporation organized outside the United States will be treated as a PFIC in any \ntaxable year in which either (1) at least 75% of its gross income is “passive income” or (2) at least 50% of \nthe average value of its assets is attributable to assets that produce passive income or are held for the \nproduction of passive income. Passive income for this purpose generally includes, among other things, \ndividends, interest, royalties, rents, and gains from commodities transactions and from the sale or exchange \nof property that gives rise to passive income. Assets that produce or are held for the production of passive \nincome include cash, even if held as working capital or raised in a public offering, marketable securities and \nother assets that may produce passive income. The percentage of a corporation’s assets that produce or are \nheld for the production of passive income generally is determined based upon the average ratio of passive \nassets to total assets calculated at the end of each measuring period. Calculation of the value of assets at the \nend of each measuring period is generally made at the end of each of the four quarters that make up the \ncompany’s taxable year, unless an election is made to use an alternative measuring period (such as a week or \nmonth). The “weighted average” of those periodic values is then used to determine the value of assets for the \npassive asset test for the taxable year. In proposed regulations section 1.1297-1(d)(2), a limited exception to \nthe passive asset test valuation rules is provided for the treatment of working capital in order to take into \naccount the short-term cash needs of operating companies. This working capital rule provides that an amount \nof cash held in a non-interest bearing account that is held for the present needs of an active trade or business \nand is no greater than the amount reasonably expected to cover 90 days of operating expenses incurred in the \nordinary course of the trade or business of the foreign corporation (for example, accounts payable for \nordinary operating expenses or employee compensation) is not treated as a passive asset. The Treasury \nDepartment and the IRS indicated that they continue to study the appropriate treatment of working capital for \npurposes of the passive asset test. In determining whether a foreign corporation is a PFIC, a proportionate \nshare of the items of gross income and assets of each corporation in which it owns, directly or indirectly, at \nleast a 25% interest (by value) are taken into account. \nPFIC Status Determination. Although the tests for determining PFIC status for any taxable year are \ndependent upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the value of our assets, \nthe market price of our common shares, and the amount and type of our gross income, based on those tests: \n(i) we believe that we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2016, and (ii) we do not believe \nthat we were a PFIC for any of the taxable years ended December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2021, and \n(iii) we believe that we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2022. Our status as a PFIC is a \nfact-intensive determination made on an annual basis, and we cannot provide any assurance regarding our \nPFIC status for the taxable year ending December 31, 2023 or for subsequent taxable years.

No opinion of legal counsel or ruling \nfrom the IRS concerning our status as a PFIC has been obtained or is currently planned to be requested. \nHowever, the determination of our PFIC status is made annually after the close of each taxable year and it is \ndifficult to predict before such determination whether we will be a PFIC for any given taxable year. Even if \nwe determine that we are not a PFIC after the close of a taxable year, there can be no assurance that the IRS \nwill agree with our conclusion. No assurance can be provided regarding our PFIC status, and neither we nor \nour United States counsel expresses any opinion with respect to our PFIC status. \nPFIC Consequences. If we are a PFIC at any time when a non-corporate U.S. Holder owns common shares, \nand such U.S. Holder does not make a “qualified electing fund” election (QEF election) or a “mark-to-\nmarket” election, both as described below, such U.S. Holder will generally be subject to federal tax under the \nexcess distribution rules (described below). Under such rules, additional taxes and interest charges would \napply to certain distributions by us or to gain upon dispositions of our common shares. If neither of such \nelections are made, the excess distribution rules apply to (1) distributions paid during a taxable year that are \ngreater than 125% of the average annual distributions paid in the three preceding taxable years, or, if shorter, \nthe U.S. Holder’s holding period for the common shares, and (2) any gain recognized on a sale, exchange or \nother disposition (which would include a pledge or transfer by gift or death) of common shares. Under the \nexcess distribution rules, the non-corporate U.S. Holder’s tax liability will be determined by allocating such \ndistribution or gain ratably to each day in the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the common shares. The \namount allocated to the current taxable year (i.e., the year in which the distribution occurs or the gain is \nrecognized) and any year prior to the first taxable year in which we were a PFIC during such holding period \nwill be taxed as ordinary income earned in the current taxable year and the preferential tax rate applicable to \ncapital gains or dividends received on our common shares would not be available. The amount allocated to \nother taxable years (i.e., prior years in which we were a PFIC) will be taxed at the highest marginal rate in \neffect (for individuals or corporations as applicable) for ordinary income in each such taxable year, and an \ninterest charge, generally applicable to the underpayment of tax, will be added to the tax and the preferential \ntax rate applicable to capital gains or dividends received on our common shares would not be available. \nThese adverse tax consequences would not apply to a pension or profit-sharing trust or other tax-exempt \norganization that did not borrow funds or otherwise utilize leverage in connection with its acquisition of our \ncommon shares. In addition, if a non-electing U.S. Holder who is an individual dies while owning our \ncommon shares, such U.S. Holder's successor generally would not receive a step-up in tax basis with respect \nto such common shares, but instead would have a tax basis equal to the lower of the fair market value of such \ncommon shares or the decedent’s tax basis in such common shares. Newly proposed regulations, that are not \nyet effective, address domestic partnerships and S corporations that own stock in a PFIC for which a QEF \nelection or \"mark-to-market\" election could be made. Currently, only the domestic partnership or S \ncorporation (and not the partners or S corporation shareholders) can make these elections. The proposed \nregulations would reverse the current rule so that only the partners or S corporation shareholders — not the \npartnership or S corporation — could make the elections. These proposed regulations would only apply to \npartnership or S corporation shareholders' tax years beginning on or after the date they are issued in final \nform. \nQEF Election. The tax considerations that would apply if we were a PFIC would be different from those \ndescribed above if a U.S. Holder were able to make a valid QEF election. For each year that we meet the \nPFIC gross income test or asset test, an electing U.S. Holder would be required to include in gross income its \npro rata share of our ordinary income and net capital gains, if any, as determined under U.S. federal income \ntax principles. The U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in our common shares would be increased by the amount \nof such inclusions. An actual distribution to the U.S. Holder out of such income generally would not be \ntreated as a dividend and would decrease the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in our common shares. Gain \nrealized from the sale of our common shares covered by a QEF election would be taxed as a capital gain and \nthe denial of the basis step-up at death described above would not apply. Generally, a QEF election must be"

A separate QEF election would need to be made for any of our subsidiaries that are classified as \na PFIC. A QEF election is made on IRS Form 8621. U.S. Holders will be eligible to make QEF elections \nonly if we agree to provide U.S. Holders with the information they will need to comply with the QEF rules. \nIn the event we become a PFIC, we intend to provide all information and documentation that a U.S. Holder \nmaking a QEF election is required to obtain for U.S. federal income tax purposes (e.g., the U.S. Holder’s pro \nrata share of ordinary income and net capital gain, and a “PFIC Annual Information Statement” as described \nin applicable U.S. Treasury regulations). \nMark-to-Market Election. As an alternative to a QEF election, a U.S. Holder may also mitigate the adverse \ntax consequences of PFIC status by timely making a “mark-to-market” election, provided the U.S. Holder \ncompletes and files IRS Form 8621 in accordance with the relevant instructions and related Treasury \nregulations. A U.S. Holder who makes the mark-to-market election generally must include as ordinary \nincome each year the increase in the fair market value of the common shares and deduct from gross income \nthe decrease in the value of such shares during each of its taxable years, but with losses limited to the amount \nof previously recognized net gains. The U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the common shares would be adjusted to \nreflect any income or loss recognized as a result of the mark-to-market election. If a mark-to-market election \nwith respect to our common shares is in effect on the date of a U.S. Holder’s death, the tax basis of the \ncommon shares in the hands of a U.S. Holder who acquired them from a decedent will be the lesser of the \ndecedent’s tax basis or the fair market value of the common shares. Any gain from a sale, exchange or other \ndisposition of the common shares in any taxable year in which we are a PFIC (i.e., when we meet the gross \nincome test or asset test described above) would be treated as ordinary income and any loss from a sale, \nexchange or other disposition would be treated first as an ordinary loss (to the extent of any net mark-to-\nmarket gains previously included in income) and thereafter as a capital loss. If we cease to be a PFIC, any \ngain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or exchange of the common shares would be classified \nas a capital gain or loss. \nA mark-to-market election is available to a U.S. Holder only for “marketable stock.” Generally, stock will be \nconsidered marketable stock if it is “regularly traded” on a “qualified exchange” within the meaning of \napplicable U.S. Treasury regulations. A class of stock is regularly traded during any calendar year during \nwhich such class of stock is traded, other than in de minimis quantities, on at least 15 days during each \ncalendar quarter. The common shares should be marketable stock as long as they are listed on The Nasdaq \nCapital Market and are regularly traded. A mark-to-market election will not apply to the common shares for \nany taxable year during which we are not a PFIC but will remain in effect with respect to any subsequent \ntaxable year in which we again become a PFIC. Such election will not apply to any subsidiary that we own. \nAccordingly, a U.S. Holder may continue to be subject to the PFIC rules with respect to any lower-tier PFICs \nnotwithstanding the U.S. Holder’s mark-to-market election. Whether our common shares are regularly traded \non a qualified exchange is an annual determination based on facts that, in part, are beyond our control. \nAccordingly, a U.S. Holder might not be eligible to make a mark-to-market election to mitigate the adverse \ntax consequences if we are characterized as a PFIC. \nElection Tax Risks. Certain economic risks are inherent in making either a QEF Election or a mark-to-market \nelection. If a QEF Election is made, it is possible that earned income will be reported to a U.S. shareholder as \ntaxable income and income taxes will be due and payable on such an amount. A U.S. shareholder of our \ncommon shares may pay tax on such “phantom” income, i.e., where income is reported to it pursuant to the \nQEF Election, but no cash is distributed with respect to such income. There is no assurance that any \ndistribution or profitable sale will ever be made regarding our common shares, so the tax liability may result \nin a net economic loss. A mark-to-market election may result in significant share price gains in one year \ncausing a significant income tax liability. This gain may be offset in another year by significant losses. If a \nmark-to-market election is made, this highly variable tax gain or loss may result in substantial and"

However, if we cease to meet these tests, a U.S. Holder can avoid the continuing \nimpact of the PFIC rules by making a special election (a Purging Election) to recognize gain by making a \n“deemed sale” election with respect to all of the U.S. Holder’s common shares and have such common shares \ndeemed to be sold at their fair market value on the last day of the last taxable year during which we were a \nPFIC.

In addition, for a U.S. Holder \nmaking such an election, a new holding period would be deemed to begin for our common shares for \npurposes of the PFIC rules. After the Purging Election, the common shares with respect to which the Purging \nElection was made will not be treated as shares in a PFIC unless we subsequently again become a PFIC. \nEach U.S. person who is a shareholder of a PFIC generally must file an annual report (on IRS Form 8621) \nwith the IRS containing certain information, and the failure to file such report could result in the imposition \nof penalties on such U.S. person and in the extension of the statute of limitations with respect to federal \nincome tax returns filed by such U.S. person. Should we be classified as a PFIC during a U.S. Holder’s \nholding period for our common shares, each such U.S. Holder should consult their own tax advisors with \nrespect to the possibility of making these elections and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the \nacquisition, ownership and disposition of our common shares. In addition, the possibility of us being \nclassified as a PFIC may deter certain U.S. investors from purchasing our common shares, which could have \nan adverse impact on the market price of our common shares and our ability to raise additional financing by \nselling equity securities, including our common shares. \nThe U.S. federal income tax rules relating to PFICs are very complex. U.S. Holders are urged to consult \ntheir own tax advisors with respect to the purchase, ownership and disposition of common shares, the \nconsequences to them of an investment in a PFIC, any elections available with respect to the common shares \nand the IRS information reporting obligations with respect to the purchase, ownership and disposition of \ncommon shares in the event we are considered a PFIC. \nAdditional Tax on Passive Income \nCertain U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts (other than trusts that are exempt from tax) with \nadjusted income exceeding certain thresholds, will be subject to a 3.8% tax on all or a portion of their “net \ninvestment income,” which includes dividends on the common shares, and net gains from the disposition of \nthe common shares. Further, excess distributions treated as dividends, gains treated as excess distributions, \nand mark-to-market inclusions and deductions are all included in the calculation of net investment income. \nTreasury regulations provide, subject to the election described in the following paragraph, that solely for \npurposes of this additional tax, that distributions of previously taxed income will be treated as dividends and \nincluded in net investment income subject to the additional 3.8% tax. Additionally, to determine the amount \nof any capital gain from the sale or other taxable disposition of common shares that will be subject to the \nadditional tax on net investment income, a U.S. Holder who has made a QEF election will be required to \nrecalculate its basis in the common shares excluding any QEF election basis adjustments."

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve \nnumerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking \nstatements as a result of these risks and uncertainties. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking \nStatements” for additional cautionary information. \nBusiness Overview \nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of people suffering \nfrom serious diseases. DiaMedica’s lead candidate DM199 is the first pharmaceutically active recombinant \n(synthetic) form of the human tissue kallikrein-1 (KLK1) protein to be studied in patients. KLK1 is an \nestablished therapeutic modality in Asia for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke and chronic kidney \ndisease, including hypertensive nephrosclerosis (hypertension). We have also identified a potential novel \ntreatment for inflammatory diseases, DM300, which is currently early in the preclinical stage of \ndevelopment. Our long-term goal is to use our patented and in-licensed technologies to establish our \nCompany as a leader in the development and commercialization of therapeutic treatments from novel \nrecombinant proteins. Our current focus is on the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and chronic \nkidney disease (CKD). We plan to advance DM199, our lead drug candidate, through required clinical trials \nto create shareholder value by establishing its clinical and commercial potential as a therapy for AIS and \nCKD. \nDM199 is a recombinant form of human tissue kallikrein-1 (KLK1). KLK1 is a serine protease (protein) \nproduced primarily in the kidneys, pancreas and salivary glands, which plays a critical role in the regulation \nof local blood flow and vasodilation (the widening of blood vessels which decreases vascular resistance) in \nthe body, as well as an important role in inflammation and oxidative stress (an imbalance between potentially \ndamaging reactive oxygen species, or free radicals, and antioxidants in your body). We believe DM199 has \nthe potential to treat a variety of diseases where healthy functioning requires sufficient activity of KLK1 and \nits system, the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS). \nOur product development pipeline is as follows:"

      "text": "82 \nAIS Phase 2/3 ReMEDy2 Trial \nOur ReMEDy2 trial is an adaptive design, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial intended \nto enroll approximately 350 participants at up to 75 sites in the United States. Participants enrolled in \nthe trial will be treated with either DM199 or placebo within 24 hours of the onset of AIS symptoms. \nThe trial excludes patients with large vessel occlusions and imaging evidence of brain damage and those \ntreated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or any other thrombolytic. The study population is \nrepresentative of the approximately 80% of AIS patients who do not have treatment options today, \nprimarily due to the limitations on treatment with mechanical thrombectomy or tPA, which must be \ndosed within 4.5 hours from symptom onset. DiaMedica believes that the proposed trial has the potential \nto serve as a pivotal registration study of DM199 in this patient population. \nIn April 2021, we submitted an investigational new drug application (IND) to the FDA for the trial, \nwhich was accepted in May 2021. In September 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to the \nCompany’s lead candidate DM199 for the treatment of AIS where tPA and/or mechanical thrombectomy \nare not indicated or medically appropriate. We initiated the first site in September and successfully \ndosed the first participant in November 2021.  \nOn July 6, 2022, we announced that the FDA placed a clinical hold on the IND for our Phase 2/3 ReMEDy2 \ntrial. The clinical hold was issued following the Company voluntarily pausing participant enrollment in the \ntrial to investigate three unexpected instances of clinically significant hypotension (low blood pressure) \noccurring shortly after initiation of the intravenous (IV) dose of DM199. The acutely low blood pressure \nlevels in the three participants recovered back to their baseline blood pressure within minutes after the IV \ninfusion was stopped, and the participants suffered no injuries. In response to the FDA’s clinical hold letter, \non September 16, 2022, we submitted to the FDA supporting in-vitro data that the cause of the hypotensive \nevents was likely related to switching to a new type of IV bag for use in the ReMEDy2 trial rather than \ncontinue with the type of IV bag used in the prior ReMEDy 1 trial, where DM199 was generally safe and \nwell tolerated and no hypotensive episodes were reported. While there were no differences in the \ncompatibility of DM199 with either type of IV bag, we observed significant differences in DM199 binding \nbetween the two types of IV bags used in the studies that we believe altered, and unintentionally elevated, the \ntotal amount of DM199 being administered to participants in the ReMEDy2 trial and thereby triggering the \nhypotensive events. In addition to our analysis of the events leading to and causing the hypotensive events, \nwe also included in this FDA submission, proposed protocol modifications to address the mitigation of these \nevents, including a reduction in the DM199 dose level for the initial IV dose to effectively match the well \ntolerated IV dose administered in the ReMEDy1 trial. Following review of this data, the FDA responded to \nour submission, indicating that the FDA was continuing the clinical hold and requesting, among other items, \nan additional in-use in vitro stability study of the IV administration of DM199, which includes testing the \ncombination of the IV bag, IV tubing and mechanical infusion pump, to further rule out any other cause of \nthe hypotension events. In December 2022, we received written comments from the FDA clarifying its \nexpectations for the design of the in-use study. These comments were incorporated into the study protocol \nand submitted to the FDA. In response the FDA recently indicated that the protocol appeared to be \nreasonable. The requested in-use study has been initiated and is being performed at an independent \nlaboratory. The study is being conducted in two parts. Part 1 simulates actual use in the hospital and part 2 \ntests worst-case scenarios such as varying storage durations, temperature(s) and light. Part 1 is complete. We \nbelieve data from part 1 confirms our conclusions from prior testing that the IV dose administered in the \nReMEDy2 study was higher than planned due to the change in IV bag materials and was the cause of the \nhypotension, and that a dose revision in ReMEDy2 should avoid the clinically significant hypotension. We \nhave submitted these results and conclusions to the FDA for feedback and to request confirmation that all"

The purpose of the study is to confirm, with \nhuman data, the DM199 serum concentration level achieved with the IV dose and further evaluate safety and \ntolerability. In the event that the FDA does not agree that the results of the in-use study support the proposed \ndose revision, the data from this Phase 1C study can be used to support the rationale for the IV dose selected \nfor the ReMEDy2 trial.  The Phase 1C study is being conducted in Australia and is intended to enroll up to \n15 healthy, adult participants. Enrollment in the study has commenced and preliminary data is expected to be \navailable in May 2023. \nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to fully respond to the FDA’s latest questions sufficiently for \nthe FDA to lift the clinical hold on a timely basis or at all. It is also possible that the FDA may subsequently \nmake additional requests that we would need to fulfill prior to the lifting of the clinical hold, such as \nrequiring us to complete additional clinical testing or imposing stricter approval conditions than we recently \nproposed for our DM199 product candidate. We may not enroll any additional participants in the ReMEDy2 \ntrial until we provide the FDA with the requested data and the FDA notifies us that the FDA has lifted the \nclinical hold and we may resume enrollment in the clinical trial. \nPrior to voluntarily halting enrollment, we had experienced slower than expected site activations and \nenrollment in our ReMEDy2 trial and may continue to experience these conditions if and when we are able \nto resume enrollment. We believe this was due to a number of factors, including the reduction or suspension \nof research activities at our current and targeted clinical study sites, as well as staffing shortages, due to \nCOVID-19 and concerns managing logistics and protocol compliance for participants discharged from the \nhospital to an intermediate care facility. We intend to continue to take certain actions, including bringing \ncertain site engagement responsibilities in-house and engaging a clinical services consulting firm to provide \nstaff support to study sites as needed, to assist study sites in overcoming these issues, if and when we resume \nenrollment in the ReMEDy2 trial, however no assurances can be provided as to if and when these issues will \nresolve. \nCKD Phase 2 REDUX Clinical Trial \nAs of December 31, 2021, we completed enrollment in REDUX with a total 84 subjects enrolled, including \n24 African American subjects into Cohort 1, 25 subjects with IgAN into Cohort 2 and 35 subjects with Type \n2 diabetes in Cohort 3. As of March 31, 2022, all participants had completed their treatment periods. We are \ncurrently evaluating next steps for our CKD program as we proceed with analyzing the complete data set \nfrom the REDUX trial. \nDM300 \nWe have identified a potential novel new treatment for inflammatory diseases, DM300, currently early in the \npreclinical stage of development. \nFinancial Overview \nWe have not generated any revenues from product sales. Since our inception, we have financed our \noperations from public and private sales of equity, the exercise of warrants and stock options, interest income \non funds available for investment and government grants and tax credits. We have incurred losses in each \nyear since our inception. Our net losses were $13.7 million and $13.6 million for the years ended December \n31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $96.2 million."

In the near term, inclusive of the estimated costs of the Phase 1C study, we anticipate that our \nquarterly expenses will remain relatively consistent with recent prior periods until the FDA lifts the clinical \nhold on the IND for our ReMEDy2 trial. Once we are able to resume the ReMEDy2 trial, we expect our \nexpenses and operating losses to increase as compared to prior periods. Our efforts to expand our team to \nprovide support for our operations and maintaining, expanding and protecting our intellectual property \nportfolio will also likely contribute to such increases. \nWhile we expect our rate of future negative cash flow per month will vary due to the timing of site \nactivations and patient enrollment expenses, we expect our current cash resources will be sufficient to allow \nus to continue to work with the FDA to lift the clinical hold and continue our Phase 2/3 ReMEDy2 trial in \npatients with AIS, complete the data analysis from our REDUX Phase 2 trial and evaluate next steps for our \nCKD program and otherwise fund our planned operations for at least the next 12 months from the date of \nissuance of the consolidated financial statements included in this report. However, the amount and timing of \nfuture funding requirements will depend on many factors, including our ability and timing to release the \nclinical hold on the IND for our ReMEDy2 trial, the timing and results of our ongoing development efforts, \nincluding site activations and enrollment in our clinical studies, the potential expansion of our current \ndevelopment programs, potential new development programs, related G&A support and the effects of \nCOVID-19. We may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect and there is no \nassurance that we will not need or seek additional funding prior to such time. We may elect to raise \nadditional funds even before we need them if market conditions for raising additional capital are favorable. \nComponents of Our Results of Operations \nResearch and Development Expenses \nWe incurred R&D expenses of $7.8 million and $8.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and \n2021, respectively. R&D expenses consist primarily of fees paid to external service providers such as \ncontract research organizations (CROs); contractual obligations for clinical development including clinical \nsite costs, outside nursing services, laboratory testing, preclinical trials; fees paid to our contract \nmanufacturers and outside laboratories for development of DM199 and related manufacturing processes; \ncosts for production runs of DM199; salaries, benefits and share-based compensation and other personnel \ncosts. Over the past approximately ten years, our R&D efforts have been primarily focused on developing \nDM199. At this time, due to the risks inherent in the clinical development process and the clinical stage of \nour product development programs, we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in \ndeveloping DM199 through marketing approval or any of our preclinical development programs. The \nprocess of conducting clinical studies necessary to obtain regulatory approval and manufacturing scale-up to \nsupport expanded development and potential future commercialization is costly and time consuming. Any \nfailure by us or delay in completing clinical studies, manufacturing scale-up or in obtaining regulatory \napprovals could lead to increased R&D expenses and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our results of \noperations. \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses \nWe incurred G&A expenses of $6.2 million and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and \n2021, respectively. G&A expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including share-based \ncompensation related to our executive, finance, business development and support functions. G&A expenses"

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make \nestimates and assumptions for the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related \ndisclosures. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe \nare reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the \ncarrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may \ndiffer from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be \nmaterial. \nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial \nstatements included elsewhere in this report, we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical \naccounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and \nresults of operations and require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. \nResearch and Development Costs \nR&D costs include expenses incurred in the conduct of human clinical trials such as fees paid to external \nservice providers such as contract research organizations; contractual obligations for clinical development \nincluding clinical sites; outside nursing services and laboratory testing and non-clinical research studies. \nR&D costs also include fees paid to contract manufacturing organizations and outside laboratories for the \ndevelopment of the manufacturing process necessary to produce, and to produce sufficient amounts of the \nDM199 compound for use in our clinical studies; consulting resources with specialized expertise related to \nexecution of our development plan for our DM199 product candidate; and personnel costs, including salaries, \nbenefits and share-based compensation. \nWe charge R&D costs, including clinical trial costs, to expense when incurred. Our human clinical trials are \nperformed at clinical trial sites and are generally administered by us with assistance from CROs, and include \noutside service providers such as outside nursing services, testing laboratories and data coordination and \ncollection. Costs of setting up clinical trial sites are accrued upon execution of the trial agreement. Expenses \nrelated to the performance of clinical trials are accrued based on contracted amounts and the achievement of \nagreed upon milestones, such as participant enrollment, participant follow-up, etc. We monitor levels of \nperformance under each significant contract, including the extent of participant enrollment and other \nactivities through communications with the clinical trial sites, CROs and supporting vendors and adjust the \nestimates, if required, on a quarterly basis so that clinical expenses reflect the actual work performed at each \nclinical trial site and by each CRO or supporting vendor."

      "text": "86 \nClinical Trial Costs  \nOur clinical trials are performed at clinical trial sites and are administered by us with assistance from CROs \nor outside contractors as necessary. Clinical trial costs are recorded or accrued based on actual invoices \nreceived and estimates of work completed to date by CROs, outside contractors and clinical trial sites that \nmanage and perform the trials. We obtain initial estimates of accrued costs based on the trial protocol and \nactual enrollment of subjects, trial duration, project and data management costs, participant treatment costs \nand other activities as required by the trial protocol. Additionally, non-participant related costs may be \ncharged to us and are recognized as the tasks are completed by the clinical trial site. Accrued clinical trial \ncosts may be subject to revisions as clinical trials progress and any revisions are recorded in the period in \nwhich the facts that give rise to the revisions become known. \nShare-based Compensation \nWe account for all share-based compensation awards using a fair value method. The cost of employee and \nnon-employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments is measured and recognized \nbased on the estimated grant date fair value of those awards. Compensation cost is recognized ratably using \nthe straight-line attribution method over the vesting period, which is considered to be the requisite service \nperiod. We record forfeitures in the periods in which they occur. \nThe fair value of share-based awards is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The \ndetermination of the fair value of share-based awards is affected by our common share price, as well as \nassumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. Risk-free interest rates are based upon \nUnited States Government bond rates appropriate for the expected term of each award. Expected volatility \nrates are based on the historical volatility equal to the expected term of the option. The assumed dividend \nyield is zero, as we do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future. The expected term of \noptions is estimated considering the vesting period at the grant date, the life of the option and the average \nlength of time similar grants have remained outstanding in the past. \nThe assumptions used in calculating the fair value under the Black-Scholes option valuation model are set \nforth in the following table for options issued by us for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n \n2022 \n \n2021 \nCommon share fair value \n$1.47 – $3.88 \n \n$3.64 – $10.04 \nRisk-free interest rate \n1.4 – 3.6% \n \n0.5 – 1.3% \nExpected dividend yield \n0% \n \n0% \nExpected option life (in years) \n5.0 – 5.6 \n \n5.0 – 5.5 \nExpected stock price volatility \n102.1 – 104.0% \n \n94.7 – 106.1% \nResults of Operations \nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 \nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 \n(in thousands): \n \nYear Ended December 31, \n \n2022 \n \n2021 \nResearch and development expense \n$ \n7,839 \n$ \n8,765 \nGeneral and administrative expense \n \n6,162  \n \n4,881 \nOther income, net \n \n(353) \n \n(82)"

This increase was primarily driven by increased directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, \nincreased personnel and professional services costs to support our expanding clinical programs and increased \nlegal fees for our lawsuit against PRA. These increases were partially offset by reduced non-cash, share-\nbased compensation costs. We did not incur significant additional G&A expenses during the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022 related to the COVID-19 pandemic, nor do we expect to incur significant additional \nG&A expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic going forward. We expect that we will continue to see \nmoderate increases in G&A expenses as compared to prior periods as we expand our development and \noperating activities, continue our lawsuit against PRA and the anticipated effects of economic inflation, \nparticularly in the United States. \nOther Income, Net \nOther income, net, was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $0.1 million for \n2021. This increase was driven by increased interest income recognized during 2022 as compared to 2021, \nprimarily related to higher interest rates during 2022 versus 2021. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nThe following tables summarize our liquidity and capital resources as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and \ncash flows for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and are intended to supplement the \nmore detailed discussion that follows (in thousands): \nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nDecember 31, \n2022 \n \nDecember 31, \n2021 \nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities  \n$ \n33,502 \n $ \n45,112 \nTotal assets \n \n34,395 \n \n45,551 \nTotal current liabilities \n \n 2,168 \n \n1,524 \nTotal shareholders’ equity \n \n31,827 \n \n44,024 \nWorking capital \n \n 31,667 \n \n43,915"

The decreases in our combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities \nand in our working capital were due to cash used in operating activities during 2022. \nCash Flows \nOperating Activities \nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $11.5 million, down \n$0.8 million from $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease relates primarily to the \neffects of changes in operating assets and liabilities during 2022. \nInvesting Activities \nInvesting activities consist primarily of the net purchases of marketable securities. Net cash provided by \ninvesting activities was $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net cash used in \ninvesting activities of $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This change resulted from the \ninvestment of the net proceeds received in the September 2021 private placement in the prior year period \ncoupled with an increase in the maturities of marketable securities during 2022. \nFinancing Activities \nNet cash used in financing activities was $6,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and consisted of \nprincipal payments on finance lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities was $30.1 million \nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 and consisted primarily of net proceeds received from the September \n2021 private placement. \nCapital Requirements \nSince our inception, we have incurred losses while advancing the R&D of our DM199 product candidate. We \nhave not generated any revenues from product sales and do not expect to do so for at least three to five years. \nWe do not know when or if, we will generate any revenues from product sales or out-licensing of our \nDM199 product candidate or any future product candidate. We do not expect to generate any revenue from \nproduct sales unless and until we obtain regulatory approval. We expect to continue to incur substantial \noperating losses until such time as any future product sales, licensing fees, milestone payments and/or royalty \npayments are sufficient to generate revenues to fund our continuing operations. Provided that the FDA lifts \nthe clinical hold on the IND for our ReMEDy2 clinical trial we expect our operating losses to increase as \ncompared to prior periods as we continue the research, development and clinical studies of, and seek \nregulatory approval for, our DM199 product candidate.

Although we are striving to achieve \nthese plans, there is no assurance these and other strategies will be achieved or that additional funding will be \nobtained on favorable terms or at all. While the rate of our future negative cash flow per month will vary due \nto our clinical activities, particularly considering the effects of the FDA imposed clinical hold, and the timing \nof expenses incurred, we expect our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be \nsufficient to allow us to continue to work with the FDA to lift the clinical hold and continue our Phase 2/3 \nReMEDy2 trial in patients with AIS, complete data analysis in our REDUX Phase 2 trial in patients with \nCKD and otherwise fund our planned operations for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of \nthe consolidated financial statements included in this report. However, the amount and timing of future \nfunding requirements will depend on many factors, including our ability and timing to release the clinical \nhold on the IND for our ReMEDy2 trial, the timing and results of our ongoing development efforts, including \nthe initiation of new sites and enrollment in our clinical studies, the potential expansion of current \ndevelopment programs, potential new development programs, the effects of COVID-19 on our clinical \nprograms and operations, and related G&A support. We may require significant additional funds earlier than \nwe currently expect and there is no assurance that we will not need or seek additional funding prior to such \ntime, especially if market conditions for raising additional capital are favorable. \nHistorically we have financed our operations primarily from sales of equity securities and the exercise of \nwarrants and stock options, and we expect to continue this practice for the foreseeable future. Our most \nrecent equity financing was our September 2021 private placement in which we issued and sold an aggregate \nof 7,653,060 common shares at a purchase price of $3.92 per share to 10 accredited investors, resulting in \ngross proceeds of $30.0 million and net proceeds to us of $29.8 million, after deducting offering expenses. \nWe do not have any existing credit facilities under which we could borrow funds. We may seek to raise \nadditional funds through various sources, such as equity or debt financings, or through strategic \ncollaborations and license agreements. We can give no assurances that we will be able to secure additional \nsources of funds to support our operations, or if such funds are available to us, that such additional financing \nwill be sufficient to meet our needs or on terms acceptable to us. This is particularly true if our clinical data \nis not positive or economic and market conditions deteriorate. \nTo the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the \nownership interests of our shareholders will be diluted. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements \nthat include conversion discounts or covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such \nas incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds \nthrough government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements or other \ncollaborations, or strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish \nvaluable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant \nlicenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. The availability of financing will be affected by our \nclinical data and other results of scientific and clinical research; the ability to attain regulatory approvals; \nmarket acceptance of our product candidates; the state of the capital markets generally with particular \nreference to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical companies; the status of strategic alliance \nagreements; and other relevant commercial considerations. \nIf adequate funding is not available when needed, we may be required to scale back our operations by taking \nactions that may include, among other things, implementing cost reduction strategies, such as reducing use of"

These obligations may relate to preclinical or clinical studies, manufacturing or manufacturing process \ndevelopment and other related activities. Currently, these obligations include costs to be incurred with \ncontract research organizations, central laboratory and pharmacy services, clinical study sites, home nursing \nservices, various other vendors supporting the performance of our clinical trials and contract manufacturing \norganizations. The contracts we enter into with these vendors and the commitments within these contracts are \nsubject to significant variability based upon the actual activities/services performed by each vendor. As a \nresult, the ultimate amounts due may be materially different as these obligations are affected by, among other \nfactors, the number and pace of participants enrolled, the number of clinical study sites enrolling subjects, the \namount of time to complete trial enrollments and the time required to finalize, analyze and report of trial \nresults. Clinical research agreements are generally cancelable upon up to 60-90 days’ notice, with the \nCompany’s obligation limited to costs incurred up to that date, including any non-cancelable costs. \nCancelation terms for product manufacturing and process development contracts vary and are generally \ndependent upon timelines for sourcing research materials and reserving laboratory time. As of December 31, \n2022, the Company estimates that its outstanding commitments, including such cancellable contracts, are \napproximately $4.0 million over the next 12 months and approximately $3.0 million in the following 12 \nmonths. These amounts do not include commitments that the Company will be required to make upon \nresumption of the ReMEDy2 AIS trial. \nAs of December 31, 2022, we had future operating lease commitments totaling approximately $459,000 over \nthe remainder of the lease, of which approximately $63,000 is due over the next 12 months. \nWe have entered into a license agreement with Catalent Pharma Solutions, LLC (Catalent) whereby we have \nlicensed certain gene expression technology and we contract with Catalent for the manufacture of DM199. \nUnder the terms of this license, certain milestone and royalty payments may become due under this \nagreement and are dependent upon, among other factors, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and ultimately \nthe successful development of a new drug, the outcome and timing of which is uncertain As of December 31, \n2022, one milestone payment obligation remains which is tied to the first commercial sale. Following the \nlaunch of our first product, we will also incur a royalty of less than 1% on net sales. The royalty term is \nindefinite but the license agreement may be canceled by us on 90 days’ prior written notice. The license may \nnot be terminated by Catalent unless we fail to make required milestone and royalty payments. \nItem 7A.

In our opinion, the \nconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the \nCompany as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years \nthen ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \nBasis for Opinion \nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our \nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our \naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board of \nthe United States of America (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in \naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and \nExchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we \nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial \nstatements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to \nhave, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our \naudits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the \npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial \nreporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated \nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. \nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the \nconsolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and \nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated \nfinancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n/s/ Baker Tilly US, LLP \nWe have served as the Company’s auditors since 2018. \nMinneapolis, MN \nMarch 28, 2023"

The \nCompany has not yet completed the development of any product candidate and does not generate any \nrevenues from the commercial sale of any product candidate. DM199 requires significant additional clinical \ntesting and investment prior to seeking marketing approval and is not expected to be commercially available \nfor at least three years, if at all. \nOn July 6, 2022, we announced that the FDA placed a clinical hold on the investigational new drug \napplication (IND) for the Company’s Phase 2/3 ReMEDy2 trial. The clinical hold was issued following the \nCompany voluntarily pausing participant enrollment in the trial to investigate three unexpected instances of \nclinically significant hypotension (low blood pressure) occurring shortly after initiation of the intravenous \n(IV) dose of DM199.  In September 2022 we submitted our analysis of the events leading to and causing the \nhypotensive events, and proposed protocol modifications to address the mitigation of these events in the \nfuture trial participants. Following review of this analysis, the FDA informed us that they were continuing \nthe clinical hold and requesting, among other items, an additional in-use in vitro stability study of the IV \nadministration of DM199, which includes testing the combination of the IV bag, IV tubing and mechanical \ninfusion pump, to further rule out any other cause of the hypotension events.  The requested in-use study has \nbeen initiated and is being performed at an independent laboratory and is expected to complete in April 2023.  \nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to fully respond to the FDA’s latest questions sufficiently for \nthe FDA to lift the clinical hold on a timely basis or at all. It is also possible that the FDA may subsequently \nmake additional requests that we would need to fulfill prior to the lifting of the clinical hold, such as \nrequiring us to complete additional clinical testing or imposing stricter approval conditions than we recently \nproposed for our DM199 product candidate. We may not enroll any additional participants in the ReMEDy2 \ntrial until we provide the FDA with the requested data and the FDA notifies us that the FDA has lifted the \nclinical hold and we may resume enrollment in the clinical trial. \nPrior to voluntarily halting enrollment, we had experienced slower than expected site activations and \nenrollment in our ReMEDy2 trial and may continue to experience these conditions if and when we are able \nto resume enrollment. We believe this was due to a number of factors, including the reduction or suspension \nof research activities at our current and targeted clinical study sites, as well as staffing shortages, due to \nCOVID-19 and concerns managing logistics and protocol compliance for participants discharged from the \nhospital to an intermediate care facility. We intend to continue to take certain actions, including bringing \ncertain site engagement responsibilities in-house and engaging a clinical services consulting firm to provide"

For the year \nended December 31, 2022, we incurred a net loss of $13.7 million and negative cash flows from operating \nactivities of $11.5 million. We expect to continue to incur operating losses until such time as any future \nproduct sales, licensing fees, milestone payments and/or royalty payments generate revenue sufficient to fund \nour continuing operations. For the foreseeable future, we expect to incur significant operating losses as we \ncontinue the development and clinical study of, and to seek regulatory approval for, our DM199 product \ncandidate. As of December 31, 2022, DiaMedica had combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable \nsecurities of $33.5 million, working capital of $31.7 million and shareholders’ equity of $31.8 million.  \nOur principal source of cash has been net proceeds from the issuance of equity securities. Although the \nCompany has previously been successful in obtaining financing through equity securities offerings, there is \nno assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. This is particularly true if we are unable to resolve \nthe clinical hold on the IND for our ReMEDy2 trial, if our clinical data is not positive, or if economic and \nmarket conditions do not improve or further deteriorate.  \nWe expect that we will need substantial additional capital to further our research and development activities, \ncomplete the required clinical studies, regulatory activities and manufacturing development for our product \ncandidate, DM199, or any future product candidates, to a point where they may be licensed or commercially \nsold. We expect our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to fund our planned operations \nfor at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements. The \namount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including our ability and \ntiming to release the clinical hold on the IND for our ReMEDy2 trial, the timing and results of our ongoing \ndevelopment efforts, including the duration of the current clinical hold, the rate of site activation and \nenrollment in our clinical study, the potential expansion of our current development programs, potential new \ndevelopment programs, the effects of COVID-19, staffing shortages and other factors on our clinical trials \nand our operating expenses. We may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect and \nthere is no assurance that we will not need or seek additional funding prior to such time, especially if market \nconditions for raising capital are favorable. \n3. \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies  \nBasis of consolidation \nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and expenses of \nDiaMedica Therapeutics Inc., and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, DiaMedica USA, Inc. and DiaMedica \nAustralia Pty Ltd. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in \nconsolidation. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. \nFunctional currency \nThe United States dollar is our functional currency as it represents the economic effects of the underlying \ntransactions, events and conditions and various other factors including the currency of historical and future \nexpenditures and the currency in which funds from financing activities are mostly generated by the"

A change in functional currency could result in material differences in the \namounts recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for foreign exchange \ngains and losses. All amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are in U.S. dollars \nunless otherwise indicated. \nUse of estimates \nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally \naccepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect \nthe amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ \nfrom those estimates. \nCash and cash equivalents \nThe Company considers all bank deposits, including money market funds, and other investments, purchased \nwith an original maturity to the Company of three months or less, to be cash and cash equivalents. The \ncarrying amount of our cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short maturity of the investments. \nMarketable securities \nThe Company’s marketable securities typically consist of obligations of the United States government and its \nagencies, bank certificates of deposit and/or investment grade corporate obligations, which are classified as \navailable-for-sale and included in current assets. All marketable securities mature within 12 months from \ntheir date of purchase and generally are intended to fund current operations. Securities are valued based on \nmarket prices for similar assets using third party certified pricing sources. Available-for-sale securities are \ncarried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of shareholders’ equity in \naccumulated other comprehensive gain (loss). The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for \namortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization or accretion is included \nin interest income. Realized gains and losses, if any, are calculated on the specific identification method and \nare included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations. \nAvailable-for-sale securities are reviewed for possible impairment at least quarterly, or more frequently if \ncircumstances arise that may indicate impairment. When the fair value of the securities declines below the \namortized cost basis and impairment is indicated, it must be determined whether the impairment is other than \ntemporary. Impairment is considered to be other than temporary if the Company: (i) intends to sell the \nsecurity, (ii) will more likely than not be forced to sell the security before recovering its cost, or (iii) does not \nexpect to recover the security’s amortized cost basis. If the decline in fair value is considered other than \ntemporary, the cost basis of the security is adjusted to its fair market value and the realized loss is reported in \nearnings. Subsequent increases or decreases in fair value are reported as a component of shareholders’ equity \nin accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss). There were no other-than-temporary unrealized losses as of \nDecember 31, 2022. \nFair value measurements \nUnder the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the \namount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between \nmarket participants as of the measurement date. The authoritative guidance also establishes a hierarchy for \ninputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of \nunobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs \nare inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data"

Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the \nCompany’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability \ndeveloped based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The categorization of financial \nassets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is \nsignificant to the fair value measurement. \nThe hierarchy is broken down into three levels defined as follows: \nLevel 1 Inputs — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities \nLevel 2 Inputs — observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities \nLevel 3 Inputs — unobservable inputs \nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company believes that the carrying amounts of its other financial instruments, \nincluding amounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate their fair value due to \nthe short-term maturities of these instruments. See Note 4, titled “Marketable Securities” for additional \ninformation. \nConcentration of credit risk \nFinancial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of \ncash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The Company maintains its cash balances primarily with \ntwo financial institutions. These balances generally exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not \nexperienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in cash \nand cash equivalents. The Company believes that the credit risk related to marketable securities is limited \ndue to the adherence to an investment policy focused on the preservation of principal. \nLong-lived assets \nProperty and equipment are stated at purchased cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property \nand equipment is computed using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of three to ten \nyears for office equipment and four years for computer equipment. Upon retirement or sale, the cost and \nrelated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheets and the resulting gain or \nloss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as \nincurred. \nLong-lived assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the \ncarrying amount of the asset or related group of assets may not be recoverable. If the expected future \nundiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized at \nthat time. Measurement of impairment may be based upon appraisal, market value of similar assets or \ndiscounted cash flows. \nLeases \nLeases related to our corporate offices are classified as operating leases \nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. We have made a policy election to not separate lease \nand non-lease components for our real estate leases to the extent they are fixed. Non-lease components that \nare not fixed are expensed as incurred as variable lease expense. Our facility lease includes variable non-\nlease components, such as common-area maintenance costs. Our operating lease is included in operating \nlease right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and operating lease obligations on our consolidated balance sheets. Our \noperating lease ROU asset represents our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating \nlease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.

      "text": "101 \nROU asset and operating lease obligation are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over \nthe lease term. The lease does not provide an implicit rate and, due to the lack of a commercially salable \nproduct, we are generally considered unable to obtain commercial credit. Therefore, considering the quoted \nrates for the lowest investment-grade debt and the interest rates implicit in recent financing leases, we \nestimated our incremental borrowing rate. The operating lease ROU asset excludes lease incentives. Our \nlease includes an option to extend or terminate the lease; lease terms are only adjusted for these options when \nit is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options to extend or terminate the lease. Lease expense is \nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \nAssumptions made by us at the commencement date are re-evaluated upon occurrence of certain events, \nincluding a lease modification. A lease modification results in a separate contract when the modification \ngrants the lessee an additional right of use not included in the original lease and when lease payments \nincrease commensurate with the standalone price for the additional right of use. When a lease modification \nresults in a separate contract, it is accounted for in the same manner as a new lease. \nResearch and development costs \nResearch and development costs include expenses incurred in the conduct of human clinical trials, for third-\nparty service providers performing various treatment, testing, data accumulation and analysis related to \nclinical studies; sponsored non-clinical research; developing the manufacturing process necessary to produce \nsufficient amounts of the DM199 compound for use in our clinical studies; consulting resources with \nspecialized expertise related to execution of our development plan for our DM199 or other product \ncandidates; and personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation. \nWe charge research and development costs, including clinical trial costs, to expense when incurred. Our \nhuman clinical trials are performed at clinical trial sites and are administered jointly by us with assistance \nfrom various contract research organizations. Costs of setting up clinical trial sites are accrued upon \nexecution of the study agreement. Expenses related to the performance of clinical trials are recorded or \naccrued based on actual invoices received and estimates of work completed to date by contract research \norganizations, outside contractors and clinical trial sites that assist with management and performance of the \ntrials, and those that manufacture the investigational product. We obtain initial estimates of accrued costs \nbased on the trial protocol, actual enrollment of subjects, trial duration, project and data management costs, \nparticipant treatment costs and other activities as required by the trial protocol. Additionally, actual costs \nmay be charged to us and are recognized as the tasks are completed by the clinical trial site. Accrued clinical \ntrial costs may be subject to revisions as clinical trials progress and any revisions are recorded in the period \nin which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known. \nPatent costs \nCosts associated with applying for, prosecuting and maintaining patents are expensed as incurred given the \nuncertainty of patent approval and, if approved, the resulting probable future economic benefit to the \nCompany. Patent-related costs, consisting primarily of legal expenses and filing/maintenance fees, are \nincluded in general and administrative costs and were $146,000 and $96,000 for the years ended December \n31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \nShare-based compensation \nThe cost of employee and non-employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments is \nmeasured and recognized based on the estimated grant date fair value of those awards. Compensation cost is \nrecognized ratably using the straight-line attribution method over the vesting period, which is considered to \nbe the requisite service period. We record forfeitures in the periods in which they occur."

The determination of the fair value of share-based awards is affected by our share price, as well as \nassumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. Risk free interest rates are based upon \nUnited States Government bond rates appropriate for the expected term of each award. Expected volatility \nrates are based on the historical volatility over a period equal to the expected term of the option. The \nassumed dividend yield is zero, as we do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future. The \nexpected term of options is estimated considering the vesting period at the grant date, the life of the option \nand the average length of time similar grants have remained outstanding in the past. \nIncome taxes \nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are \nrecognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated \nfinancial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and \noperating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted \nrates, for each of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, expected to apply to taxable income in the \nyears in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax \nassets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the \nenactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the \namount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance \nagainst the gross deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. See Note 14, “Income Taxes” for \nadditional information. The Company’s policy is to classify interest and penalties related to income taxes as \nincome tax expense. \nNet loss per share \nWe compute net loss per share by dividing our net loss (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of \ncommon shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Shares issued during the period and shares \nreacquired during the period, if any, are weighted for the portion of the period that they were outstanding. \nThe computation of diluted earnings per share, or EPS, is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that \nthe denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been \noutstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. Our diluted EPS is the same as basic \nEPS due to the exclusion of common share equivalents as their effect would be anti-dilutive. \nThe following table summarizes our calculation of net loss per common share for the periods presented (in \nthousands, except share and per share data): \n \nYear Ended December 31, \n \n2022 \n \n2021 \nNet loss \n$  \n(13,676) \n $  \n(13,592) \nWeighted average shares outstanding—basic and diluted \n 26,443,067 \n20,773,399  \nBasic and diluted net loss per share \n$ \n(0.52) \n$ \n(0.65)"

This ASU replaces the existing incurred loss \nimpairment model with an expected loss model. It also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary \nimpairment and requires credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an \nallowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. These \nchanges will result in earlier recognition of credit losses. The standard is effective for smaller reporting \ncompanies in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 with early adoption permitted for all periods \nbeginning after December 15, 2018.

Currently, these obligations include costs to be incurred with \ncontract research organizations, central laboratory and pharmacy services, clinical study sites, home nursing \nservices and various other vendors supporting the performance of our clinical trials. The contracts we enter \ninto with these vendors and the commitments within these contracts are subject to significant variability \nbased upon the actual activities/services performed by each vendor. As a result, the ultimate amounts due \nmay be materially different as these obligations are affected by, among other factors, the number and pace of \nparticipants enrolled, the number of clinical study sites enrolling subjects, the amount of time to complete \ntrial enrollments and the time required to finalize, analyze and report of trial results. Clinical research \nagreements are generally cancelable upon up to 60 days’ notice, with the Company’s obligation limited to \ncosts incurred up to that date, including any non-cancelable costs. Cancelation terms for product \nmanufacturing and process development contracts vary and are generally dependent upon timelines for \nsourcing research materials and reserving laboratory time. As of December 31, 2022, the Company estimates \nthat its outstanding commitments, including such cancellable contracts, are approximately $ 4.0 million over \nthe next 12 months and approximately $3.0 million in the following 12 months. These amounts do not \ninclude commitments that the Company will be required to make upon resumption of the ReMEDy2 AIS \ntrial. \nOn November 11, 2021, we announced the enrollment of the first participant for our pivotal ReMEDy2 trial. \nThe ReMEDy2 trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 adaptive trial intended to \nenroll approximately 350 participants. Participants enrolled in the trial will be treated with either DM199 or \nplacebo within 24 hours of the onset of AIS symptoms. Treatment continues twice weekly for approximately \nthree weeks with final follow-up at approximately 90 days after treatment commences. \nOur REDUX clinical trial, a multi-center, open-label, Phase 2 clinical trial investigating patients with Stage \nII or III CKD has completed enrollment. The trial focused on participants with CKD caused by three specific \nconditions: Cohort 1 focused on non-diabetic, hypertensive African Americans with Stage II or III CKD;"

As of December \n31, 2022, one milestone payment obligation remains which is due upon our first regulatory approval of \nDM199 for commercial sale.

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the United \nStates Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act) may be permitted to directors, officers and \ncontrolling persons of the Company, the Company has been advised that, in the opinion of the United States \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in \nthe Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. The Company believes the fair value of these \nindemnification agreements is minimal.

Each RSU or DSU \nrepresents the right to receive one share of our common stock. These recipients receive a number of DSUs \nequal to the amount of the elected portion of the annual cash retainers divided by the 10-trading day average \nclosing sale price of the common stock as determined on the third (3rd) business day prior to the anticipated \ngrant date of the award. Vesting for these annual RSU and DSU grants is quarterly over one year, \nconditioned on continuous service.

RSUs will be settled immediately upon vesting and DSU \nawards will be settled following a separation from service by such director. \nThere were approximately 134,000 and 68,000 vested DSUs and no RSUs outstanding under our share-based \ncompensation plans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The work was performed as required \nby us and all services were invoiced on an hourly basis with no minimum commitment. Total charges \ninvoiced for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $149,000 prior to termination of the agreement \neffective June 16, 2021. \n14.  \nEmployee Benefit Plan \nWe maintain an employee 401(k) retirement savings plan (401(k) Plan).

All employees over the age of 21 may elect to participate in the 401(k) Plan beginning on their hire \ndate. The 401(k) Plan allows eligible employees to contribute a portion of their annual compensation, subject \nonly to maximum limits required by law.
