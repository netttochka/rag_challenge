We are pioneers of optical genome mapping (OGM) for\ngenome analysis and provide a suite of genome analysis solutions designed to enable researchers and clinicians to reveal answers to challenging questions\nin biology and medicine. Our mission is to transform the way the world sees the genome. Through our OGM solutions, our nucleic acid isolation and\npurification solutions, our genomic analysis and interpretation software, and our clinical testing and laboratory services, we believe that we have a suite of\nproducts that will drive new discoveries, elevate health and wellness, and increase our understanding of the genome in transformative ways.\nWe market and sell the Saphyr  system, which delivers OGM data to enable ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific detection of all classes of structural variation\n(SV). The Saphyr system is used to identify structural changes in chromosomes, known as cytogenetics, and to accelerate the search for answers in genetic\ndisease and cancer applications. The Saphyr system is comprised of an instrument, chip consumables, reagents and software containing a suite of data\nanalysis and visualization tools. The Saphyr system has been shown to outperform the current gold standard methods for cytogenetics and molecular\ngenetics including karyotyping, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), Southern blot and chromosomal microarray (CMA). The Saphyr system has also\nbeen shown to identify structural changes in chromosomes that cannot be identified using current commercially available solutions for gene sequencing.\nWe market and sell the Ionic  Purification system, which is able to deliver high quality DNA in a more natural, native form and with fewer contaminants\nwhen compared to other isolation and purifications solutions. The Ionic Purification system is used to extract, purify, and concentrate DNA or RNA from a\nvariety of sample types, and is comprised of an instrument, consumables, and reagents.\nOur software delivers genomic data interpretation solutions tailored for research use in cytogenomics and molecular pathology labs in genetic disease and\ncancer research markets, with an emphasis on structural variation. This industry leading, platform agnostic software solution is designed to provide\nanalysis, visualization, interpretation and reporting of SVs, single-nucleotide variants and absence of heterozygosity across the genome in one consolidated\nview. Our software currently enables analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and microarray data, and we are developing a version that we expect to\nbe able to incorporate OGM data to make our software a more comprehensive offering for analysis of genomic data. We believe the integration of OGM\nwith data types common in the industry, such as Variant Call Format (VCF), and Binary Alignment Map (BAM), should accelerate and broaden our\nposition in digital cytogenetics and comprehensive genome analysis by enabling us to simplify the assessment of clinically relevant variants in\ncytogenomics applications, potentially reducing interpretation time per sample and expanding our reach into the discovery and translational research\nmarkets through the combination of OGM and NGS.\nOur Bionano Laboratories business provides proprietary genetic clinical testing services for individuals demonstrating clinical presentations consistent with\nneurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and other disorders of childhood development. Their comprehensive\ngenetic testing services include reporting for known NDD-causing genome variations, including testing for proprietary variations, and combines testing\nwith our Proprietary Variant Index (PRISM) which uses a proprietary database of over 35,000 individuals with NDDs tested with over 60,000 tests that\nprovides additional evidence for candidate genes associated with NDDs. This testing is a CLIA-certified diagnostic testing service, and we have expertise\nin selling cytogenetic assays to physicians, providing genetic counseling services to individuals undergoing testing and their families, and contracting with\nthird-party payors for reimbursement. Additionally, Bionano Laboratories has developed OGM-based laboratory developed tests (LDTs) for\nfacioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 1 (FSHD1), which is a progressive disorder that primarily affects the muscles of the face, shoulder blades\n(scapula), upper arms, and lower legs, and for detecting SVs in individuals with hematologic malignancies.\nBionano Laboratories also provides laboratory services to clinicians, scientists, pharmaceutical companies, and others who are seeking to incorporate OGM\ninto their genomics research without the need to bring our Saphyr system in house. Laboratory services for OGM are performed in our laboratory facilities\nin San Diego, California and at partner laboratories in the United States and Europe, and serve as solutions for researchers and clinicians who would like to\nuse OGM for various applications in genomics but have yet to acquire the Saphyr system.\nOver the past year, we believe we have transformed our business from an instrument company to a provider of a full suite of genomic solutions. We\nexpanded into molecular genetic clinical testing services through our August 2020 acquisition of Lineagen. We furthered our transformation through the\nexpansion into software solutions, made possible by our October 2021 acquisition of BioDiscovery and continued with our November 2022 acquisition of\nPurigen bringing their leading nucleic acid isolation and purification technology to Bionano. We believe that these acquisitions, along with internal\ninvestments in research and development and the build out of our commercial teams, have positioned us well to provide solutions to our customers that we\nbelieve will make OGM the standard of care for many constitutional genetic disorders and cancers.\n®\n®\n5"

Milestones\nBionano executed on its 2022 ELEVATE! milestones and achieved or exceeded all publicly stated milestones outlined at the beginning of 2022.\n•\nReimbursement: We applied for a category 1 Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code for OGM.\n•\nClinical Studies: We received institutional review board (IRB) approval for our hematological study. Site selection was completed, and\nenrollment commenced for our hematological study. Data generation for our prenatal study commenced. We completed our postnatal study. We\nhad an interim publication for our prenatal study.\n•\nExpand Awareness: We achieved an installed base of 240 Saphyr systems.\n•\nPlanned Product Developments: We released a pre-commercial version of NxClinical software, version 7.0, enabling OGM data analysis in the\nfield. We released labeling protocol 2.0 and the SP Next DNA isolation protocol. We placed a pre-commercial version of our next-generation\nOGM system in the field. Our Bionano Laboratories business launched an OGM test menu for genetic disease and hematologic malignancies.\nCommercial Adoption of Offerings for Saphyr\nBionano executed on its commercialization strategy, expanded the utilization of its Saphyr system and increased the amount of Bionano data generated\nacross the globe, driving commercial momentum.\n•\nGrew our installed base of Saphyr systems to 240 as of December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately 46% from a total installed base of 164 as\nof December 31, 2021. Installed base represents the global number of Saphyr instruments installed at end-customer locations to perform optical\ngenome mapping.\n•\nSold 4,781 flowcells in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of approximately 49% over the 3,204 flowcells sold during the fourth quarter of\n2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, total flowcells sold reached 15,375, an increase of approximately 23% over the 12,518 flowcells\nsold during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Saphyr chip is the consumable that packages nanochannel arrays for DNA linearization. In its\ncurrent form, each Saphyr chip has three flowcells. Flowcells sold refers to the units of genome mapping consumables used for analyzing one\ngenome, purchased by customers to process optical genome mapping.\nContinued to Validate the Utility of OGM for Applications in Clinical Research with Benchmarking, Scientific Publication and Adoption\nRigorous and extensive benchmarking of our Saphyr system against traditional cytogenetic methods and long read sequencing has continued and these\nresults were published and validated in several key publications, presentations and announcements including:\n•\nResearchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center published the first study to evaluate the utility of OGM for\nmyelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) prognostication. The publication reported that when OGM was used instead of karyotyping, 17 to 21% of study\nsubjects had different prognostic risk scores depending on the scoring system used, and in 13% of study subjects additional pathogenic variants\nwere revealed.\n•\nIn a study published in Blood Cancer Journal, researchers found that in 33% of MDS samples and 54% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)\nsamples, more clinically relevant variants were detected using OGM than were found by traditional cytogenetic methods and these variants were\nreported to be highly relevant to the understanding of pathogenesis of these disorders.\n•\nResearchers from eight research institutes analyzed OGM’s utility for detection of cytogenetic abnormalities in AML samples, finding that OGM\nidentified pathogenic variants in 12% of cases that altered European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk-level or identified eligibility for clinical trials.\n•\nThe first published validation study to evaluate the performance of OGM versus traditional cytogenetic techniques for the analysis of\nhematological neoplasms showed that OGM’s technical performance resulted in a 100% first-pass rate, with concordance to traditional methods\nshowing a sensitivity of 98.7%, a specificity of 100%, and an accuracy of 99.2%.\n•\nA study demonstrated the utility of OGM as part of a workflow to evaluate the quality of hypoimmunogenic induced pluripotent stem cells\n(iPSCs) which could be used in regenerative medicine. This research provides scientific and practical support for OGM’s ability to detect cryptic\nand balanced SVs in CRISPR-edited cells, some of which were not detected by karyotyping, and which may impact the genomic integrity of\niPSCs.\n6"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nMacroeconomic and Geopolitical Developments\nWe are subject to additional risks and uncertainties as a result of adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic developments, such as any lingering effects of\nCOVID-19, the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia and related sanctions, and uncertain market conditions, including inflation and supply chain\ndisruptions, which could continue to have a material impact on our business and financial results.\nFor a more detailed discussion of the impacts of macroeconomic and geopolitical developments on our business, see “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Developments.”\nIndustry Background\nGenome analysis is the process of extracting and interpreting biological information from DNA and RNA. DNA is the code that is found in all living cells\nand determines the characteristics and health of all living organisms. Although each organism’s DNA order is unique, all DNA is composed of the same\nfour nucleotides that come in pairs, which are referred to as base pairs. The human genome is composed of six billion of these base pairs (three billion of\nwhich are the maternal copy and three billion of which are the paternal copy of the genome), distributed across 23 pairs of chromosomes ranging in size\nfrom approximately 50 million to approximately 250 million base pairs. Genome variation is defined as at least one base pair differing in a comparison of\nsequence against a reference standard and can be as large as tens of millions of base pairs.\nGenome structure refers to the way in which the various functional elements of the genome such as genes, reading frames, promoters and others are\nordered, oriented and organized across the 23 pairs of chromosomes. SVs represent differences in the amount or location of genomic DNA from one\nindividual compared to a reference genome. SV is one of the most biologically important aspects of the human genome and is a major factor for the cause\nof genetic disorders and cancer. Each SV involves the rearrangement or repetition of as few as several hundred base pairs to as many as tens of millions of\nbase pairs. SVs may be inherited or arise spontaneously. SVs are well-known to cause diseases such as constitutional genetic disorders and cancer. Many\nresearchers and clinicians now agree that despite major advances in the speed and cost-effectiveness of DNA sequencing, it fails to reliably detect SVs.\nOGM enables the detection of all known classes of SVs, and we believe no methodology exists that can detect SVs more comprehensively or cost\nefficiently than OGM with the Saphyr system.\nWe believe the traditional cytogenomic methods of detecting SVs for research and clinical applications, such as karyotyping, CMA, and FISH are\nantiquated and cumbersome and can only detect a small proportion of the SVs across an entire genome. OGM is designed to offer cytogeneticists the ability\nto fully digitize and replace these traditional methods with one simplified, cost effective and scalable workflow using the Saphyr system.\nWe believe that DNA isolation is the critical first step in the analysis of DNA. Short and long read sequencing applications typically require nucleotide\nlengths of 150 and, generally, 10,000 to 20,000 base pairs, respectively. OGM, conversely, optimally requires DNA lengths of greater than 100,000 base\npairs. Due to market needs, the vast majority of DNA isolation and preparation technologies have been directed to meeting the requirements for short and\nlong read sequencing applications. We believe that DNA isolation and purification processes that allow long segments of DNA (ultra-high molecular\nweight (UHMW) DNA) to remain intact are important for the success of OGM. Our Ionic Purification system has the capability to isolate and purify\nUHMW DNA that is ideal for OGM applications. We believe that the system’s ease of use, reproducibility, and cost per sample profile has the potential to\naccelerate the adoption of OGM across a broad spectrum of applications.\nWe believe that software is necessary for genome analysis and should be the primary interface for how cytogeneticists interact with the data and report their\nfindings. We believe the software’s ease of use, core analysis functionality and the time necessary to obtain a reportable result are the most important\nfactors to customers when considering a platform adoption decision and that data interpretation is typically a critical bottleneck in methods of genome\nanalysis and therefore software is a key component in the entire workflow. The majority of software solutions on the market today have been developed\nwith NGS as the primary application with the focus on the interpretation and reporting of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) instead of SVs. Our software\nsolution, NxClinical™, was developed with CNV as the core focus and has become established as an industry leading solution for interpretation and\nreporting of CNVs for CMA and NGS. To the extent we are successful in integrating OGM into our NxClinical software, we anticipate that our software\nwill be the first software solution delivering a fully integrated interpretation capability for SVs from OGM as well as seamless integration with NGS, with\nthe potential to enable complementary OGM and NGS workflows through one software solution.\nOur Solutions\nWe believe that an end-to-end OGM solution begins with the sample and ends with data analysis. The OGM workflow includes several steps: DNA\nisolation, DNA labeling, DNA mapping, data processing and data analysis. At each step we have either organically developed a solution or partnered with a\nthird party to enable and provide a solution. We highly value our relationships with third parties that enable us to provide these solutions and will continue\nto work with others to ensure our customers’ needs are being met. We are constantly on the look-out for opportunities to better meet the needs of our\ncustomers\n7"

To that end, we have\nrecently engaged in two transactions, which we believe will substantially benefit our customers and their adoption of OGM as a solution of choice for SV\nand CNV analysis. In 2021 we acquired BioDiscovery and its leading NxClinical software for data analysis, and in 2022 we acquired Purigen, and its\nproprietary isolation and purification technology. We believe that each of these acquisitions, together with our organic development, will significantly\nenhance the customer experience with OGM.\nOGM Systems\nOur system uses a proprietary approach to measure genome structure and SV through OGM. The OGM workflow is novel, comprehensive, scalable, cost\neffective and highly differentiated. OGM data is currently generated using the Saphyr system, which directly measures sequence specific patterns (SSPs)\nalong UHMW DNA molecules in an unbiased approach without any amplification. Using the SSPs, software constructs a detailed physical map of the\ngenome that accurately assigns the chromosomal location, order, orientation and quantity of sequence and in-turn, all the genome’s functional elements. We\nbelieve OGM is capable of comprehensive, cost-effective and efficient detection of all classes of SVs and CNVs. Today, these SVs cannot be reliably\ndetected by genome sequencing, from existing high throughput sequencers, which is focused on identifying genomic differences involving a few base pairs\nor SNVs, which the Saphyr system does not identify. We believe the Saphyr system is ideally suited to be adopted alongside the installed base of high\nthroughput sequencers as a complement that is designed to give users the ability to see a much wider scope of genome variation, from single bases of DNA\nto full chromosomes.\nOGM was built upon four key elements:\n•\nExtremely long molecules for analysis (or UHMW DNA). The Saphyr system is capable of analyzing single molecules that are on average\napproximately 250,000 base pairs in length and can be as long as millions of base pairs. These lengths are over 1,000 times longer than the\naverage short read length with Illumina sequencing systems and approximately 10-20 times longer than the average long read lengths with Pacific\nBiosciences of California (PacBio), and Oxford Nanopore systems. We believe these long read lengths overcome the inherent challenges of\ngenome complexity and are the key to the Saphyr system’s unprecedented sensitivity and specificity.\n•\nProprietary nanotechnology for massively parallel linearization and analysis of long molecules with single molecule imaging. Analyzing\nUHMW DNA required invention. We invented, patented, developed and commercialized nanochannel arrays to capture long single molecules of\nDNA from a solution and unwind and linearize them for SV analysis. Each molecule is imaged separately, making it possible to deconvolute\ncomplex mixtures including haplotypes and heterogeneous tumors.\n•\nDNA labeling chemistry specifically for physical mapping. The detailed analysis of SSPs we use is also highly unique and novel. Instead of\nidentifying the sequence of every base pair in these long fragments, we label and detect SSPs or motifs that occur universally across every genome\nwith an average frequency of approximately one site for every few thousand base pairs. The key to our method entails introducing fluorescent tags\nat the sequence-specific site using highly specific and robust enzymatic chemistry along the extremely long fragments. These fragments, stretched\nout in nanochannels, are then directly imaged allowing us to measure the distance between labels with high accuracy. The pattern of labels\ndetected on all these fragments can then be related to the pattern of sequence motif sites in a reference genome for comparison. Changes in the\npattern indicate structural variation.\n•\nBioinformatic tools for SV analysis. Finally, our approach includes a novel bioinformatics platform that we developed from the ground-up to\ntake advantage of the unique benefits of our solution. It comprises proprietary algorithms for the construction of a structurally accurate physical\nmap of the genome to assign structure. Physical\n8"

We believe that the Saphyr system is the only product capable of detecting SVs at high\nsensitivity and specificity with a workflow that is cost-effective and time efficient.\nOur customers include researchers and clinicians who seek to identify and understand the biological implications of genome variation. We believe that the\nSaphyr system can replace more traditional cytogenetic tools which are expensive, slow and labor-intense, with an advanced solution designed to simplify\nworkflow, reduce cost, and increase assay success rates. We believe the Saphyr system has the potential to significantly increase success rates and provide\nmore answers across a wide range of applications in genomics.\nNucleic Acid Isolation and Purification Systems\nOur nucleic acid isolation and purification system uses a novel and proprietary application of isotachophoresis (ITP) to isolate nucleic acid molecules in a\ngentle and efficient process. The process involves the gentle lysis of biological samples followed by the addition of the sample and buffer to an Ionic  fluid\nchip. An electric field is applied to the chip and the nucleic acid is isolated in its natural, native form. Traditional methods of isolating nucleic acid,\nincluding column-based isolation and bead-based isolation, can be laborious, and result in molecules that are denatured, dehydrated and fragmented, and\nsolutions that are contaminated and have low purity. An additional limitation of many of the traditional isolation processes is the number of cells that are\nrequired to be processed in order to obtain sufficient nucleic acid molecules for OGM analysis. Current methodologies require upwards of 1.5 million cells\nin order to isolate sufficient DNA for use on the Saphyr system. Our Ionic Purification system, employing ITP technology, addresses many of these\ndeficiencies and yields high purity nucleic acid that is not denatured, dehydrated or fragmented. Additionally, the Ionic Purification system is capable of\nisolating sufficient quantities of DNA for use in OGM applications from far fewer cells in contrast to traditional methods. We believe the addition of the\nIonic Purification system to the OGM workflow will provide a more efficient yield of DNA at higher quality than can be achieved with current processes.\nAlthough OGM is our primary focus, the Ionic Purification system has a current customer base of non-OGM users that use the system to isolate and purify\nnucleic acid molecules from sample types including formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sample, tissue, cells, and viral. We anticipate continuing to\nsupport and expanding this customer base.\nSoftware Solutions\nWe offer industry leading genome analysis software that enables genomics labs to analyze and interpret data across a wide range of platforms to generate\nhighly informative data visualizations for streamlined and simple reporting of causal variants. Today, NxClinical software is among the most\ncomprehensive solutions for analysis and interpretation of any microarray or NGS generated data integrating CNVs, absence of heterozygosity (AOH) and\nloss of heterozygosity (LOH), as well as SNVs from sequencing data into a single well integrated interface that is used across the globe by renowned\nacademic and commercial clinical laboratories.\nOur acquisition of BioDiscovery has expanded our portfolio into providing data analysis and interpretation solutions across NGS, CMA and we are\nworking to add OGM. These software solutions are expected to allow us to leverage and expand our network of Bionano customers and to potentially\nenable future adoption of OGM. We believe integrating OGM data into the NxClinical software should substantially improve the analysis and reporting\ncapabilities of our current Saphyr system, making OGM easier to adopt and use by our customers. Through BioDiscovery, we can now serve the NGS and\narray markets directly though software with an industry leading data interpretation solution for revealing more answers with delivery of copy number\nvariants across the genome. Our software monetization strategy is predicated on a pay-per-sample model where customers running NGS and/or array today\ncan adopt, which sets the stage for future OGM adoptions. Software is a way for us to participate directly in the NGS market while also enabling OGM data\nto be seamlessly integrated with NGS in one view for a comprehensive analysis, which is unique to Bionano.\nTesting and Laboratory Services\nOur Bionano Laboratories business offers tests that use CMA for evaluation of patients suspected of having certain genetic diseases, which is\nrecommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the American\nAcademy of Neurology (AAN), among other renowned societies. We are actively performing research to determine whether OGM with the Saphyr system\ncan replace CMA as the front-line test for children with developmental disorders. As the scientific, peer-reviewed literature supports this claim, the coding\nentities such as CMS and the AMA would need to adopt the proper procedural codes to allow for insurance reimbursement of new testing methodologies\nbefore they become mainstream clinical diagnostic instruments. Importantly, OGM is expected to be able to detect full mutations consistent with fragile X\nsyndrome, which is another front-line test for children, especially males, with\n®\n9"

Bionano Laboratories also employs Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), which aims to detect genome SNVs that are different from genome SVs\nand are not detectable by OGM.\nWe believe that Bionano Laboratories is uniquely positioned to develop LDT’s that can improve upon the existing SOC for diagnostic testing for NDDs.\nBionano Laboratories is working with payers to secure reimbursement alternatives for OGM-based testing. If reimbursements can be established, Bionano\nLaboratories intends to share its strategies with other labs which may drive demand for the Saphyr system. Bionano Laboratories plans to expand its testing\nmenu with inclusion of OGM to demonstrate workflow implementation in a clinical setting in order to drive adoption as well as serve as a conduit for\nenabling access for those customers unable to make a capital equipment expenditure. Bionano Laboratories is working to enable access, demonstrate\nexcellence of the OGM workflow as a model within a CLIA setting for educational purposes, and drive advancements in product development for clinical\ngrade testing of OGM at scale.\nOur Commercial Offerings\nThe Saphyr System and Consumables\nWe develop and market the Saphyr system, a complete sample-to-result solution for SV analysis by OGM that empowers comprehensive genome analysis\nand facilitates a deeper understanding of genetic variation and function. We believe the Saphyr system is capable of addressing the needs for SV analysis\nbecause it is:\n•\nHighly sensitive. We believe Saphyr is the most sensitive detector of SV larger than 500 base pairs currently on the market.\n•\nCost effective. The consumables cost per genome, at an average of approximately $500, can be less than the combination of standard techniques\nand well below both short-read and long-read WGS at a depth of 160x coverage.\n•\nScalable and fast. Relative to traditional techniques, Saphyr has demonstrated up to a 75% reduction in turnaround time for analysis of acute\nlymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) subjects when used instead of karyotyping, FISH and MLPA.\nThe Saphyr Instrument\nThe Saphyr instrument is a single-molecule imager that includes high performance optics, automated sample loading based on machine learning algorithms\nand computational hardware and control software. The instrument’s high-performance optics simultaneously image DNA linearized in hundreds of\nthousands of nanochannels. The instrument’s control interface is the user’s primary control center to design and monitor experiments as they occur in real\ntime. The computational hardware is responsible for the secondary processing of the image data being produced on the Saphyr instruments. The Saphyr\ninstrument is currently capable of analyzing up to 5,000 human genomes per year at 30x coverage. At the end of 2022 we announced the placement of a\npre-commercial unit that we expect to significantly increase the throughput.\nThe Saphyr Chip\nThe Saphyr Chip® is the consumable that packages the nanochannel arrays for DNA linearization. In its current form, each Saphyr chip has three flow cells\ncontaining approximately 120,000 nanochannels that are roughly 30 nanometers wide, and each flowcell can hold one unique sample. To manufacture the\narrays, we use photolithography in a semiconductor fabrication facility to print hundreds of thousands of tiny grooves on silicon wafers and then dice the\nwafers into individual chips. Our chips are inexpensive to manufacture and highly scalable. The fluidic environment in each channel allows individual\nmolecules to move swiftly utilizing only the charge of DNA. Hundreds of thousands of molecules can move through hundreds of thousands of parallel\nnanochannels simultaneously, enabling extremely high-throughput processing on a single-molecule basis.\n10"

These kits are optimized for performing our genome mapping applications on a variety of sample types.\nOur workflow begins with the isolation of UHMW DNA. Our Bionano Prep kits are optimized for isolating and purifying UHMW DNA in a process that is\ngentler than existing DNA extraction methods. The resulting purified DNA is up to millions of base pairs long and optimal for use with our systems. Our\nkits and protocols enable the extraction of UHMW DNA from a variety of sample types including human or animal tissue and tumors, plant tissue, cell\nlines, bone marrow aspirates and human blood.\nOur labeling reagents are optimized for applications on our genome mapping systems. Starting with UHMW DNA purified using the appropriate Bionano\nPrep kit, fluorescent labels are attached to specific sequence motifs. The result is uniquely identifiable genome-specific label patterns that enable de novo\nmap assembly, anchoring sequencing contigs and discovery of SVs as small as 500 base pairs to up to chromosome arm lengths.\nOur kit for DNA labeling, the Direct Label and Stain (DLS) kit, is a proprietary, nondestructive chemistry for sequence motif labeling of genomic DNA\nthat improves every aspect of our genome mapping. DLS uses a single direct-labeling enzymatic reaction to attach a fluorophore to the DNA at a specific\n6-base pair sequence motif, yielding approximately 16 labels per 100,000 base pairs in the human genome. After labeling, the molecules are linearized in\nthe Saphyr chip on the Saphyr instrument and imaged. Through the isolation, labeling and linearization steps, the molecules maintain an average length of\naround 250,000 base pairs. The label patterns on each molecule allow them to be uniquely identified and aligned in a pair-wise comparison against all other\nmolecules imaged from the same sample.\nThe Ionic Purification System\nWe acquired the Ionic Purification system through our November 2022 acquisition of Purigen. The Ionic Purification system uses a proprietary ITP method\nto isolate and purify nucleic acid molecules. The technology was initially developed at Stanford University and intellectual property from that development\nwas exclusively licensed to Purigen. The technology was further developed and commercialized by Purigen. The system includes an instrument,\nconsumable and reagents necessary to process samples. The system works by applying an electric field to specially formulated reagents in a consumable.\nThe electric field electrophoretically focuses nucleic acid into a narrow band and purifies the molecules away from other potential inhibitors. This results in\na higher yield of pure nucleic acid than traditional bind-and-strip approaches that is also less fragmented and free from bead or wash buffer contamination.\nWe offer reagents to isolate DNA and RNA from FFPE, tissue, and cells. We are optimizing the system with the intent it be used in an OGM workflow. We\nbelieve that the isolation and purification of DNA using the Ionic system in an OGM workflow will create a number of opportunities, including, enabling\nadditional sample types not currently available to OGM, increasing sample throughput, decreasing sample preparation complexity.\n11"

Using pairwise alignment\nof the single molecule images, consensus genome maps are constructed, refined, extended and merged. Molecules are then clustered into two alleles, and a\ndiploid assembly is created to allow for heterozygous SV detection. Genome maps typically span entire chromosome arms in single, contiguous maps.\nComparative analysis of maps reveals SV. Our customers use our variant annotation workflow to specifically uncover rare and sample-specific mutations.\nOur hardware solution includes the Saphyr Compute Server, which provides cluster-like performance in an affordable, compact solution and the Bionano\nCompute Server, which expands the analytical capacity of the suite of tools. With these solutions, our customers are capable of performing multiple\nsimultaneous analyses and sustaining continuous throughput, which allows them to spend less time waiting for data, so they can focus on investigating\nresults. We also offer a cloud-based solution for data analysis.\nOur NxClinical software is among the most comprehensive and up-to-date solutions for cytogenetics and molecular genetics, providing one solution for\nanalysis and interpretation of all genomic variants from microarray and NGS data. We are developing a version of NxClinical to incorporate OGM data,\nwhich is expected to become our software solution once completed.\nTesting and Laboratory Services\nOur Bionano Laboratories business offers OGM data to researchers seeking access to OGM data. Bionano Laboratories intends to build a menu of LDTs\nusing OGM solutions, and in 2022 Bionano Laboratories introduced their first two OGM-based tests, one for hematological malignancy and another for\ngenetic disorder applications. Additionally, Bionano Laboratories offers molecular genetic clinical testing services for individuals demonstrating clinical\npresentations consistent with NDDs, including ASDs and other disorders of childhood development, including:\n•\nFirstStepDx PLUS is a CMA designed to identify an underlying genetic cause in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay,\nand intellectual disability;\n•\nFragile X syndrome (FXS) testing is designed to detect individuals (both males and females) with FXS, as well as carriers of the condition;\n•\nNextStepDx PLUS is a whole exome sequencing test designed to identify genetic variants that are associated with disorders of childhood\ndevelopment;\n•\nEpiPanelDx PLUS is a genetic testing panel designed for patients who have experienced seizures, infantile spasms, encephalopathy, or febrile\nseizures; and\n•\nPGx test identifies over 60 alleles in 11 genes. PGx testing is one aspect of personalized medicine and is used to aid health care providers with\nmedications and dosage.\nMarket Opportunity\nAccording to Markets and Markets, the worldwide market for genomics products and services is expected to reach approximately $54.4 billion by 2025, up\nfrom approximately $22.7 billion in 2020, representing a compound annual growth rate of 19%.\nWe expect to see OGM adoption in cytogenomics, discovery research and cell bioprocessing quality control (QC). Within cytogenetics and molecular\npathology, we estimate the number of cytogenetic labs on a worldwide basis (excluding India and\n12"
    },
    {
      "page_index": 14,
      "text": "Table of Contents\ndeveloping countries) to be approximately 10,000. We estimate that these labs analyze approximately 10.0 million samples per year. Additionally, we\nestimate the number of pharmaceutical and biotech companies that are engaged in research and development of various cell therapies that rely on methods,\nincluding cytogenetics, for QC of the cell modification and manufacturing process to be approximately 1,400. Based on these estimates, we believe the\neconomic potential for OGM in these markets is approximately $10.0 billion annually, $3.0 billion of which we attribute to cell bioprocessing QC. We\nbelieve there are additional potential future market opportunities for OGM including newborn screening, population genomics, and neurological and\ncardiological risk assessment which are not included in our estimates above.\nWe believe the three areas of the genomics market that are driving demand for the Saphyr system today:\n•\nConsolidation of traditional cytogenetics techniques in constitutional and cancer applications. To provide a robust clinical analysis, cytogenetic\nassays detect known SVs that are linked to specific diseases or therapeutic responses. The technologies used for detecting SVs are expensive and\ninvolve cumbersome workflows with relatively limited ability to scale to higher volumes or more complex testing panels. Sequencers tend not to\nbe used for cytogenetics due to their inability to reliably detect SVs. Cytogenetics laboratories are beginning to adopt the Saphyr system as a more\neffective, scalable and efficient approach to finding the SVs causative to genetic diseases and cancer. For this segment, the Saphyr system can be\nused as the sole tool for providing comprehensive and accurate detection of all classes of SVs and enable clinically relevant calls without the need\nfor any sequencing or legacy cytogenetic technology. We estimate that approximately 10,000 cytogenetics labs exist worldwide (excluding India\nand developing countries).\n•\nCombining OGM with sequencing for molecular genetics and discovery research applications. In discovery research across patient cohorts,\nsequencing is primarily used to find SNVs responsible for disease or therapeutic response. Sequencing alone, however, is significantly limited due\nto its inability to reveal SV. Our Saphyr system has been expanding this market segment by complementing sequencing to expand the scope of\ngenome variation that can be analyzed in studies to achieve a more comprehensive view of the genome.\n•\nCell bioprocessing QC applications. An important part of cell bioprocessing applications is to ensure that genomic modifications did not\nintroduce any SVs into the cell population. As a QC step, our Saphyr system has been used by researchers to evaluate the ability of OGM to detect\nSVs that may impact cellular stability. Several studies have been published showing the OGM can be used to evaluate cellular stability. We believe\nthat this is an emerging market opportunity and could be up to $3.0 billion annually.\nWe believe that if our OGM-based solutions can successfully penetrate these addressable market opportunities, this should spur additional basic and\ntranslational research creating new areas where the Saphyr instrument (or successor instruments) and OGM data can be used to improve the standard of\ncare and patient management. These may include preconception, products of conception and prenatal genetic applications, uses to advance gene editing\ntechniques and precision medicine. In the long term, we anticipate potential opportunities in population screening, newborn screening, biopharma\napplications in cell quality control and oncology.\nOur Strategy\nWe are primarily focused on driving adoption of OGM through the Saphyr system (and successor instruments). Our goal is to streamline SV identification\nand enable new research in genomics to allow greater insight into their role in human health in ways that have not been possible with any other current\nresearch and diagnostic technologies.\nOur strategy to achieve this includes:\n•\nDemonstrate that Saphyr is a superior alternative to traditional techniques in constitutional genetic disorders and hematologic malignancy\napplications. Optical genome mapping has demonstrated superior detection sensitivity for all classes of SVs relative to karyotyping, FISH and\nCMA in numerous peer-reviewed publications over the past several years and offers benefits of improved assay success rates, faster time to result\nand a lower total cost. The value proposition and competitive differentiation for OGM in cytogenetics market is exceptionally strong with an\nimmediate opportunity to digitize legacy microscope techniques (karyotyping) with a superior approach using the Saphyr system.\n•\nComplement NGS with OGM in translational, applied and discovery research markets. We believe the combination of NGS and OGM can\nprovide the most comprehensive and cost-effective analysis of genome variants from SNVs to whole chromosomes. NGS is an accurate technique\nfor measuring genome variants below 500 bp while OGM bridges the gap by enabling detection of all SVs above 500 bp to reveal more answers\nand resolve previously unresolved cases from using NGS alone. There are over 15,000 NGS instruments installed globally and our vision is for\neach of these sequencers to be complemented with an OGM system to provide a more comprehensive picture of the genome for more discoveries,\npublications and translation into molecular genetics.\n•\nAccelerate broad reimbursement for OGM and establish it as the SOC in guidelines by professional medical societies. We are investing in four\nmulti-center clinical studies for postnatal, prenatal, hematologic malignancies and solid tumor analyses relative to SOC. Each study is designed\nwith an expectation for recruitment of 1,000 subjects and\n13"

We are investing in\nthese programs to build the necessary evidence to establish reimbursement and to pave the way for inclusion in professional society guidelines to\nadvance SOC.\n•\nSupport the publication of findings with OGM by our customers beyond the more than 687 papers published to date. The annual number of\npublications featuring data generated by the Saphyr system and its predecessor system has steadily increased since 2010 when the first publication\nappeared. Recently, the overall number of these publications has grown significantly. For example, of the 521 peer-reviewed and pre-print papers\npublished since 2019, 173 were published in 2022 alone. We intend to continue to support and foster our customer base to help grow the number\nof publications featuring our systems’ data. We believe that these publications are impactful as our customers’ studies cover SVs in areas of high\nunmet medical need, such as rare and undiagnosed pediatric diseases, neurological and muscular diseases, developmental delays and disorders,\nprostate cancer and leukemia.\n•\nContinue to innovate our products and technologies. We designed the Saphyr system to accommodate performance enhancements without the\nneed for replacement of the entire instrument. For example, hardware upgrades and new consumables are made available to purchase by\ncustomers. We intend for these performance enhancements to be delivered on a regular basis. In addition, we periodically make available software\nupgrades to customers through download at no charge. We expect to continue developing and refining our technologies to improve the ease of use\nof our Saphyr system and enable our existing installed systems to meaningfully increase sample throughput and sensitivity and specificity of SV\ndetection. A high throughput version is currently in development is expected to significantly increase the throughput and lower the cost per\nsample. Compared to the Saphyr system, which images DNA at a rate of approximately 205 Gbp per hour, the new system is expected to image\nnearly 820 Gbp per hour and we announced the placement of a pre-commercial beta system at a customer facility in December 2022.\n•\nPartner with industry-leading companies and laboratories to expand adoption in clinical markets. Establish additional collaborations with\ncustomers to help drive validating studies. Expand partnership efforts with clinical diagnostic companies to commercialize LDTs in the U.S. as\nwell as LDTs and approved tests outside the U.S.\nSales and Marketing\nAs of December 31, 2022, our commercial team consisted of 168 individuals in sales, sales support and marketing. Our sales support personnel include\nindividuals in customer solutions, field service engineers and field application specialists. This commercial staff is primarily located in North America,\nEurope, and China. Most of our sales support team is located at our headquarters in San Diego and some work remotely throughout the U.S., Europe, and\nChina.\nWe sell our products through a direct sales force based in North America and Europe. Our sales strategy involves the use of a combination of sales\nmanagers and sales representatives. We intend to increase our sales, support, and marketing efforts in the future by continuing to expand our direct footprint\nin North America and Europe as well as developing a more comprehensive support network in China and India, where we believe significant market\nopportunities exist, as we expand our business.\nWe sell our products through a network of distributors in the Asia-Pacific region and select other markets outside of North America and Europe.\nSpecifically, we distribute our instruments and reagents via third-party distributors in markets such as China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Australia,\nIndia and South Africa. Three of our distributors are in China, one in Australia, one in Italy, one in Sweden, one in Japan, and one in South Korea.\nThe role of our sales managers and sales representatives is to educate customers on the advantages of Saphyr and the applications that our system makes\npossible. The role of our field application specialists is to provide on-site training and scientific technical support to prospective and existing customers.\nOur field application specialists are technical experts with advanced degrees, including seven with PhDs., and generally have extensive experience in\nacademic research and core sequencing lab experience.\nIn addition, we maintain an applications lab team in San Diego, California composed of scientific experts who can transfer knowledge from the research\nand development team to the field application specialists. The applications lab team also runs foundational scientific collaborations and proof of principle\nstudies, which help demonstrate the value of our product offering to prospective customers. This team also provides commercial services by running\nsamples on Saphyr for researchers who do not have a Saphyr system of their own.\nOur systems are relatively new to the life science marketplace and require a capital investment by our customers. The sales process typically involves\nnumerous interactions and demonstrations with multiple people within an organization. Some potential customers conduct in-depth evaluations of the\nsystem including having us run experiments on in-house Saphyr systems. In addition, in most countries, sales to academic or governmental institutions\nrequire participation in a tender process involving preparation of extensive documentation and a lengthy review process. Because of these factors and the\nbudget cycles of our customers, our sales cycle, the time from initial contact with a customer to our receipt of a purchase order, can often be nine to 12\nmonths.\n14"

This commercial staff is\nlocated in North America, and the sales personnel primarily work remotely in U.S. states where Bionano Laboratories has obtained insurance\nreimbursement. The sales and marketing efforts are targeted primarily on specialty pediatricians, including pediatric neurologists, medical geneticists, and\ndevelopmental and behavioral pediatricians. Bionano Laboratories also targets general pediatricians with large numbers of patients. Their managed care\nefforts are directed to establishing contracts and/or credentialing with private and governmental insurance carriers that provide coverage for patients with\nASD and other forms of NDDs.\nInstruments\nOur instruments are manufactured by a third-party medical device manufacturer. Complete or nearly complete instruments are shipped by the manufacturer\nto us for final assembly and quality control testing. Upon completion, we ship directly to our customers’ locations globally, or distributors’ locations in the\ncase of certain systems sold in the Asia-Pacific region. Installation of, and training on, our products is provided by our employees in the markets where we\nconduct direct sales, and by distributors in those markets where we operate with distributors.\nWe believe this manufacturing strategy is efficient and conserves capital. However, in the event it becomes necessary to utilize a different contract\nmanufacturer, we would experience additional costs, delays and difficulties in doing so, and our business could be harmed. This manufacturer actively\nmanages obsolescence of all components in our system. This is done through their supply management process where we get notified of any parts that will\nbecome obsolete with enough lead time to identify alternatives.\nConsumables\nAll of our chip consumables for both OGM and ITP applications are produced by third-party manufacturers at their facilities; however, we have established\nprocedures for a replacement manufacturer if required. We complete final assembly and quality control assessments of our chips at our headquarters in San\nDiego and our facility in Pleasanton.\nOur OGM reagents are sourced from a limited number of suppliers, including certain single source suppliers. Our ITP reagents are sourced from a limited\nnumber of suppliers, including certain single source suppliers and also prepared in-house at our facility in Pleasanton. The OGM reagents include all\ncomponents required to run a sample on OGM, such as capture and detector reagents, enzyme reagents and enzyme substrate. The ITP reagents include all\nthe components required to run a sample for isolation and purification of nucleic acid. Although we believe that alternatives would be available, it would\ntake time to identify and validate replacement reagents for our assay kits, which could negatively affect our ability to supply assay kits on a timely basis.\nSome reagents are supplied through a single source supplier. This supplier requires a sufficient notification period to allow for supply continuity and the\nidentification and technology transfer to a new supplier in the event either party wishes to terminate the relationship.\nWe actively manage component obsolescence by subscribing to our vendors’ end-of-life notifications. If a vendor is unable to provide sufficient\nnotification, we keep safety stock of the component to minimize disruption to operations\nManufacturing and Supply\nOur manufacturing strategy is to outsource instrument and chip manufacturing and internally develop and assemble reagent kits in our own facility.\nSoftware\nOur fundamental long-term software strategy is based on our goal of making OGM ubiquitous. We believe that simplified data interpretation and a\nseamless integration with NGS and array data to provide the most compressive genome analysis will increase utilization. In addition, we can participate\ndirectly in the NGS and array markets for genetic disease and cancer applications independent of OGM using a monetization model with a pay-per-sample\nNxClinical software offering. In this manner we can expand our network of Bionano customers into our software ecosystem with among the most\ncomprehensive platform-agnostic genome interpretation solution where our proprietary original content in OGM can be adopted when needed to obtain a\nmore comprehensive view of the genome by revealing all classes of SVs.\nTesting and Laboratory Services\nBionano Laboratories’ OGM testing is performed at our lab in San Diego, or at our partner labs in the United States and Europe.

      "text": "Table of Contents\nIntellectual Property\nGenome Analysis\nOur core technology for nucleic acid research is related to methods and devices for non-sequencing based analysis of macromolecules such as nucleic\nacids. Using this technology, long (UHMC) nucleic acids can be suitably labeled and elongated in order to ascertain structural information such as scaffold\norganization, copy number, and genomic repeats that is not readily obtained with current sequencing-based approaches. We recently added a portfolio of\npatents and patent applications related to ITP through the Purigen acquisition, which we plan to continue to pursue and develop. We have secured and\ncontinue to pursue intellectual property rights globally, including rights related to isolation, purification and analysis of nucleic acid molecules, as well as\ninnovations in the molecular biology and bioinformatics spaces. Additionally, our portfolio includes patents and patent applications directed to related parts\nof our business, including certain diagnostic tests and methods of diagnosis and analysis of microarray and image data.\nWe have developed a global patent portfolio that includes more than 160 issued patents or allowed applications across approximately 35 patent families that\nare either owned or exclusively licensed. The owned and licensed patent families contain issued patents and pending applications that relate to devices,\nsystems, and methods for macromolecular analysis, isolation and purification of molecules, genetic testing, computer software systems and reflect our\nactive and ongoing research programs.\nIn addition to pursuing patents, we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality\nagreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, corporate partners and, as applicable, advisors.\nIn addition to a robust and active patent portfolio, we believe that our software and algorithms for analysis, visualization and interpretation of genomic data\nrepresent a valuable asset that we continue to develop and exploit through current and planned software offerings.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business is subject to and impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the United States (at both the federal and state levels)\nand internationally. These include laws and regulations particular to our business and laws and regulations relating to conducting business generally (e.g.,\nexport controls laws, U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws of other jurisdictions). We also are subject to inspections and audits by\ngovernmental agencies. Set forth below are highlights of certain key regulatory schemes applicable to our business. Below are discussions concerning\ngovernment regulation of our Optical Genome Mapping, or OGM, products and services and, separately, the Diagnostic Services performed by Bionano\nLaboratories.\nOptical Genome Mapping\nOur OGM products are currently intended for research use only, or RUO, applications, although our customers may use our products to develop their own\nproducts that are subject to regulation by the FDA. Although most products intended for RUO are not currently subject to clearance or approval by the\nFDA, RUO products fall under the FDA’s jurisdiction if they are used for clinical rather than research purposes. Consequently, our products are labeled\n“For Research Use Only.”\nThe FDA’s 2013 Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff on “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use\nOnly or Investigational Use Only,” or, the RUO/IUO Guidance, provides the FDA’s thinking on when IVD products are properly labeled for RUO or for\nIUO. The RUO/IUO Guidance explains that the FDA will review the totality of the circumstances when evaluating whether equipment and testing\ncomponents are properly labeled as RUO. Merely including a labeling statement that a product is intended for research use only will not necessarily exempt\nthe device from the FDA’s 510(k) clearance, premarket approval, or other requirements, if the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product\nindicate that the manufacturer intends its product to be used for clinical diagnostic use. These circumstances may include written or verbal marketing\nclaims or links to articles regarding a product’s performance in clinical applications, a manufacturer’s provision of technical support for clinical validation\nor clinical applications, or solicitation of business from clinical laboratories, all of which could be considered evidence of intended uses that conflict with\nRUO labeling.\nWhen marketed for clinical diagnostic use, our products will be regulated by the FDA as medical devices. The FDA defines a medical device in part as an\ninstrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article which is intended for the diagnosis of\ndisease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man. FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing,\nmarketing, post-market surveillance, distribution, advertising and labeling of medical devices. The FDA also requires the device to be registered by the\nmedical device manufacturer and listed as a marketed product.\nThe FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes on the basis of the intended use of the device, the risk associated with the use of the device for\nthat indication, as determined by the FDA, and on the controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness.\nClass I devices, which have the lowest level of risk associated\n17"

Class III\ndevices, which have the highest level of risk associated with them, are subject to general controls and premarket approval. Most Class I devices and some\nClass II devices are exempt from a requirement that the manufacturer submit a premarket notification, or 510(k), and receive clearance from the FDA\nwhich is otherwise a premarketing requirement for a Class II device. Class III devices may not be commercialized until a premarket approval application,\nor PMA, is submitted to and approved by the FDA.\n510(k) Clearance Pathway\nTo obtain 510(k) clearance, a sponsor must submit to the FDA a premarket notification demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent, or SE, to a\ndevice legally marketed in the U.S. for which a PMA was not required. The FDA is supposed to make a SE determination within 90 days of FDA’s receipt\nof the 510(k), but it often takes longer if the FDA requests additional information. Most 510(k)s do not require supporting data from clinical trials, but the\nFDA may request such data.\nPremarket Approval Pathway\nA PMA must be submitted if a new device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is generally more complex, costly and time\nconsuming than the 510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trials,\nmanufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After a PMA is\nsufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin an in-depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has\n180 days to review the accepted application, although, review of the application generally can take between one and three years. During this review period,\nthe FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts\nfrom outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the\ndevice. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with its quality system regulations,\nor QSRs. New premarket approval applications or premarket approval application supplements are also required for product modifications that affect the\nsafety and efficacy of the device.\nClinical Trials\nClinical trials are usually required to support a PMA and are sometimes required for a 510(k). In the U.S., if the device is determined to present a\n“significant risk,” the manufacturer may not begin a clinical trial until it submits an investigational device exemption application, or IDE, and obtains\napproval of the IDE from the FDA. These clinical trials are also subject to the review, approval and oversight of an IRB at each clinical trial site. The\nclinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations and good clinical practices. A clinical trial may be suspended by the FDA,\nthe sponsor or an IRB at its institution at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of\nparticipation in the trial. Even if a clinical trial is completed, the results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a device to the satisfaction of the\nFDA, or may be equivocal or otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval of a device.\nAfter a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include among other things:\n•\nCompliance with QSRs, which require manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, record maintenance, including\nmaintenance of complaint and related investigation files, and other quality assurance controls during the manufacturing process;\n•\nReporting of device malfunctions, serious injuries or deaths;\n•\nRegistration of the establishments where the devices are produced and listing of the devices with the FDA;\n•\nLabeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved uses; and\n•\nMedical device reporting obligations, which require that manufacturers investigate and report to the FDA adverse events, including deaths, or\nserious injuries that may have been or were caused by a medical device and malfunctions in the device that would likely cause or contribute to a\ndeath or serious injury if it were to recur.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions, including but not\nlimited to, warning letters; fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; recall or seizure of the device; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown\nof production; refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals of new devices; withdrawal of 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals; and civil or criminal\nprosecution. To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, medical device manufacturers are subject to market surveillance and periodic, pre-\nscheduled and unannounced inspections by the FDA.\n18"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nLaboratory Developed Tests (LDTs)\nFederal agencies involved in the regulation of LDTs include CMS and the FDA. CMS regulates the quality of clinical laboratories and the clinical testing\nprocess pursuant to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) and the FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of the\ndiagnostic test pursuant to authorities in the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Although the FDA has statutory authority to regulate medical\ndevices, the FDA has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the FDCA and FDA regulations with\nrespect to LDTs, which are a subset of in vitro diagnostic tests that are intended for clinical use and designed, manufactured and used entirely within a\nsingle laboratory. The FDA does not consider devices to be LDTs if they are designed or manufactured completely, or partly, outside of the laboratory that\noffers and uses them. We sell our Saphyr system on an RUO basis to CLIA certified cytogenetic laboratories, which may use the system to develop LDTs.\nAt various times since 2006, the FDA has issued documents outlining its intent to require varying levels of FDA oversight of many types of LDTs.\nCongress has also considered legislation that would change how LDTs are regulated. It is unclear at this time if or when the FDA will finalize its plans to\nend enforcement discretion for LDTs, and even then, whether the new regulatory requirements are expected to be phased-in over time. However, the FDA\nmay decide to regulate certain LDTs on a case-by-case basis at any time. A significant change in the way that the FDA regulates any LDTs that we, our\ncollaborators, or our customers develop using our technology could affect our business. If the FDA requires laboratories to undergo premarket review and\ncomply with other applicable FDA requirements in the future, the cost and time required to commercialize an LDT will increase substantially and may\nreduce the financial incentive for laboratories to develop LDTs, which could reduce demand for our instruments and our other products. In addition, if the\nFDA were to change the way that it regulates LDTs to require that we undergo pre-market review or comply with other applicable FDA requirements\nbefore we can sell our instruments or our other products to clinical cytogenetics laboratories, our ability to sell our instruments and other products to this\naddressable market would be delayed, thereby impeding our ability to penetrate this market and generate revenue from sales of our instruments and our\nother products.\nEurope/Rest of World Government Regulation\nWhether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior to the\ncommencement of clinical trials or marketing of our product for clinical diagnostic use in those countries. The regulations in other jurisdictions vary from\nthose in the U.S. and may be easier or more difficult to satisfy and are subject to change. For example, the European Union recently published new\nregulations that will result in greater regulation of medical devices and IVDs. The IVD Regulation is significantly different from the IVD Directive that it\nreplaces in that it will ensure that the new requirements apply uniformly and on the same schedule across the member states, including a risk-based\nclassification system and increasing the requirements for conformity assessment. The conformity assessment process results in the receipt of a CE\ndesignation which has been sufficient to begin marketing many types of IVDs. That process will become more difficult and costly to complete.\nOther Governmental Regulation\nWe are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and\ndisposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. For example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the U.S. This includes\nrequirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, including preventing or\nminimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries. For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as\nhazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health\nService, the U.S. Postal Service and the International Air Transport Association. We generally use third-party vendors to dispose of regulated medical\nwaste, hazardous waste and radioactive materials that we may use during our research.\nLaboratories that purchase certain of our OGM products and perform clinical diagnostic testing are also subject to extensive regulation under the Clinical\nLaboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, requiring clinical laboratories to meet specified standards in areas such as personnel\nqualifications, administration, participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. Adverse\ninterpretations of current CLIA regulations or future changes in CLIA regulations could have an adverse effect on sales of any affected products. Moreover,\nif we decide to operate our own clinical testing laboratory with respect to our OGM products, such clinical testing would require compliance with CLIA. If,\nin the future, we operate our own clinical laboratory to perform clinical diagnostic testing with respect to our OGM products, such activities would become\nsubject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and its corresponding regulations, as well as additional federal and\nstate laws that impose a variety of fraud and abuse prohibitions on healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories.\n19"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nCoverage and Reimbursement\nCurrently, our OGM products are for research use only, but clinical laboratories may acquire our instrumentation through a capital purchase or capital lease\nand use the Saphyr system and direct label and stain chemistry to create their own diagnostic tests and potentially seek reimbursement for such tests. Our\ncustomers may generate revenue for these testing services by seeking the necessary approval of their product from the FDA or CMS, along with coverage\nand reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health programs and private health plans. The ability of our customers to commercialize\ndiagnostic tests based on our technology will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these tests will be available from such\nthird-party payors.\nIn the U.S., molecular testing laboratories have multiple options for reimbursement coding, but we expect that the primary codes used will be the genomic\nsequencing procedure codes, or GSPs. The American Medical Association, or AMA, added GSPs to its clinical laboratory fee schedule in 2015. In\naddition, CMS issued a coverage determination providing for the reimbursement of next-generation sequencing for certain cancer diagnostics using an\nFDA-approved in vitro diagnostic test. Private health plans often follow CMS coverage and reimbursement guidelines to a substantial degree, and it is\ndifficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement of any products or services our customers try to commercialize.\nIn Europe, coverage for molecular diagnostic testing is varied. Countries with statutory health insurance (e.g., Germany, France, The Netherlands) tend to\nbe more progressive in technology adoption with favorable reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing. In countries such as the United Kingdom with\ntax-based insurance, adoption and reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing is not uniform and is influenced by local budgets.\nUltimately, coverage and reimbursement of new products and services is uncertain, and whether laboratories that use our instruments to develop their own\nproducts or services will attain coverage and adequate reimbursement is unknown. In the U.S., there is no uniform policy for determining coverage and\nreimbursement. Coverage can differ from payor to payor, and the process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage may be separate from the\nprocess for setting the reimbursement rate. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in\nimplementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls and restrictions on\nreimbursement.\nDiagnostic Services\nClinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and State Regulation\nAs a clinical laboratory, Bionano Laboratories is required to hold certain federal and state licenses, certifications and permits to conduct is business. As to\nfederal certifications, in 1988, Congress passed the CLIA, establishing more rigorous quality standards for all commercial laboratories that perform testing\non human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease or the assessment of the health or\nimpairment of human beings. CLIA requires such laboratories to be certified by the federal government and mandates compliance with various operational,\npersonnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test\nresults. CLIA certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to bill state and federal healthcare programs, as well as many commercial third-party payers,\nfor laboratory testing services. Both of Bionano Laboratories’ facilities, one located in Salt Lake City, Utah and the other in San Diego, California are\nCLIA certified. These laboratories must comply with all applicable CLIA requirements. If a clinical laboratory is found to be out of compliance with CLIA\nstandards, CMS may impose sanctions, limit or revoke the laboratory’s CLIA certificate (and prohibit the owner, operator or laboratory director from\nowning, operating, or directing a laboratory for two years following license revocation), a directed plan of correction, on-site monitoring, civil monetary\npenalties, civil actions for injunctive relief, criminal penalties, or suspension or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nCLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory licensure requirements and regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law and requires\ncompliance with such laws and regulations. The State of Utah follows all CLIA regulations for laboratory facility and personnel requirements. Utah does\nnot have any additional licensure and regulations. The State of California follows CLIA regulations for in-state laboratory facilities, but requires additional\nlicensing requirements for laboratory personnel established by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). CAP accreditation for the San Diego\nfacility is pending.\nAdditionally, certain states require clinical laboratories to obtain out-of-state licenses to test specimens from patients, or to receive orders from physicians,\nwithin those states. Our Salt Lake City facility currently holds such out-of-state laboratory licenses in Pennsylvania and Maryland.\n20"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nHIPAA and other Privacy Laws\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), established comprehensive federal standards for the privacy and security of\nhealth information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations: health plans, healthcare clearing houses, and healthcare providers that\nconduct certain healthcare transactions electronically (“Covered Entities”). Title II of HIPAA, the Administrative Simplification Act, contains provisions\nthat address the privacy of health data, the security of health data, the standardization of identifying numbers used in the healthcare system and the\nstandardization of certain healthcare transactions. The privacy regulations protect medical records and other protected health information by, among other\nthings, limiting their use and release, giving patients the right to access their medical records and limiting most disclosures of health information to the\nminimum amount necessary to accomplish an intended purpose. The HIPAA security standards require the adoption of administrative, physical, and\ntechnical safeguards and the adoption of written security policies and procedures.\nOn February 17, 2009, Congress enacted Subtitle D of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, provisions\nof the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. HITECH expanded and strengthened HIPAA, created new targets for enforcement, imposed new\npenalties for noncompliance and established new breach notification requirements for Covered Entities. Regulations implementing major provisions of\nHITECH were finalized on January 25, 2013 through publication of the HIPAA Omnibus Rule (the “Omnibus Rule”).\nUnder HITECH's breach notification requirements, Covered Entities must report breaches of protected health information that has not been encrypted or\notherwise secured in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the “Secretary”). Required\nbreach notices must be made as soon as is reasonably practicable, but no later than 60 days following discovery of the breach. Reports must be made to\naffected individuals and to the Secretary and, in some cases depending on the size of the breach, they must be reported through local and national media.\nBreach reports can lead to investigation, enforcement and civil litigation, including class action lawsuits.\nAs a result of the clinical diagnostic services offered by Bionano Laboratories, Bionano Laboratories, is currently subject to HIPAA and maintains an active\ncompliance program that is designed to identify security incidents and other issues in a timely fashion and enable us to remediate, mitigate harm or report if\nrequired by law. Bionano Laboratories is subject to prosecution and/or administrative enforcement and increased civil and criminal penalties for non-\ncompliance, including a new, four-tiered system of monetary penalties adopted under HITECH. Bionano Laboratories is also subject to enforcement by\nstate attorneys general who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH. To mitigate penalties under the HITECH breach notification\nprovisions, Bionano Laboratories must ensure that breaches of protected health information are promptly detected and reported within the company, so that\nBionano Laboratories can make all required notifications on a timely basis. However, even if Bionano Laboratories makes required reports on a timely\nbasis, Bionano Laboratories may still be subject to penalties for the underlying breach.\nIn addition to the federal privacy and security regulations, there are a number of state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information and\npersonal data that are applicable to our clinical laboratories. Many states have also implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient\nconsent requirements and protecting test results by strictly limiting the disclosure of those results. State requirements are particularly stringent regarding\npredictive genetic tests, due to the risk of genetic discrimination against healthy patients identified through testing as being at a high risk for disease. We\nbelieve that we have taken the steps required of us to comply with health information privacy and security statutes and regulations, including genetic\ntesting and genetic information privacy laws in all jurisdictions, both state and federal. However, these laws constantly change, and we may not be able to\nmaintain compliance in all jurisdictions where we do business. Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal laws regarding privacy or\nsecurity could result in civil and/or criminal penalties, significant reputational damage and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which applies to all EU member states from May 25, 2018, also applies to some of our operations. The\nGDPR is discussed in more detail elsewhere in this report. The GDPR applies not only to organizations within the EU, but also applies to organizations\noutside of the EU that offer goods or services to EU data subjects or that process or hold personal data of EU data subjects. Additionally, from January 1,\n2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom GDPR (“UK GDPR”), which, together with the amended United\nKingdom Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in the United Kingdom national law. Both the GDPR and the UK GDPR regulations specify\npotential liabilities for certain data protection violations, and we anticipate that it will result in a greater compliance burden for us as we conduct our\nbusiness in the European Union. Fines for non-compliance can range from the greater of 2% of annual global revenues or €10 million, up to the greater of\n4% of annual global revenues or €20 million. The GDPR is discussed in more detail under the heading “International Regulations” below.\n21"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nReimbursement and Billing\nReimbursement and billing for diagnostic services is highly complex. Laboratories must bill various payors, such as private third-party payors, including\nmanaged care organizations (“MCO”), and state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and each may have different billing\nrequirements. Additionally, the audit requirements Bionano Laboratories must meet to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as\nour internal compliance policies and procedures, add further complexity to the billing process. Other factors that complicate billing include:\n•\nvariability in coverage and information requirements among various payors;\n•\npatient financial assistance programs;\n•\nmissing, incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians;\n•\nbillings to payors with whom we do not have contracts;\n•\ndisputes with payors as to which party is responsible for payment; and\n•\ndisputes with payors as to the appropriate level of reimbursement.\nDepending on the reimbursement arrangement and applicable law, the party that reimburses us for our services may be:\n•\na third-party who provides coverage to the patient, such as an insurance company or MCO;\n•\na state or federal healthcare program; or\n•\nthe patient.\nPresently, approximately 90% of the diagnostic service revenue for Bionano Laboratories is paid by private third-party payors.\nFederal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws\nA variety of state and federal laws prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws\nare interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including CMS, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector\nGeneral for the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”), and various state agencies. In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs\nincreasingly use a variety of contractors to review claims data and to identify improper payments as well as fraud and abuse. Any overpayments must be\nrepaid within 60 days of identification unless a favorable decision is obtained on appeal. In some cases, these overpayments can be used as the basis for an\nextrapolation, by which the error rate is applied to a larger set of claims, and which can result in even higher repayments.\nAnti-Kickback Laws\nThe Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration,\ndirectly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service\nthat is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program. “Remuneration” is broadly defined to include anything of monetary value, such\nas, for example, cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, or the furnishing of services, supplies or equipment. The Anti-Kickback Statute can be\ninterpreted broadly to prohibit many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry.\nRecognizing the potential breadth of interpretation of the Anti-Kickback Statute and the fact that it may technically prohibit many otherwise innocuous or\nbeneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the OIG has issued a series of regulations, or safe harbors intended to protect such arrangements.\nCompliance with all requirements of a safe harbor immunizes the parties to the business arrangement from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute.\nThe failure of a business arrangement to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the arrangement is illegal or that the OIG will pursue\nprosecution but would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Still, in the absence of an applicable safe harbor, a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may\noccur even if only one purpose of an arrangement is to induce referrals. The penalties for violating the Anti-Kickback Statute can be severe. These\nsanctions include criminal, civil and administrative penalties, imprisonment and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. Many states have\nadopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, and some apply to items and services reimbursable by any payor, including private third-party payors.\nFurther, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018, or EKRA, prohibits payments for referrals to recovery homes, clinical treatment facilities, and\nlaboratories. EKRA’s reach extends beyond federal health care programs to include private insurance (i.e., it is an “all payor” statute). For purposes of\nEKRA, the term “laboratory” is defined broadly and without reference to any connection to substance use disorder treatment. The law includes a limited\nnumber of exceptions, some of which closely align with corresponding federal Anti-Kickback Statute exceptions and safe harbors, and others that\nmaterially differ.\n22"

Several Stark Law exceptions are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including\nbut not limited to: (1) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; (2) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical\nlaboratory services; (3) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that satisfy certain requirements; and (4) personal services arrangements. Penalties\nfor violating the Stark Law include the return of funds received for all prohibited referrals, fines, civil monetary penalties and possible exclusion from\nfederal health care programs. In addition to the Stark Law, many states have their own self-referral bans, which may extend to all self-referrals, regardless\nof the payor.\nState and Federal Prohibitions on False Claims\nThe federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or\nfraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. Under the False Claims Act, a person acts knowingly if he or she has actual knowledge of the\ninformation or acts in deliberate ignorance or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information. Specific intent to defraud is not required. The\nqui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the federal government and to share in any amounts\npaid by the defendant to the government in connection with the action. Penalties include payment of up to three times the actual damages sustained by the\ngovernment, plus significant civil penalties, as well as possible exclusion from federal health care programs. In addition, various states have enacted similar\nlaws modeled after the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state health care programs, and, in several\nstates, such laws apply to claims submitted to any payor.\nCivil Monetary Penalties Law\nThe federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, or the CMP Law, prohibits, among other things, (1) the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or\nstate health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider,\npractitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies; (2) employing or contracting with\nan individual or entity that the provider knows or should know is excluded from participation in a federal health care program; (3) billing for services\nrequested by an unlicensed physician or an excluded provider; and (4) billing for medically unnecessary services. The penalties for violating the CMP Law\ninclude exclusion, substantial fines, and payment of up to three times the amount billed, depending on the nature of the offense.\nPenalties\nFailure to comply with the aforementioned fraud and abuse laws could result in significant penalties, including civil, criminal, and administrative penalties,\ndamages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs,\nadditional integrity oversight and reporting obligations, imprisonment, contractual damages, and reputational harm. If any of the physicians or other\nhealthcare providers or entities with whom we do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or\nadministrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nInternational Regulations\nWe market some of our tests outside of the United States and are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing laboratory licensure, human clinical\ntesting, use of tissue, privacy and data security, and marketing approval for our tests. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the\nUnited States and may require us to implement additional compliance measures or perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing. For example, the In\nVitro Diagnostic Medical Devices (2017/746/EU) (“IVDR”) will replace the existing In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive (98/79/EC) (“IVDD”)\nin the European Union (“EU”). The IVDR was published in May 2017, marking the start of a five-year period of transition from the IVDD. During the\ntransitional period the IVDR will come into force gradually, starting with the provisions related to the designation of Notified Bodies and the ability of\nmanufacturers to apply for new certificates under the IVDR. The transitional period will end on 26 May 2022, the “Date of Application” (“DoA”) of the\nRegulation. From that point the IVDR will apply fully. The EU has also implemented the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which requires us\nto meet new and more stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data about European Union residents. In many countries outside of the\nUnited States, coverage, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required. We are also required to maintain accurate information on and control over\nsales and distributors’ activities that may fall within the purview of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery\nprovisions.\n23"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nOther Regulatory Requirements\nOur laboratories, and the laboratories of Bionano Laboratories, are subject to federal, state and local regulations relating to the handling and disposal of\nregulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste, including chemical, biological agents and compounds, blood and bone marrow samples\nand other human tissue. Typically, we use outside vendors who are contractually obligated to comply with applicable laws and regulations to dispose of\nsuch waste. These vendors are licensed or otherwise qualified to handle and dispose of such waste.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and\ndisposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. For example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration (“OSHA”) has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the U.S. This\nincludes requirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, including preventing\nor minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries. For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as\nhazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health\nService, the United States Postal Service, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the International Air Transport Association. We generally use third-\nparty vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and radioactive materials and contractually require them to comply with applicable\nlaws and regulations.\nHealthcare Reform\nIn the U.S. and abroad, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs and change the way healthcare is\nfinanced. By way of example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education\nReconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, became law. The ACA is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the\ngrowth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance\nindustries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.\nThere have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, President Trump signed several Executive\nOrders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for\nhealth insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation to repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While\nCongress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA, such as removing penalties,\neffective January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court\ndismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by\nCongress. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the\nhealthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.\nFurther, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed\nthe Inflation Reduction Act into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA\nmarketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the coverage gap under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly\nlowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and through a newly established manufacturer discount program. In addition, on April 1, 2014, the\nProtecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, was signed into law, which, among other things, significantly altered the payment methodology\nunder the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS. PAMA requires certain laboratories performing clinical diagnostic laboratory tests to\nreport to CMS the amounts paid by private payors for laboratory tests. Beginning on January 1, 2018, CMS has begun using reported private payor pricing\nto periodically revise payment rates under the CLFS. Based on current law, between January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2023, applicable laboratories will be\nrequired to report on data collected during January 1, 2019 and June 30, 2019. This data will be utilized to determine 2024 to 2026 CLFS rates.\nWe expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and\nstate governments will pay for healthcare products and services. In addition, sales of our tests outside of the U.S. will subject us to foreign regulatory\nrequirements, which may also change over time.\nAcquisitions\nWe acquired BioDiscovery in October 2021 and Purigen in November 2022. For a further discussion of these acquisitions, please refer to Note 14,\nAcquisitions, to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 405 employees, of which 168 work in sales, sales support and marketing, 130 work in research and development, and\n107 work in general and administrative.

The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. The occurrence of any of\nthe following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our securities could decline. This Annual\nReport also contains forward-looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those\nanticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below.\nRisks related to our financial condition and need for additional capital\nWe are an early commercial-stage company and have a limited commercial history, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and\npredict our future performance.\nWe are an early commercial-stage company and have a limited commercial history. Our limited commercial history may make it difficult to evaluate our\ncurrent business and, especially when combined with the other risk factors listed in this section, makes predictions about our future success or viability\nsubject to significant uncertainty. In particular, we have significantly increased our headcount through recent acquisitions of other businesses and the\nexpansion of our sales, marketing and research and development teams, which has increased our operating costs in a manner not historically reflected in\nour unaudited consolidated financial statements, and plan to further increase headcount as we expand our operations. Because our business model has\nevolved over time, and combined with our recent acquisitions, this has impacted the composition and concentration of our revenues, which we expect to\ncontinue to change with any future acquisitions and further expansion of our operations. These changes, among others, may make it difficult to evaluate our\ncurrent business, assess our future performance relative to prior performance and accurately predict our future performance. We have encountered in the\npast, and will continue to encounter in the future, risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early commercial-stage companies, including those\nassociated with scaling up our infrastructure, increasing the size of our organization and integrating acquired businesses.

We cannot be certain that we will achieve or\nsustain profitability.\nSince our inception, we have incurred recurring net losses. We incurred net losses of $132.6 million and $72.4 million, and used cash in operations of\n$124.8 million and $71.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit\nof $348.7 million.We cannot predict if we will be profitable in the near future or at all. We expect that our losses will continue for the foreseeable future as\nwe plan to invest significant additional funds toward the expansion of our commercial organization, research and development efforts and capital\nexpenditures, among other things. Our recent acquisitions have increased our expenses and we expect that any future acquisitions of businesses, assets,\nproducts or technologies will further increase our expenses, which may result in additional losses. We also expect significant increases in our stock-based\ncompensation expense in future periods, reflecting higher stock option valuations as a public company and the issuance of additional equity awards due to\nincreased headcount. In addition, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a result of being a public company, especially as we no\nlonger qualify as an emerging growth company and are therefore required to comply with additional disclosure and compliance requirements. These\nfactors, among others, will make it hard for us to achieve and sustain profitability. We may also incur significant losses in the future for a number of other\nreasons, many of which are beyond our control, including the level of market acceptance of our products, the introduction of competitive products and\ntechnologies, our future product development efforts, our market penetration and our margins, as well as the other risks described below.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results and cash flows have fluctuated in the past and might continue to fluctuate, which makes our future\noperating results difficult to predict and could cause the market price of our securities to decline substantially.\nNumerous factors, many of which are outside our control, may cause or contribute to significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results.\nThese fluctuations may make financial planning and forecasting uncertain and may result in unanticipated decreases in our available cash, which could\nnegatively affect our business and prospects. In addition, one or more of such factors may cause our revenue or operating expenses in one period to be\ndisproportionately higher or lower relative to the other periods. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis might not be\nmeaningful. You should not rely on our past results as indicative of our future performance. Moreover, our stock price might be based on expectations of\nfuture performance that are unrealistic or that we might not meet and, if our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or\nsecurities analysts, the price of our securities could decline substantially.\nOur operating results have varied in the past. In addition to other risk factors listed in this section, some of the important factors that, alone or together, may\ncause fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results include:\n•\nadoption of our OGM solutions on our Saphyr system, Ionic Purification system or successor systems;\n•\nour successful creation of an end-to-end solution for OGM;\n•\nthe successful integration of our Bionano Laboratories, BioDiscovery and Purigen businesses;\n•\nexecution on our commercial and reimbursement strategy involving Bionano Laboratories;\n•\ncustomer demand for current BioDiscovery software solutions, including NxClinical software, and future software solutions developed through\nBioDiscovery’s platform;\n•\nthe position of our Purigen business in the DNA isolation space of genome analysis and customer demand for our Ionic Purification system;\n•\nthe timing of customer orders and payments and our ability to recognize revenue;\n•\nthe rate of utilization of consumables by our customers;\n•\nreductions in or other difficulties relating to staffing, capacity, shutdowns or slowdowns of laboratories and other institutions in our customer base,\nsuch as reduced or delayed investment in new technologies or spending on products, technologies or consumables;\n•\ndifferences in purchasing patterns across our customer base, including potential differences in consumables spending between earlier adopters of\nour technologies and more recent customers and variances in rates of increase of consumables spending following new technology purchases;\n26"

Accordingly, unexpected revenue shortfalls could decrease our gross margins and\ncause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter. If this occurs, the trading price of our securities could fall substantially. This\nvariability and unpredictability caused by factors such as those described above and elsewhere in this section could also result in our failing to meet the\nexpectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or\ninvestors or below any guidance we may provide, or if the guidance we provide is below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our securities\ncould decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met or exceeded any previously publicly stated guidance or\nexpectations.\nIf we are unable to maintain adequate revenue growth or do not successfully manage such growth, our business and growth prospects will be harmed.\nWe may not achieve substantial growth rates in future periods. Investors should not rely on our operating results for any prior periods as an indication of\nour future operating performance. To effectively manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to maintain and enhance our financial,\naccounting, manufacturing, customer support and sales administration systems, processes and controls, and to integrate such systems, processes and\ncontrols into our newly acquired businesses. Failure to effectively manage our anticipated growth could lead us to over-invest or under-invest in\ndevelopment, operational and administrative infrastructure; result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems, or controls; give rise to operational\nmistakes, losses, loss of customers, productivity or business opportunities; and result in loss of employees and reduced productivity of remaining\nemployees.\nOur continued growth could require significant capital expenditures and might divert financial resources from other projects such as the development or\nintegration of new products, technologies and services. As additional products and technologies are commercialized, we may need to incorporate new\nequipment, implement new technology systems, or hire new personnel with different qualifications. Failure to manage this growth or transition could result\nin turnaround time delays, higher product costs, declining product quality, deteriorating customer service, and slower responses to competitive challenges.\nA failure in any one of these areas could make it difficult for us to meet market expectations for our products and technologies, and could damage our\nreputation and the prospects for our business.\nIf our management is unable to effectively manage our anticipated growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our revenue could decline or\ngrow more slowly than expected and we may be unable to implement our business strategy. The quality of our products, technologies and services may\nsuffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract customers.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may require additional funding in the future to advance the commercialization of our Saphyr system,\nIonic Purification system, NxClinical software, and our other products, technologies and services, as well as continue our research and development\nefforts. If we fail to obtain additional funding, we will be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our commercialization and development efforts.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since our inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts of cash in order to\ncontinue the commercialization of our products and technologies, fund our research and development programs, expand headcount and execute potential\nstrategic transactions. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we performed an analysis\nof our ability to continue as a going concern. We believe, based on our current business plan, that our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be\nsufficient for the next twelve months from the issuance of this report. Our ability to execute our operating plan depends on our ability to generate sales and\nobtain additional funding through equity offerings, debt financings or potential licensing and collaboration arrangements.

We have limited shares of our common stock currently available and authorized for issuance. Investors in prior transactions\nhave purchased our shares of common stock or our convertible securities, such as warrants, for which we must reserve unissued shares of our common\nstock. We therefore will likely need to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock, which requires stockholder approval, in order to\nissue shares of our common stock or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable into shares of our common stock to investors and other strategic\npartners, in capital raising transactions. If our trading price does not increase or if we are unable to increase the authorized shares of our common stock, we\nwill be limited in our efforts to raise additional capital. As a result, our operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nUnfavorable geopolitical and macroeconomic developments could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy, the global financial markets and adverse geopolitical and\nmacroeconomic developments, including without limitation inflation, slowing growth, rising interest rates and recession. A severe or prolonged global\neconomic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business. For example, inflation rates, particularly in the United States, have increased recently\nto levels not seen in years, and increased inflation may result in decreased demand for our products and services, increases in our operating costs (including\nour labor costs), prolonged unemployment, reduced liquidity and limits on our ability to access credit or otherwise raise capital on acceptable terms, if at\nall. In addition, the Federal Reserve has raised, and may again raise, interest rates in response to concerns about inflation, which coupled with reduced\ngovernment spending and volatility in financial markets may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks. Risks\nof a prolonged global economic downturn are particularly true in Europe, which is undergoing a continued severe economic crisis. A weak or declining\neconomy, regardless of the reason for the decline, could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption. Any actual or perceived disruption\nin our product distribution channel could alter customer buying decisions, prompting customers to delay or cancel their orders, which would negatively\nimpact our sales revenue and could harm our reputation. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, customers that committed to order minimum\nquantities of consumables or to purchase our Saphyr instrument delayed such commitments. In addition, we anticipate that ongoing disruptions in our\nsupply chain due to lingering COVID-19 and general macroeconomic effects may cause shortages in the materials required to operate our instruments,\ntherefore limiting our ability to process customer samples and the ability of users of our systems to operate our system. We have experienced supply chain\ndisruptions, some of which have delayed shipment of products to our customers. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all\nof the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nAdditionally, following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, financial markets around the world experienced volatility. In response to the invasion, the\nUnited States, United Kingdom and European Union, along with others, imposed significant new sanctions and export controls against Russia, Russian\nbanks and certain Russian individuals and may implement additional sanctions or take further punitive actions in the future. The full economic and social\nimpact of the sanctions imposed on Russia (as well as possible future punitive measures that may be implemented), as well as the counter measures\nimposed by Russia, in addition to the ongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which could conceivably expand into the surrounding region,\nremains uncertain; however, both the conflict and related sanctions have resulted, and could continue to result in disruptions to trade, commerce, pricing\nstability, credit availability, supply chain continuity and reduced access to liquidity, in both Europe and globally, and has introduced significant uncertainty\ninto global markets. In particular, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has contributed to rapidly rising costs of living (driven largely by higher energy prices) in\nEurope and other advanced economies. As the adverse effects of this conflict continue to develop and potentially spread, both in Europe and throughout the\nrest of the world, our customers may be negatively impacted, which in turn may cause them to delay purchasing decisions and otherwise depress the level\nof spend conducted by such customers for our products, technologies and services. Further, a weak or declining economy could strain our suppliers,\npossibly resulting in additional supply disruption. As a result, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the ongoing conflict\nbetween Ukraine and Russia and related sanctions, particularly to the extent it escalates to involve additional countries, further economic sanctions or wider\nmilitary conflict. We have operations, as well as current and potential new customers throughout Europe.

Such health crises could also affect the business or operations of our research partners, customers and other third\nparties with whom we conduct business. In particular, the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and government measures taken in response have\nhad significant impacts, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as significant reductions in business-related activities have occurred, supply\nchains have been disrupted, manufacturing and clinical development activities have been curtailed or suspended and enrollment in studies has been limited\nor made more difficult. Continued remote work policies, quarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders, shutdowns or other restrictions, or the\nperception of such orders, shutdowns, or other restrictions have materially affected and may continue to materially affect how we, our customers, and our\nsuppliers are operating our businesses.\nAs public health directives surrounding the pandemic have relaxed, we have modified our work-from-home policies for certain employees and certain of\nour business practices, including reopening our offices and permitting travel and in-person events, taking into consideration government restrictions,\nemployee safety and health risks. Our approach may vary among geographies depending on appropriate health protocols, and may change at any time.\nAdditionally, our efforts to reopen our offices safely may not be successful, could expose our employees to health risks, and could involve additional costs\nor liability. To the extent our employees are exposed to or become ill with COVID-19, our ability to conduct our global and domestic operations may be\nimpaired from time to time. For example, we experienced at various times during the pandemic the inability to visit certain customer sites to support\ninstallation of, training on or service to our OGM systems. As a result, in the past, we have had to delay instrument installations or service related visits.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also have long-term effects on the nature of the office environment and remote working, which may present strategy,\noperational, talent recruiting and retention, worker productivity and efficiency, and workplace culture challenges that may adversely affect our business.\nFurthermore, our remote workforce poses increased risks to our information technology systems and data as more of our personnel leverage resources not\nnecessarily within our control.\nIn connection with our Bionano Laboratories diagnostic services, COVID-19 poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, courier\ndelivery services and other partners may be prevented from conducting business activities, including due to, among other things, spread of the disease\nwithin these groups or shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. The continued spread of COVID-19 and the measures\ntaken by the governments of countries affected could disrupt the supply chain of materials needed for our diagnostic tests, interrupt our ability to receive\nspecimens, impair our ability to perform or deliver the results from our tests, impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services causing a decrease\nin test volumes, delay coverage decisions from Medicare and third-party payors, delay ongoing and planned clinical studies involving our tests, negatively\naffect enrollment in our ongoing or future studies, cause us to make strategic determinations regarding, among other things, the cost and quality of the\ncomponents and supplies we acquire, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example,\nCOVID-19 related disruptions to the global supply chain created challenges in getting sufficient components and raw materials for production of our OGM\nsystems and consumables, as well as resulted, at least in part, in unfavorable flowcell yields in 2021 and part of 2022. If the pandemic persists, these\ndisruptions could reoccur or persist.\nAs global economic conditions recover, business activity may not recover as quickly as anticipated or at all, and it is not possible at this time to estimate the\nlong-term impacts that these factors could have on our business, or the global economy as a whole, as the impact will depend on future developments,\nwhich are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Conditions will be subject to the effectiveness of government policies, including vaccine mandates,\nvaccine shortages and administration rates, the emergence of new strains or variants of the virus in markets and communities where we, our customers, and\nour suppliers are operating our business and other factors that are not foreseeable. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. In addition, these factors may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow,\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\nNew income, sales, use, excise or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness operations and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified\nor applied adversely to us. For example, legislation informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act;\nand the Inflation Reduction Act enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Future guidance from the Internal Revenue Service and other tax\nauthorities with respect to such legislation may affect us, and certain aspects of such legislation could be repealed or modified in future legislation. These\ndevelopments, along with any other future changes in U.S. tax laws could have a material impact on the value\n30"

In addition, it is uncertain if and to\nwhat extent various states will conform to federal tax legislation.\nMoreover, should the scale of our international business activities expand, any changes in the U.S. taxation of such activities or any other changes in\napplicable non-U.S. tax laws could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our future financial position and results of operations. Limitations\non the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the U.S. are repatriated\nto the U.S., as well as changes to United States tax laws that may be enacted in the future, could impact the tax treatment of future foreign earnings.\nOur ability to use net operating losses and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income and taxes may be subject to limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of $463.8 million and $197.6 million, respectively. The federal tax\nloss carryforwards include $282.9 million that do not expire, but utilization of such tax loss carryforwards is limited to 80% of our taxable income. The\nremaining federal tax loss carryforwards of $180.9 million and state tax loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2027 and 2023, respectively, unless\npreviously utilized. As of December  31, 2022, we also had federal and California research credit carryforwards of $9.4 million and $8.8 million,\nrespectively. The federal research credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2027 unless previously utilized. The California research credits carry forward\nindefinitely.\nIn addition, utilization of our net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to limitations due to ownership\nchanges that have occurred or that could occur in the future in accordance with applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,\nand corresponding provisions of state law. We may have experienced one or more ownership changes in the past and we may also experience additional\nownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent changes in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership\nchange occurs and our ability to use our net operating loss or research and development credit carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future\noperating results by increasing our future tax obligations. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of net operating loss\ncarryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our results of\noperation could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market\nprice of our securities.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical\nexperience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making\njudgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions\nunderlying our estimates and judgements relating to our critical accounting policies change or if actual circumstances differ from our assumptions,\nestimates or judgements, our operating results may be adversely affected and could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of\nsecurities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our securities.\nRisks related to our business operations\nAcquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic transactions could disrupt or otherwise harm our business and may cause dilution to our stockholders.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have acquired and may continue to acquire other businesses, products or technologies as well as pursue strategic\nalliances, joint ventures, technology licenses or investments in complementary businesses or assets. We may not be able to locate or make suitable\nacquisitions on acceptable terms, and future acquisitions may not be effectively and profitably integrated into our business. Our failure to successfully\ncomplete the integration of any business or assets that we acquire could have an adverse effect on our prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial\ncondition, results of operations and stock price. Integration challenges may include the following:\n•\ndisruption in our relationships with our pre-acquisition customers, distributors or suppliers, or in the relationships of our acquired businesses with\ntheir pre-acquisition customers, distributors or suppliers, as a result of such a transaction;\n•\nunanticipated expenses and liabilities related to acquired companies or assets;\n•\ndisputes with the seller(s) of any acquired companies or assets or litigation with the seller(s) or third parties resulting from acquired companies or\nassets;\n•\ndifficulties integrating acquired personnel, technologies, operations and legal compliance obligations into our existing business;\n31"

Such transactions could harm our operating results and cash position, negatively affect the price of our\nstock and cause dilution to our current stockholders. For example, in connection with our acquisition of Lineagen, a U.S.-based provider of proprietary\nmolecular diagnostics services for individuals presenting with certain neurodevelopmental disorders, we issued 6.2 million shares of our common stock, in\nour acquisition of BioDiscovery, a U.S.-based software company with solutions for analysis, interpretation and reporting of genomics data, we paid upfront\nconsideration consisting of a combination of approximately $52.3 million in cash and 2.7 million shares of our common stock, and in our acquisition of\nPurigen, a U.S-based DNA and RNA extraction company, we paid upfront consideration of approximately $32.0 million in cash. In connection with the\nacquisition of BioDiscovery, we issued an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock subject to vesting based on continued service of a key\nemployee. These shares vested in full on October 4, 2022.\nThe issuances of shares in connection with the Lineagen and BioDiscovery acquisitions resulted in dilution to our existing stockholders, the payment of\ncash in the BioDiscovery acquisition reduced our cash by approximately $52.3 million, the payment of cash in the Purigen acquisition reduced our cash by\napproximately $32.0 million, our headcount increased by more than 75 employees as a result of all three acquisitions, and we acquired new leases in each\nacquisition. Accordingly, in addition to transaction costs, these acquisitions have increased our operating expenses, further increasing our net losses. We\ncannot predict the number, timing or size of any future strategic transactions, or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating results.\nAlthough we conducted extensive business, financial and legal due diligence in connection with our evaluation of our recent acquisitions, our due diligence\ninvestigations may not have identified every matter that could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, and such\ninvestigations may have identified matters that, in the opinion of our management based on information available at the time, bore an acceptable level of\nrisk that they, individually or in the aggregate, might or might not adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. We may be unable\nto adequately address the financial, legal and operational risks introduced by our recent acquisitions and may have difficulty developing experience with\nthe industries in which Lineagen, BioDiscovery and/or Purigen operate. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that our recent acquisitions will yield the results\nwe have anticipated and unforeseen complexities and expenses may arise. In addition, we may not achieve the revenues, growth prospects and synergies\nexpected from these recent acquisitions, and any such benefits we do achieve may not offset our increased costs, resulting in a potential impairment of\ngoodwill or other assets that were acquired. For any future acquisitions, we may similarly be unable to achieve revenue, growth prospects and synergies in\na manner consistent with our expectations. Our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf our products or technologies fail to achieve and sustain sufficient market acceptance, our revenue will be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to develop and market products and technologies that are recognized and accepted as reliable, enabling and cost-\neffective. Most of the potential customers for our products and technologies already use expensive research systems in their laboratories that they have used\nfor many years and may be reluctant to replace those systems with ours. Market acceptance of our systems will depend on many factors, including our\nability to demonstrate to potential customers that our technology is an attractive alternative to existing technologies. Compared to some competing\ntechnologies, our technology is new and complex, and many potential customers have limited knowledge of, or experience with, our products and\ntechnologies. Prior to adopting our systems, some potential customers may need to devote time and effort to testing and validating our systems. Any failure\nof our systems to meet these customer benchmarks could result in potential customers choosing to retain their existing systems or to purchase systems other\nthan ours. In addition, it is important that our gene mapping and DNA isolation systems be perceived as accurate and reliable by the scientific and medical\nresearch community as a whole.\n32"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nThe scientific community is comprised of a small number of early adopters and key opinion leaders who significantly influence the rest of the community.\nHistorically, a significant part of our sales and marketing efforts has been directed at demonstrating the advantages of our technology to industry leaders,\nincluding those key opinion leaders, and encouraging such leaders to publish or present the results of their evaluation of our system. If we are unable to\ncontinue to motivate leading researchers to use our technology, or if such researchers are unable to achieve or unwilling to publish or present significant\nexperimental results using our systems, acceptance and adoption of our systems will be slowed and our ability to increase our revenue would be adversely\naffected. We also run the risk that researchers may produce publications or presentations with findings that are negative about our technologies or systems,\nand that such findings may be due to factors outside of our control, which may also slow acceptance and adoption of our systems and adversely affect our\nability to increase our revenue.\nEquity issuances in connection with strategic transactions or raising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders or restrict our\noperations.\nFrom time to time, we expect to finance our strategic transactions or cash needs through a combination of equity and debt financings. To the extent that we\nfinance our strategic transactions or raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest could be\ndiluted and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt\nfinancing may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt,\nmaking capital expenditures or declaring dividends and may be secured by all or a portion of our assets.\nFor example, in January 2021, we completed two underwritten public offerings pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of approximately 71.7 million\nshares of our common stock for gross proceeds, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, of approximately $331.8\nmillion. In March 2021, we entered into an at-the-market facility with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, which provides for the sale, in our sole\ndiscretion, of shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $350.0 million through or to Cowen, acting as sales agent or\nprincipal, which we amended in March 2023 to provide for sales of up to $200.0 million going forward. In August and September 2021, we sold\n2.3 million shares of common stock through Cowen for gross proceeds of approximately $13.9 million before deducting offering costs. In the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2022, we sold 6.6 million shares of common stock under the Cowen ATM for gross proceeds of approximately $23.1 million before\ndeducting offering costs. In January and February 2023, we sold approximately 9.5 million shares of common stock under the Cowen ATM for gross\nproceeds of approximately $15.2 million before deducting offering costs. In addition, we issued shares of our common stock in connection with our\nacquisitions of Lineagen and BioDiscovery. Any future significant sales of our capital stock or strategic transactions in which we use equity as\nconsideration would result in further dilution to our current stockholders. As a result of these issuances, our investors experienced dilution of their\nownership interests.\nThe issuance of shares under awards granted under existing or future employee equity benefit plans may cause immediate and substantial dilution to\nour existing stockholders.\nIn order to provide persons who have a responsibility for our management and/or growth with additional incentive, to increase their proprietary interest in\nour success, and to support and increase our ability to attract and retain individuals of exceptional talent, we maintain multiple equity incentive plans. The\ntotal number of shares of our common stock available for the grant of awards under these plans is 8.6 million, 0.1 million and 2.1 million for our 2018\nEquity Incentive Plan, as amended, 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 2020 Inducement Plan, as amended, respectively, subject to adjustment,\nincluding pursuant to automatic “evergreen” increases in certain of our plans. As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding equity awards underlying\nthose plans accounting for 24.4 million underlying shares. We may also adopt one or more additional employee equity benefit plans in the future. The\nissuance of shares under an employee equity benefit plan may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders. For example on February\n15, 2023, our Board of Directors granted our executive officers options to purchase an aggregate of 3.3 million shares of our common stock, and 0.7\nmillion restricted stock units (RSUs), which represented approximately 1% of our outstanding shares of common stock based on the 306.2 million shares of\ncommon stock outstanding as of March 6, 2023. Accordingly, the issuance of shares under current or future employee equity benefit plans will have the\neffect of further diluting the proportionate equity interest and voting power of holders of our common stock.\nIf we are unable to execute our sales and marketing strategy for our Bionano Laboratories products and services, including diagnostic assays, and are\nunable to gain acceptance in the market, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our Bionano Laboratories business.\nOur Bionano Laboratories business provides molecular diagnostics services and has engaged in only limited sales and marketing activities for the\ndiagnostic assays currently offered through our CLIA-certified laboratory. To date, the revenue generated by our Bionano Laboratories business has been\ninsufficient to fund operations.\nAlthough we believe that our current assays and our planned future assays represent a promising commercial opportunity, our products or assays may never\ngain significant acceptance in the marketplace and therefore may never generate substantial\n33"

We will need to further establish a market for our products and diagnostic assays and build that market through physician\neducation, awareness programs and the publication of clinical trial results. Gaining acceptance in medical communities requires, among other things,\npublications in leading peer-reviewed journals of results from studies using our current products, assays and services and/or our planned future products,\nassays and services. The process of publication in leading medical journals is subject to a peer review process and peer reviewers may not consider the\nresults of our studies sufficiently novel or worthy of publication. Failure to have our studies published in peer-reviewed journals would limit the adoption\nof our current products, assays and services and our planned future products, assays and services.\nOur ability to successfully market the products and diagnostic assays that we have developed, and may develop in the future, will depend on numerous\nfactors, including:\n•\nconducting clinical utility studies of such assays in collaboration with key thought leaders to demonstrate their use and value in important medical\ndecisions such as treatment selection;\n•\nwhether our current or future partners, vigorously support our offerings;\n•\nthe success of our sales force;\n•\nwhether healthcare providers believe such diagnostic assays provide clinical utility;\n•\nwhether the medical community accepts that such diagnostic assays are sufficiently sensitive and specific to be meaningful in patient care and\ntreatment decisions;\n•\nour ability to continually source raw materials, shipping kits and other products that we sell or consume in our manufacturing process that are of\nsufficient quality and supply;\n•\nour ability to continue to fund planned sales and marketing activities; and\n•\nwhether private health insurers, government health programs and other third-party payors will adopt our current and future assays in their\nguidelines, or cover such diagnostic assays and, if so, whether they will adequately reimburse us.\nGeopolitical and macroeconomic developments, such as the COVID-19 pandemic may also increase the risk and uncertainty of the events described above\nand delay our development timelines. Failure to achieve widespread market acceptance of our current products, assays and services, as well as our planned\nfuture products, assays and services, would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the near term, sales of our Saphyr system, Ionic Purification system, NxClinical software, consumables and genome analysis services will depend on\nlevels of research and development spending by clinical research laboratories, academic and governmental research institutions and biopharmaceutical\ncompanies, a reduction in which could limit demand for our technologies and products and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIn the near term, we expect that our revenue from sales of our Saphyr system, Ionic Purification system, NxClinical software, consumables and OGM\nservices will be derived primarily from sales to academic and governmental research institutions, and academic and commercial clinical laboratories, as\nwell as biopharmaceutical and contract research companies worldwide for research applications. The demand for our products and technologies will depend\nin part upon the research and development budgets of these customers, which are impacted by factors beyond our control, such as:\n•\nchanges in government programs that provide funding to research institutions and companies;\n•\nchanges in the regulatory environment;\n•\nscientists’ and customers’ opinions of the utility of new products, technologies or services;\n•\nreductions in or other difficulties relating to, among other things, staffing, capacity, shutdowns or slowdowns of laboratories and other institutions\nas well as other impacts stemming from various geopolitical and macroeconomic developments, such as the conflict between Ukraine and Russia,\nrelated sanctions and the COVID-19 pandemic;\n•\ndifferences in budgetary cycles; and\n•\nmarket acceptance of relatively new technologies, such as ours.\nIn addition, our operating results may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by our customers. Any\ndecrease in customers’ budgets or expenditures, including impacts stemming from various geopolitical and macroeconomic developments, such as the\nconflict between Ukraine and Russia, related sanctions and the COVID-19 pandemic, or in the size, scope or frequency of capital or operating expenditures,\ncould materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\n34"

Our customers’ evaluation processes often involve a number\nof factors, many of which are beyond our control. As a result of these factors, the capital investment required to purchase our systems and the budget cycles\nof our customers, the time from initial contact with a customer to our receipt of a purchase order can vary significantly. Given the length and uncertainty of\nour sales cycle, we have in the past experienced, and expect to in the future experience, fluctuations in our sales on a period-to-period basis. In addition,\nany failure to meet customer expectations could result in customers choosing to retain their existing systems, use existing assays not requiring capital\nequipment or purchase systems other than ours.\nOur long-term results depend upon our ability to improve existing products and technologies and introduce and market new products and technologies\nsuccessfully.\nOur business is dependent on the continued improvement of our existing products and technologies and our development of new products and technologies\nutilizing our current or other potential future technology. As we introduce new products or technologies or refine, improve or upgrade versions of existing\nproducts or technologies, we cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share these products or technologies will achieve, if\nany.\nConsistent with our strategy of offering new products and product refinements, we expect to continue to use a substantial amount of capital for product\ndevelopment and refinement. We may need additional capital for product development and refinement than is available on terms favorable to us, if at all,\nwhich could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe generally sell our products and technologies in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and technology\nintroductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop new products and technologies and product and technology enhancements based on\ntechnological innovation on a timely basis, our products and technologies may become obsolete over time and our revenues, cash flow, profitability and\ncompetitive position will suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n•\ncorrectly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;\n•\nallocate our research and development funding to products and technologies with higher growth prospects;\n•\nanticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and technological innovations;\n•\ninnovate and develop new technologies and applications, including software applications through our BioDiscovery subsidiary, and acquire or\nobtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in the markets we serve;\n•\nour ability to successfully market our Ionic Purification system through our Purigen business, and to integrate that technology in our existing\necosystem of technologies;\n•\nsuccessfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new\nproducts of appropriate quality on time; and\n•\ncustomers’ willingness to adopt new technologies.\nIn addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research\nand development of products and technologies that do not lead to significant revenue. For example, we completed the BioDiscovery acquisition in October\n2021 and the Purigen acquisition in November 2022 and will need to devote time and resources in order to further develop and integrate BioDiscovery’s\nsoftware and technology solutions and Purigen’s Ionic Purification system for our current and anticipated product offerings. We may be unsuccessful in\nachieving our desired results or in marketing such solutions to our future customers. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and\ntechnologies and product and technological enhancements, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer.\nOur ability to develop new products and technologies based on innovation can affect our competitive position and often requires the investment of\nsignificant resources. Difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new products, technologies and services or failure to gain market\nacceptance of new products and technologies may reduce future revenues and adversely affect our competitive position.\n35"

The expenses or losses associated\nwith unsuccessful product and technology development or launch activities or lack of market acceptance of our new products and technologies could\nadversely affect our business or financial condition.\nOur future success is dependent upon our ability to further penetrate our existing customer base, attract new customers and retain the customers of our\nacquired businesses.\nOur current customer base for our products and technologies is primarily composed of academic and governmental research institutions and\nbiopharmaceutical and contract research companies and, for our Bionano Laboratories diagnostic services, physicians and their patients. Our success will\ndepend upon our ability to respond to the evolving needs of, and increase our market share among, existing customers and additional potential customers,\nmarketing new products, technologies and services as we develop them.

Our estimates of the total addressable market for our current and future products and technologies are based\non a number of internal and third-party estimates and assumptions. Both our current market opportunity estimates for cytogenomics and discovery research\nand our potential future market opportunity estimates, including newborn screening, population genomics, neurological and cardiological risk assessment,\nand cell bioprocessing quality control, are forward-looking statements and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. While these were prepared in\ngood faith, we cannot provide assurances as to future results or events because these estimates are dependent in part on, among other things, anticipated\ndemand for OGM instruments, complementary capabilities of OGM and NGS, and expected consumption of chips and sample prep and labeling kits. In\nparticular, these estimates are based on current and projected selling prices for instruments and consumables, each of which is subject to change over time\nand may be drastically affected without warning due to matters outside of our control, including geopolitical and macroeconomic developments.\nThe estimates and assumptions underlying our addressable market opportunities also involve significant judgments with respect to, among other things,\nfuture economic, competitive, regulatory, market and financial conditions, as well as future customer demand, business decisions and corporate\nopportunities that may not be realized, and that are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and regulatory risks and uncertainties,\nall of which are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. For example, as interest rates continue to rise, our customers may be\nunable to deploy additional capital to purchase, or re-prioritize their budget away from, our products and technologies.

While we have focused\ninitially on the life sciences research market and RUO products only, part of our business strategy is to expand our product line to encompass products that\nare intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease and precision healthcare, either alone or in collaboration with third parties. The use of our RUO\nproducts for any such diagnostic purposes would require that we obtain regulatory clearance or approval to market our products for those purposes and also\nthat we acquire the materials and components used in such products from suppliers without an RUO restriction. There can be no assurance that we will be\nable to acquire these materials and components for use in diagnostic products on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to do so, we would not be able\nto expand our non-Bionano Laboratories product offerings beyond RUO, and our business and prospects would suffer.\nThe FDA Guidance on “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only”, or, the RUO/IUO\nLabeling Guidance, emphasizes that the FDA will review the totality of the circumstances when evaluating whether equipment and testing components are\nproperly labeled as RUO. It further states that merely including a labeling statement that a product is intended for RUO will not necessarily render the\ndevice exempt from the FDA’s 510(k) clearance, PMA, or other requirements, if the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicate that\nthe manufacturer intends for its product to be offered for clinical diagnostic use. These circumstances may include written or verbal marketing claims or\nlinks to articles regarding a product’s performance in clinical applications, a manufacturer’s provision of technical support for clinical validation or clinical\napplications, or solicitation of business from clinical laboratories, all of which could be considered evidence of intended uses that conflict with RUO\nlabeling. If the FDA were to determine that our RUO products were intended for use in clinical investigation, diagnosis or treatment decisions, or that\nexpress or implied clinical or diagnostic claims were made for our RUO products, those products could be considered misbranded or adulterated under the\nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. If the FDA determines that our RUO products are being marketed for clinical diagnostic use without the required\nPMA or 510(k) clearance, we may be required to cease marketing our products as planned, recall the products from customers, revise our marketing plans,\nand/or suspend or delay the commercialization of our products until we obtain the required authorization. We also may be subject to a range of enforcement\nactions by the FDA, including warning or untitled letters, injunctions, civil monetary penalties, criminal prosecution, and recall and/or seizure of products,\nas well as significant adverse publicity.\nIf, in the future, we choose to commercialize our RUO products for clinical diagnostic use, we will be required to comply with the FDA’s premarket review\nand post-market control requirements for in-vitro diagnostics, or IVDs, products, as may be applicable. Complying with the FDA’s PMA and/or 510(k)\nclearance requirements may be expensive, time-consuming, and subject us to significant and/or unanticipated delays. Our efforts may never result in an\napproved PMA or 510(k) clearance for our products. Even if we obtain a PMA or 510(k) clearance, where required, such authorization may not be for the\nuse or uses we believe are commercially attractive and/or are critical to the commercial success of our products. As a result, being subject to the FDA’s\npremarket review and/or post-market control requirements for our products could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe have limited experience in marketing and selling our products and technologies, and if we are unable to successfully commercialize our products\nand technologies, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe have limited experience marketing and selling our products and technologies. We currently sell our Saphyr system and Ionic Purification system for\nRUO, through our direct field sales and support organizations located in North America and Europe and through a combination of our own sales force and\nthird-party distributors in additional major markets such as Australia, China, Japan and South Korea.\nThe future sales of our products and technologies will depend in large part on our ability to effectively market and sell our products and technologies,\nsuccessfully manage and expand our sales force, and increase the scope of our marketing efforts. We may also enter into additional distribution\narrangements in the future. Because we have limited experience in marketing and selling our products and technologies, our ability to forecast demand, the\ninfrastructure required to support such demand and the sales cycle to customers is unproven. If we do not build an efficient and effective sales force, our\nbusiness and operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe rely on a single contract manufacturer for our optical genome mapping systems and a single contract manufacturer for our chip consumables. If\neither of these manufacturers should fail or not perform satisfactorily, our ability to supply these products would be negatively and adversely affected.\nWe currently rely on a single contract manufacturer to manufacture and supply all of our OGM-based instruments, including our new Ionic Purification\ninstruments. See “Business — Key Agreements” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we rely on a single contract manufacturer based in the\nUnited States to manufacture and supply all of our chip consumables.

If\neither of these manufacturers were to be unable to supply instruments or chip consumables, our business would be harmed.\nIn the event it becomes necessary to utilize different contract manufacturers for our OGM-based instruments or chip consumables, we would experience\nadditional costs, delays and difficulties in doing so as a result of identifying and entering into an agreement with a new supplier as well as preparing such\nnew supplier to meet the logistical requirements associated with manufacturing our units, and our business would suffer. We may also experience additional\ncosts and delays in the event we need access to or rights under any intellectual property of these current manufacturers.\nWe have experienced manufacturing problems or delays that could limit the growth of our revenue or increase our losses.\nWe have encountered situations that resulted in delays or shortfalls caused by our outsourced manufacturing suppliers and by other third-party suppliers\nwho manufacture components for our products. We have been negatively impacted by unfavorable flowcell yields in the production cycle. If the same or a\nsimilar issue were to occur, it could lead to lower gross margins in future periods. If we are unable to keep up with demand for our products, our revenue\ncould be impaired, market acceptance for our products could be adversely affected and our customers might instead purchase our competitors’ products.\nOur inability to successfully manufacture our products would have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf our laboratory facilities become damaged or inoperable or we are required to vacate our existing facilities, our ability to conduct our laboratory\nanalysis and pursue our research and development efforts may be jeopardized.\nWe currently perform all research and development activities and most of our OGM services at a single laboratory facility in San Diego, California with the\nremaining genome analysis services at a facility we occupy at a customer’s lab in Clermont-Ferrand, France. All of our molecular diagnostics services are\nprocessed at a single laboratory facility in Salt Lake City, Utah.\nOur facilities and equipment could be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including war, fire, earthquake, power loss,\ncommunications failure, terrorism, burglary, public health crises (including restrictions that may result from various geopolitical and macroeconomic\ndevelopments, such as the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia or the COVID-19 pandemic) or other events, which may make it difficult or\nimpossible for us to perform our testing services for some period of time or to receive and store samples. The inability to perform tests or to reduce the\nbacklog of sample analysis that could develop if one or both of our facilities become inoperable, for even a short period of time, may result in the loss of\nrevenue, loss of customers or harm to our reputation, and we may be unable to regain that revenue, those customers or repair our reputation in the future.\nFurthermore, integral parties in our supply chain are operating from single sites, increasing their vulnerability to natural disasters and man-made disasters\nor other sudden, unforeseen and severe adverse events.\nIn addition, the loss of our samples due to such events could limit or prevent our ability to conduct research and development analysis on existing tests as\nwell as tests in development.\nOur facilities and the equipment we use to perform our testing and research and development could be unavailable or costly and time-consuming to repair\nor replace. It would be difficult, time-consuming and expensive to rebuild our facilities, to locate and qualify a new facility, replace certain pieces of\nequipment or license or transfer our proprietary technology to a third party, particularly in light of licensure and accreditation requirements. Even in the\nunlikely event that we are able to find a third party with such qualifications to enable us to resume our operations, we may be unable to negotiate\ncommercially reasonable terms.\nWe carry insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, but this insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with damage\nor disruption to our business, may not provide coverage in amounts sufficient to cover our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on\nacceptable terms, if at all.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers or, in some cases, one supplier, for some of our materials and components used in our products, and may not\nbe able to find replacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and reputation.\nWe rely on limited or sole suppliers for certain reagents and other materials and components that are used in our products. While we periodically forecast\nour needs for such materials and enter into standard purchase orders with our suppliers, we do not have long-term contracts with many of these suppliers. If\nwe were to lose such suppliers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify or enter into agreements with alternative suppliers on a timely\nbasis on acceptable terms, if at all. An interruption in our operations, including our laboratory operations, could occur if we encounter delays or difficulties\nin securing these materials, or if the quality of the materials supplied do not meet our requirements, or if we cannot then obtain an acceptable substitute.\nThe time and effort required to qualify a new supplier and ensure that the new materials provide the same or better quality results could result in significant\nadditional costs. Any such interruption could significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\n38"

If any of these events occur, our business and\noperating results could be harmed.\nAlso, in order to mitigate these risks, we maintain inventories of certain supplies at higher levels than would be the case if multiple sources of supply were\navailable. If our sales or testing volume decreases or we switch suppliers, we may hold excess supplies with expiration dates that occur before use which\nwould adversely affect our losses and cash flow position. As we introduce any new products, we may experience supply issues as we ramp up our sales or\ntest volume. If we should encounter delays or difficulties in securing, reconfiguring or revalidating the equipment, reagents or other materials we require\nfor our products, our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected.\nUndetected errors or defects in our products or technologies could harm our reputation, decrease market acceptance of our products or technologies or\nexpose us to product liability claims or recalls.\nOur products or technologies may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions or new products or technologies are\nreleased. Disruptions affecting the introduction or release of, or other performance problems with, our products or technologies may damage our\ncustomers’ businesses and could harm their and our reputations. If that occurs, we may incur significant costs, the attention of our key personnel could be\ndiverted, or other significant customer relations problems may arise. We may also be subject to warranty and liability claims for damages related to errors\nor defects in our products or technologies. In addition, if we do not meet industry or quality standards, if applicable, our products may be subject to recall.\nA material liability claim, recall or other occurrence that harms our reputation or decreases market acceptance of our products or technologies could harm\nour business and operating results.\nIf our customers develop or use our products or assays for diagnostic purposes, someone could file a product liability claim alleging that one of our\nproducts contained a design or manufacturing defect that resulted in the failure to adequately perform, leading to death or injury. In addition, the marketing,\nsale and use of our current or future products and assays could lead to the filing of product liability claims against us if someone alleges that our products\nfailed to perform as designed. We may also be subject to liability for errors in the results we provide or for a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance\nupon, the information we provide.\nA product liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming to defend, either of which could materially harm our\nbusiness or financial condition. We cannot assure investors that our product liability insurance would adequately protect our assets from the financial\nimpact of defending a product liability claim. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability\ninsurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could damage our reputation, or\ncause current partners to terminate existing agreements and potential partners to seek other partners, any of which could impact our results of operations.\nWe may also initiate a correction to our existing products or assays, which could lead to increased costs and increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities and\nour customers regarding the quality and safety of our products or services, as well as negative publicity. The occurrence of any of these events could have\nan adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur reliance on distributors for sales of our products outside of the United States could limit or prevent us from selling our products and could impact\nour revenue.\nWe intend to continue to grow our business internationally, and to do so we must attract additional distributors and retain existing distributors to maximize\nthe commercial opportunity for our products. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in attracting or retaining desirable sales and distribution\npartners or that we will be able to enter into such arrangements on favorable terms. Distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell\nour products to the level of our expectations or may choose to favor marketing the products of our competitors. If current or future distributors do not\nperform adequately, or we are unable to enter into effective arrangements with distributors in particular geographic areas, we may not realize long-term\ninternational revenue growth. In addition, if our distributors fail to comply with applicable laws and ethical standards, including anti-bribery laws, this\ncould damage our reputation and could have a significant adverse effect on our business and our revenues.\nWe expect to generate a substantial portion of our revenue internationally in the future and can become further subject to various risks relating to our\ninternational activities, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 58% and 54%, respectively, of our revenue was generated from customers located\noutside of the United States.

We have limited experience operating\ninternationally and engaging in international business involves a number of difficulties and risks, including:\n•\nrequired compliance with existing and changing foreign regulatory requirements and laws;\n•\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;\n•\ndifficulties protecting or procuring intellectual property rights;\n•\nrequired compliance with anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, data privacy and security requirements, labor laws and\nanti-competition regulations;\n•\nexport or import restrictions;\n•\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n•\nlonger payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n•\npolitical and economic instability; and\n•\npotentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, customs charges, bureaucratic requirements and other trade barriers.\nHistorically, most of our revenue has been denominated in U.S. dollars. For sales made to customers outside of the United States, we may sell our products\nand services in local currency outside of the United States. As our operations in countries outside of the United States grow, our results of operations and\ncash flows may be subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which could harm our business in the future. For example, if\nthe value of the U.S. dollar increases relative to foreign currencies, in the absence of a corresponding change in local currency prices, our revenue could be\nadversely affected as we convert revenue from local currencies to U.S. dollars. If we dedicate significant resources to our international operations and are\nunable to manage these risks effectively, our business, operating results and financial condition will suffer.\nWe are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws with respect to our operations and non-compliance with such laws\ncan subject us to criminal and/or civil liability and harm our business.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as amended, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act,\nthe USA PATRIOT Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in\nwhich we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from\nauthorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or accepting, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to or from any person whether in\nthe public or private sector for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage. We rely on third-party\nrepresentatives, distributors, and other business partners to support sales of our products and services and our efforts to ensure regulatory compliance. In\naddition, as we increase our international sales and business, we may engage with additional business partners. We can be held liable for the corrupt or\nother illegal activities of our employees, representatives, contractors, business partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual\nknowledge of such activities.\nAny violations of anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant\nmanagement distraction, involve significant costs and expenses, including legal fees, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business,\nprospects, financial condition, or results of operations. We could also incur severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, and other\nremedial measures.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets due to licensing\nrequirements and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nOur products are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs\nregulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls.\nExports of our products must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain\nof our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines, which may be\nimposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers.\nIn addition, changes in our products or changes in applicable export or import laws and regulations may create delays in the introduction and sale of our\nproducts in international markets, prevent our customers from deploying our products or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to\ncertain countries, governments or persons altogether.

Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our\nability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to recruit, train, retain, motivate and integrate key personnel, we may not achieve our goals.\nOur future success depends on our ability to recruit, train, retain, motivate and integrate key personnel, including our recently expanded senior management\nteam, as well as our research and development, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense. This\ncompetition has become exacerbated by the increase in employee resignations throughout the United States, which is commonly referred to as the “great\nresignation.” We may also experience employee turnover as a result of the ongoing “great resignation.” Our growth depends, in particular, on attracting and\nretaining highly-trained sales personnel with the necessary scientific background and ability to understand our systems at a technical level to effectively\nidentify and sell to potential new customers and develop new products and technologies. Because of the complex and technical nature of our products and\ntechnologies and the dynamic market in which we compete, any failure to attract, train, retain, motivate and integrate qualified personnel could materially\nharm our operating results and growth prospects. In response to competition, rising inflation rates and labor shortages, we may need to adjust employee\ncash compensation, which would affect our operating costs and our margins, or equity compensation, which would affect our outstanding share count,\ncausing dilution to existing shareholders and possibly souring investor sentiment, which could in turn make it difficult to achieve our goals.\nIf we cannot provide quality technical and applications support, we could lose customers and our business and prospects will suffer.\nThe placement of our products at new customer sites, the introduction of our technology into our customers’ existing laboratory workflows and ongoing\ncustomer support can be complex. Accordingly, we need highly trained technical support personnel. Hiring technical support personnel is very competitive\nin our industry due to the limited number of people available with the necessary scientific and technical backgrounds and ability to understand our\ntechnology at a technical level. To effectively support potential new customers and the expanding needs of current customers, we will need to substantially\nexpand our technical support staff. If we are unable to attract, train or retain the number of highly qualified technical services personnel that our business\nneeds, our business and prospects will suffer.\nIf our information technology systems or data or those of third parties upon which we rely, are or were compromised, we could experience adverse\nconsequences resulting from such compromise, including but not limited to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties;\ndisruptions of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; loss of customers or sales; and other adverse consequences.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business,\nwe collect, store, use, protect, secure, generate, transfer, dispose of, transmit, disclose, and otherwise process sensitive, proprietary, and confidential\ninformation, including intellectual property, trade secrets, financial information, and personal data (including protected health information) (collectively,\n“Sensitive Data”). We may rely upon third-party service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process Sensitive Data in a\nvariety of contexts, including, without limitation, third-party providers of cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee\nemail, content delivery to customers, and other functions and, as a result, we and the third parties upon which we rely face a variety of evolving threats,\nincluding but not limited to ransomware attacks, which could cause security incidents. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ cybersecurity practices is\nlimited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. While we may be entitled to damages if our third-party\nservice providers fail to satisfy their privacy or security-related obligations to us, any award may be insufficient to cover our damages, or we may be unable\nto recover such award. We may share or receive sensitive data with or from third parties.\nCyberattacks, malicious internet-based activity, and online and offline fraud are prevalent and continue to increase. Moreover, these threats are becoming\nincreasingly difficult to detect, and they come from a variety of sources. In addition to traditional computer “hackers,” threat actors, personnel (such as\nthrough theft or misuse), “hacktivists,” sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in\nattacks, including without limitation nation-state actors for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. During\ntimes of war and other major conflicts, including as a result of the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions imposed\nagainst Russia, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of these attacks, including cyber-attacks that could\nmaterially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services. We and the third parties upon\nwhich we rely may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social-engineering attacks (such as through phishing attacks),\nmalicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks (such as\ncredential stuffing), credential harvesting, personnel misconduct or error, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions,\nsoftware or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other\nsimilar threats.

Extortion payments\nmay alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws\nor regulations prohibiting such payments. Similarly, supply chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third\nparties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our third-party partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable\ndefects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems (including our software) or the third-party information\ntechnology systems that support us and our services. Remote work has become more common and has increased risks to our information technology\nsystems and data, as more of our employees utilize network connections, computers and devices outside our premises or network, including working at\nhome, while in transit, and in public locations. Additionally, past or future business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could expose us to\nadditional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems and Sensitive Data could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in acquired or\nintegrated entities’ systems and technologies.\nAny of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident or other interruption. A security incident or other interruption could result\nin unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, disclosure of, or access to data. A security\nincident or other interruption could disrupt our ability (and that of third parties upon whom we rely) to provide our products, software and services. We\nmay expend significant resources or modify our business activities in an effort to protect against security incidents. Certain data privacy and security\nobligations may require us to implement and maintain specific security measures, or industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our\ninformation technology systems and Sensitive Data.\nWhile we have implemented security measures designed to protect against security incidents, there can be no assurance that these measures will be\neffective. We may be unable in the future to detect vulnerabilities in our information technology systems (including our software) because such threats and\ntechniques change frequently, are often sophisticated in nature, and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Despite our efforts to\nidentify and remediate vulnerabilities, if any, in our information technology systems (including our software), our efforts may not be successful. Further, we\nmay experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address any such identified vulnerabilities.\nApplicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders of security incidents. Such disclosures are costly, and the\ndisclosures or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse consequences. If we (or a third party upon whom we rely) experience a\nsecurity incident or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences. These consequences may include:\ngovernment enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight;\nrestrictions on processing data (including personal data); litigation (including class claims); indemnification obligations; negative publicity; reputational\nharm; monetary fund diversions; interruptions in our operations (including availability of data); financial loss; and other similar harms. Security incidents\nand attendant consequences may cause customers to stop using our software or services, deter new customers from using our software or services, and\nnegatively impact our ability to grow and operate our business.\nOur contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are\nsufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations. We cannot be sure that our insurance\ncoverage, if any, will be adequate or sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our privacy and security practices, that such\ncoverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing laws, regulations, rules, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations related to data privacy and\nsecurity. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and\npenalties; disruption of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; loss of customers or sales; and other adverse business\nconsequences.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect, store, protect, secure, generate, transfer, dispose of, use, transmit, disclose and otherwise process personal\ndata (including protected health information) and other sensitive information, including proprietary and confidential business data, trade secrets, and\nintellectual property. Our data processing activities may subject us to numerous data privacy and security obligations, such as various laws, regulations,\nguidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contracts, and other obligations that govern the processing of personal data\nby us and on our behalf. In the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including data\nbreach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), and other similar\nlaws (e.g., wiretapping laws). For example, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health\nInformation Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose specific requirements\nrelating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information.

These obligations include, but are not limited to, providing specific\ndisclosures in privacy notices and affording California residents certain rights related to their personal data. The CCPA allows for statutory fines for\nnoncompliance (up to $7,500 per violation and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover significant statutory damages). In\naddition, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or the CPRA, operative January 1, 2023, expands the CCPA’s obligations on businesses. For example,\nthe CPRA establishes a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce relevant laws, which could increase the risk of an enforcement\naction, and applies to personal information of business representatives and employees. Other states have also recently enacted data privacy laws, as well as\nat the federal and local levels. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, both of\nwhich differ from the CPRA and take effect in 2023.\nOutside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards apply to data privacy and security. For example, the European\nUnion’s General Data Protection Regulation, or EU GDPR, and the United Kingdom’s GDPR, or UK GDPR, impose strict requirements for processing the\npersonal data of individuals. For example, under the EU GDPR, companies may face temporary or definitive bans on data processing and other corrective\nactions; fines of up to 20 million euros or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is greater; or private litigation related to the processing of personal data\nbrought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent their interests.\nWe may be unable to transfer personal data from Europe and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries due to data localization requirements\nor limitations on cross-border data flows. Europe and other jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring data to be localized or limiting the transfer of personal\ndata to other countries. In particular, the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) have significantly restricted the transfer of\npersonal data to the United States and other countries whose privacy laws it believes are inadequate. Other jurisdictions may adopt similarly stringent\ninterpretations of their data localization and cross-border data transfer laws. Although there are currently various mechanisms that may be used to transfer\npersonal data from the EEA and UK to the United States in compliance with law, such as the EEA and UK’s standard contractual clauses, these\nmechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the\nUnited States. If there is no lawful manner for us to transfer personal data from the EEA, the UK, or other jurisdictions to the United States, or if the\nrequirements for a legally-compliant transfer are too onerous, we could face significant adverse consequences, including the interruption or degradation of\nour operations, the need to relocate part of or all of our business or data processing activities to other jurisdictions at significant expense, increased\nexposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and penalties, the inability to transfer data and work with partners, vendors and other third parties, and\ninjunctions against our processing or transferring of personal data necessary to operate our business. Some European regulators have prevented companies\nfrom transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations.\nIn addition, privacy advocates and industry groups have proposed, and may propose in the future, standards with which we may be legally or contractually\nbound to comply. For example, we may also be subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS. The PCI DSS requires\ncompanies to adopt certain measures to ensure the security of cardholder information, including using and maintaining firewalls, adopting proper password\nprotections for certain devices and software, and restricting data access. Noncompliance with PCI-DSS can result in penalties ranging from $5,000 to\n$100,000 per month by credit card companies, litigation, damage to our reputation, and revenue losses. We may also rely on vendors to process payment\ncard data, and those vendors may be subject to PCI DSS, and our business may be negatively affected if our vendors are fined or suffer other consequences\nas a result of PCI DSS noncompliance.\nWe may also be subject to contractual obligations and policies related to data privacy and security. Publication of our privacy policies and other statements\nregarding data privacy and security may subject us to investigation or enforcement actions by regulators if those policies or statements are found to be\ndeficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our practices. We may also be bound by contractual obligations related to data\nprivacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful.\nOur data privacy and security obligations are quickly changing in an increasingly stringent fashion, creating some uncertainty as to the effective future\nlegal framework. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to differing applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or in conflict\namong jurisdictions. Preparing for and complying with these obligations requires us to devote significant resources (including, without limitation, financial\nand time-related resources). These obligations may necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third\nparties on which we rely. Although we endeavor to comply with all applicable data privacy and security obligations, we may at times fail (or be perceived\nto have failed) to do so. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties upon which we rely may fail to comply with such obligations, which\ncould negatively impact our business operations and compliance posture. For example, any failure by a third-party processor to comply with applicable law,\nregulations, or contractual obligations could result in adverse effects, including inability to operate our business and proceedings against us by\ngovernmental entities or others. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face\nsignificant consequences. These consequences may include, but are not limited to, government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties,\naudits, inspections, and similar); litigation (including class-related claims); additional reporting\n43"

If we fail to effectively compete, our business, financial condition and\noperating results will suffer.\nWe face significant competition in the life sciences research and diagnostic markets. We currently compete with both established and early stage companies\nthat design, manufacture and market systems and consumable supplies. We believe our principal competitors in the life sciences research and genome\nmapping markets include PacBio, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Genomic Vision, Qiagen, and Dovetail Genomics (now part of Cantata Bio). In addition,\nthere are a number of new market entrants in the process of developing novel technologies for the life sciences research, diagnostic and screening markets.\nMany of our current competitors are either publicly-traded, or are divisions of publicly-traded companies, and may enjoy a number of competitive\nadvantages over us, including:\n•\ngreater name and brand recognition;\n•\nsubstantially greater financial and human resources;\n•\nbroader product lines;\n•\nlarger sales forces and more established distributor networks;\n•\nsubstantial intellectual property portfolios;\n•\nlarger and more established customer bases and relationships; and\n•\nbetter established, larger scale, and lower cost manufacturing capabilities.\nWe believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our target markets include:\n•\ncost of instruments and consumables;\n•\naccuracy, including sensitivity and specificity, and reproducibility of results;\n•\nreputation among customers;\n•\ninnovation in product offerings;\n•\nflexibility, scalability and ease of use; and\n•\ncompatibility with existing laboratory processes, tools and methods.\nWe cannot assure investors that our products or technologies will compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition\nfrom new products and technologies introduced by our existing competitors or new companies entering our markets. In addition, we cannot assure investors\nthat our competitors do not have or will not develop products or technologies that currently or in the future will enable them to produce competitive\nproducts or technologies with greater capabilities or at lower costs than ours. Any failure to compete effectively could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could\nhave a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe, and any the third parties with access to our facilities, are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those\ngoverning laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Each of our operations involve\nthe use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological and radioactive materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste.\nWe generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these\nmaterials. We could be held liable for any resulting damages in the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use of hazardous materials by us or\nthe third parties with whom we contract, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal\nfines and penalties. Although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our\nemployees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities.

In addition, we\nmay incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Compliance with applicable\nenvironmental laws and regulations is expensive, and these current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development and\ncommercialization efforts, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Failure to comply with these laws and\nregulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nRisks related to government regulation and diagnostic product reimbursement\nIf the FDA determines that our RUO products are medical devices or if we seek to market our RUO products for clinical diagnostic or health screening\nuse, we will be required to obtain regulatory clearance(s) or approval(s), and may be required to cease or limit sales of our then marketed products,\nwhich could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such regulatory process would be\nexpensive, time-consuming and uncertain both in timing and in outcome.\nOur RUO products are focused on the life sciences research market. This includes laboratories associated with academic and governmental research\ninstitutions, as well as pharmaceutical, biotechnology and contract research companies. Accordingly, our products are labeled as RUO, and are not intended\nfor diagnostic use. While we have focused initially on the life sciences research market and RUO products only, our strategy is to expand our product line\nto encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease, either alone or in collaboration with third parties. Such IVD products will\nbe subject to regulation by the FDA as medical devices, or comparable international agencies, including requirements for regulatory clearance or approval\nof such products before they can be marketed. If the FDA were to determine that our products are intended for clinical use or if we decided to market our\nproducts for such use, we would be required to obtain FDA 510(k) clearance or premarket approval in order to sell our products in a manner consistent with\nFDA laws and regulations. Such regulatory approval processes or clearances are expensive, time-consuming and uncertain; our efforts may never result in\nany approved premarket approval application, or PMA, or 510(k) clearance for our products; and failure by us or a collaborator to obtain or comply with\nsuch approvals and clearances could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nIVD products may be regulated as medical devices by the FDA and comparable international agencies and may require either clearance from the FDA\nfollowing the 510(k) pre-market notification process or PMA from the FDA, in each case prior to marketing. If we or our collaborators are required to\nobtain a PMA or 510(k) clearance for products based on our technology, we or they would be subject to a substantial number of additional requirements for\nmedical devices, including establishment registration, device listing, Quality Systems Regulations which cover the design, testing, production, control,\nquality assurance, labeling, packaging, servicing, sterilization (if required), and storage and shipping of medical devices (among other activities), product\nlabeling, advertising, recordkeeping, post-market surveillance, post-approval studies, adverse event reporting, and correction and removal (recall)\nregulations. One or more of the products we or a collaborator may develop using our technology may also require clinical trials in order to generate the data\nrequired for PMA approval. Complying with these requirements may be time-consuming and expensive. We or our collaborators may be required to\nexpend significant resources to ensure ongoing compliance with the FDA regulations and/or take satisfactory corrective action in response to enforcement\naction, which may have a material adverse effect on the ability to design, develop, and commercialize products using our technology as planned. Failure to\ncomply with these requirements may subject us or a collaborator to a range of enforcement actions, such as warning letters, injunctions, civil monetary\npenalties, criminal prosecution, recall and/or seizure of products, and revocation of marketing authorization, as well as significant adverse publicity. If we\nor our collaborators fail to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, regulatory approvals for IVD products, such products may not be able to be\nlaunched or successfully commercialized in a timely manner, or at all.\nLaboratory developed tests, or LDTs, are a subset of IVD tests that are designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory. Our Bionano\nLaboratories diagnostic services are provided as LDTs. The FDA maintains that LDTs are medical devices and has for the most part exercised enforcement\ndiscretion for most LDTs. A significant change in the way that the FDA regulates any LDTs that we, our collaborators or our customers market or develop\nusing our technology could affect our business. If the FDA requires laboratories to undergo premarket review and comply with other applicable FDA\nrequirements in the future, the cost and time required to commercialize an LDT will increase substantially, and may reduce the financial incentive for us to\ncontinue to offer our Bionano Laboratories genetic diagnostic services or for our customer laboratories to develop LDTs, which could reduce demand for\nour RUO instruments and our other products. In addition, if the FDA were to change the way that it regulates LDTs to require that we undergo pre-market\nreview or comply with other applicable FDA requirements before we can sell our RUO instruments or our other products to clinical cytogenetics\nlaboratories, our ability to sell our RUO instruments and other products to this addressable market would be delayed, thereby impeding our ability to\npenetrate this market and generate revenue from sales of our instruments and our other products.\nFailure to comply with applicable FDA requirements could subject us to misbranding or adulteration allegations under the Federal Food, Drug, and\nCosmetic Act. We could be subject to a range of enforcement actions, including warning letters,\n45"

In addition,\nchanges to the current regulatory framework, including the imposition of additional or new regulations, could arise at any time during the development or\nmarketing of our products, which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain FDA or comparable regulatory approval of our products, if\nrequired.\nForeign jurisdictions have laws and regulations similar to those described above, which may adversely affect our ability to market our products as planned\nin such countries. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing. As in the United States, the cost and time required to comply with regulatory\nrequirements may be substantial, and there is no guarantee that we will obtain the necessary authorization(s) required to make our products commercially\nviable. As a result, the imposition of foreign requirements may also have a material adverse effect on the commercial viability of our operations.\nWe expect to rely on third parties in conducting any required future studies of diagnostic products that may be required by the FDA or other regulatory\nauthorities, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials or other studies that may be required to obtain FDA and other regulatory clearance or\napproval for future diagnostic products. Accordingly, we expect that we would rely on third parties, such as clinical investigators, consultants, and\ncollaborators to conduct such studies if needed. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical and other development activities would reduce our control\nover these activities. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the\nthird parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised, we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or\napproval.\nBilling for our Bionano Laboratories diagnostic testing procedures is complex and requires substantial time and resources to collect payment.\nBilling for clinical laboratory testing services in connection with our Bionano Laboratories diagnostic services is complex, time-consuming and expensive.\nDepending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payors, including Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance companies, private\nhealthcare institutions, and patients, all of which have different billing requirements. We generally bill third-party payors for our diagnostic testing services\nand pursue reimbursement on a case-by-case basis where pricing contracts are not in place. To the extent laws or contracts require us to bill patient co-\npayments or co-insurance, we must also comply with these requirements. We may also face increased risk in our collection efforts, including potential\nwrite-offs of accounts receivable and long collection cycles, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSeveral factors make the billing process complex, including:\n•\ndifferences between the billing rates and reimbursement rates for our products;\n•\ncompliance with complex federal and state regulations related to billing government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and\nTRICARE;\n•\nrisk of government audits related to billing;\n•\ndisputes among payors as to which party is responsible for payment;\n•\ndifferences in coverage and information and billing requirements among payors, including the need for prior authorization and/or advanced\nnotification;\n•\nthe effect of patient co-payments or co-insurance and our ability to collect such payments from patients;\n•\nchanges to billing codes used for our products;\n•\nchanges to requirements related to our current or future clinical studies, including our registry studies, which can affect eligibility for payment;\n•\nongoing monitoring provisions of LCDs for our products, which can affect the circumstances under which a claim would be considered medically\nnecessary;\n•\nincorrect or missing billing information; and\n•\nthe resources required to manage the billing and claims appeals process.\nWe use standard industry billing codes, known as CPT codes, to bill for our diagnostic testing services. If these codes were to change, there is a risk of an\nerror being made in the claim adjudication process. Such errors can occur with claims submission, third-party transmission or in the processing of the claim\nby the payor. Claim adjudication errors may result in a delay in payment processing or a reduction in the amount of the payment we receive.\n46"

Failure or delays in\neffecting these changes in external billing and internal systems and processes could negatively affect our collection rates, revenue and cost of collecting.\nAdditionally, our billing activities require us to implement compliance procedures and oversight, train and monitor our employees, and undertake internal\naudits to evaluate compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures. When payors deny our claims,\nwe may challenge the reason, low payment amount or payment denials. Payors also conduct external audits to evaluate payments, which add further\ncomplexity to the billing process. If the payor makes an overpayment determination, there is a risk that we may be required to return all or some portion of\nprior payments we have received.\nAdditionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010,\ncollectively the ACA, requires providers and suppliers to report and return any overpayments received from government payors under the Medicare and\nMedicaid programs within 60 days of identification. Failure to identify and return such overpayments exposes the provider or supplier to liability under\nfederal false claims laws. These billing complexities, and the related uncertainty in obtaining payment for our products, could negatively affect our revenue\nand cash flow, our ability to achieve sustained profitability, and the consistency and comparability of our results of operations.\nIf our Bionano Laboratories diagnostic testing procedures are subject to unfavorable pricing regulations or third-party payor coverage and\nreimbursement policies, our business could be harmed.\nOur Bionano Laboratories-related revenue depends on achieving and maintaining broad coverage and adequate reimbursement for our Bionano\nLaboratories products and diagnostic assays from third-party payors, including both government and commercial third-party payors. If third-party payors\ndo not provide coverage of, or do not provide adequate reimbursement for, a substantial portion of the list price of our Bionano Laboratories products and\ndiagnostic assays, we may need to seek additional payment from the patient beyond any co-payments and deductibles, which may adversely affect demand\nfor our Bionano Laboratories products and diagnostic assays. Coverage determinations by a third-party payor may depend on a number of factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, a third-party payor’s determination of whether our products or services are appropriate, medically necessary or cost-effective.\nIf we are unable to provide third-party payors with sufficient evidence of the clinical utility and validity of our Bionano Laboratories products and\ndiagnostic assays, they may not provide coverage, or may provide limited coverage, which will adversely affect our revenues and our ability to succeed.\nSince each third-party payor makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy to cover our Bionano Laboratories products and diagnostic assays,\nenter into a contract with us and set the amount it will reimburse for a product, these negotiations are a time-consuming and costly process, and they do not\nguarantee that the third-party payor will provide coverage or adequate reimbursement for our Bionano Laboratories products and diagnostic assays. In\naddition, the determinations by a third-party payor whether to cover our Bionano Laboratories products and diagnostic assays and the amount it will\nreimburse for them are often made on an indication-by-indication basis.\nIn cases where there is no coverage policy or we do not have a contracted rate for reimbursement as a participating provider, the patient is typically\nresponsible for a greater share of the cost of the product, which may result in further delay of our revenue, increase our collection costs or decrease the\nlikelihood of collection.\nOur claims for reimbursement from third-party payors may be denied upon submission, and we may need to take additional steps to receive payment, such\nas appealing the denials. Such appeals and other processes are time-consuming and expensive, and may not result in payment. Third-party payors may\nperform audits of historically paid claims and attempt to recoup funds years after the funds were initially distributed if the third-party payors believe the\nfunds were paid in error or determine that our Bionano Laboratories products and diagnostic assays were medically unnecessary. If a third-party payor\naudits our claims and issues a negative audit finding, and we are not able to overturn the audit findings through appeal, the recoupment may result in a\nmaterial adverse effect on our revenue. Additionally, in some cases commercial third-party payors for whom we are not a participating provider may elect\nat any time to review claims previously paid and determine the amount they paid was too much. In these situations, the third-party payor will typically\nnotify us of their decision and then offset whatever amount they determine they overpaid against amounts they owe us on current claims. We cannot predict\nwhen, or how often, a third-party payor might engage in these reviews and we may not be able to dispute these retroactive adjustments.\nAdditionally, coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Therefore, even if favorable coverage and\nreimbursement status is attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future that may adversely affect the\ncoverage and reimbursement of our Bionano Laboratories products and diagnostic assays.\n47"

The ability of our customers to commercialize diagnostic tests based on our technology will depend in part on the extent to which\ncoverage and reimbursement for these tests will be available from such third-party payors.\nIn the United States, molecular testing laboratories have multiple options for reimbursement coding, but we expect that the primary codes used will be the\ngenomic sequencing procedure codes, or GSPs. The American Medical Association, or AMA, added GSPs to its clinical laboratory fee schedule in 2015. In\naddition, CMS issued a coverage determination providing for the reimbursement of next-generation sequencing for certain cancer diagnostics using an\nFDA-approved in vitro diagnostic test. Private health plans often follow CMS coverage and reimbursement guidelines to a substantial degree, and it is\ndifficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement of any products our customers try to commercialize.\nIn Europe, coverage for molecular diagnostic testing is varied. Countries with statutory health insurance (e.g., Germany, France, The Netherlands) tend to\nbe more progressive in technology adoption with favorable reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing. In countries such as the United Kingdom with\ntax-based insurance, adoption and reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing is not uniform and is influenced by local budgets.\nUltimately, coverage and reimbursement of new products is uncertain, and whether laboratories that use our instruments to develop their own products will\nattain coverage and adequate reimbursement is unknown. In the United States, there is no uniform policy for determining coverage and reimbursement.\nCoverage can differ from payor to payor, and the process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage may be separate from the process for\nsetting the reimbursement rate. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in\nimplementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls and restrictions on\nreimbursement. We cannot be sure that coverage will be available for any diagnostic tests based on our technology, and, if coverage is available, the level\nof payments. Reimbursement may impact the demand for those tests. If coverage and reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels,\nour customers may not be able to successfully commercialize any tests for which they receive marketing authorization.\nHealthcare legislative or regulatory reform measures may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn March 2010, the ACA became law. The ACA is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of\nhealthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries,\nimpose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. For example, the ACA contained a 2.3% excise tax on\ncertain entities that manufacture or import medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions, which has been permanently\neliminated as part of the 2020 spending package.\nThere have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, while Congress has not passed\ncomprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for\nnot complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural\ngrounds that argued the ACA was unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain\nin effect in its current form.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the\nInflation Reduction Act into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA\nmarketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the coverage gap under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly\nlowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost through a newly established manufacturer discount program. In addition, on April 1, 2014, the\nProtecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, was signed into law, which, among other things, significantly altered the payment methodology\nunder the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS. PAMA requires certain laboratories performing clinical diagnostic laboratory tests to\nreport to CMS the amounts paid by private payors for laboratory tests. Such reporting has been subject to numerous delays. Beginning on January 1, 2018,\nCMS has begun using reported private payor pricing to periodically revise payment rates under the CLFS. Based on current law, between January 1, 2023\nand March 31, 2023, applicable laboratories will be required to report on data collected during January 1, 2019 and June 30, 2019. This data will be utilized\nto determine 2024 to 2026 CLFS rates.\n48"

Any reduction in payments from\nMedicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment\nmeasures or other healthcare reforms may prevent our customers from successfully commercializing any tests for which they receive approval, which could\nprevent us from being able to generate revenue and attain profitability.\nComplying with numerous regulations pertaining to our business is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure to comply could result\nin substantial penalties.\nWe are subject to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment of 1988, or CLIA, which is a federal law regulating clinical laboratories that perform\ntesting on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. Our clinical\nlaboratory is located in Utah and must be certified under CLIA in order for us to perform testing on human specimens. CLIA is intended to ensure the\nquality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration,\nand participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. We have a current certificate of\ncompliance under CLIA to perform cytogenetics. To renew this certificate, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA\ninspectors may make periodic inspections of our clinical laboratory outside of the renewal process. The failure to comply with CLIA requirements can\nresult in enforcement actions, including the revocation, suspension, or limitation of our CLIA certificate of compliance, as well as a directed plan of\ncorrection, state on-site monitoring, civil money penalties, civil injunctive suit and/or criminal penalties. We must maintain CLIA compliance and\ncertification to be eligible to bill for assays provided to Medicare beneficiaries. If we were to be found out of compliance with CLIA program requirements\nand subjected to sanctions, our business and reputation could be harmed. Even if it were possible for us to bring our laboratory back into compliance, we\ncould incur significant expenses and potentially lose revenue in doing so.\nWe hold laboratory licenses from the states of California, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, to test specimens from patients in those states or received from\nordering physicians in those states. Other states may have similar requirements or may adopt similar requirements in the future. Finally, we may be subject\nto regulation in foreign jurisdictions if we seek to expand international distribution of our assays outside the United States.\nIf we were to lose our CLIA certification or state laboratory licenses, whether as a result of a revocation, suspension or limitation, we would no longer be\nable to offer our assays, which would limit our revenues and harm our business. If we were to lose, or fail to obtain, a license in any other state where we\nare required to hold a license, we would not be able to test specimens from those states. Additionally, if we were to lose our CAP accreditation, our\nreputation for quality, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations, could be significantly and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and other federal and state laws applicable to our business activities, including our\nmarketing practices. If we are unable to comply, or have not complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nOur operations are subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal and state anti-kickback statutes and\nfalse claims laws. These laws may impact, among other things, our sales and marketing and education programs, and our financial and business\nrelationships with health care professionals. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n•\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or the AKS, which prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully soliciting,\nreceiving, offering or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral\nof an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare\nprogram, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term ‘‘remuneration’’ has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value.\nThere are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, however these are\ndrawn narrowly. Additionally, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to\nhave committed a violation.

EKRA’s reach extends beyond federal health care programs to include private insurance (i.e., it is an “all payor” statute). For\npurposes of EKRA, the term “laboratory” is defined broadly and without reference to any connection to substance use disorder treatment. The law\nincludes a limited number of exceptions, some of which closely align with corresponding federal Anti-Kickback Statute exceptions and safe\nharbors, and others that materially differ;\n•\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which, among other things, imposes criminal liability for\nexecuting or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and\nwillfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and\nknowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or\nrepresentation, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

Moreover, the provision of payments or\nother items of value by a clinical laboratory to a referral source could be prohibited under the Stark Law unless the arrangement meets all criteria of an\napplicable exception.

We could be adversely affected if regulatory agencies interpret our financial relationships with providers who may influence the\nordering of and use of our products to be in violation of applicable laws.\nEnsuring that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is costly. If our operations are found to\nbe in violation of any of these laws, we may be subject to significant penalties, including, without limitation, civil, criminal, and administrative penalties,\ndamages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs,\nadditional integrity oversight and reporting obligations, imprisonment, contractual damages, and reputational harm, any of which could adversely affect our\nability to operate our business and our results of operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we do business is\nfound to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from\ngovernment funded healthcare programs.\nAdditionally, sales of our products outside of the United States will subject us to similar foreign regulatory requirements, all of which are far-reaching and\ncomplex, and our failure to comply with such regulatory requirements could result in substantial penalties and have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nRisks related to intellectual property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, it may reduce our ability to maintain any technological or competitive advantage over our\ncompetitors and potential competitors, and our business may be harmed.\nWe rely on patent protection as well as trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights protection and contractual restrictions to\nprotect our proprietary technologies, all of which provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any\ncompetitive advantage. We have developed a global patent portfolio that includes more than 160 issued patents or allowed applications across\napproximately 35 patent families that are either owned or exclusively licensed. The owned and licensed patent families contain issued patents and pending\napplications that relate to devices, systems, and methods for macromolecular analysis, isolation and purification of molecules, genetic testing, computer\nsoftware systems and reflect our active and ongoing research programs. We also were the assignee of approximately 97 pending patent applications and\ngranted patents in particular jurisdictions outside the United States. If we fail to protect and/or maintain our intellectual property, third parties may be able\nto compete more effectively against us, we may lose our technological or competitive advantage, and/or we may incur substantial litigation costs in our\nattempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property.\nWe cannot assure investors that any of our currently pending or future patent applications will result in granted patents, and we cannot predict how long it\nwill take for such patents to issue, if at all. It is possible that, for any of our patents that have issued or that may issue in the future, our competitors may\ndesign their products, technologies or services around our patented technologies. Further, we cannot assure investors that other parties will not challenge\nany patents granted to us, or that courts or regulatory agencies will hold our patents to be valid, enforceable, and/or infringed. We cannot guarantee\ninvestors that we will be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and patent applications. Any successful third-party challenge or\nchallenges to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents, or such patents being interpreted narrowly and/or in a manner\nadverse to our interests. Our ability to establish or maintain a technological or competitive advantage over our competitors and/or market entrants may be\ndiminished because of these uncertainties. For these and other reasons, our intellectual property may not provide us with any competitive advantage. For\nexample:\n•\nwe or our licensors might not have been the first to make the inventions claimed or disclosed by our pending patent applications or issued patents;\n•\nwe or our licensors might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions. To determine the priority of these inventions, we\nmay have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO,\nwhich could result in substantial cost to us, and could possibly result in a loss or narrowing of patent rights. No assurance can be given that our or\nour licensors’ patent applications or granted patents will have priority over any other patent or patent application involved in such a proceeding, or\nwill be held valid as an outcome of the proceeding;\n•\nother parties may independently develop similar or alternative products and technologies or duplicate any of our products and technologies, which\ncan potentially impact our market share, revenue, and goodwill, regardless of whether intellectual property rights are successfully enforced against\nthese other parties;\n•\nit is possible that our owned or licensed pending patent applications will not result in granted patents, and even if such pending patent applications\nissue as patents, they may not provide intellectual property protection of commercially\n51"

If our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage of our competitors’ products, technologies or services, our\ncompetitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business.\nFurther, to the extent that computation methods implemented by software included in our products or technologies are not protected by our patents, our\ndependence on copyright and trade secret protection may not provide adequate protection. In addition, the Supreme Court’s ruling in Alice Corporation Pty.\nLtd. v. CLS Bank International has narrowed the scope of patent protection available for computational methods in certain circumstances.\nThe measures that we use to protect the security of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may not be adequate, which could result in the\nloss of legal protection for, and thereby diminish the value of, such intellectual property and other rights.\nIn addition to pursuing patents on our technologies, we also rely upon trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and unfair competition laws, as well as license\nagreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual\nproperty rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated. In addition, we take steps to protect our intellectual property and\nproprietary technologies by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants,\ncorporate partners and, when needed, our advisors. Such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets\nand/or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements, and we may not be able to prevent\nsuch unauthorized disclosure. Moreover, if a party having an agreement with us has an overlapping or conflicting obligation to a third-party, our rights in\nand to certain intellectual property could be undermined. Monitoring unauthorized and inadvertent disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the\nsteps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate. If we were to enforce a claim that a third-party had illegally obtained and was\nusing our trade secrets, it would be expensive and time consuming, the outcome would be unpredictable, and any remedy may be inadequate. In addition,\ncourts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets.\nIn addition, competitors could purchase our products or technologies and attempt to replicate and/or improve some or all of the competitive advantages we\nderive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design their products or technologies around our protected\ntechnologies or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. If our intellectual property does not\nadequately protect our market share against competitors’ products or technologies, services and methods, our competitive position could be adversely\naffected, as could our business.\n52"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nWe have rights in some intellectual property that has been discovered through government funded programs and thus is subject to federal regulations\nsuch as “march-in” rights, certain reporting requirements, and a preference for U.S. industry. Compliance with such regulations may limit our\nexclusive rights, subject us to expenditure of resources with respect to reporting requirements, and limit our ability to contract with non-U.S.\nmanufacturers.\nSome of the intellectual property rights assigned to us and/or in-licensed to us have been generated through the use of U.S. government funding and are\ntherefore subject to certain federal regulations. For example, all of the intellectual property rights licensed to us under our license agreement with Princeton\nUniversity have been generated using U.S. government funds. As a result, the U.S. government has certain rights to intellectual property embodied in our\ncurrent or future products pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980. These U.S. government rights in certain inventions developed under a government-\nfunded program include a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the\nU.S. government has the right to require us to grant exclusive, partially exclusive, or non-exclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third-party if the\ngovernment determines that: (i) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention; (ii) government action is necessary to meet public\nhealth or safety needs; or (iii) government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations (also referred to as “march-in\nrights”). The U.S. government also has the right to take title to these inventions if we fail, or the applicable licensor fails, to disclose the invention to the\ngovernment, elect title, and file an application to register the intellectual property within specified time limits. In addition, the U.S. government may\nacquire title to these inventions in any country in which a patent application is not filed within specified time limits. Intellectual property generated under a\ngovernment funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements, compliance with which may require us, or the applicable licensor, to expend\nsubstantial resources. In addition, the U.S. government requires that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the\nsubject invention be manufactured substantially in the United States. The manufacturing preference requirement can be waived if the owner of the\nintellectual property can show that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would\nbe likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that, under the circumstances, domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible. This\npreference for U.S. manufacturing may limit our ability to license the applicable patent rights on an exclusive basis under certain circumstances.\nIf we enter into future arrangements involving government funding, and we make or license inventions that result from such funding, intellectual property\nrights to such discoveries may be subject to the applicable provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act. To the extent any of our current or future intellectual property\nis generated through the use of U.S. government funding, the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act may similarly apply. Any exercise by the government of\ncertain of its rights could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe depend on technology that is licensed to us by Princeton University. Any loss of our rights to this technology could prevent us from selling our\nproducts.\nSome technology that relates to analysis of nucleic acids is licensed exclusively to us from Princeton University, or Princeton. We do not own the patents\nthat underlie this license. Our rights to use this technology and employ the inventions claimed in the licensed patents are subject to the continuation of and\ncompliance with the terms of the license. Our principal obligations under our license agreement with Princeton are as follows:\n•\nroyalty payments;\n•\nannual maintenance fees;\n•\nusing commercially reasonable efforts to develop and sell a product using the licensed technology and developing a market for such product;\n•\npaying and/or reimbursing fees related to prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of patent rights; and\n•\nproviding certain reports.\nIf we breach any of these obligations, Princeton may have the right to terminate or modify the license, which could result in our being unable to develop,\nmanufacture and sell our products or a competitor gaining access to the relevant technology. Termination or certain modifications of our license agreement\nwith Princeton would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, we are a party to a number of other agreements that include licenses to intellectual property, including non-exclusive licenses. We may need to\nenter into additional license agreements in the future. Our business could suffer, for example, if any current or future licenses terminate, if the licensors fail\nto abide by the terms of the license, if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable, or if we are unable to enter into\nnecessary licenses on acceptable terms.\nAs we have done previously, we may need or may choose to obtain licenses and/or acquire intellectual property rights from third parties to advance our\nresearch or begin commercialization of our current or future products or services, and we cannot\n53"

We may fail to obtain any of these licenses or intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms. Even if we are able to obtain a license,\nit may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In that event, we may be required to expend\nsignificant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the\naffected products or services, which could materially harm our business and the third parties owning such intellectual property rights could seek either an\ninjunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation.\nLicensing of intellectual property is important to our business and involves complex legal, business and scientific issues. Disputes may arise between us\nand our licensors regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including:\n•\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n•\nwhether and the extent to which our technologies and processes infringe any intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing\nagreement;\n•\nwhether to take action to enforce any intellectual property rights against an allegedly infringing product or process of a third-party;\n•\nour right to sublicense patent and other rights to third parties;\n•\nour diligence obligations with respect to the use of licensed technology in relation to our development and commercialization of our products and\nservices, and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; and\n•\nthe ownership of inventions and know-how, such as intellectual property resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our\nlicensors and us and our partners.\nIf disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms,\nwe may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product or service, or the dispute may have an adverse effect on our results of\noperation.\nIn addition to agreements pursuant to which we in-license intellectual property, we may in the future grant licenses under our intellectual property, or sell\ncertain intellectual property. Like in-licenses, out-licenses can be complex and disputes may arise between us and our licensees, such as the types of\ndisputes described above. Moreover, licensees may breach their obligations, or we may be exposed to liability due to our failure or alleged failure to satisfy\nour obligations. Any such occurrence could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we or any of our partners is sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it would be costly and time consuming, and an\nunfavorable outcome in that litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success also depends on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and technologies and perform our services without\ninfringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign-issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in\nthe fields in which we are developing manufacturing, marketing and selling products and technologies and performing services. As part of a business\nstrategy to impede our successful commercialization and entry into new markets, competitors may allege that our products, technologies and/or services\ninfringe their intellectual property rights.\nWe could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against claims of infringement\nmade by third parties. Any adverse ruling by a court or administrative body, or perception of an adverse ruling, may have a material adverse impact on our\nability to conduct our business and our finances. Moreover, third parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive relief against us, which\ncould block our ability to offer one or more products, technologies or services and could result in a substantial award of damages against us. In addition,\nsince we sometimes indemnify customers, collaborators or licensees, we may have additional liability in connection with any infringement or alleged\ninfringement of third-party intellectual property. Intellectual property litigation can be very expensive, and we may not have the financial means to defend\nourselves or our customers, collaborators and licensees.\nBecause patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be pending applications, some of which are unknown to us, that may result in issued\npatents upon which our products, services or proprietary technologies may infringe. Moreover, we may fail to identify issued patents of relevance or\nincorrectly conclude that an issued patent is invalid or not infringed any of our products, services or proprietary technologies. There is a substantial amount\nof litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in our industry. If a third-party claims that we or any of our licensors, customers or\ncollaboration partners infringe upon a third-party’s intellectual property rights, we may have to:\n•\nseek to obtain licenses that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n54"

In the event of infringement or unauthorized use, we may file one or more infringement\nlawsuits, which can be expensive and time-consuming. An adverse result in any such litigation proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of\nbeing invalidated, being found to be unenforceable, and/or being interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing and/or\ncould impact the validity or enforceability positions of our other patents or those we license. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery\nrequired in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure\nduring this type of litigation.\nMost of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. They are, therefore, likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex\npatent litigation longer than we could. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the\nfunds necessary to continue our operations, continue our internal research programs, in-license needed technology, pursue, obtain or maintain intellectual\nproperty rights, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring our products, technologies or services to market.\nIn addition, patent litigation can be very costly and time-consuming. An adverse outcome in such litigation or proceedings may expose us or any of our\nfuture development partners to loss of our proprietary position, expose us to significant liabilities, or require us to seek licenses that may not be available on\ncommercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nOur issued patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or at the Patent Office or other administrative agency, which could\nhave a material adverse impact on our business.\nIf we or any of our partners were to initiate legal proceedings against a third-party to enforce a patent related to one of our products, technologies or\nservices, the defendant in such litigation could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States,\ndefendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace, as are validity challenges by the defendant against the subject patent\nor other patents before the USPTO. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including\nlack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement, failure to meet the written description requirement, indefiniteness, and/or failure to disclose the best mode\nor to claim patent eligible subject matter. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the\npatent intentionally withheld material information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Additional grounds for an\nunenforceability assertion include an allegation of misuse or anticompetitive use of patent rights, and an allegation of incorrect inventorship with deceptive\nintent. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the USPTO even outside the context of litigation. The outcome is unpredictable following legal\nassertions of invalidity and unenforceability. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that no invalidating prior art existed of\nwhich we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. These assertions may also be based on information known to us or the USPTO. If a\ndefendant or third-party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the claims\nof the challenged patent. Such a loss of patent protection would or could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their\nother clients or former employers to us, and/or that their other clients or former employers allegedly have rights in our intellectual property, which\ncould subject us to costly litigation.\nAs is common in the life sciences industry, we engage the services of consultants and independent contractors to assist us in the development of our\nproducts, technologies and services. Many of these consultants and independent contractors were previously employed at, or may have previously or may\nbe currently providing consulting or other services to, universities or other technology, biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our\ncompetitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims that our company, a consultant or an independent contractor inadvertently or\notherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other information proprietary to their former employers or their former or current clients. We may similarly be\nsubject to claims stemming from similar actions of an employee, such as one who was previously employed by another company, including a competitor or\npotential competitor.

This may include a competitor of ours. If a competitor has rights in our patents, the\ncompetitor or a licensee or related entity of the competitor may be able to make, use, sell, import, and/or export the patented technology without liability to\nus under our patents or the patents we license. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against\nthese claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management team. If we were not successful, we could lose valuable\nintellectual property rights.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe generally enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, and, as applicable,\nadvisors. These agreements generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property.\nHowever, those agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign or may be alleged to ineffectively assign intellectual property rights to us.\nFor example, even if we have a consulting agreement in place with an academic advisor pursuant to which such academic advisor is required to assign any\ninventions developed in connection with providing services to us, such academic advisor may not have the right to assign such inventions to us, as it may\nconflict with his or her obligations to assign all such intellectual property to his or her employing institution.\nIn addition, we sometimes enter into agreements where we provide services to third parties, such as customers. Under such circumstances, our agreements\nmay provide that certain intellectual property that we conceive in the course of providing those services is assigned to the customer. In those cases, we may\nnot be able to use that particular intellectual property in, for example, our work for other customers without a license.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could materially and negatively affect our business.\nFiling, prosecuting, maintaining, and defending patents on current and future products, technologies and services in all countries throughout the world\nwould be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the\nUnited States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the\nUnited States. Consequently, regardless of whether we are able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in the United States, we may not be\nable to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our\ninventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not pursued and\nobtained patent protection to develop their own products, technologies or services, and further, may export otherwise infringing products or technologies to\nterritories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as it is in the United States. These products, technologies or services may\ncompete with our products, technologies or services and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them\nfrom competing. Even if we pursue and obtain issued patents in particular jurisdictions, our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be\neffective or sufficient to prevent third parties from so competing. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an\nexpensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we\nwill not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems\nof certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly\nthose relating to biotechnology, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products,\ntechnologies or services in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in\nsubstantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted\nnarrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits\nthat we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\nAccordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from\nthe intellectual property that we develop or license and may adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, we and our partners also face the risk that our products or components thereof are imported, reimported, or exported into markets with\nrelatively higher prices from markets with relatively lower prices, which would result in a decrease of sales and any payments we receive from the affected\nmarket. Recent developments in U.S. patent law have made it more difficult to stop these and related practices based on theories of patent infringement.\n56"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nChanges in patent laws or patent jurisprudence could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products or\ntechnologies.\nAs is the case with other life science industry companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and\nenforcing patents involve both technological complexity and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing patents is costly, time-consuming and\ninherently uncertain. In addition, the America Invents Act, or the AIA, became effective on March 16, 2013.\nAn important change introduced by the AIA is that the United States transitioned to a “first-to-file” system for deciding which party should be granted a\npatent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third-party that files a patent application in the\nUSPTO after that date but before us could therefore be awarded a patent claiming or disclosing an invention of ours even if we had made the invention\nbefore it was made by the third-party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application, but\ncircumstances could prevent us from promptly filing patent applications on our inventions. Additionally, there can be a trade-off between obtaining an\nearlier filing date, and waiting to obtain additional data and/or further refine a patent application. In some circumstances, the effects of a decision to pursue\nan earlier filing or a later filing will not be known until prior art or third-party activities are subsequently discovered, such as by the USPTO or by a third-\nparty seeking to challenge patent rights. These circumstances may apply, for example, to patent applications prepared and filed around the time of the\nimplementation of the AIA, or with a priority application that preceded the implementation of the AIA.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patent holder may file a patent infringement suit and providing\nadditional opportunities for third parties to challenge an issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our owned and in-licensed U.S. patents, even\nthose issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower standard for evidence in USPTO proceedings compared to the standard for evidence in U.S. federal\ncourts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third-party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a\nclaim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a court action. Accordingly, a third-party may\ntry to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third-party in court. The\nAIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or\ndefense of our issued patents. In addition, the contours of the laws under the AIA are subject to further judicial interpretation and/or legislative changes.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, such as Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc.,\nAssociation for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. and Alice Corporation Pty.\nLtd. v. CLS Bank International, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners\nin certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty\nas to the value of patents, once obtained, including patents in the molecular biology analysis and diagnostic space in particular. Depending on decisions by\nthe U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could weaken\nour ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other\nrequirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these\nrequirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other\nprovisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application,\nresulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than\nwould otherwise have been the case. In some cases, our licensors may be responsible for these payments, thereby decreasing our control over compliance\nwith these requirements.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our\nbusiness may be adversely affected.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing\nother marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition by potential partners\nor customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build\nbrand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by\nowners of other registered trademarks. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then\nwe may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.\n57"

Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as\nopen source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. Some\nopen source licenses may contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of\nopen source software we use. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source\nlicenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This would allow our competitors to create similar products with\nless development effort and time, and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales.\nAlthough we intend to monitor any use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions, we do not intend, the terms of many open\nsource licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that any such licenses could be construed in a way that could impose\nunanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. Moreover, we cannot assure investors that our processes for\ncontrolling our use of open source software in our products will be effective. If we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license,\nwe could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our\nproducts, to discontinue the sale of our products if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source\ncode form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe use third-party software that may be difficult to replace or cause errors or failures of our products that could lead to lost customers or harm to our\nreputation.\nWe use software licensed from third parties in our products. In the future, this software may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at\nall. Any loss of the right to use any of this software could result in delays in the production of our products until equivalent technology is either developed\nby us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business. In addition, any errors or defects in third-party software or\nother third-party software failures could result in errors or defects or cause our products to fail, which could harm our business and be costly to correct.\nMany of these providers attempt to impose limitations on their liability for such errors, defects or failures, and, if enforceable, we may have additional\nliability to our customers or third-party providers that could harm our reputation and increase our operating costs.\nWe intend to maintain our relationships with third-party software providers and to seek software from such providers that does not contain any errors or\ndefects. Any failure to do so could adversely impact our ability to deliver reliable products to our customers and could harm our results of operations.\nNumerous factors may limit any potential competitive advantage provided by our intellectual property rights.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not\nadequately protect our business, provide a barrier to entry against our competitors or potential competitors, or permit us to maintain our competitive\nadvantage. Moreover, if a third-party has intellectual property rights that cover or impact our use of our technologies, we may not be able to fully use or\nextract value from our intellectual property rights. For example:\n•\nothers may be able to develop and/or use technologies that are similar to our technologies or aspects of our technologies but that does not cover\nthe claims of any our patents or patents that may issue from our patent applications or those we license;\n•\nwe or the licensor of our licensed-in patents might not have been the first to make the inventions disclosed and/or claimed in a pending patent\napplication that we own or license;\n•\nwe or the licensor of our licensed-in patents might not have been the first to file patent applications disclosing and/or claiming an invention;\n•\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies without infringing our or our licensors’ intellectual property rights;\n•\npending patent applications that we own or license may not lead to issued patents or may not result in the claims that we want (for example, as to\nthe scope of issued claims, if any);\n•\npatents, if issued, that we own or license may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result\nof legal challenges by our competitors or other third parties;\n58"

These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control\nelections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This\nmay prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our securities that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our\nstockholders.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or file our\nperiodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause adverse effects on our business and may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported\nfinancial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. The Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. Internal\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Effective internal control over financial reporting is\nnecessary for us to provide reliable financial reports in a timely manner. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess\nour internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation.\nWe cannot assure you that we will not experience future material weaknesses or that we will be able to successfully remediate any such material weakness\nin a timely manner or at all. If our independent registered public accounting firm is subsequently unable to conclude that our internal control over financial\nreporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our securities could\ndecline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities and we could be subject to shareholder\nlitigation. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control\nsystems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nFurther, in connection with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2021, our independent registered public accounting firm\nwas required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act. As of December 31, 2022, we qualified as a “non-accelerated filer” based on the market value of our common stock held by non-\naffiliates as of June 30, 2022 and revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. For as long as we are a non-accelerated filer, we will not be\nrequired to obtain an independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls, including in connection with this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAn independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management’s assessment might not. Consequently,\nif we choose not to obtain an independent assessment, there is a risk that we may not detect problems with our internal controls that otherwise might have\nbeen detected.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or\nmistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized\noverride of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be\ndetected.\nWe are a smaller reporting company, and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies could make our securities less\nattractive to investors.\nAs of June 30, 2021, the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million, causing us to no longer qualify as a “smaller\nreporting company” beginning with our first Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2022. However, as of June 30, 2022,\nthe market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates did not exceed $560.0 million and our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021\ndid not exceed $100.0 million. As a result, we once again qualified as a smaller reporting company effective as of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for\nthe quarterly period ended June 30, 2022, although we continued to be a large accelerated filer until the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConsequently, we qualify as a smaller reporting company and a non-accelerated filer for our 2023 reporting period, which allows us to immediately take\nadvantage of many exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies,\nincluding not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure\nobligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, but we still expect to incur substantial legal and financial\ncompliance costs. As we have chosen to avail ourselves of certain scaled disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, the content of\nour disclosures may differ from period to period. We may no longer qualify as a smaller reporting company in the future should the market value of our\ncommon stock held by non-affiliates as of the end of the second quarter of any given year once again exceed $700.0 million or our revenue as of the end of\nany fiscal year exceed $100.0\n61"

These anti-takeover provisions and\nother provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for stockholders or\npotential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors and could also delay\nor impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company.

As\na newer public company, we have only limited research coverage on our company by equity research analysts. If securities or industry analysts elect not to\ninitiate or continue to provide coverage of our company, the trading price for our securities would likely be negatively impacted. If one or more of the\nanalysts who covers us downgrades our securities or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities may\ndecline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our securities could\ndecrease, which might cause the price of our securities and trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the possibility that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our\ncommon stock.\nFuture sales in the public market of shares of our common stock, including shares issued upon exercise of our outstanding stock options, or the perception\nby the market that these sales could occur, could lower the market price of our common stock or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our\nsecurities.\nStockholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance stockholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert\ninfluence on our board of directors and management. Activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction or seek changes in the\ncomposition of our board of directors could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A proxy contest would require us to\nincur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by\nour board of directors and management, diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategy. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future\ndirection and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising\nfrom a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability which may result in the loss of potential business\nopportunities, make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives, or limit our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any\nof which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If individuals are ultimately elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it\nmay adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our stockholders. We may choose to initiate,\nor may become subject to, litigation as a result of the proxy contest or matters arising from the proxy contest, which would serve as a further distraction to\nour board of directors and management and would require us to incur significant additional costs. In addition, actions such as those described above could\ncause significant fluctuations in our stock price based upon temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the\nunderlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nSecurities class action litigation could divert our management’s attention and harm our business and could subject us to significant liabilities.\nThe stock markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the equity\nsecurities of life sciences and biotechnology companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline. In\nthe past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is\nespecially relevant for us because biotechnology and biopharma companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. Even if we\nare successful in defending claims that may be brought in the future, such litigation could result in substantial costs and may be a distraction to our\nmanagement and may lead to an unfavorable outcome that could adversely impact our financial condition and prospects.\nITEM 1B.

You should review the risks described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a provider of genome analysis solutions that can enable researchers and clinicians to reveal answers to challenging questions in biology and\nmedicine. Our mission is to transform the way the world sees the genome through OGM solutions, diagnostic services and software. We offer OGM\nsolutions for applications across basic, translational and clinical research, and for other applications including bioprocessing. Through our Bionano\nLaboratories business, we also provide diagnostic testing for patients with clinical presentations consistent with autism spectrum disorder and other\nneurodevelopmental disabilities. Through our BioDiscovery business, we offer an industry-leading, platform-agnostic software solution, which integrates\nnext-generation sequencing and microarray data designed to provide analysis, visualization, interpretation and reporting of copy number variants, single-\nnucleotide variants and absence of heterozygosity across the genome in one consolidated view. Through our Purigen business, we offer nucleic acid\nextraction and purification solutions using proprietary ITP technology.\nWe expect to see OGM adoption in cytogenomics, discovery research and cell bioprocessing quality control (QC). Within cytogenetics and molecular\npathology, we estimate the number of cytogenetic labs on a worldwide basis (excluding India and developing countries) to be approximately 10,000. We\nestimate that these labs analyze approximately 10.0 million samples per year. Additionally, we estimate the number of pharmaceutical and biotech\ncompanies that are engaged in research and development of various cell therapies that rely on methods, including cytogenetics, for QC of the cell\nmodification and manufacturing process to be approximately 1,400. Based on these estimates, we believe the economic potential for OGM in these markets\nis approximately $10.0 billion annually, $3.0 billion of which we attribute to cell bioprocessing QC. We believe there are additional potential future market\nopportunities for OGM including newborn screening, population genomics, and neurological and cardiological risk assessment which are not included in\nour estimates above.\nWe have incurred losses in each year since our inception. Our net losses were $132.6 million and $72.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, and\n2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $348.7 million.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses as we:\n•\nexpand our sales and marketing efforts to further commercialize our products;\n•\ncontinue research and development efforts to improve our existing products;\n•\nhire additional personnel;\n•\nenter into collaboration arrangements, if any;\n•\nadd operational, financial and management information systems; and\n•\nincur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company.\nAccordingly, based on recurring losses from operations incurred since inception, the expectation of continued operating losses, and the need to raise\nadditional capital to finance our future operations, we determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within 12\nmonths of this Annual Report.\nMacroeconomic and Geopolitical Developments\nWe are subject to additional risks and uncertainties as a result of adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic developments, such as the ongoing conflict\nbetween Ukraine and Russia and related sanctions, any lingering effects of COVID-19 and uncertain market conditions, including inflation and supply\nchain disruptions, which could continue to have a material impact on our business and financial results.\nFollowing the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the U.S. and global financial markets experienced volatility, which has led to disruptions to trade, commerce,\npricing stability, credit availability, supply chain continuity and reduced access to liquidity globally. In response to the invasion, the United States, United\nKingdom and European Union, along with others, imposed significant new sanctions and export controls against Russia, Russian banks and certain Russian\nindividuals and may implement additional sanctions or take further punitive actions in the future. The full economic and social impact of the sanctions\nimposed on Russia and possible future punitive measures that may be implemented, as well as the counter measures imposed by Russia, in addition to the\nongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which could conceivably expand into the surrounding region, remains uncertain; however, both the\nconflict and related sanctions have resulted, and could continue to result, in disruptions to trade, commerce, pricing stability, credit availability, supply\nchain continuity and reduced access to liquidity on acceptable terms, in both Europe and globally, and has introduced significant uncertainty into global\nmarkets. As a result, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia and related\nsanctions, particularly to the extent it escalates to involve additional countries, further economic sanctions or wider military conflict.\n66"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nWe closely monitor and comply with various applicable guidelines and legal requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result of COVID-\n19 and actions taken to reduce its spread, we could see additional supply chain disruptions that impact our ability to produce our products and may cause us\nto make strategic determinations regarding, among other things, the cost and quality of the components and supplies we acquire. We may also see negative\neffects on enrollment in our ongoing or future clinical studies. At various times throughout the pandemic, we have been unable to visit certain customer\nsites to support installation or service our OGM systems. Our manufacturing partners, suppliers, and customers have implemented similar operational\nreductions. This overall reduction in activity has contributed to a decrease in sales which negatively impacted our financial results in fiscal years 2021 and\n2022. The future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, if any, are unknown and our financial results may continue to be negatively affected as a result. The\nCOVID-19 pandemic may also have long-term effects on the nature of the office environment and remote working, which may present strategy,\noperational, talent recruiting and retention and workplace culture challenges that may adversely affect our business.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we experienced supply chain challenges, which we largely attribute to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic did not prevent us from operating our business during the twelve months ended December  31, 2022 and 2021, we\nexperienced increased costs to secure certain component parts in our products and to produce our products at our contract manufacturers. We expect these\nincreased costs to remain high as the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine-Russia conflict and their respective effects persist. As global economic conditions\nrecover, business activity may not recover as quickly as anticipated, and it is not possible at this time to estimate the long-term impact that these and related\nevents could have on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. For instance,\nproduct demand may be reduced due to an economic recession, a decrease in corporate capital expenditures, prolonged unemployment, rising inflation\nrates, labor shortages, reduction in consumer confidence, adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic developments, or any similar negative economic\ncondition. Further, the travel restrictions on our business have limited our ability to support our global and domestic operations, including providing\ninstallation and training and customer service, which has and may continue to slow the pace of our commercial strategy, sales and marketing efforts. These\nnegative effects could have a material impact on our operations, business, earnings, and liquidity.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenue\nWe generate product revenue from sales of our systems and consumables, which includes our instruments, and our NxClinical™ software. We currently sell\nour systems for research use only applications and our customers are primarily laboratories associated with academic and governmental research\ninstitutions, academic and commercial clinical laboratories, as well as pharmaceutical, biotechnology and contract research companies. In addition, we\nprovide instruments to certain customers under our reagent rental program, under which we provide an instrument to customers at no cost and the\ncustomers agree to purchase minimum quantities of consumables. Consumable revenue consists of sales of reagents and chips necessary to process a\nsample. Sales of our NxClinical™ software, which provides customers with solutions for analysis, interpretation and reporting of genomics data, are made\non a subscription basis. We generate service revenue from the sale of diagnostic testing services for those with autism spectrum disorder and other\nneurodevelopmental disabilities through Bionano Laboratories, as well as services performed related to customer sample evaluations using the Saphyr\nsystem. Other revenue consists of warranty and other service-based revenue, including support, repair and maintenance services.\n67"

For the year ended December 31, 2022, our installed base grew to 240 Saphyr systems compared to the 164\nsystems for the year ended December 31, 2021. We expect the number of Saphyr placements to continue to grow during 2023, driven by increased market\nawareness and additional published data demonstrating the utility of OGM solutions.\nConsumables revenue increased $0.9 million, or 16%, to $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31,\n2021. The increase in consumable revenue was attributable to higher Saphyr consumables sales given the growth of the instrument installed base.

The increase in cost of service and other revenue is primarily due to increased service costs on our growing installed base\nas well as increased costs to support the service offerings from Bionano Laboratories.\nProduct gross profit increased $2.3 million, or 106%, to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $2.2 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to a change in product mix, where NxClinical™ software revenue represented 25% of product sales in\n2022 compared to 8% in 2021, offset by an increase in product costs resulting from unfavorable flowcell yields in the production cycle and other inventory\nwrite offs.\nService and other gross profit decreased by $0.2 million, or 13%, to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1.7 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2021.

The increase is primarily due to a $19.4 million increase in compensation expenses, of which $9.9 million\nrelates to stock-based compensation expense. The increase in compensation expense is primarily driven by increased headcount. We anticipate future\nadditions to our development teams as well as continued increases to our product development costs and, thus, future increases to R&D expenses. This\nincrease was further driven by a $5.6 million increase in product development costs, including internal materials and supply consumption costs, foundry\nexpenses, clinical trial research, and consulting costs.\nWe expect R&D expenses to increase in 2023 relative to 2022 as we have added headcount in order to support our efforts to develop more scalable and\nefficient manufacturing workflows, expand the utility of Saphyr, and develop the next versions of OGM products – including integration of OGM data into\nour NxClinical software.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $30.1 million, or 51%, to $88.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $58.5\nmillion for the same period in 2021. The increase is primarily due to a $16.7 million increase in compensation expenses, of which $2.8 million relates to\nstock-based compensation, a $4.4 million increase in amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of BioDiscovery and Purigen, a $3.2 million\nincrease in marketing expenses, and a $1.8 million increase in other headcount-related expenses. Other headcount-related expenses included the cost of\nrecruiting, temporary employment, and facilities expenses incurred in order to support increased product demand.\nThe increase in compensation expense is driven primarily by increased headcount. This is due to growth in our global sales, service, and back-office teams\nto facilitate the expanding customer base, as well as headcount additions attributed to the acquisition of Purigen. We anticipate headcount additions to our\nglobal sales, service and back-office teams in the coming 12\n70"

While we expect headcount to continue to grow, we anticipate that headcount will grow at a slower pace than the trailing twelve months.\nWe expect selling, general, and administrative expenses to increase in 2023 due to our continuing investment in growing and supporting our customer base.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased by $0.6 million, or 68%, to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $0.9 million for the same period\nin 2021. In May 2021, we paid off the outstanding principal balance of our March 2019 Loan and Security Agreement (Innovatus LSA).\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased by $1.3 million, or 539%, to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $0.2 million for the same period\nin 2021 resulting from positive returns on investments. We did not hold available for sale securities until August 2021. Our total available-for-sale\nsecurities balance was $108.1 million as of December 31, 2022.\nGain on forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program loan\nA gain on forgiveness of our Paycheck Protection Program loan (PPP Loan) of $1.8 million was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 in\nconnection with the forgiveness of the PPP Loan, including all accrued interest in full.\nLoss on debt extinguishment\nA loss on debt extinguishment of $2.1 million was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 in connection with our payment in full of the\nInnovatus LSA, including all accrued interest, an end of term fee, a prepayment fee, and write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs\nIncome tax benefit (expense)\nIncome tax expense increased by $7.6 million, or 133%, to a $1.9 million expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to a $5.7 million\nbenefit for the same period in 2021, driven by the acquisition of BioDiscovery. We adjusted the business combination accounting for the tax impact of the\nBioDiscovery acquisition within the one year measurement period for the acquisition. The effect of the adjustment was to decrease the net deferred tax\nliability and decrease goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition by $1.8 million, which increased the valuation allowance associated with our\ndeferred taxes by $1.8 million, which we recorded to deferred tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations. We incurred net losses of $132.6 million and $72.4 million, and\nused $124.8 million and $71.9 million of cash from our operating activities for the years ended December  31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $348.7 million, cash and cash equivalents of $5.1 million and $108.1 million in available-for-sale\nsecurities.\nSources of Liquidity\nIn the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have generated cash flows from sales of common stock and other equity instruments. We anticipate\nthat future sources of liquidity will principally come from sales of common stock and other equity instruments, borrowings from credit facilities and\nrevenue from our commercial operations. Revenue from our commercial operations has increased due to our acquisition of revenue-positive BioDiscovery.\nSee Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our recent equity activity and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for a\ndiscussion of terms and provisions of our debt included in this Annual Report. See the section below entitled “Capital Resources” for a discussion of our no\nlonger qualifying as a well-known seasoned issuer and its impacts on our ability to generate liquidity.\nFuture Capital Requirements\nWe expect that our near and longer-term liquidity requirements will consist of working capital and general corporate expenses associated with the growth\nof our business, including, without limitation, expenses associated with scaling up our operations and continuing to increase our manufacturing capacity,\nsales and marketing expense, increasing market awareness of our products and services to target customers, instrument placements with customers via the\nreagent rental sales strategy, additional research and development expenses associated with expanding our offerings, expenses associated with continuing to\nbuild out our corporate infrastructure and expenses associated with being a public company. Our short-term capital expenditure needs relate primarily to the\nongoing build out of our facilities, service lab and service-related capabilities, research and development expenses related to current and future product\nofferings, and enhancements to information technology. We expect such expenditures to continue throughout 2023.\n71"

Accordingly, based on recurring losses from\noperations incurred since inception, the expectation of continued operating losses, and the need to raise additional capital to finance our future operations,\nwe determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months after the date that the financial statements\nincluded in this Annual Report are issued. As a result, in order to continue to operate our business beyond that time, we will need to raise additional funds.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate funds on terms acceptable to us, on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, we have based\nthis estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we currently anticipate.\nCash Flows\nWe derive cash flows from operations primarily from the sale of our products and services. Our cash flows from operating activities are also significantly\ninfluenced by our use of cash for operating expenses to support the growth of our business. We have historically experienced negative cash flows from\noperating activities as we have developed our technology, expanded our business and built our infrastructure and this may continue in the future.

Our cash flows from operating activities are also significantly\ninfluenced by our use of cash for operating expenses to support the growth of our business. We have historically experienced negative cash flows from\noperating activities as we have developed our technology, expanded our business and built our infrastructure, and this may continue in the future. We\nanticipate our use of cash in operating activities to increase in the next 12 to 24 months due to anticipated increases in headcount and ongoing support of\nour growing operations, including R&D operations and servicing our expanding commercial footprint. As discussed below, we anticipate our available cash\nbalance will not be sufficient for the next twelve months from the issuance of this report. We plan to raise additional capital to fulfill our operating and\ncapital requirements for at least 12 months through public or private equity or debt financings, however, we may not be able to secure such financing in a\ntimely manner or an favorable terms, if it all.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $124.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $71.9 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. The increase in cash used in operating activities of $52.9 million is attributed to increased headcount of 35% across the business,\nincreased professional fees to support ongoing business operations and increase our international presence and increased spending on materials and\nsupplies during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nInvesting Activities\n2022 Compared to 2021\nHistorically, our primary investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures for the purchase of capital equipment to support our expanding\ninfrastructure, as well as the acquisitions of Lineagen, BioDiscovery and Purigen to grow our business. We expect to continue to incur additional costs for\ncapital expenditures related to these efforts in future periods. Net cash provided by investing activities was $82.8 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, compared to $278.1 million used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase in cash provided by\ninvestment activities of $360.8 million is attributed to sales of available-for-sale investments and is offset by the acquisition of Purigen, our new wholly\nowned subsidiary.\nFinancing Activities\n2022 Compared to 2021\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $23.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $336.1 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, a decrease of $313.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we raised approximately $311.1 million in net proceeds from\nexecuting two follow-on offerings, $10.0 million from warrant and stock option exercises, and $29.9 million in sales under our at-the-market facilities with\nLandenburg Thalmann & Co.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we\nraised approximately $23.1 million in gross proceeds from sales under the Cowen ATM.\nCapital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $5.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, $108.1 million of available-for-sale securities, and $121.4\nmillion of working capital.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we sold 27.0 million shares of our common stock under our prior at-the-market facility at an average share price of\n$0.82, and received gross proceeds of approximately $22.1 million before deducting offering costs of $0.6 million. In January 2021, we sold an additional\n6.3 million shares of our common stock under the prior at-the-market facility at an average share price of $2.68, and received gross proceeds of\napproximately $16.9 million before deducting offering costs of $0.4 million. This at-the-market facility was terminated effective March 22, 2021 and\nreplaced by an at-the-market facility with Cowen (the Cowen ATM).\nOn January 12, 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering of 33.4 million shares of our common stock, including 4.4 million shares of our\ncommon stock sold pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise in full of their option to purchase additional shares. The price to the public in the offering was\n$3.05 per share and the underwriters purchased the shares from us pursuant to the underwriting agreement at a price of $2.87 per share. The gross proceeds\nto us were approximately $101.8 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses.\nOn January 19, 2021, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-252216) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission, or SEC, as a “well-known seasoned issuer.” The registration statement allows us to issue an indeterminate number or amount of common\nstock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants from time to time in one or more offerings. However, there can be no assurance that we will complete\nany future offerings of securities. Any future offerings under this registration statement will be dependent upon, among other factors, market conditions,\navailable pricing, our financial condition, investor perception of our prospects and our capital needs. Further, as of the date of this Annual Report, the\nworldwide market value of our voting and non-voting common equity held by our non-affiliates did not equal $700.0 million or more, calculated as of a\ndate within 60 days prior to filing, and, consequently, we are no longer a well-known seasoned issuer. We may continue to use our automatic shelf\nregistration statement but only for a limited time and only if we follow the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities\nAct), the rules promulgated thereunder and the guidance of the SEC relating to a former well-known seasoned issuer utilizing an automatic shelf\nregistration statement. We anticipate filing a new shelf registration statement after filing this Annual Report; however, we anticipate being unable to raise\nadditional capital as efficiently as when we could rely on our automatic shelf registration statement, and raising capital may take more time and be more\ncostly as a result.\nOn January 25, 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering pursuant to our shelf registration statement of 38.3 million shares of our common\nstock, including 5.0 million shares of our common stock sold pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise in full of their option to purchase additional shares. The\nprice to the public in the offering was $6.00 per share and the underwriters purchased the shares from us pursuant to the underwriting agreement at a price\nof $5.64 per share. The gross proceeds to us were approximately $230.0 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other\noffering expenses.\nWe have in place the Cowen ATM, as amended, pursuant to which we may offer and sell from time to time up to $200.0 million of shares from the date of\nthe amendment going forward through or to Cowen, acting as sales agent or principal. In the third quarter of 2021, we sold 2.3 million shares of common\nstock under the Cowen ATM at an average share price of $6.15 per share, and received gross proceeds of approximately $13.9 million before deducting\noffering costs of $0.6 million. In the third quarter of 2022, we sold approximately 6.6 million shares of common stock under the Cowen ATM at an average\nshare price of $3.46 per share, and received gross proceeds of approximately $23.1 million before deducting offering costs of $0.6 million. In January,\nFebruary and March 2023, we sold approximately 9.5 million shares of common stock under the Cowen ATM and received gross proceeds of\napproximately $15.2 million before deducting offering costs of $0.4 million.\nWe performed an analysis of our ability to continue as a going concern. We believe, based on our current business plan, that our existing cash and cash\nequivalents will not be sufficient for the next twelve months from the issuance of this report. We plan to continue to fund our losses from operations\nthrough cash and cash equivalents on hand, as well as through public or private equity or debt financings. There can be no assurance that additional funds\nwill be available when needed from any source or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to us. Even if we raise additional capital, we\nmay also be required to modify, delay or abandon some of our plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and\nfinancial condition and our ability to achieve our intended business objectives. Any of these actions could materially harm our business, results of\noperations and future prospects. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong,\n73"

See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in\nthis Annual Report for more information.\nContingent Consideration\nAs part of the merger agreement related to the acquisition of BioDiscovery, we agreed to pay a milestone payment of $10.0 million in cash contingent on\nthe achievement of a commercial milestone within eighteen months of the acquisition date. We determined the fair value of the milestone consideration\nusing a scenario-based technique, as the trigger for payment is event driven. The outcome of the milestone consideration is binary, meaning the milestone is\neither achieved or not achieved, and the only other variable factor is the timing of when the milestone is achieved. We determined it is highly likely that the\nmilestone will be achieved and therefore used a 95% probability factor which is applied to the $10.0 million milestone consideration.\nAs part of the merger agreement related to the acquisition of Purigen, we agreed to pay two independent milestone payments up to an aggregate of $32.0\nmillion.\nThe fair value of the Purigen milestones are reassessed on a quarterly basis using a probability weighted model and a Monte Carlo Simulation. We\ndetermined the fair value of this milestone consideration using a scenario-based technique, as the trigger for payment is event driven. We determined the\nlikelihood of each independent milestone and used probability factors ranging from 20% to 80% which were applied to the individual payments. A Monte\nCarlo Simulation was performed to determine the likelihood that the milestone will be achieved and was applied to the milestone consideration payment.\nBased on these valuation assumptions, the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities was determined to be $22.4 million as of December 31,\n2022, $9.4 million of which is current as of December 31, 2022.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our future cash outflows for contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022.\nPayments Due by Period\nTotal\nLess than 1 Year\n1-3 Years\n3-5 Years\nMore than 5 years\nOperating lease obligations, including interest\n$\n9,042,000 \n$\n2,586,000 \n$\n5,472,000 \n$\n984,000 \n$\n— \nFinance lease obligations, including interest, related party\n7,287,000 \n322,000 \n668,000 \n703,000 \n5,594,000 \nPurchase obligations\n1,350,000 \n1,350,000 \n— \n— \n— \nTotal contractual obligations\n$\n17,679,000 \n$\n4,258,000 \n$\n6,140,000 \n$\n1,687,000 \n$\n5,594,000 \nOperating lease obligations relate to our office, laboratory and manufacturing space for our corporate headquarters in San Diego, California, Bionano\nLaboratories operations in Salt Lake City, Utah, and Purigen office and laboratory space in Pleasanton, California. Finance lease obligations relate to our\nBioDiscovery office in El Segundo, California. See Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in this\nAnnual Report.\nPurchase obligations primarily represent commitments for purchases of inventory from our supplier as disclosed in Note 11, Commitments and\nContingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which\nhave been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These accounting principles require us to make\ncertain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as\nthe reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable\nbased upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. To the extent there are material differences\nbetween these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. Historically, revisions to our estimates have\nnot resulted in a material change to our financial statements. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our\nconsolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, the significant accounting estimates that we believe are important to aid in\nfully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nWe recognize compensation expense for employees based on an estimated grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing method. We have\nelected to account for forfeitures as they occur. \n74"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nThe inputs for the Black-Scholes valuation model require management’s significant assumptions. The common share price was determined by using the\nquoted price on the grant date. The risk-free interest rates were based on the rate for U.S. Treasury securities at the date of grant with maturity dates\napproximately equal to the expected life at the grant date. The expected life was based on the simplified method in accordance with the SEC Staff\nAccounting Bulletin Nos. 107 and 110. The expected volatility was estimated based on historical volatility information of peer companies that are publicly\navailable. Our expected dividend yield assumption is zero as we have never paid dividends and have no present intention to do so in the future.\nGoodwill\nWe review goodwill annually at the reporting unit level at the same time every year or when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is\nreasonably possible that an impairment may exist. We have established December 31 as the annual impairment test date. We first make a qualitative\nassessment as to whether goodwill is impaired and if it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, we perform a quantitative impairment analysis to\ndetermine if goodwill is impaired. We may also determine to skip the qualitative assessment in any year and move directly to the quantitative test. For the\nquantitative test, we determine the fair value of the reporting unit, then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. Goodwill\nimpairment is recorded for any excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the\nreporting unit. The determination of fair value requires a number of significant assumptions and judgments, including assumptions about future economic\nconditions, revenue growth, operating margins, and discount rates.\nWe have determined that we are a single reporting unit for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2022, we performed a qualitative\nassessment of goodwill impairment which included an evaluation of changes in industry, market and macroeconomic conditions as well as consideration of\nour financial performance and any significant trends. Our qualitative assessment indicated that it was not more likely that not that goodwill is impaired. No\nimpairments of goodwill were reported during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in accounting for acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the\nidentifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of\nconsideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best\nestimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where\napplicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from\nthe acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the\nconclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent\nadjustments are required to be recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.\nAccounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including\nestimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration, where applicable.\nAlthough we believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical\nexperience and information obtained from management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain.\nWe generally use the income approach to derive the fair value of the above identified intangible assets when accounting for business combinations. This\napproach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a\nrisk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures the value of our income\nproducing assets. This approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in\nworking capital use, appropriate discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent\nwith our business plans. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset. Actual results\nmay differ from management’s estimates.\nWe record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. On a quarterly basis, we revalue this\nobligation and record any increase or decrease in fair value as an adjustment to the consolidated statement of operations. Changes to the fair value of the\ncontingent consideration obligation may result from changes to the discount rate, the passage of time, or changes in our estimate of the likelihood or timing\nof achieving the criteria for payment of the contingent consideration. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these\nassumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent reporting period. Accordingly, changes in the assumptions described above could have a\nmaterial impact on the amount of income or expense we record for contingent consideration in any given period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2, ‘‘Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,’’ in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this\nAnnual Report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\n75"

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business. These risks\nprimarily relate to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and inflation.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had approximately $5.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $108.1 million in available for sale securities as of December 31, 2022, which include\nhighly liquid, investment grade debt securities. Such interest-bearing instruments are exposed to a certain degree of interest rate risk. The primary objective\nof our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. We do not enter into\ninvestments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. To achieve\nthis objective, we invest in highly liquid and high-quality government and other debt securities. To minimize our exposure due to adverse shifts in interest\nrates, we invest primarily in short-term securities.\nAlthough we are seeing, and expect to continue to see, increased interest rates, due to our investment in highly liquid and high quality government and\nother debt securities as well as short-term securities, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not expect anticipated changes in interest\nrates to have a material effect on our interest rate risk in future reporting periods. Due to the short holding period of our investments and the nature of our\ninvestments, a hypothetical change of 100 basis points would have approximately a $0.4 million impact on our investments.\nOur liabilities for acquisition-related contingent consideration, which is adjusted to fair value each reporting period, is also impacted by changes in interest\nrates. The risk-free interest rate used to estimate our weighted average cost of capital is a component of the discount rate used to calculate the present value\nof future cash flows due upon the achievement of certain milestones. As a result, any changes in the underlying risk-free interest rate could result in\nmaterial changes to the fair value of such liabilities and could materially impact the amount of non-cash expense (or income) recorded each reporting\nperiod. As a consequence of the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates, the underlying risk-free interest rate we use for purposes of calculating fair\nvalue of our liabilities for acquisition-related contingent consideration has increased from our prior reporting periods, but such increase did not have a\nmaterial impact on our financial statements, and we currently do not expect anticipated future changes to have a material effect in future reporting periods.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than our U.S. dollar functional currency. Transactional exposure arises where transactions occur in\ncurrencies other than the functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.\nThe resulting monetary assets and liabilities are translated into the appropriate functional currency at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date and\nthe resulting gains and losses are reported in foreign currency translation adjustments in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of\ncomprehensive loss. Our foreign currency exposures are primarily concentrated in the British Pound, Chinese Renminbi, Euro, and Canadian dollar. We do\nnot currently participate in material foreign exchange hedging activities.\nAdditionally, we have operations outside of the United States. The functional currency of each foreign subsidiary is generally the local currency. We are\nexposed to foreign currency exchange risk as the functional currency financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. The assets\nand liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries having a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate\nprevailing at the balance sheet date, and at the average exchange rate for the reporting period for revenue and expense accounts. The cumulative foreign\ncurrency translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity. The reported results of our\nforeign subsidiaries will be influenced by their translation into U.S. dollars by currency movements against the U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, we had minimal assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and expect similar levels of foreign currency denomination in\nthe next 12 months. We believe a hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2022 would not have a material impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.\nInflation\nGeopolitical and macroeconomic developments, including the on-going conflict between Ukraine and Russia and related sanctions and the COVID-19\npandemic, have contributed to supply chain challenges, which we believe have resulted in inflation headwinds, particularly increased logistical costs and\nraw material prices. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we experienced increased costs to secure certain component parts in our products and to\nproduce our products at our contract manufacturers. However we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition\nor results of operations, other than its impact on the general economy, as our cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was not significantly\nimpacted by the cost increases we experienced. While the effects of the above-described geopolitical and macroeconomic developments, as well as other\ninflationary pressures, are highly uncertain, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not expect anticipated changes in inflation to have a\nmaterial effect on our business, financial condition or\n76"

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the\nrelated consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes\n(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended,\nin conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern Uncertainty\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in\nNote 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a\ngoing concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that\nmight result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not\nrequired to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis\nfor our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAcquisition of Purigen Biosystems, Inc.\nAs described in Note 14 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired Purigen Biosystems, Inc. for an estimated purchase\nprice of $44.9 million, which includes estimated contingent consideration for potential future payments to be made upon achievement of certain milestones.\nThe Company allocated the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired, including certain identifiable intangible assets such as\ndeveloped technology, and liabilities assumed.\n78"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nWe identified the determination of the fair values of the developed technology and contingent consideration as a critical audit matter. The principal\nconsiderations for our determination included the following: (i) the assumptions used by the Company in determining the fair value of the developed\ntechnology, specifically the revenue and expense forecasts and discount rate, and in determining the fair value of the contingent consideration, specifically\nthe probability of achievement of certain milestones and discount rate, are subjective and require significant judgment, and (ii) the fair values of the\ndeveloped technology and contingent consideration are sensitive to changes in those specific assumptions. Auditing these elements involved especially\nchallenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skill or\nknowledge needed.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\na.\nAssessing the reasonableness of the revenue and expense forecasts by evaluating: (i) historical performance of the target entity (ii) financial\nprojections against industry metrics and peer-group companies and (iii) management’s operating plan for future sales.\nb.\nEvaluating the reasonableness of the probability of milestones by evaluating available information that either corroborated or contradicted\nmanagement’s conclusions. Estimates of future sales were evaluated for reasonableness in relation to internal and external analyses.\nc.\nUtilizing personnel with specialized knowledge and skill in valuation to assist in: (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation models\nutilized in determining the valuation of developed technology and the contingent consideration (ii) assessing the reasonableness of the discount\nrates by computing an independently developed range using publicly available data from comparable entities and (iii) performing independent\nestimates to evaluate the potential effect of changes in the significant assumptions.\n/s/ BDO USA, LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020.\nSan Diego, CA\nMarch 9, 2023\n79"

(collectively, with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”) is a provider of genome analysis solutions that can enable\nresearchers and clinicians to reveal answers to challenging questions in biology and medicine. The Company offers OGM solutions for applications across\nbasic, translational and clinical research, and for other applications including bioprocessing. Through its Lineagen, Inc. (doing business as Bionano\nLaboratories, “Bionano Laboratories”) business, the Company also provides diagnostic testing for patients with clinical presentations consistent with\nautism spectrum disorder and other neurodevelopmental disabilities. Through its BioDiscovery, LLC (“BioDiscovery”) business, the Company also offers\nplatform-agnostic software solution, which integrates next-generation sequencing and microarray data designed to provide analysis, visualization,\ninterpretation and reporting of copy number variants, single-nucleotide variants and absence of heterozygosity across the genome in one consolidated view.\nThrough our Purigen Biosystems Inc. (“Purigen”) business, we offer nucleic acid extraction and purification solutions using proprietary isotachophoresis\n(“ITP”) technology.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nThe Company has experienced recurring net losses from operations, negative cash flows from operating activities, and significant accumulated deficit since\nits inception and expects to continue to incur net losses into the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $5.1 million\nin cash and cash equivalents, $108.1 million in short term investments, and working capital of $121.4 million.\nThe Company has an accumulated deficit of $348.7 million as of December 31, 2022. In 2022, the Company used $124.8 million cash in operations.\nManagement expects operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for at least the next year as the Company continues to incur costs related to\nresearch and commercialization efforts. Management has prepared cash flows forecasts which indicate that based on the Company’s expected operating\nlosses and negative cash flows, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within twelve months after the date\nthat the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, are issued. Management’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its\nability to raise additional funding. Management’s plans to raise additional capital to fulfill its operating and capital requirements for at least 12 months\ninclude public or private equity or debt financings. However, the Company may not be able to secure such financing in a timely manner or on favorable\nterms, if at all.\nFurthermore, if the Company issues equity securities to raise additional funds, its existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity\nsecurities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the Company’s existing stockholders.\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the\nnormal course of business, and do not include any adjustments to reflect the outcome of this uncertainty.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\") requires management to make\nsignificant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date\nof the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions used by\nmanagement include estimates of selling prices for multiple performance obligation arrangements, expected future cash flows including growth rates,\ndiscount rates, terminal values and other assumptions and estimates used in purchase accounting and to evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets and\ngoodwill, warranty reserves, certain accrued expenses, contingent liabilities, tax reserves, deferred tax rates and recoverability of the Company’s net\ndeferred tax assets, stock-based compensation expense, and related valuation allowances. Although the Company regularly assesses these estimates, actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. The Company bases its\nestimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the accounts of the Company’s 100%-owned subsidiaries.\nAll intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n86"

These reclassifications had no effect on\nthe reported results of operations.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounted for its acquisitions of BioDiscovery and Purigen using the acquisition method of accounting pursuant to Accounting Standards\nCodification Topic 805, Business Combinations (\"ASC 805\"). See Note 14, Acquisitions, for a more fulsome discussion of our acquisition of BioDiscovery\nand Purigen. Under ASC 805, the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded based\non their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess purchase price over the estimated fair value assigned to the tangible and identifiable\nintangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded to goodwill.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired with the assistance of independent valuations that use information and\nassumptions provided by the Company’s management.\nUnder ASC 805, acquisition-related transaction costs (such as advisory, legal, valuation, other professional fees) are expensed in the statements of\noperations in the periods incurred.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents primarily represent funds invested in readily available money market accounts. The Company has not experienced any losses in such\naccounts. The Company believes that it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash consists of cash restricted from withdrawal and usage and represents funds that are restricted related to the lease assumed in the acquisition\nof Purigen, which is further discussed in Note 14.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an\nasset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date.\nASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair\nvalue measurements. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized its financial assets and liabilities, based on the priority of the inputs to the\nvaluation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy as set forth below.\nLevel 1 – Assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the\ncompany has the ability to access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 – Assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices for similar attributes in active markets; quoted prices in markets where\ntrading occurs infrequently; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of\nthe asset or liability.\nLevel 3 – Assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and\nsignificant to the overall fair value measurement.\nIf the inputs used to measure the financial instruments fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that\nis significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.\nInvestment Securities\nAll investments have been classified as “available-for-sale” and are carried at fair value as determined based upon quoted market prices or pricing models\nfor similar securities at period end. Investments with contractual maturities less than 12 months at the balance sheet date are considered short-term\ninvestments. Investments with contractual maturities beyond one year are also classified as short-term due to the Company’s ability to liquidate the\ninvestment for use in operations within the next 12 months. Realized gains and losses on investment securities are included in earnings and are derived\nusing the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold. The Company has not realized any significant gains or losses on sales of\navailable-for-sale investment securities during any of the periods presented. As all the Company’s investment holdings are in the form of debt securities,\nunrealized gains and losses that are determined to be temporary in nature are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nA decline in the fair value of any security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and the establishment of a new\ncost basis for the\n87"

Interest income is recognized when earned, as are the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts on investment\nsecurities.\nConcentrations\nCredit Risks\nFinancial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and\naccounts receivable. The Company maintains deposits in federally insured major financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company\nhas not experienced any losses in such accounts and management believes that the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial\nposition of the depository institution in which those deposits are held.\nThe Company’s customers are located throughout the world. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. More information on\naccounts receivable is contained in the paragraph titled “Accounts Receivable” below.\nSources of Materials and Products\nThe materials and components for the Company’s product offerings are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company competes with\nother companies for production capacity, therefore, the Company is exposed to a risk of inventory being unavailable at acceptable prices, or at all, if\nsuppliers are unable (or decide) to provide sufficient levels of materials and components and the Company is unable to identify alternative suppliers.\nAccounts Receivable\nDecember 31,\n2022\nDecember 31,\n2021\nAccounts receivable, net:\nAccounts receivable, trade\n$\n7,315,000 \n$\n5,624,000 \nLess allowance for doubtful accounts\n(293,000)\n(690,000)\n$\n7,022,000 \n$\n4,934,000 \nThe Company extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business. For diagnostic testing services, receivables are based on either contractual\nrates with third-party payors, plus the amounts expected to be collected for any patient-responsibility portion, or for non-contracted arrangements, using the\namounts expected to be collected from third-party payors and/or the patient-customer based on historical collection experience. The Company does not\nperform credit evaluations and therefore subsequent adjustments to the amount expected to be collected are recorded to revenue.\nFor OGM products and services, credit is extended based upon an evaluation of each customer’s credit history, financial condition, and other factors.\nEstimates of allowances for doubtful accounts are determined by evaluating individual customer circumstances, historical payment patterns, length of time\npast due, and economic and other factors. Bad debt expense is recorded as necessary to maintain an appropriate level of allowance for doubtful accounts in\nselling, general and administrative expense. Amounts are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when collection efforts have been exhausted and\nare deemed uncollectible.\nAccounts receivable is subject to concentration risk whenever a customer has a balance that meets or exceeds 10% of the Company’s total accounts\nreceivable balance. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, no customers met or exceeded 10% of the Company’s total accounts receivable balance.\nInventory\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory is valued at standard cost. Inventory includes raw\nmaterials and finished goods that may be used in the research and development process and such items are expensed as consumed or expired. Provisions for\nslow-moving, excess, and obsolete inventories are estimated based on product life cycles, historical experience, and usage forecasts.\n88"

Property and equipment generally consist of laboratory\nequipment, computer and office equipment, furniture and fixtures, and leasehold improvements. Property and equipment are recorded at cost and\ndepreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally three to five years, or the remaining term of\nthe lease for leasehold improvements, whichever is shorter). Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred.\nIntangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized separately from goodwill and are initially recognized at their fair value at the\nacquisition date. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset on a basis that approximates the pattern of economic\nbenefit. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist. There was no indication of impairment of intangible\nassets for any of the periods presented.\nAs a result of the Lineagen, BioDiscovery, and Purigen acquisitions, the Company recorded intangible assets, which consist of trade name intangibles,\ncustomer relationship intangibles, and a developed technology intangible, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of\nfive years. Straight-line amortization was determined to be materially consistent with the pattern of expected use of the intangible assets.\nIf the Company identifies a change in the circumstances related to its long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets (other than\ngoodwill), that indicates the carrying value of any such asset may not be recoverable, the Company will perform an impairment analysis. A long-lived asset\n(other than goodwill) is not recoverable when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset (or asset group) are less than the asset’s\ncarrying amount. Any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, and would be\nrecorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating expense.\nDuring the years ended December  31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized no impairment losses on long-lived assets. Substantially all of the\nCompany's long-lived assets are located in the U.S.\nContingent Consideration\nThe Company recorded contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. On a quarterly basis, the\nCompany revalues this obligation and records any increase or decrease in fair value as an adjustment to the consolidated statement of operations. Changes\nto the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation may result from changes to the discount rate, the passage of time, or changes in the estimate of\nthe likelihood or timing of achieving the criteria for payment of the contingent consideration.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill\nBalance as of December 31, 2020\n$\n7,173,000 \nAcquisitions\n48,987,000 \nBalance as of December 31, 2021\n56,160,000 \nAcquisitions\n22,651,000 \nMeasurement period adjustments\n(1,522,000)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$\n77,289,000 \nGoodwill arises when the purchase price of an acquired business exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired, with such excess recorded as\ngoodwill on the balance sheet.

The Company has determined that it has a single operating segment and a single reporting\nunit.\nIn testing goodwill for impairment, the Company will first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the\nreporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is\nless than its carrying value, then the Company will perform a quantitative impairment analysis by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the\ncarrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. An impairment charge for goodwill is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of\nthe reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized no impairment losses on goodwill.\nLeases\nRight-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease\npayments arising from the lease. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in the consolidated\nbalance sheets, while finance leases are included in finance lease right-of-use assets and finance lease liabilities.\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company generally uses\nits incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments. The ROU\nassets also include any prepaid or accrued lease payments and is adjusted for lease incentives and initial direct costs.\nLease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease which are recognized when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that\noption. Leases with terms of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterms, or in some cases, the useful life of the underlying asset. Variable lease payments are excluded from the measurement of ROU assets and lease\nliabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The Company accounts for the lease and non-lease\ncomponents as a single lease component for all classes of underlying assets.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates revenue primarily from the sale of products and services. The Company considers revenue to be earned when all of the following\ncriteria are met: the Company has a contract with a customer that creates enforceable rights and obligations; promised products or services are identified;\nthe transaction price, or the amount the Company expects to receive, including an estimate of uncertain amounts subject to a constraint to ensure revenue is\nnot recognized in an amount that would result in a significant reversal upon resolution of the uncertainty, is determinable; and the Company has transferred\ncontrol of the promised items to the customer. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and\nis the unit of account in the contract. The transaction price for the contract is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in\nexchange for the goods and services expected to be transferred. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and\nrecognized as revenue when, or as, control of the distinct good or service is transferred.\nThe Company provides assurance type warranties on many of its products. As customers cannot purchase such warranties independently of the products\nunder the contract and they are not priced separately, assurance type warranties are not separate performance obligations.\nThe Company recognizes a receivable when we have an unconditional right to payment, which is generally at the time of delivery of software, consumables\nand instruments, including any extended warranties, or at the time services are rendered. Payment terms are typically 30 days for sales to customers in the\nUnited States but may be longer in international markets. The Company treats shipping and handling costs performed after a customer obtains control of\nthe good as a fulfillment cost and records these costs within selling, general and administrative expenses, less any amounts reimbursed by the customer,\nwhen the corresponding revenue is recognized.\nRevenue is recorded net of discounts and sales tax. The Company’s contracts typically do not provide for product returns or refunds. In general, estimates\nof variable consideration and constraints are not material to the Company’s financial statements. Employee sales commissions are recorded as selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses when incurred as the amortization period for such costs, if capitalized, would have been one year or less.\n90"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nProduct revenue recognition\nProduct revenue consists of sales of our Saphyr system and related consumables, as well as sales of software. These products are sold primarily through a\ndirect sales force, and within international markets, there is more reliance on distributors. In addition, the Company provides the Saphyr system to certain\ncustomers under its reagent rental program, under which the Company provides Saphyr systems to customers at no cost and the customers agree to\npurchase minimum quantities of consumables.\nTransfer of control for the Company's products is generally at shipment or delivery, depending on contractual terms, but occurs when title and risk of loss\ntransfers to the customer which represents the point in time when the customer obtains control of the product. Transfer of control of software is recognized\nat the point-in-time when the software license is transferred to the customer. As such the Company's performance obligation related to product sales is\nsatisfied at a point in time.\nFor transfers of instruments and consumables to customers under the Company's rental reagent program, the Company allocates the total contract\nconsideration between the instrument and the consumables based on estimates of stand-alone selling prices, and recognizes the instrument revenue evenly\nover the rental period, and the consumables revenue when the consumables are delivered. Rental revenue related to the reagent rental program recognized\nover-time totaled $0.4 million and $0.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nRevenue related to software license maintenance agreements is recognized over-time based on the contract term. Revenue recognized over-time related to\nsoftware sales totaled $0.4 million and $0.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nService and other revenue recognition\nService and other revenue primarily consist of revenue from diagnostic testing services, license maintenance agreements, software hosting arrangements,\nand support, repair and maintenance services and extended warranties on Saphyr systems.\nRevenue from the completion of diagnostic testing services is initially recorded at the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive from\ncontractual and non-contractual payors, and is subject to adjustment based on the amount actually collected. The Company performs its obligation under a\ncontract with a customer by processing diagnostic tests and communicating the test results, which the Company has determined is the point at which\ncontrol is transferred to the customer for revenue recognition purposes.\nRevenue for hosting arrangements is recognized over-time on a usage basis as the customer processes the number of genetic samples purchased with the\nsoftware. Hosting arrangements revenue recognized over-time totaled $0.5 million and $0.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\nRevenue from support and maintenance contracts and extended warranties is recognized over time based on the contract term, which represents a faithful\ndepiction of the transfer of goods and services given the stand-ready nature of the performance obligations. Service revenue related to repairs and customer\nsample evaluations is recognized as the services are performed based on the specific nature of the service. Warranty and maintenance revenue recognized\nover-time totaled $0.7 million and $0.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2022, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied was $1.0\nmillion. These remaining performance obligations primarily relate to extended warranty and support and maintenance obligations, as well as obligations\nrelated to software under hosting arrangements. The Company expects to recognize approximately 87.4% of this amount as revenue in 2023, 9.1% in 2024,\n3.3% in 2025 and 0.2% in 2026 and thereafter.\nWe periodically review the warranty reserve for adequacy and adjust the warranty accrual, if necessary, based on actual experience and estimated costs to\nbe incurred. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of product revenue. The Company's liability for product warranties provided under its\nagreements with customers was $0.5 million and $0.2 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Warranty expense recorded in cost of goods\nsold totaled $1.0 million and $0.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nContract assets primarily relate to the Company’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets\nat the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were immaterial.\nContract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. The Company records a contract\nliability, or deferred revenue, when it has an obligation to provide service, and to a much lesser extent product, to the customer and payment is received or\ndue in advance of performance. Deferred revenue primarily relates to support and maintenance contracts and extended warranty obligations. Contract\nliabilities are classified as other current\n91"

The Company recognized revenue of $0.7 million and $0.4 million during the\nyears ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which was included in the contract liability balance at the end of the previous year.\nDistributor Transactions\nIn certain markets, the Company sells products and provides services to customers through distributors that specialize in life sciences products. In cases\nwhere the product is delivered to a distributor, revenue recognition generally occurs when the distributors obtains control of the product. The terms of sales\ntransactions through distributors are generally consistent with the terms of direct sales to customers and do not contain return rights. Distributor sales\ntransactions typically differ from direct customer sales as they do not require the Company’s services to install the instrument at the end customer or\nperform the services for the customer that are beyond the standard warranty in the first year following the sale. These transactions are accounted for in\naccordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policy described herein.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue for products consists of the Company’s raw material parts costs and associated freight, shipping and handling costs, contract manufacturing\ncosts, royalties due to third parties, salaries and other personnel costs, equipment depreciation, overhead and other direct costs related to those sales\nrecognized as product revenue in the period.\nCost of service and other revenue consists of salaries and other personnel costs, and facility costs associated with costs related to warranties and other costs\nof servicing equipment at customer sites, and performance of diagnostics services.\nResearch and Development Costs\nCosts incurred for research and product development, including acquired technology and costs incurred for technology in the development stage, are\nexpensed as incurred.\nPatent Costs\nCosts related to filing and pursuing patent applications are recorded as selling, general and administrative expense and expensed as incurred since\nrecoverability of such expenditures is uncertain.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Company issues stock-based awards as compensation to employees and directors. Stock-based awards may include stock options, restricted stock\nunits, and performance stock units. These awards are accounted for as equity awards. To-date, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense\nnet of actual forfeitures on a straight-line basis over the underlying award’s requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, as measured\nusing the award’s grant date fair value. The Company determines grant date fair value of stock option awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing\nmodel. The fair value of restricted stock units and performance stock units are determined using the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the\ngrant date. For service based vesting grants, expense is recognized over the requisite service period based on the number of options or shares expected to\nultimately vest. For performance stock units, expense is recognized over the implicit service period, assuming vesting is probable. No expense is\nrecognized for the performance stock units if it is not probable the vesting criteria will be satisfied.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the\nexpected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are\ndetermined on the basis of the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the\nyear in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the\nperiod that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that the Company believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a\ndetermination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences,\nprojected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If management determines that the Company would be able to\nrealize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their recorded amount, management would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation\nallowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. Changes in the valuation allowance when they are recognized in the provision for income\ntaxes may result in a change in the estimated annual effective tax rate.\nThe Company recognizes the impact of uncertain tax positions at the largest amount that is “more likely than not” to be sustained upon audit by the relevant\ntaxing authority. An uncertain tax position will not be recognized if it does not have a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained. The Company\nrecognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense. Any accrued interest and penalties are included within the\nrelated tax liability.\n92"

The Company’s chief operating decision-\nmaker, the Chief Executive Officer, views the Company’s operations and manages its business as one operating segment.\nNet Loss Per Share\nBasic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net\nloss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding for the\nperiod. Common share equivalents are only included when their effect is dilutive. Pre-funded warrants from the Company's follow-on offering have been\ntreated as if they were common shares outstanding on the date of issuance. The Company’s potentially dilutive securities which include outstanding\nwarrants to purchase stock and outstanding stock options under the Company’s equity incentive plans have been excluded from the computation of diluted\nnet loss per share as they would be anti-dilutive to the net loss per share. Restricted stock is treated as outstanding for accounting purposes. For all periods\npresented, there is no difference in the number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted shares outstanding due to the Company’s net loss position.\nPotentially dilutive securities not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share because to do so would be anti-dilutive were as follows (in\ncommon stock equivalent shares):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\nCommon stock options\n24,022,000 \n12,765,000 \nCommon warrants\n4,356,000 \n4,356,000 \nUnvested restricted stock\n— \n5,006,000 \nRSUs\n96,000 \n361,000 \nPSUs\n290,000 \n290,000 \nTotal\n28,764,000 \n22,778,000 \nRecently Issued But Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU\n2016-13), which amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward looking approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses\non certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables and available-for-sale debt securities. The standard is effective for the company\nbeginning in the first quarter of 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact of ASU 2016-13 on its\nfinancial statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASC 842”) which\nrequires lessees to recognize leases on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASC 842 establishes a right-of-use\nmodel that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. ASC 842\nalso requires disclosures to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising\nfrom leases. The standard was adopted on January 1, 2021, as the Company lost its status as an Emerging Growth Company effective December 31, 2021,\nand therefore was required to adopt the standard for the year ending December 31, 2021, using the modified retrospective method. Under this transition\nmethod, the Company recognized and measured leases that existed at the adoption date in the audited consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2021. In\nconnection with the adoption of ASC 842, the Company elected the package of practical expedients requiring no reassessment of whether any expired or\nexisting contracts contain leases, the lease classification of any expired or existing leases, or initial direct costs for any existing leases. The Company also\nmade accounting policy elections not to apply the recognition requirements under ASC 842 to any short-term leases and to account for each separate lease\nand associated non-lease components as a single lease component for all the Company’s leases. The adoption of this new accounting standard resulted in\nincreased qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For further details, see\nNote 11, Commitments and Contingencies. The adoption of the new standard did not materially impact the Company’s consolidated results of operations.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities From\nContracts With Customers. This ASU requires an acquirer to account for revenue contracts acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC\n606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as if it had originated the contracts.

The Company determines the fair value of its\ninvestment securities based upon one or more valuations reported by its investment accounting and reporting service provider. The investment service\nprovider values the securities using a hierarchical security pricing model that relies primarily on valuations provided by an industry-recognized valuation\nservice. Such valuations may be based on trade prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or valuation models using inputs\nthat are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2 inputs), such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, yield curves, volatility factors, credit\nspreads, default rates, loss severity, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt, and broker and dealer quotes, as well as\nother relevant economic measures.\nThe following table presents the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nDecember 31, 2022\nTotal Fair Value\nand Carrying Value\non Balance Sheet\nFair Value Measurement Category\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nAssets:\nCommercial paper\n$\n20,020,000 \n$\n— \n$\n20,020,000 \n$\n— \nCorporate notes/bonds\n86,094,000 \n— \n86,094,000 \n— \nSecurities of government sponsored entities\n1,981,000 \n1,981,000 \nTotal investments:\n$\n108,095,000 \n$\n— \n$\n108,095,000 \n$\n— \nMoney market funds\n$\n1,868,000 \n$\n1,868,000 \n$\n— \n$\n— \nLiabilities:\nContingent consideration\n$\n22,352,000 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n22,352,000 \nDecember 31, 2021\nTotal Fair Value\nand Carrying Value\non Balance Sheet\nFair Value Measurement Category\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nAssets:\nCommercial paper\n$\n100,860,000 \n$\n— \n$\n100,860,000 \n$\n— \nCorporate notes/bonds\n125,181,000 \n— \n125,181,000 \n— \nSecurities of government sponsored entities\n— \n— \n— \n— \nTotal investments:\n$\n226,041,000 \n$\n— \n$\n226,041,000 \n$\n— \nMoney market funds\n$\n11,126,000 \n$\n11,126,000 \n$\n— \n$\n— \nLiabilities:\nContingent consideration\n$\n9,066,000 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n9,066,000 \nMoney Market Funds are classified as cash equivalents on the balance sheet.\nContingent consideration relates to the acquisitions of BioDiscovery and Purigen. The outcome of the milestone consideration for all contingent\nconsideration liabilities is binary, meaning the milestones are either achieved or not achieved, and the only other variable factor is the timing of when the\nmilestones are achieved. The fair value measurement of the contingent consideration liabilities is based on significant inputs not observed in the market\n(Level 3 inputs). These unobservable inputs represent a Level 3 measurement because they are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the\nCompany’s assumptions in measuring fair value.\nThe fair value of the BioDiscovery contingent consideration liability is reassessed on a quarterly basis using a probability weighted model. Assumptions\nused to estimate the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of BioDiscovery include the probability of\nachieving, or changes in timing, of certain milestones, and a discount rate. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, a discount\nrate of 3% was used.

The Company determined it is highly likely that the milestone related to the BioDiscovery acquisition will be achieved and\ntherefore used a 95% probability factor which is applied to the $10.0 million milestone consideration. The change in fair value of the contingent\nconsideration during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was due to the passage of time. During the year ended December 31,\n2022, the milestone consideration liability related to the BioDiscovery acquisition was reclassified from non-current liabilities to current liabilities.\nContingent consideration liabilities related to the Purigen milestones are related to the achievement of two independent milestones with aggregate possible\nmilestone payments totaling $32.0 million.\nThe fair value of the Purigen milestones are reassessed on a quarterly basis using a probability weighted model and a Monte Carlo Simulation.\nAssumptions used to estimate the acquisition date fair value of the milestones using a probability weighted model include the probability of achieving, or\nchanges in timing, of independent milestones, and a discount rate of 15.3%. The Company determined the fair value of this milestone consideration using a\nscenario-based technique, as the trigger for payment is event driven. The Company determined the likelihood of each independent milestone and used\nprobability factors ranging from 20% to 80% which were applied to the individual payments.

The LSA provided\na first term loan of $17.5 million, a second term loan of $2.5 million and a third term loan of $5.0 million (collectively, the “Term Loans”) if the Company\nsatisfied certain funding conditions. Interest on the Term Loans was due on the first of each month at a rate of 10.25% per annum in cash or a discounted\nrate of 7.25% in cash with 3.0% of the 10.25% per annum rate added to the principal of the loan and subject to accruing interest through the end of the\ninterest only payment period, which was scheduled to end March 1, 2022. At inception, the Company elected to pay interest in cash at a rate of 7.25% per\nannum and have 3.0% per annum of the interest added back to the outstanding principal.

In addition, upon the final repayment of the total amounts borrowed, the\nCompany was required to pay an end of term fee of $0.8 million.

The Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $2.1 million.\nThe LSA also provided for a revolving line of credit in an amount not to exceed $5.0 million (the “Revolver”), which was terminated effectively upon\npayment in full of the above term loan.\nThe LSA was collateralized by substantially all of the Company’s assets, including its intellectual property. The LSA required the Company to comply with\nvarious affirmative and negative covenants, including: (1) a liquidity covenant requiring the Company to maintain a minimum cash balance at all times in a\ncollateral account and (2) a revenue covenant requiring the Company to meet certain minimum revenue targets measured at the end of each calendar\nquarter.

As of September 30, 2019, the Company did not achieve the revenue covenant under the Innovatus LSA. As a\nresult, in October 2019, the Company obtained a waiver letter from Innovatus. Pursuant to the waiver letter, Innovatus agreed to allow the Company to cure\nits noncompliance with the revenue covenant as of September 30, 2019 so long as the Company (i) raised at least $10 million in gross proceeds from the\nsale of its securities in an underwritten public offering by October 31, 2019 and (ii) amended the warrant to purchase stock, issued by the Company to\nInnovatus in March 2019 to decrease the exercise price of the warrant from $4.63 per share to $0.48 per share. Also pursuant to the waiver letter, as\nconsideration for the prospective breach of a liquidity covenant, the Company agreed to issue to Innovatus $0.6 million shares of the Company's common\nstock. As a result of the amendment and shares issued, the Company recognized $0.6 million as a debt discount, which was being amortized as interest\nexpense over the remaining term of the LSA.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company did not achieve certain financial covenants under the Innovatus LSA. As a result, in March 2020, the Company\nand Innovatus entered into an amendment to the Innovatus LSA (the “Second Amendment”) to, among other things: (i) waive the events of default from\nnot achieving the specific financial covenants for the December 31, 2019 measurement date, (ii) require an immediate partial repayment of $2.1 million,\n(iii) require an additional partial repayment of $2.9 million on the earlier of completion of an Equity Event (as defined in the Second Amendment), or April\n30, 2020, (iv) modify the liquidity covenant, such that the Company’s minimum cash balance shall vary based on outstanding borrowing capacity under the\nRevolver (provided, however, that the Company shall maintain a minimum cash balance of $2 million at any given time), (v) reduce the dollar amount of\ncertain minimum revenue covenants measured as of the end of each calendar quarter (each, a “Revenue Covenant”) and (vi) modify the terms of certain\nevents of default. For example, the Second Amendment provides for a cure period in connection with the breach of certain minimum revenue financial\ncovenants, as long as the Company submits an updated management plan and financial projections, which are subject to Innovatus approval, and completes\na Qualified Financing Event (as defined in the Second Amendment) within 45 days of such breach.\nIn connection with the Second Amendment, the Company was obligated to pay Innovatus a waiver fee in the amount of $0.2 million and a prepayment fee\nof $0.1 million, payable in cash or in shares of the Company’s common stock at the Company's election, no later than following completion of the Equity\nEvent, as defined in the Second Amendment. The Company completed a follow-on public offering in April 2020 that constituted an Equity Event under the\nSecond Amendment. A portion of the proceeds from the follow-on offering were used to pay-down $2.9 million of principal balance outstanding under the\nTerm Loans in accordance with the Second Amendment. In addition, the Company issued 0.9 million shares of its common stock to Innovatus to satisfy the\n$0.2 million waiver fee and the $0.1 million prepayment fee due under the Second Amendment. As a result of the amendment and shares issued, the\nCompany recognized $0.3 million as a debt discount, which was being amortized as interest expense over the remaining term of the LSA. Also pursuant to\nthe Second Amendment, the Company subsequently registered such shares for resale on a registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Registration\nStatement”)\n100"

In\nDecember 2022, the Company executed a new lease, subject to the consent of a third party that was obtained in February 2023, for an additional 18,005\nsquare feet of office and laboratory space in San Diego, California that commences in April 2023 and expires in March 2024. Rent payments for the\nadditional space are $49,000 each month through the end of the lease term.\nIn August 2020, through the acquisition of Lineagen, the Company obtained a lease for approximately 9,710 square feet of office space in a Salt Lake City,\nUtah under a non-cancelable operating lease that expires in December 2026.\nIn November 2022, through the acquisition of Purigen, the Company obtained a lease for approximately 16,165 square feet of office and laboratory space\nin Pleasanton, California, under a non-cancelable operating lease agreement that expires in July 2027.\nFinance lease\nIn October 2021, through the acquisition of BioDiscovery, the Company obtained a finance lease of 4,786 square feet of office space in El Segundo,\nCalifornia that expires in February 2041.

Related Party Transactions for additional information.\nSupplemental information\nFor all leases, the Company has the ability to enter into renewal negotiations, prior to the lease end date, with no specific terms. At this time, it is not\nreasonably certain that we will extend the term of the lease and therefore the renewal period has been excluded from the aforementioned ROU asset and\nlease liability measurements. The leases are subject to variable charges for common area maintenance and other costs that are determined based on actual\ncosts and includes certain lease incentives such as tenant improvement allowances. The base rent for the leases is subject to an annual increase each year.\nRent expense is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The Company’s estimated incremental borrowing rate summarized in\nthe table below was used in its present value calculations as the operating and finance leases do not have a stated rate and the implicit rate was not readily\ndeterminable.

An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the financial statements if it is probable\nthat a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Based on the Company’s assessment, it currently does not have\nany material loss exposure as it is not a defendant in any claims or legal actions.\nContingent Consideration\nRefer to Note 4.

The\nfederal tax loss carryforwards include $282.9 million that do not expire but utilization is limited to 80% of the Company’s taxable income in any given tax\nyear based on current federal tax laws. The remaining federal tax loss carryforwards of $180.9 million and state tax loss carryforwards begin to expire in\n2027 and 2023, respectively, unless previously utilized. As of December  31, 2022, the Company also has federal and California research credit\ncarryforwards of $9.4 million and $8.8 million, respectively. The federal research credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2027 unless previously utilized.\nThe California research credits carry forward indefinitely.\nManagement assesses all available evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. The\nCompany has experienced net losses since inception, and the revenue and income potential of the Company’s business and market are unproven. Due to the\nCompany’s continuing research and development (\"R&D\") activities, the Company expects to continue to incur net losses into the foreseeable future. As\nsuch, the Company cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance of $122.0 million, and\n$83.2 million as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively, has been established to offset the deferred tax assets.\nThe Company acquired BioDiscovery, LLC. an entity designated for income tax purposes as a corporation in a plan of reorganization within the meaning of\nSection 368(a)(1)(A) on October 18, 2021. Under ASC 805-740, the Company recorded deferred tax liabilities of $5.8 million related to customer lists,\npatents/trademarks, developed technology, and fixed assets as part of the business combination. As the deferred tax liability recorded in the business\ncombination constitutes a source of future taxable income, the Company recorded a decrease to its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets of\n$5.8 million as a deferred income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAs permitted under ASC 805, the Company is allowed a measurement period, which may not exceed one year, in which to complete its accounting for the\nacquisition.

The Company recorded a corresponding increase in the valuation allowance of $1.8 million as a deferred income tax expense for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The purchase price for BioDiscovery was finalized during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nIn November 2022, the Company completed the stock acquisition of Purigen Biosystems, Inc. The Company recorded a net deferred tax asset of $11.5\nmillion of which $4.4 million related to deferred tax liabilities for non-deductible intangibles and $15.4 million related to deferred tax assets for pre-\nacquisition tax loss and credit carryforwards. As management determined that the net deferred tax asset was not more likely than not to realize, a full\nvaluation allowance was recorded. There was no impact on the Company's income tax provision as of December 31, 2022. The measurement period\nremains open for the Purigen acquisition as of December 31, 2022.\nUtilization of the net operating losses and R&D credit carryforwards are subject to annual limitations due to ownership changes that have occurred or that\ncould occur in the future, as required by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), as well as similar state and\nforeign provisions. These ownership changes will limit the amount of net operating losses and R&D credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to\noffset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an \"ownership change\" as defined by Section 382 of the Code results from a transaction or\nseries of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points of outstanding stock of a company by\ncertain stockholders. Due to the existence of the valuation allowance, limitations created by past or future ownership changes, if any, will not impact its\neffective tax rate.\nThe Company last performed a 382 study during 2013 and since this date there have been changes in ownership that will limit the Company's ability to\nutilize the net operating loss and R&D credit carryforwards. The Company is in the process of refreshing its 382 study but the results of that analysis are\nunknown as of the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements. The completion of the 382 study could result in material reductions to deferred\ntax assets and related valuation allowance disclosed above. However, the Company had not utilized any of the net operating losses and R&D credits during\nthe years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021.             \nReconciliations of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, are as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2022\n2021\nBalance at beginning of the year\n$\n5,119,000 \n$\n4,201,000 \nAdditions/(reductions) for tax positions - prior year\n903,000 \n231,000 \nIncrease related to current year positions\n1,259,000 \n687,000 \nBalance at the end of the year\n$\n7,281,000 \n$\n5,119,000 \nThe Company recognizes the benefit of uncertain tax positions at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant\ntaxing authority. An uncertain tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Due to the valuation allowance\nposition, none of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, will impact the Company`s effective tax rate. The Company does not anticipate a significant\nchange in the unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months.\nThe Company’s practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company had no accrual of interest\nand penalties on the Company’s balance sheets and has not recognized any interest and penalties in the statements of operations for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the United States, the United Kingdom and China. The Company’s tax years from 2007 (inception) are subject to\nexamination by the United States and state authorities due to the carry forward of unutilized net operating losses and R&D credits.\n13. Employee Benefits\nThe Company has a defined contribution 401(k) plan available to eligible employees. Under the terms of the plan, employees may make voluntary\ncontributions as a percent of compensation, limited to the maximum amount allowable under federal tax regulations. The Company, at its discretion, may\nmake certain contributions to the 401(k) plan. The Company expensed matching contributions of $1.5  million and $0.8  million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n14.

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by\nus in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the\nSEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including\nour principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure.\nAs of December  31, 2022, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our management recognizes\nthat any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and\nmanagement necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this assessment, our\nmanagement, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were\neffective as of December 31, 2022.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term as defined in Exchange Act\nRule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision and with the participation of our management,\nincluding our principal executive and financial officers, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation\nof financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nAs of December 31, 2022, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal\nControl-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our\nmanagement concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nAs the acquisition of Purigen occurred in the fourth quarter of 2022, we excluded the internal control over financial reporting of Purigen from the scope of\nour assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls. This exclusion is in accordance with the general guidance issued by the Staff of the\nSEC that an assessment of a recently-acquired business may be omitted from our scope in the year of acquisition, if specified conditions are satisfied.\nGoodwill and net intangibles assets acquired were not excluded from our assessment. Purigen's total net assets excluded from our assessment constituted\napproximately 2% of the Company’s total assets as of December 31, 2022, and Purigen’s revenues excluded from our assessment represented\napproximately 0.1% of the Company’s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nExcept as described below, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15-d-15(f) under the\nExchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nIn October 2021, we acquired BioDiscovery LLC.

      "text": "Exhibit 4.10\nDESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES\nGeneral\nThe following summary describes Bionano Genomic, Inc.’s (or “we,” “our” or “us”) securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and certain provisions of Delaware law.\nBecause it is only a summary, it does not contain all of the information that may be important to you. For a complete description of the matters set forth in\nthis Description of Securities, you should refer to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended (“Restated Certificate”), amended and\nrestated bylaws (“Bylaws”), form of warrant certificate and form of warrant agent agreement, each of which are filed as exhibits to our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K, as well as the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (“DGCL”). The Restated Certificate authorizes us\nto issue 400,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. Our\nboard of directors has the authority, without stockholder approval, except as required by the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, to issue\nadditional shares of our capital stock. In addition, our board of directors has the authority, without further action by our stockholders, to designate the\nrights, preferences, privileges, qualifications and restrictions of our preferred stock in one or more series.\nCommon Stock\nVoting Rights\nOur common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, including the election of\ndirectors, and does not have cumulative voting rights. The Restated Certificate establishes a classified board of directors that is divided into three classes\nwith staggered three-year terms. Only the directors in one class will be subject to election by a plurality of the votes cast at each annual meeting of our\nstockholders, with the directors in the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three-year terms.\nEconomic Rights\nExcept as otherwise expressly provided in the Restated Certificate or required by applicable law, all shares of common stock have the same rights and\nprivileges and rank equally, share ratably, and are identical in all respects for all matters, including those described below.\nDividends. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any then-outstanding preferred stock, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive\ndividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors out of legally available funds.`\nLiquidation Rights. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in the net assets\nlegally available for distribution to stockholders after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities, subject to the satisfaction of any liquidation\npreference granted to the holders of any outstanding shares of preferred stock.\nNo Preemptive or Similar Rights\nThe holders of our shares of common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights, and are not subject to conversion, redemption or sinking fund provisions.\nThe rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of our common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of\nshares of any series of our preferred stock that we may designate and issue in the future.\nPreferred Stock\nOur board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other\nrights of the holders of the common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other\ncorporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in our control that may otherwise benefit\nholders of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of the common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of common\nstock. We have no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.\nWarrants\nEach warrant issued in our initial public offering entitles the holder to purchase one share of our common stock at an initial exercise price of $6.125,\nsubject to adjustment. Each warrant became exercisable 30 days after our initial public offering and will expire at 5:00 p.m. New York City time on August\n21, 2023. The warrants were issued in registered form, in each case pursuant to a warrant agreement between American Stock Transfer & Trust Company,\nLLC, as warrant agent, and us.\n    1    \n281729599 v3"

      "text": "The exercise price and number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events, including but not\nlimited to any stock split, stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will not\nbe adjusted for issuances of common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into common stock at a price below the then current exercise price of\nsuch warrant.\nIf, at any time warrants are outstanding, we consummate any fundamental transaction, as described in such warrants and generally including any\nconsolidation or merger with or into another corporation, the consummation of a transaction whereby another entity acquires more than 50% of our\noutstanding common stock, or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets, or other transaction in which our common stock are\nconverted into or exchanged for other securities or other consideration, the holder of any such warrants will thereafter receive upon exercise of such\nwarrants, the securities or other consideration to which a holder of the number of common stock then deliverable upon the exercise or conversion of such\nwarrants would have been entitled upon such consolidation or merger or other transaction.\nThe number of shares of our common stock that may be acquired by any holder upon any exercise of the warrants will be limited to the extent necessary to\ninsure that, following such exercise (or other issuance), the total number of common stock then beneficially owned by such holder and its affiliates and any\nother persons whose beneficial ownership of common stock would be aggregated with the holder’s for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, does\nnot exceed 9.99% (or in certain instances 4.99%) of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock (including for such purpose the\ncommon stock issuable upon such exercise), which we refer to as the beneficial ownership limitation; provided, however, that if a holder and/or its affiliates\nalready own 9.99% (or 4.99%, as applicable) on the date of this offering then the beneficial ownership limitation will not apply to such holder. A holder\nmay elect to increase or decrease this beneficial ownership limitation from 9.99% (or 4.99%, as applicable) to any other percentage of the total number of\nissued and outstanding shares of our common stock (including for such purpose the common stock issuable upon such exercise) upon providing us with not\nless than 61 days’ prior written notice, and any such increase will apply only to such holder.\nThe warrants may be exercised, at the option of each holder, in whole or in part, upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date\nat the offices of the warrant agent, with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied\nby full payment of the exercise price for the number of common stock purchased upon such exercise, by certified check payable to us or by wire transfer of\nimmediately available funds to an account designated by us. Subject to applicable laws, the warrants may be transferred at the option of the holders upon\nsurrender of the warrants to us together with the appropriate instruments of transfer.\nThe warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of our common stock or any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive\ncommon stock. After the issuance of common stock upon exercise of such warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each common stock held of\nrecord on all matters to be voted on by stockholders. If we fail to issue a holder of our warrants, within three business days after receipt of an applicable\nexercise notice, a certificate for the number of shares of our common stock to which such holder is entitled, then such holder can rescind the exercise of\nsuch warrant. If we are otherwise unable to issue and deliver the number of shares of our common stock that a holder is entitled to under the warrant, we\nhave no obligation to pay such holder any cash or other consideration to settle such warrant.\nUnder the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement and\ncurrent prospectus relating to common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants at any time that the warrants are exercisable. During any period that we\nfail to have maintained an effective registration statement covering the common stock underlying such warrants, the holder may exercise such warrants on\na cashless basis.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\nThe provisions of the DGCL, the Restated Certificate and the Bylaws, certain provisions of which are summarized below, may have the effect of delaying,\ndeferring or discouraging another person from acquiring control of our company. They are also designed, in part, to encourage persons seeking to acquire\ncontrol of us to negotiate first with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate with an\nunfriendly or unsolicited acquirer outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging a proposal to acquire us because negotiation of these proposals could result\nin an improvement of their terms.\nDelaware Anti-Takeover Law\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested\nstockholder for a period of three years after the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, subject to certain exceptions.\nCertificate of Incorporation and Bylaws\nAmong other things, the Restated Certificate and the Bylaws:\n    2    \n281729599 v3"

Since our board of directors has the\npower to retain and discharge our officers, these provisions could also make it more difficult for existing stockholders or another party to effect a change in\nmanagement. In addition, the authorization of undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting\nor other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change our control.\nThese provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy\nfights. However, such provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares and may have the effect of deterring\nhostile takeovers or delaying changes in our control or management. As a consequence, these provisions may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of\nour stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts.\nChoice of Forum\nThe Restated Certificate provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding\nbrought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers or\nother employees arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Restated Certificate or the Bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us\nthat is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The Restated Certificate further provides that U.S. federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for\nresolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. These choice of forum provisions of the Restated Certificate will not\napply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act.\n    3    \n281729599 v3"

(the “Company”)\nhas granted you an option under its 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) to purchase the number of shares of the Company’s Common\nStock indicated in your Grant Notice at the exercise price indicated in your Grant Notice. The option is granted to you effective as of the date\nof grant set forth in the Grant Notice (the “Date of Grant”). If there is any conflict between the terms in this Option Agreement and the Plan,\nthe terms of the Plan will control. Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Option Agreement or in the Grant Notice but defined in the\nPlan will have the same definitions as in the Plan.\nThe details of your option, in addition to those set forth in the Grant Notice and the Plan, are as follows:\n1.\nVesting.\n(a)\nSubject to the provisions contained herein, your option will vest as provided in your Grant Notice. Vesting will cease\nupon the termination of your Continuous Service. If a Change in Control occurs and your Continuous Service has not terminated as of\nimmediately prior to such Change in Control, the vesting and exercisability of your option will be accelerated in full.\n(b)\nIf any payment or benefit you would receive from the Company or otherwise in connection with a Change in Control\nor other similar transaction (a “280G Payment”) would (i) constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the\nCode, and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the “Excise Tax”), then any such 280G\nPayment (a “Payment”) shall be equal to the Reduced Amount. The “Reduced Amount” shall be either (x) the largest portion of the Payment\nthat would result in no portion of the Payment (after reduction) being subject to the Excise Tax or (y) the largest portion, up to and including\nthe total, of the Payment, whichever amount (i.e., the amount determined by clause (x) or by clause (y)), after taking into account all\napplicable federal, state and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax (all computed at the highest applicable marginal rate),\nresults in your receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater economic benefit notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payment may be\nsubject to the Excise Tax. If a reduction in a Payment is required pursuant to the preceding sentence and the Reduced Amount is determined\npursuant to clause (x) of the preceding sentence, the reduction shall occur in the manner (the “Reduction Method”) that results in the greatest\neconomic benefit for you. If more than one method of reduction will result in the same economic benefit, the items so reduced will be\nreduced pro rata (the “Pro Rata Reduction Method”).\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Reduction Method or the Pro Rata Reduction Method would result in any portion of the\nPayment being subject to taxes pursuant to Section 409A of the Code that would not otherwise be subject to taxes pursuant to Section 409A\nof the Code, then the Reduction Method and/or the Pro Rata Reduction Method, as the case may be, shall be modified so as to avoid the\nimposition of taxes pursuant to Section 409A of the Code as follows: (A) as a first priority, the modification shall preserve to the greatest\nextent possible, the greatest economic benefit for you as determined on an after-tax basis; (B) as a second priority, Payments that are\ncontingent on future events (e.g., being terminated without cause), shall be reduced (or eliminated) before Payments that are not contingent\non future events; and (C) as a third priority, Payments that are “deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code\nshall be reduced (or eliminated) before Payments that are not deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.\n1\n179426020 v2"

You may pay\nthe exercise price in cash or by check, bank draft or money order payable to the Company or in any other manner permitted by your Grant\nNotice, which may include one or more of the following:\n(a)\nProvided that at the time of exercise the Common Stock is publicly traded, pursuant to a program developed under\nRegulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board that, prior to the issuance of Common Stock, results in either the receipt of cash\n(or check) by the Company or the receipt of irrevocable instructions to pay the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales\nproceeds. This manner of payment is also known as a “broker-assisted exercise”, “same day sale”, or “sell to cover”.\n(b)\nProvided that at the time of exercise the Common Stock is publicly traded, by delivery to the Company (either by\nactual delivery or attestation) of already-owned shares of Common Stock that are owned free and clear of any liens, claims, encumbrances or\nsecurity interests, and that are valued at Fair Market Value on the date of exercise. “Delivery” for these purposes, in the sole discretion of the\nCompany at the time you exercise your option, will include delivery to the Company of your attestation of ownership of such shares of\nCommon Stock in a form approved by the Company.

The option is granted to you effective as of the date\nof grant set forth in the Grant Notice (the “Date of Grant”). If there is any conflict between the terms in this Option Agreement and the Plan,\nthe terms of the Plan will control. Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Option Agreement or in the Grant Notice but defined in the\nPlan will have the same definitions as in the Plan.\nThe details of your option, in addition to those set forth in the Grant Notice and the Plan, are as follows:\n1.\nVesting. Subject to the provisions contained herein, your option will vest as provided in your Grant Notice. Vesting will\ncease upon the termination of your Continuous Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change in Control occurs and within one (1)\nmonth prior to, or within twelve (12) months after, the effective time of such Change in Control, your Continuous Service terminates due to\nan involuntary termination (not including death or Disability) without Cause or due to your voluntary termination with Good Reason, then, as\nof the date of termination of Continuous Service, the vesting and exercisability of your option will be accelerated in full.\n(a)\n“Good Reason” shall mean that any of following actions are taken by the Company without your prior written\nconsent: (i) a material reduction by the Company of your base salary; (ii) a material breach by the Company of your employment agreement\nor any other material written agreement between you and the Company concerning the terms and conditions of your employment with the\nCompany; (iii) the relocation of your principal place of employment, without your consent, to a place that increases your one-way commute\nby more than thirty-five (35) miles as compared to your then-current principal place of employment immediately prior to such relocation; or\n(iv) a material reduction in your duties, authority, or responsibilities relative to your duties, authority, or responsibilities in effect immediately\nprior to such reduction; provided, however, that, any such termination by you shall only be deemed for Good Reason pursuant to this\ndefinition if: (1) you give the Company written notice of your intent to terminate for Good Reason within thirty (30) days following the\noccurrence of the condition(s) that you believe constitute(s) Good Reason, which notice shall describe such condition(s); (2) the Company\nfails to remedy such condition(s) within thirty (30) days following receipt of the written notice (the “Cure Period”); and (3) you voluntarily\nterminate your employment within thirty (30) days following the end of the Cure Period.\n(b)\nIf any payment or benefit you would receive from the Company or otherwise in connection with a Change in Control\nor other similar transaction (a “280G Payment”) would (i) constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the\nCode, and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the “Excise Tax”), then any such 280G\nPayment (a “Payment”) shall be equal to the Reduced Amount. The “Reduced Amount” shall be either (x) the largest portion of the Payment\nthat would result in no portion of the Payment (after reduction) being subject to the Excise Tax or (y) the largest portion, up to and including\nthe total, of the Payment, whichever amount (i.e., the amount determined by clause (x) or by clause (y)), after taking into account all\napplicable federal, state and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax (all computed at the highest applicable marginal rate),\nresults in your receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater\n1\n179425913 v2"

If a reduction in a Payment is\nrequired pursuant to the preceding sentence and the Reduced Amount is determined pursuant to clause (x) of the preceding sentence, the\nreduction shall occur in the manner (the “Reduction Method”) that results in the greatest economic benefit for you. If more than one method\nof reduction will result in the same economic benefit, the items so reduced will be reduced pro rata (the “Pro Rata Reduction Method”).\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Reduction Method or the Pro Rata Reduction Method would result in any portion of the\nPayment being subject to taxes pursuant to Section 409A of the Code that would not otherwise be subject to taxes pursuant to Section 409A\nof the Code, then the Reduction Method and/or the Pro Rata Reduction Method, as the case may be, shall be modified so as to avoid the\nimposition of taxes pursuant to Section 409A of the Code as follows: (A) as a first priority, the modification shall preserve to the greatest\nextent possible, the greatest economic benefit for you as determined on an after-tax basis; (B) as a second priority, Payments that are\ncontingent on future events (e.g., being terminated without cause), shall be reduced (or eliminated) before Payments that are not contingent\non future events; and (C) as a third priority, Payments that are “deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code\nshall be reduced (or eliminated) before Payments that are not deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.\nUnless you and the Company agree on an alternative accounting firm, the accounting firm engaged by the Company for general tax\ncompliance purposes as of the day prior to the effective date of the change of control transaction triggering the Payment shall perform the\nforegoing calculations. If the accounting firm so engaged by the Company is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or\ngroup effecting the change of control transaction, the Company shall appoint a nationally recognized accounting firm to make the\ndeterminations required hereunder. The Company shall bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by such accounting firm required\nto be made hereunder. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the accounting firm engaged to make the\ndeterminations hereunder to provide its calculations, together with detailed supporting documentation, to you and the Company within fifteen\n(15) calendar days after the date on which your right to a 280G Payment becomes reasonably likely to occur (if requested at that time by you\nor the Company) or such other time as requested by you or the Company.\nIf you receive a Payment for which the Reduced Amount was determined pursuant to clause (x) of the first paragraph of this Section\n1(b) and the Internal Revenue Service determines thereafter that some portion of the Payment is subject to the Excise Tax, you shall promptly\nreturn to the Company a sufficient amount of the Payment (after reduction pursuant to clause (x) of the first paragraph of this Section 1(b) so\nthat no portion of the remaining Payment is subject to the Excise Tax. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Reduced Amount was determined\npursuant to clause (y) in the first paragraph of this Section 1(b), you shall have no obligation to return any portion of the Payment pursuant to\nthe preceding sentence.\n2.\nNumber of Shares and Exercise Price. The number of shares of Common Stock subject to your option and your exercise\nprice per share in your Grant Notice will be adjusted for Capitalization Adjustments.\n3.\nExercise Restriction for Non-Exempt Employees. If you are an Employee eligible for overtime compensation under the\nFair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (that is, a “Non-Exempt Employee”), and except as otherwise provided in the Plan, you may\nnot exercise your option until you have completed at least six (6) months of Continuous Service measured from the Date of Grant, even if\nyou have already been an employee for more than six (6) months. Consistent with the provisions of the Worker Economic Opportunity Act,\nyou may exercise your option as to any vested portion prior to such six (6) month anniversary in the case of (i) your death or disability, (ii) a\nCorporate Transaction in which your option is not assumed, continued or substituted, (iii) a Change in Control or (iv) your termination of\nContinuous Service on your “retirement” (as defined in the Company’s benefit plans).\n2\n179425913 v2"

This manner of payment is also known as a “broker-assisted exercise”, “same day sale”, or “sell to cover”.\n(b)\nProvided that at the time of exercise the Common Stock is publicly traded, by delivery to the Company (either by\nactual delivery or attestation) of already-owned shares of Common Stock that are owned free and clear of any liens, claims, encumbrances or\nsecurity interests, and that are valued at Fair Market Value on the date of exercise. “Delivery” for these purposes, in the sole discretion of the\nCompany at the time you exercise your option, will include delivery to the Company of your attestation of ownership of such shares of\nCommon Stock in a form approved by the Company. You may not exercise your option by delivery to the Company of Common Stock if\ndoing so would violate the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the redemption of the Company’s stock.\n(c)\nIf this option is a Nonstatutory Stock Option, subject to the consent of the Company at the time of exercise, by a “net\nexercise” arrangement pursuant to which the Company will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of your\noption by the largest whole number of shares with a Fair Market Value that does not exceed the aggregate exercise price. You must pay any\nremaining balance of the aggregate exercise price not satisfied by the “net exercise” in cash or other permitted form of payment. Shares of\nCommon Stock will no longer be outstanding under your option and will not be exercisable thereafter if those shares (i) are used to pay the\nexercise price pursuant to the “net exercise,” (ii) are delivered to you as a result of such exercise, and (iii) are withheld to satisfy your tax\nwithholding obligations.\n5.\nWhole Shares. You may exercise your option only for whole shares of Common Stock.\n6.\nSecurities Law Compliance. In no event may you exercise your option unless the shares of Common Stock issuable upon\nexercise are then registered under the Securities Act or, if not registered, the Company has determined that your exercise and the issuance of\nthe shares would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The exercise of your option also must comply with all\nother applicable laws and regulations governing your option, and you may not exercise your option if the Company determines that such\nexercise would not be in material compliance with such laws and regulations (including any restrictions on exercise required for compliance\nwith Treas. Reg. 1.401(k)-1(d)(3), if applicable).\n7.\nTerm. You may not exercise your option before the Date of Grant or after the expiration of the option’s term.

The Building is part of a larger Project commonly\nknown as Britannia Business Center II consisting of 5700 and 5720 Stoneridge Drive, Pleasanton, California (collectively, the “Project”). As used in this\nLease, the term “Project” shall include the parcel or parcels of land on which the Project is located and all appurtenances thereto and all improvements\nlocated thereon (including, without limitation, the buildings located at 5700 and 5720 Stoneridge Drive, Pleasanton, California). During the Lease Term,\nTenant shall have the nonexclusive right, in common with other tenants of the Project, to use only for their intended purposes of lobbies, entrances, stairs,\nelevators and other public portions of the Project, that are designated by Landlord from time to time as common areas and not leased to or allocated for the\nexclusive use of another tenant of the Project. Landlord shall have the right from time to time to change the size, location, configuration, character or use of\nany such common areas, construct additional improvements or facilities in any such common areas, or close any such common areas; provided that\nTenant’s use of and access to the Premises is not materially impaired. Tenant shall not interfere with the rights of Landlord and other tenants of the Project\nto use such common areas. All of the windows and outside decks or terraces and walls of the Premises and any space in the Premises used for shafts,\nstacks, pipes, conduits, ducts, electric or other utilities, sinks or other Building facilities, and the use thereof and access thereto through the Premises for the\npurposes of operation, maintenance and repairs, are reserved to Landlord.\n1.2    Tenant acknowledges that Tenant has inspected the Premises, the Building and the Project or has had the Premises, the Building and the\nProject inspected by professional consultants retained by Tenant, Tenant is familiar with the condition of the Premises, the Building and the Project, the\nPremises, the Building and the Project are suitable for Tenant’s purposes, and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Lease, and except for the\nimprovements to be constructed or installed by Landlord pursuant to Exhibit B (if any), the condition of the Premises, the Building and the Project is\nacceptable to Tenant. Except for the improvements to be constructed or installed by Landlord pursuant to Exhibit B (if any), Landlord shall have no\nobligation to construct or install any improvements in the Premises, the Building or the Project or to remodel, renovate, recondition, alter or improve the\nPremises, the Building or the Project in any manner, and Tenant shall accept the Premises “as is” on the Commencement Date. For purposes of Section\n1938 of the California Civil Code, Landlord hereby discloses to Tenant, and Tenant hereby acknowledges, that the Premises have not undergone inspection\nby a person certified pursuant to Section 4459.2 of the California Government Code (a Certified Access Specialist). Tenant hereby waives any and all rights\nit otherwise might now or hereafter have under Section 1938 of the California Civil Code. Landlord and Tenant expressly agree that there are and shall be\nno implied warranties of merchantability, habitability, fitness for a particular purpose, or any other kind arising out of this Lease and there are and shall be\nno warranties that extend beyond the warranties, if any, expressly set forth in this Lease. As of the Commencement Date, Landlord shall cause, at\nLandlord’s sole cost and expense and without reimbursement, the Base Building (as defined below) serving the Premises to be in good working order and\ncondition; provided that the foregoing shall not imply any representation or warranty as to the useful life of such systems, nor shall the foregoing diminish\nTenant’s responsibility pursuant to section 10.1 below to perform any repairs, modifications or improvements to the same necessitated after the\nCommencement Date, whether by reason of Tenant’s use of the same, Tenant’s Alterations (as defined below), ordinary wear and tear, or otherwise. The\nforegoing warranty by Landlord specifically excludes any equipment that is installed by Tenant following the Commencement Date and any\nmalfunctioning of any Building systems due to Tenant’s Alterations or Tenant’s acts or omissions. “Base Building” means the structural portions of the\nBuilding (including exterior walls, roof and foundation of the Building), the exterior of the Building and all base Building systems, including, without\nlimitation, plumbing, air conditioning, heating, electrical, security, life safety and power, except those special systems installed for specific tenants and the\nportion of any other Building system within the Premises or any other specific tenant space which exclusively serves such tenant or is otherwise the\nresponsibility of such tenant pursuant to its lease.\n1.3    No easement for light, air or view is included with or appurtenant to the Premises. Any diminution or shutting off of light, air or view by any\nstructure which may hereafter be erected (whether or not constructed by Landlord) shall in no way affect this Lease or impose any liability on Landlord.\n1.4    Notwithstanding section 1.1 of this Lease relating to use of the common areas of the Project for parking, Tenant shall have the right to use\nonly the number of parking spaces specified in the Basic Lease Information. No parking spaces shall be reserved for the exclusive use of Tenant. Tenant\nshall use such parking spaces solely for parking vehicles of Tenant’s officers and employees. Tenant shall not, at any time, use more than the number of\nparking spaces specified in the Basic Lease Information. Tenant shall comply with all Rules and Regulations and all laws now or hereafter in effect relating\nto the use of parking spaces. Without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall this Lease be void or voidable, nor shall Landlord be liable to Tenant for any\nloss or damage, nor shall there be any abatement of rent hereunder, by reason of any reduction in Tenant’s parking rights hereunder by reason of strikes,\nlock-outs, labor disputes, shortages of material or labor, fire, flood or other casualty, acts of God or any other cause beyond the control of Landlord.\nARTICLE 2\n\nTerm\n-1-\n279330373 v2"

If Landlord, for any reason whatsoever, does not deliver possession of the Premises to Tenant by the Target\nCompletion Date, this Lease shall not be void or voidable and Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any loss or damage resulting therefrom, but in such\nevent, the Commencement Date shall be postponed until the date on which Landlord delivers possession of the Premises, to Tenant; provided, however,\nthat if the Commencement Date does not occur on or before the date that is sixty (60) days after the Target Completion Date, as such date may be extended\nby Tenant Delay or Force Majeure (as defined and as permitted below) (such date, as so extended, the “Trigger Date”), then Tenant may terminate this\nLease upon written notice to Landlord given within ten (10) calendar days after the Trigger Date; provided, however, that Tenant’s termination notice shall\nbe void and of no further force or effect if the Commencement Date shall occur within thirty (30) days after Landlord’s receipt of Tenant’s termination\nnotice. The foregoing right of Tenant to terminate this Lease shall be Tenant’s sole remedy for such delay in the Commencement Date. For purposes of this\nLease, “Force Majeure” shall mean strikes, lock-outs, labor disputes, shortages of material or labor, fire, earthquake, flood or other casualty, acts of terror,\nacts of God, tenant holdover, or any other cause (other than financial inability) beyond the reasonable control of Landlord. Notwithstanding anything to the\ncontrary contained in this Lease, no Force Majeure event shall extend the Trigger Date for more than thirty (30) days.\n2.2    At any time during the Lease Term, Landlord may deliver to Tenant a notice confirming the Commencement Date and the Expiration Date,\nas determined in accordance with this Lease, which notice Tenant shall execute and return to Landlord within five (5) days following receipt.\n2.3    Landlord shall construct or install in the Premises those Tenant Improvements to be constructed or installed by Landlord pursuant to Exhibit\nB.

Landlord shall complete or correct the items on Landlord’s punch list promptly after the Commencement Date.\nIf the Substantial Completion of the Premises is delayed as a result of any Tenant Delay (as defined in Exhibit B), then, notwithstanding anything to the\ncontrary set forth in this Lease or in Exhibit B and regardless of the actual date of the Substantial Completion of the Premises, Tenant’s obligation to pay\nBase Rent and additional rent hereunder shall commence as of the date the Commencement Date would have occurred if no Tenant Delay(s) had occurred.\nARTICLE 3\n\nRent\n3.1    Tenant shall pay to Landlord the following amounts as rent for the Premises:\n(a)    During the Lease Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as monthly rent, the base rent specified in the Basic Lease Information (the\n“Base Rent”).\n(b)    During each calendar year or part thereof during the Lease Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as additional rent, Tenant’s\nPercentage Share (as hereinafter defined) of all Operating Expenses (as hereinafter defined) paid or incurred by Landlord in such calendar year.\n(c)    During each calendar year or part thereof during the Lease Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as additional rent, Tenant’s\nPercentage Share of all Property Taxes (as hereinafter defined) paid or incurred by Landlord in such calendar year.\n(d)    During each calendar year or part thereof during the Lease Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as additional rent, the actual cost\nincurred by Landlord with respect to all electricity, chilled water, air conditioning, gas, fuel, steam, heat, light, power and other utilities consumed within\nthe Premises, as more particularly described herein (all such costs payable by Tenant pursuant to this section 3.1(d) shall be referred to as “Tenant’s\nMonthly Utility Charge”, and all such amounts shall constitute rent hereunder).\n(i)    All electricity directly serving the Premises (“Direct Electrical Costs”) shall be metered or submetered and Tenant shall\npay, as monthly rental, the actual cost (without mark up by Landlord) of all such Direct Electrical Costs either to Landlord as a reimbursement, or, at\nLandlord’s election, as a payment directly to the entity providing such electricity. Such payments to Landlord of Direct Electrical Costs shall be made\nwithin thirty (30) days of Landlord’s delivery of an invoice to Tenant therefor.\n(ii)    With respect to all utility costs for the Premises other than Direct Electrical Costs (collectively, “Other Utility Costs”),\nLandlord shall have the right, from time to time, to fairly and equitably allocate some or all of such Other Utility Costs among different portions or\noccupants of the Building (“Cost Pools”), in Landlord’s reasonable discretion.

On or\nbefore the first day of each month during such ensuing calendar year, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as monthly rent, one twelfth of such estimated amounts.\nIf such notice is not given for any calendar year, Tenant shall continue to pay on the basis of the prior calendar year’s estimate until the month after such\nnotice is given. If at any time it appears to Landlord that the amounts payable under sections 3.1(b), 3.1(c), and 3.1(d)(ii) hereof for the current calendar\nyear will vary from Landlord’s estimate, Landlord may, by giving written notice to Tenant, revise its estimate for such calendar year. If Landlord delivers\nits estimate after the first day of a calendar year, or if Landlord revises its estimate for a calendar year, then subsequent payments by Tenant for such\ncalendar year shall be based on such late or revised estimate, as the case may be, with an appropriate adjustment to the amount of such subsequent\npayments such that, prior to the end of such calendar year or portion thereof during the Lease Term, Tenant shall have paid Landlord’s entire estimate of the\namounts payable under sections 3.1(b), 3.1(c), and 3.1(d)(ii) hereof for such calendar year.\n(b)    Within a reasonable time after the end of each calendar year, but no later than April 1, Landlord shall give Tenant a written\nstatement of the amounts payable under sections 3.1(b), 3.1(c), and 3.1(d)(ii) hereof for such calendar year certified by Landlord. If such statement shows\nan amount owing by Tenant that is less than the estimated payments for such calendar year previously made by Tenant, Landlord shall credit the excess to\nthe next succeeding monthly installments payable under sections 3.1(b), 3.1(c), and 3.1(d)(ii) hereof. If such statement shows an amount owing by Tenant\nthat is more than the estimated payments for such calendar year previously made by Tenant, Tenant shall pay the deficiency to Landlord within ten (10)\ndays after delivery of such statement. Failure by Landlord to give any notice or statement to Tenant under this section 3.2 shall not waive Landlord’s right\nto receive, and Tenant’s obligation to pay, the amounts payable by Tenant under sections 3.1(b), 3.1(c), and 3.1(d)(ii) hereof. During the Lease Term, but in\nno event more often than once in any one (1) year period, Tenant or its authorized employee or representative shall have the right to inspect the books of\nLandlord relating to Operating Expenses and Property Taxes, after giving reasonable prior written notice to Landlord and during the business hours of\nLandlord at Landlord’s office in the Project or at such other location as Landlord may designate, for the purpose of verifying the information in such\nstatement; provided that, if Tenant utilizes an independent accountant to perform such review, then such accountant shall be one of national standing which\nis reasonably acceptable to Landlord and is not compensated on a contingency basis; and provided further that Tenant shall have no right to inspect such\nbooks pertaining to any given period more than ninety (90) days after Landlord shall have delivered the written statement pertaining to such period.\n(c)    If the Lease Term ends on a day other than the last day of a calendar year, the amounts payable by Tenant under sections 3.1(b),\n3.1(c), and 3.l(d)(ii) hereof applicable to the calendar year in which the end of the term occurs shall be prorated on the basis which the number of days from\nthe commencement of such calendar year to and including the date on which the end of the term occurs bears to three hundred sixty five (365). Termination\nof this Lease shall not affect the obligations of Landlord and Tenant pursuant to section 3.2(b) hereof to be performed after such termination.\n3.3    Tenant shall pay all monthly installments of Base Rent and monthly installments of Landlord’s estimates of amounts payable under sections\n3.1(b), 3.1(c), and 3.1(d)(ii) hereof and monthly installments of the Allowance Rent (collectively, “Monthly Rent”) to Landlord, in advance, on or before\nthe first day of each and every calendar month during the Lease Term, without notice, demand, deduction or offset, in lawful money of the United States of\nAmerica. Landlord instructs Tenant to pay all such Monthly Rent to the address specified therefor in the Basic Lease Information, or to such other person\nor at such other place as Landlord may from time to time designate in writing. Landlord shall have the right to apply payments received from Tenant\npursuant to this Lease, regardless of Tenant’s designation of such payments, to satisfy any obligations of Tenant hereunder, in such order and amounts as\nLandlord, in its sole discretion, may elect. If Tenant’s obligation to pay Base Rent hereunder commences on a day other than the first day of a calendar\nmonth, or if the Lease Term terminates on a day other than the last day of a calendar month, then the Base Rent payable for such partial month shall be\nappropriately prorated on the basis of a thirty (30)-day month. Upon signing this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord an amount equal to the Base Rent for\nthe first full calendar month of the Term in which monthly Base Rent is payable, which amount Landlord shall apply to the Base Rent for such first full\ncalendar month.\nARTICLE 4\n\nOperating Expenses and Property Taxes Definitions\n4.1    The following terms shall have the definitions herein specified:\n(a)    “Operating Expenses” shall mean all costs and expenses paid or incurred by Landlord in connection with the ownership,\nmanagement, operation, replacement, maintenance or repair of the Project or providing services in accordance with this Lease, including, without\nlimitation, the following: (i) salaries, wages, other compensation and benefits for personnel engaged in the\n-3-\n279330373 v2"

If Tenant wishes to make any such change in such approved plans and specifications, Tenant shall\nhave Tenant's architect(s) and engineer(s) prepare plans and specifications for such change and submit them to Landlord for Landlord's written approval. If\nLandlord disapproves such change, Landlord shall, within five (5) days of submittal, specify in writing the reasons for disapproval and such plans and\nspecifications shall be revised by Tenant and resubmitted to Landlord for Landlord's written approval. After Landlord's written approval of such change,\nsuch change shall become part of the plans and specifications approved by Landlord.\n(f)    Tenant shall pay Landlord on demand prior to or during the course of construction of any Alterations an amount (the “Supervision\nFee”) equal to four percent (4%) of the total cost of such Alteration (and for purposes of calculating the Supervision Fee, such cost shall include\narchitectural and engineering fees, but shall not include permit fees) as compensation to Landlord for Landlord's review of the plans and specifications for\nsuch Alterations and general oversight of the construction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, the Supervision Fee payable to\nLandlord in connection with the Tenant Improvements shall be two and one half percent (2.5%) of the amount of the approved Work Cost Estimate\ndescribed in Exhibit B).

At Landlord's sole election any or all Alterations made for or by Tenant shall be removed by Tenant from the Premises at the expiration\nor sooner termination of this Lease and the Premises shall be restored by Tenant to their condition prior to the making of the Alterations, ordinary wear and\ntear excepted. The removal of the Alterations and the restoration of the Premises shall be performed by a general contractor selected by Tenant and\napproved by Landlord, in which event Tenant shall pay the general contractor's fees and costs in connection with such work. Movable furniture, equipment,\ntrade fixtures and personal property (except partitions) shall remain the property of Tenant and Tenant shall, at Tenant's expense, remove all such property\nfrom the Project at the end of the Lease Term. Termination of this Lease shall not affect the obligations of Tenant pursuant to this section 8.2 to be\nperformed after such termination. Upon Tenant's express written request making specific reference to this section 8.2, Landlord shall advise Tenant at the\ntime of Landlord's approval of any Alteration requested by Tenant (or within ten (10) business days after receipt of Tenant’s notice to Landlord with respect\nto those Alterations not requiring Landlord's approval) whether Landlord will require the removal of the Alteration and restoration of the Premises to its\nprevious condition at the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease. Landlord's failure to expressly waive in writing Tenant's removal obligation as to\nany Alterations shall preserve Landlord's right to make its foregoing election with respect to such Alterations.\n-9-\n279330373 v2"

As a condition to Tenant recapturing its assignment or subletting costs as provided herein, Tenant\nshall provide to Landlord, within thirty (30) days of Landlord's execution of Landlord's consent to the assignment or subletting, a detailed accounting of\nsuch costs and reasonable supporting documents.\n15.7    Any sublease hereunder shall be subordinate and subject to the provisions of this Lease, and if this Lease shall be terminated during the\nterm of any sublease, Landlord shall have the right to: (a) treat such sublease as canceled and repossess the entire Premises by any lawful means, or (b)\nrequire that such subtenant attorn to and recognize Landlord as its landlord under any such sublease. If Tenant shall be in default beyond any applicable\ncure period under this Lease, Landlord is hereby irrevocably authorized, as Tenant's agent and attorney-in-fact, to direct any subtenant to make all\npayments under or in connection with a sublease directly to Landlord (which Landlord shall apply towards Tenant’s obligations under this Lease) until such\ndefault is cured. Such subtenant shall rely on any representation by Landlord that Tenant is in default hereunder, without any need for confirmation thereof\nby Tenant.\n15.8    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, and 15.6 but subject to sections 15.5 and 15.7, Tenant may assign\nthis Lease or sublet the Premises or any portion thereof, without Landlord's consent, to any partnership, corporation or other entity which controls, is\ncontrolled by, or is under common control with Tenant or Tenant's parent (control being defined for such purposes as ownership of at least 50% of the\nequity interests in, and the power to direct the management of, the relevant entity), or to any partnership, corporation or other entity resulting from a merger\nor consolidation with Tenant or Tenant's parent, or to any person or entity which acquires all or substantially all the assets of Tenant as a going concern\n(including by means of a purchase of all or substantially all of Tenant's stock) (collectively, an “Affiliate”), provided that (i) Landlord receives at least ten\n(10) days' prior written notice of the assignment or subletting, together with evidence that the requirements of this section 15.8 have been met (provided,\nhowever, if Tenant is prohibited by law from making such disclosure to Landlord, such notice may be provided within ten (10) business days following the\nclosing), (ii) the Affiliate's net worth is not less than Tenant's net worth as of the date of this Lease or as of the date immediately prior to the assignment or\nsubletting (or series of transactions of which the same is a part), whichever is greater, (iii) the Affiliate has proven experience in the operation of a first-\nclass business of a type consistent with the use of the Building as a first-class Building, (iv) except in the case of an assignment where the assignor is\ndissolved as a matter of law following the series of transactions of which the assignment is a part (e.g. a merger) and where such assignor makes sufficient\nreserves for contingent liabilities (including its obligations under this Lease) as required by applicable law, the Affiliate remains an Affiliate for the\nduration of the subletting or the balance of the term in the event of an assignment, (v) the Affiliate assumes (in the event of an assignment) in writing all of\nTenant's obligations under this Lease, and agrees (in the event of a sublease) that such subtenant will, at Landlord's election, attorn directly to Landlord in\nthe event that this Lease is terminated for any reason, (vi) Landlord receives a fully executed copy of an assignment or sublease agreement between Tenant\nand the Affiliate, (vii) in the case of an assignment by means of a purchase of all or substantially all of Tenant's stock, the essential purpose of such\nassignment is to transfer an active, ongoing business with substantial assets in addition to this Lease, and in the case of an assignment (by any means), or a\nsublease, the transaction is for legitimate business purposes unrelated to this Lease and the transaction is not a subterfuge by Tenant to avoid it"

Tenant hereby waives, for Tenant and for all those claiming under Tenant, any and all rights now or hereafter existing to redeem by order or\njudgment of any court or by any legal process or writ, Tenant's right of occupancy of the Premises after any termination of this Lease.\n19.4    If Landlord defaults under this Lease, Tenant shall give written notice to Landlord specifying such default with particularity, and Landlord\nshall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice within which to cure such default; provided, however, that if such default cannot reasonably be cured\nwithin such period of thirty (30) days, a default by Landlord shall not exist as long as Landlord commences with due diligence and dispatch the curing of\nsuch default within such period of thirty (30) days and, having so commenced, thereafter prosecutes with diligence and dispatch and completes the curing\nof such default within a reasonable time.

In the event of any Letter of Credit Draw Event, Landlord may, but without obligation to do so, and without notice to Tenant, draw upon the\nLetter of Credit, in part or in whole, and apply the proceeds of the Letter of Credit to cure any such Letter of Credit Draw Event and/or to compensate\nLandlord for any and all damages or losses of any kind or nature sustained or which Landlord reasonably estimates that it will sustain resulting from\nTenant’s breach or default of this Lease or other Letter of Credit Draw Event and/or to compensate Landlord for any and all damages or losses arising out\nof, or incurred in connection with, the termination of this Lease, including, without limitation, those specifically identified in this Lease and Section 1951.2\nof the California Civil Code.

No condition or term of this Lease shall be deemed to\nrender the Letter of Credit conditional to justify the issuer of the Letter of Credit in failing to honor a drawing upon such Letter of Credit in a timely\nmanner.

Tenant\nhereby irrevocably waives and relinquishes the provisions of Section 1950.7 of the California Civil Code and any successor statute, and all other provisions\nof law, now or hereafter in effect, which (x) establish the time frame by which a landlord must refund a security deposit under a lease, and/or (y) provide\nthat a landlord may claim from a security deposit only those sums reasonably necessary to remedy defaults in the payment of rent, to repair damage caused\nby a tenant or to clean the premises, it being agreed that Landlord may, in addition, claim those sums specified in this Article 27 and/or those sums\nreasonably necessary to (a) compensate Landlord for any loss or damage caused by Tenant’s breach of this Lease, including any damages Landlord suffers\nfollowing termination of this Lease, and/or (b) compensate Landlord for any and all damages arising out of, or incurred in connection with, the termination\nof this Lease, including, without limitation, those specifically identified in Section 1951.2 of the California Civil Code.\n27.6    Subject to the terms hereof, provided that no Event of Default has previously occurred under this Lease and Tenant is not then in default\nunder this Lease, Tenant shall be entitled to the following reductions in the Letter of Credit Amount: (i) if as of the date that is thirty (30) months following\nthe Commencement Date (a) Tenant is generating operating income and (b) has achieved (1) Total Assets of at least $8,000,000, of which at least\n$2,000,000 is Cash, (2) Current Assets of at least $6,000,000, of which at least $2,000,000 is Cash, and (3) a Tangible Net Worth of at least $7,000,000, all\nas reflected on the most recent financial statements required to be delivered pursuant to Section 31,8 of this Lease, then the Letter of Credit Amount shall\nbe reduced to $250,000; and (ii) upon the date that Tenant has achieved (1) Total Assets of at least $26,000,000, of which at least $12,000,000 is Cash, (2)\nCurrent Assets of at least $24,000,000, of which at least $12,000,000 is Cash, and (3) a Tangible Net Worth of at least $24,000,000, all as reflected on the\nmost recent financial statements required to be delivered pursuant to Section 31.8 of this Lease, then the Letter of Credit Amount shall be reduced to\n$75,000.\n27.7    If Tenant is entitled to such reduction in the Letter of Credit Amount, then Landlord shall cooperate in a commercially reasonable manner\nwith Tenant upon Tenant’s request to replace or amend the Letter of Credit to reflect such reduced Letter of Credit Amount.

Subject to Article 15 hereof, this Lease shall benefit and bind Landlord and Tenant and the\npersonal representatives, heirs, successors and assigns of Landlord and Tenant. Unless required by a lender pursuant to section 22.1, neither this Lease nor\nany memorandum, short form, affidavit or other writing with respect thereto, shall be recorded by Tenant or anyone acting through, under or on behalf of\nTenant.

This Lease shall be governed by and construed in\naccordance with the laws of the State in which the Building is located.\n31.2    Tenant acknowledges that the late payment by Tenant of any monthly installment of Monthly Rent will cause Landlord to incur costs and\nexpenses, the exact amount of which is extremely difficult and impractical to fix. Such costs and expenses will include, without limitation, administration\nand collection costs and processing and accounting expenses. Therefore, if any monthly installment of Monthly Rent is not received by Landlord from\nTenant within three (3) days after such installment is due, Tenant shall immediately pay to Landlord a late charge equal to ten percent (10%) of such\ndelinquent installment. Landlord and Tenant agree that such late charge represents a reasonable estimate of such costs and expenses and is fair\ncompensation to Landlord for its loss suffered by Tenant’s failure to make timely payment. In no event shall such late charge be deemed to grant to Tenant\na grace period or extension of time within which to pay any Monthly Rent or prevent Landlord from exercising any right or remedy available to Landlord\nupon Tenant’s failure to pay each installment of Monthly Rent due under this Lease in a timely fashion, including the right to terminate this Lease. All\namounts of money payable by Tenant to Landlord hereunder, if not paid when due, shall bear interest from the due date until paid at the rate (the “Interest\nRate”) equal to ten percent (10%) per annum.\n31.3    If there is any legal action or proceeding between Landlord and Tenant to enforce any provision of this Lease or to protect or establish any\nright or remedy of either Landlord or Tenant hereunder, the unsuccessful party to such action or proceeding shall pay to the prevailing party all costs and\nexpenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred by such prevailing party in such action or proceeding and in any appeal in connection therewith. If\nsuch prevailing party recovers a judgment in any such action, proceeding or appeal, such costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees shall be included in and as a\npart of such judgment.
