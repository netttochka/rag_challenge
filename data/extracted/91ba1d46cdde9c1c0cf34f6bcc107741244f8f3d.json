The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor \nprotections for forward-looking statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their business. Forward-looking statements \ninclude statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other \nthan statements of historical facts. \n  \nThe Company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is including this cautionary \nstatement in connection with this safe harbor legislation. This report and any other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf may include forward-\nlooking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance, and are not intended to give any assurance as to future \nresults.

      "text": "Risks Related to Our Business and Financial Condition \n  \nIf the Suezmax tanker industry, which historically has been cyclical and volatile, is depressed in the future, our revenues, earnings and available cash flow may \ndecrease. \n  \nIt should be noted that we are specializing in Suezmax tankers. Historically, the tanker industry has been highly cyclical, with volatility in profitability, charter \nrates and asset values resulting from changes in the supply of and demand for tanker capacity. Fluctuations in charter rates and tanker values result from changes in \nthe supply of and demand for tanker capacity and changes in the supply of and demand for oil and oil products. These factors may adversely affect the rates payable \nand the amounts we receive in respect of our vessels. Our ability to re-charter our vessels on the expiration or termination of their current spot and time charters and \nthe charter rates payable under any renewal or replacement charters will depend upon, among other things, economic conditions in the tanker market and we cannot \nguarantee that any renewal or replacement charters we enter into will be sufficient to allow us to operate our vessels profitably. \n  \nThe factors that influence demand for tanker capacity include: \n  \n  \n3 \nTable of Contents \n•\nWe may not be able to finance our future capital commitments. \n•\nThe current state of the global financial markets and current economic conditions may adversely impact our results of operation, financial condition, cash\nflows and ability to obtain financing or refinance our existing and future credit facilities on acceptable terms. \n•\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness. \n•\nWe are subject to certain risks with respect to our counterparties on contracts, and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause us to\nsuffer losses or negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. \n•\nOur share price may continue to be highly volatile, which could lead to a loss of all or part of a shareholder’s investment. \n•\nWe operate in a cyclical and volatile industry and cannot guarantee that we will continue to make cash distributions. \n•\nFuture sales of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. \n•\nIneffective internal controls could impact the Company’s business and financial results. \n•\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lenders and other market participants with respect to our Environmental, Social and\nGovernance (“ESG”) policies may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks. \n•\nA decision of our Board of Directors and the laws of Bermuda may prevent the declaration and payment of dividends. \n•\nWe have antitakeover protections which could prevent a change of control. \n•\nIf our vessels call on ports located in countries or territories that are subject to sanctions or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government, the European\nUnion, the United Nations or other governmental authorities, it could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. \n•\nBecause we are a foreign corporation, you may not have the same rights that a shareholder in a U.S. corporation may have. \n•\nWe are incorporated in Bermuda and it may not be possible for our investors to enforce U.S. judgments against us. \n•\nWe may have to pay tax on United States source income, which would reduce our earnings. \n•\nIf the United States Internal Revenue Service were to treat us as a “passive foreign investment company,” that could have adverse tax consequences for\nUnited States shareholders. \n•\nWe may become subject to taxation in Bermuda which would negatively affect our results. \n•\nAs a Bermuda exempted company incorporated under Bermuda law with subsidiaries in another offshore jurisdiction, our operations may be subject to \neconomic substance requirements. \n•\nsupply of and demand for oil and oil products;"

      "text": "The factors affecting the supply and demand for tankers have been volatile and are outside of our control, and the nature, timing and degree of changes in \nindustry conditions are unpredictable, including those discussed above. Continued volatility may reduce demand for transportation of oil over longer distances and \nincrease supply of tankers to carry that oil, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, ability to \npay dividends and existing contractual obligations. \n  \nWe anticipate that the future demand for our tankers will be dependent upon economic growth in the world’s economies, seasonal and regional changes in \ndemand, changes in the capacity of the global tanker fleet and the sources and supply of oil and petroleum products to be transported by sea. Given the low number \nof new tankers currently on order with shipyards, the capacity of the global tanker fleet seems likely to be muted, but there can be no assurance as to the timing or \nextent of future economic growth. Adverse economic, political, social or other developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating \nresults. \n  \nDeclines in oil and natural gas prices or decreases in demand for oil and natural gas for an extended period of time, or market expectations of potential \ndecreases in these prices and demand, could negatively affect our future growth in the tanker and offshore sector. Sustained periods of low oil and natural gas prices \ntypically result in reduced exploration and extraction because oil and natural gas companies’ capital expenditure budgets are subject to cash flow from such activities \nand are therefore sensitive to changes in energy prices. Sustained periods of high oil prices on the other hand may be destructive for demand. These changes in \ncommodity prices can have a material effect on demand for our services, and periods of low demand can cause excess vessel supply and intensify the competition in \nthe industry, which often results in vessels, particularly older and less technologically advanced vessels, being idle for long periods of time. We cannot predict the \nfuture level of demand for our services or future conditions of the oil and natural gas industry. Any decrease in exploration, development or production expenditures \nby oil and natural gas companies or decrease in the demand for oil and natural gas could reduce our revenues and materially harm our business, results of operations \nand cash available for distribution. \n  \nWe are dependent on spot charters and any decrease in spot charter rates in the future may adversely affect our earnings, our ability to pay dividends and our \nability to repay our financial liabilities. \n  \nThe 19 vessels that we currently operate are primarily employed in the spot market with the two newbuildings delivered in 2022 chartered out on six-year time \ncharter agreements, and two vessels on longer term time-charter agreements expiring in late 2023 with an option to extend the agreement for a year for one of these \nvessels. We are therefore highly dependent on spot market charter rates. The spot market is very volatile and there have been and will be periods when spot charter \nrates decline below the operating cost of vessels. If future spot charter rates decline, we may be unable to operate our vessels trading in the spot market profitably, \nmeet our obligations, including payments on indebtedness, or pay dividends in the future. Furthermore, as charter rates for spot charters are fixed for a single voyage \nwhich may last up to several weeks, during periods in which spot charter rates are rising, we will generally experience delays in realizing the benefits from such \nincreases. \n \nWe will be exposed to prevailing charter rates in the crude tanker sectors when these vessels’ existing charters expire, and to the extent the counterparties to our \nfixed-rate charter contracts fail to honor their obligations to us. We will also enter into spot charters in the future. The spot charter market may fluctuate significantly \nbased upon tanker and oil supply and demand. \n \n5 \nTable of Contents \n•\nconversion of tankers to other uses or conversion of other vessels to tankers; \n•\nwith respect to tanker vessel supply, demand for alternative sources of energy and supply and demand for energy resources and oil and petroleum\nproducts; \n•\nproduct imbalances (affecting the level of trading activity) and developments in international trade; \n•\ndevelopments in international trade, including refinery additions and closures; \n•\nthe number of tankers that are out of service; and \n•\nchanges in environmental and other regulations that may limit the useful lives of tankers."

      "text": "The successful operation of our vessels in the competitive spot charter market depends on, among other things, obtaining profitable spot charters and minimizing, \nto the extent possible, time spent waiting for charters and time spent traveling in ballast to pick up cargo. When the current charters for our fleet expire or are \nterminated, it may not be possible to re-charter these vessels at similar rates, or at all, or to secure charters for any vessels we agree to acquire at similarly profitable \nrates, or at all. As a result, we may have to accept lower rates or experience off hire time for our vessels, which would adversely impact our revenues, results of \noperations and financial condition. \n \nChanges in the price of fuel and regulations may adversely affect our profits. \n  \nFuel, including bunkers, is a significant, if not the largest, expense in our shipping operations, and changes in the price of fuel may adversely affect our \nprofitability.  The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, such as the \nongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by OPEC and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing \ncountries and regions, regional production patterns and environmental concerns, which may reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our future \nperformance, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. \n  \nEffective January 1, 2020, the International Maritime Organization, or IMO, implemented a new regulation for a 0.50% global sulfur cap on emissions from \nvessels.  Under this new global cap, vessels must use marine fuels with a sulfur content of no more than 0.50% against the former regulations specifying a maximum \nof 3.50% sulfur in an effort to reduce the emission of sulfur oxide into the atmosphere. \n  \nAll of our vessels have transitioned to burning IMO compliant fuels.  Low sulfur fuel of 0.50% sulfur content or lower, is presently more expensive than the \nnon-compliant Heavy Fuel Oil containing 3.5% sulfur and may become more expensive. \n  \nOur operations and the performance of our vessels, and as a result our results of operations, cash flows and financial position, may be negatively affected to \nthe extent that compliant sulfur fuel oils are unavailable, of low or inconsistent quality, or upon occurrence of any of the other foregoing events. Costs of compliance \nwith these and other related regulatory changes may be significant and may have a material adverse effect on our future performance, results of operations, cash \nflows and financial position.  As a result, an increase in the price of fuel beyond our expectations may adversely affect our profitability at the time of charter \nnegotiation.  Further, fuel may become much more expensive in the future, which may reduce the profitability and competitiveness of our business versus other forms \nof transportation. \n  \nInability to renew the fleet would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends. \n  \nIf we do not set aside funds or are unable to borrow or raise funds for vessel replacement, we will be unable to replace the vessels in our fleet upon the \nexpiration of their useful lives. Our cash flows and income are dependent on the revenues earned by the chartering of our vessels. If we are unable to replace the \nvessels in our fleet upon the expiration of their useful lives, our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends would be adversely \naffected. Any funds set aside for vessel replacement will not be available for dividends. \n  \n6 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "The international Suezmax tanker industry has experienced volatile charter rates and vessel values and there can be no assurance that these charter rates and \nvessel values will not decrease in the near future. \n  \nThe Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, or the BDTI, a U.S. dollar daily average of charter rates issued by the Baltic Exchange that takes into account input from \nbrokers around the world regarding crude oil fixtures for various routes and oil tanker vessel sizes, is volatile. In 2022, the BDTI continued to be volatile, but with \nincreasing levels through the year and with sharp improvement compared to 2021. During 2022, it reached a high of 2,496 and a low of 679 compared to a high of 835 \nand a low of 432 in 2021. The Baltic Clean Tanker Index, or BCTI, a comparable index to the BDTI, has similarly been volatile and with stronger rates in the latter part \nof the year. In 2022, the BCTI reached a high of 2,143 and a low of 543. Markets in 2023 has continued their strong records compared to 2021 and the early part of \n2022, and the BDTI and BCTI although down from the highs of 2022, still at 1,319 and 1,014, respectively, as of April 11, 2023. There can be no assurance that the \ncrude oil and petroleum products charter market will increase or continue at the current levels, and the market could again decline. This volatility in charter rates \ndepends, among other factors, on changes in the supply and demand for tanker capacity and changes in the supply and demand for oil and oil products, the demand \nfor crude oil and petroleum products,  the inventories of crude oil and petroleum products in the United States and in other industrialized nations,  oil refining \nvolumes,  oil prices, and any restrictions on crude oil production imposed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and non-OPEC oil \nproducing countries. \n  \nCharter rates in the Suezmax tanker industry are volatile. We anticipate that future demand for our vessels, and in turn our future charter rates, will be \ndependent upon economic growth in the world’s economies, as well as seasonal and regional changes in demand and changes in the capacity of the world’s fleet. \nThere can be no assurance that economic growth will not stagnate or decline leading to a decrease in vessel values and charter rates. A decline in vessel values and \ncharter rates would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and ability to pay dividends. \n  \nOur results of operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which may adversely affect our financial condition. \n  \nWe operate our vessels in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand and, as a result, charter rates. Seaborne trading and \ndistribution patterns are primarily influenced by the relative advantage of the various sources of production, locations of consumption, pricing differentials and \nseasonality. Changes to the trade patterns of oil and oil products may have a significant negative or positive impact on the ton-mile and therefore the demand for our \ntankers. This could have a material adverse effect on our future performance, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. \n  \nDeclines in charter rates and other market deterioration could cause us to incur impairment charges. \n  \nOur vessels are evaluated for impairment continuously or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a vessel may \nnot be recoverable. The review for potential impairment indicators and projection of future cash flows related to the vessel is complex and requires us to make various \nestimates, including future charter rates and earnings from operating the vessel.  All of these items have historically been volatile. When impairment indicators are \nidentified, we estimate the undiscounted cash flows from operating the vessels over their remaining useful lives and compare those to the net carrying values of the \nvessels. If the total estimated undiscounted net cash flows for a vessel are less than the carrying amount of the vessel the vessel is deemed impaired and written \ndown to its fair market value. The carrying values of our vessels may not represent their fair market value at any point in time because the market prices of \nsecondhand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of newbuildings. Any impairment charges incurred as a result of declines in charter \nrates could negatively affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Impairment is assessed on a vessel by vessel basis. \n  \nThe value of our vessels may be depressed at the time we decide to sell a vessel. \n  \nTanker values have generally experienced high volatility. Investors can expect the fair market value of our tankers to fluctuate, depending on general \neconomic and market conditions affecting the tanker industry and competition from other shipping companies, types and sizes of vessels and other modes of \ntransportation. In addition, as vessels age, they generally decline in value. These factors will affect the value of our vessels for purposes of covenant compliance \nunder our borrowing facilities and at the time of any vessel sale. If for any reason we sell a tanker at a time when tanker prices have fallen, the sale may be at less than \nthe tanker’s carrying amount in our financial statements, with the result that we would also incur a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings from impairment \ncharges, which could reduce our ability to pay dividends and negatively affect our business, financial condition and operating results. The carrying values of our \nvessels may not represent their charter-free market value at any point in time. \n  \n7 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "An over-supply of Suezmax tanker capacity may lead to reductions in charter rates, vessel values, and profitability. \n  \nThe market supply of Suezmax tankers is affected by a number of factors such as demand for energy resources, oil, and petroleum products, as well as \noverall economic growth in parts of the world economy, including Asia, and has been increasing as a result of the delivery of substantial newbuilding orders over the \nlast few years. \n  \nThere has been a global trend towards energy efficient technologies, lower environmental emissions and alternative sources of energy. In the long-term, \ndemand for oil may be reduced by increased availability of such energy sources and machines that run on them. Furthermore, if the capacity of new ships delivered \nexceeds the capacity of tankers being scrapped and lost, tanker capacity will increase. If the supply of tanker capacity increases and if the demand for tanker capacity \ndoes not increase correspondingly, charter rates and vessel values could materially decline. These changes could have an adverse effect on our business, results of \noperations and financial position. \n \nIf the capacity of new ships delivered exceeds the capacity of tankers being scrapped and lost, tanker capacity will increase. If the supply of tanker capacity \nincreases and if the demand for tanker capacity does not increase correspondingly, charter rates could materially decline. A reduction in charter rates and the value of \nour vessels may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to pay dividends. \n  \nDelays or defaults by the shipyards in the construction of newbuildings could increase our expenses and diminish our net income and cash flows. \n  \nVessel construction projects are generally subject to risks of delay that are inherent in any large construction project, which may be caused by numerous \nfactors, including shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor, unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment or shipyard construction, \nfailure of equipment to meet quality and/or performance standards, financial or operating difficulties experienced by equipment vendors or the shipyard, \nunanticipated actual or purported change orders, inability to obtain required permits or approvals, design or engineering changes and work stoppages and other \nlabor disputes, adverse weather conditions, pandemics or any other events of force majeure. Significant delays could adversely affect our financial position, results \nof operations and cash flows. Additionally, failure to complete a project on time may result in the delay of revenue from that vessel, and we will continue to incur \ncosts and expenses related to delayed vessels, such as supervision expense and interest expense for the issued and outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2022, we \nhave not placed any orders for Suezmax vessels and as such, we are not exposed to any risk related to construction of newbuildings. The two newbuildings delivered \nto us in 2022 were delivered on time and at agreed cost. \n  \nTerrorist attacks and international hostilities and instability can affect the tanker industry, which could adversely affect our business. \n \nWe conduct most of our operations outside of the United States, and our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay \ndividends, if any, in the future may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where our vessels \nare employed or registered. Moreover, we operate in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political conflicts. \n  \nTerrorist attacks, the outbreak of war, or the existence of international hostilities could damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and \ndemand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect both the Company’s ability to charter its vessels and the charter rates payable under any such \ncharters. In addition, the Company operates in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effect of political instability, terrorist or other \nattacks, war or international hostilities. In the past, political instability has also resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt \ninternational shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region and most recently in the Black Sea in connection with the recent conflicts between Russia and the \nUkraine. \n \n8 \nTable of Contents"

The safety and security of our vessels and efficient operation of our business, including processing, transmitting and storing electronic and financial \ninformation, are dependent on computer hardware and software systems, which are increasingly vulnerable to security breaches and other disruptions. Any \nsignificant interruption or failure of our information systems or any significant breach of security could adversely affect our business and results of operations. \n  \nOur vessels rely on information systems for a significant part of their operations, including navigation, provision of services, propulsion, machinery \nmanagement, power control, communications and cargo management.

For example, the information systems of our \nvessels may be subject to threats from hostile cyber or physical attacks, phishing attacks, human errors of omission or commission, structural failures of resources we \ncontrol, including hardware and software, and accidents and other failures beyond our control. The threats to our information systems are constantly evolving and \nhave become increasingly complex and sophisticated. Furthermore, such threats change frequently and are often not recognized or detected until after they have \nbeen launched, and therefore, we may be unable to anticipate these threats and may not become aware in a timely manner of such a security breach, which could \nexacerbate any damage we experience.

We may incur unanticipated expenses as an operating company. It is possible that the number of employees employed \nby the company, or current operating and financial systems may not be adequate as we implement our plan to expand the size of our fleet.  Finally, acquisitions may \nrequire additional equity issuances or debt issuances (with amortization payments), both of which could lower dividends per share. If we are unable to expand or \nexecute the certain aspects of our business or events noted above, our financial condition and dividend rates may be adversely affected. \n  \nBecause some of our expenses are incurred in foreign currencies, we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations, which could negatively affect our results of \noperations. \n  \nThe charterers of our vessels pay us in U.S. dollars. While we mostly incur our expenses in U.S. dollars, we may incur expenses in other currencies, most \nnotably the Norwegian Kroner. Declines in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Norwegian Kroner, or the other currencies in which we may incur expenses in the \nfuture, would increase the U.S. dollar cost of paying these expenses and thus would affect our results of operations. \n  \nRisks Related to the Operations of Our Vessels and Regulations \n  \nThe operation of Suezmax tankers involves certain unique operational risks. \n  \nThe operation of Suezmax tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil.  An oil spill may cause significant environmental \ndamage, and a catastrophic spill could exceed the insurance coverage available. Compared to other types of vessels, tankers are exposed to a higher risk of damage \nand loss by fire, whether ignited by a terrorist attack, collision, or other cause, due to the high flammability and high volume of the oil transported in tankers. \n  \nFurther, our vessels and their cargoes will be at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as marine disasters, bad weather and other acts of \nGod, business interruptions caused by mechanical failures, grounding, fire, explosions and collisions, human error, war, terrorism, piracy, diseases (such as the \noutbreak of COVID-19), quarantine and other circumstances or events. Changing economic, regulatory and political conditions in some countries, including political \nand military conflicts, have from time to time resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways, piracy, terrorism, labor strikes and boycotts. These hazards may \nresult in death or injury to persons, loss of revenues or property, the payment of ransoms, environmental damage, higher insurance rates, damage to our customer \nrelationships and market disruptions, delay or rerouting. \n  \nIf our vessels suffer damage, they may need to be repaired at a drydocking facility. The costs of drydock repairs are unpredictable and may be substantial. \nWe may have to pay drydocking costs that our insurance does not cover at all or in full. The loss of revenues while these vessels are being repaired and \nrepositioned, as well as the actual cost of these repairs, may be material. In addition, space at drydocking facilities is sometimes limited and not all drydocking \nfacilities are conveniently located. We may be unable to find space at a suitable drydocking facility or our vessels may be forced to travel to a drydocking facility that \nis not conveniently located relative to our vessels’ positions. The loss of earnings while these vessels are forced to wait for space or to travel to more distant \ndrydocking facilities may also be material.

      "text": "We operate our Suezmax tankers worldwide and as a result, our vessels are exposed to international risks which may reduce revenue or increase expenses. \n  \nThe international shipping industry is an inherently risky business involving global operations. The operations of ocean-going vessels in international trade \nis affected by a number of risks. Our vessels are at a risk of damage or loss because of events such as mechanical failure, collision, human error, war, terrorism, piracy, \ncargo loss and bad weather. In addition, changing economic, regulatory and political conditions in some countries, including political and military conflicts, have from \ntime to time resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways, piracy, terrorism, labor strikes and boycotts. These sorts of events could interfere with shipping \nroutes and result in market disruptions which may reduce our revenue or increase our expenses. \n  \nInternational shipping is subject to various security and customs inspections and related procedures in countries of origin and destination and trans-\nshipment points.  Inspection procedures can result in the seizure of the cargo and/or our vessels, delays in loading, offloading or delivery, and the levying of \ncustoms duties, fines or other penalties against us. It is possible that changes to inspection procedures could impose additional financial and legal obligations on us. \nFurthermore, changes to inspection procedures could also impose additional costs and obligations on our customers and may, in certain cases, render the shipment \nof certain types of cargo uneconomical or impractical. Any such changes or developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, \ncash flows, financial condition and available cash. \n  \nThe smuggling of drugs or other contraband onto our vessels may lead to governmental claims against us. \n  \nWe expect that our vessels will call in ports where smugglers attempt to hide drugs and other contraband on vessels, with or without the knowledge of crew \nmembers. To the extent our vessels are found with contraband, whether inside or attached to the hull of our vessel and whether with or without the knowledge of any \nof our crew, we may face governmental or other regulatory claims which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial \ncondition and ability to pay dividends. \n  \nActs of piracy on ocean-going vessels could adversely affect our business. \n  \nActs of piracy have historically affected ocean-going vessels trading in regions of the world such as the South China Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Gulf of \nAden off the Coast of Somalia and, in particular, the Gulf of Guinea region off of Nigeria, which experienced increased incidents of piracy in recent years.  Acts of \npiracy and war like conditions could result in harm or danger to the crews onboard our vessels. In addition, if piracy attacks occur in regions in which our vessels are \ndeployed that insurers’ characterized as “war risk” zones or by the Joint War Committee as “war and strikes” listed areas, premiums payable for such coverage could \nincrease significantly and such insurance coverage may be more difficult to obtain. In addition, crew costs, including costs which may be incurred to the extent we \nemploy onboard security guards, could increase in such circumstances. We may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on us. In addition, detention hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against our vessels, or an increase in cost, or unavailability of insurance \nfor our vessels, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n  \nMaritime claimants could arrest one or more of our vessels, which could interrupt our cash flow. \n  \nCrew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against a vessel for \nunsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien-holder may enforce its lien by \"arresting\" or \"attaching\" a vessel through foreclosure \nproceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of our vessels could result in a significant loss of earnings for the related off-hire period. In addition, in \njurisdictions where the \"sister ship\" theory of liability applies, a claimant may arrest the vessel which is subject to the claimant's maritime lien and any \"associated\" \nvessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. In countries with \"sister ship\" liability laws, claims might be asserted against us or any of our \nvessels for liabilities of other vessels that we own. \n  \n12 \nTable of Contents"

Requisition for title occurs when a government takes \ncontrol of a vessel and becomes the owner. A government could also requisition one or more of our vessels for hire. Requisition for hire occurs when a government \ntakes control of a vessel and effectively becomes the charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war or emergency. \nGovernment requisition of one or more of our vessels could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and \nability to pay dividends \n  \nIf we purchase secondhand vessels, we may not receive warranties from the builder and operating cost may increase as a result of aging of the fleet. \n  \nFollowing a physical inspection of secondhand vessels prior to purchase, we do not have the same knowledge about their condition and cost of any \nrequired (or anticipated) repairs that we would have had if these vessels had been built for and operated exclusively by us. Accordingly, we may not discover defects \nor other problems with such vessels prior to purchase. Any such hidden defects or problems, when detected may be expensive to repair, and if not detected, may \nresult in accidents or other incidents for which we may become liable to third parties. Also, when purchasing previously owned vessels, we do not receive the benefit \nof any builder warranties if the vessels we buy are older than one year. \n  \nIn general, the costs to maintain a vessel in good operating condition increase with the age of the vessel. Older vessels are typically less fuel efficient than \nmore recently constructed vessels due to improvements in engine technology. Governmental regulations, safety and other equipment standards related to the age of \nvessels may require expenditures for alterations or the addition of new equipment to some of our vessels and may restrict the type of activities in which these vessels \nmay engage. We cannot assure you that, as our vessels age, market conditions will justify those expenditures or enable us to operate our vessels profitably during \nthe remainder of their useful lives. As a result, regulations and standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of \noperations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends. \n  \nOur insurance may not be adequate to cover our losses that may result from our operations due to the inherent operational risks of the tanker industry. \n  \nWe carry insurance to protect us against most of the accident related risks involved in the conduct of our business, including marine hull and machinery \ninsurance, protection and indemnity insurance, which includes pollution risks, crew insurance and war risk insurance. However, we may not be adequately insured to \ncover losses from our operational risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Additionally, our insurers may refuse to pay particular claims and our \ninsurance may be voidable by the insurers if we take, or fail to take, certain action, such as failing to maintain certification of our vessels with applicable maritime \nregulatory organizations. Any significant uninsured or under-insured loss or liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash \nflows and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the future \nduring adverse insurance market. Any loss of a vessel or extended vessel off-hire, due to an accident or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our \nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends. \n  \nAn increase in operating costs would decrease earnings and dividends per share. \n  \nUnder the charters of all of our operating vessels, we are responsible for vessel operating expenses. Our vessel operating expenses include the costs of \ncrew, lube oil, provisions, deck and engine stores, insurance and maintenance and repairs, which depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our \ncontrol. If our vessels suffer damage, they may need to be repaired at a drydocking facility.

Competitors with greater resources could enter \nand operate larger tanker fleets through consolidations or acquisitions, and may be able to offer more competitive prices and fleets. We will have to compete with \nother tanker owners, including major oil companies as well as independent tanker companies and our market share may decrease in the future and we may not find \nprofitable employment for our vessels, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to expand our business. \n  \nWe are subject to laws and regulations which can adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and our ability to pay \ndividends. \n  \nOur operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the form of international conventions and treaties, national, state and local laws and national \nand international regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which our vessels operate or are registered, which can significantly affect the ownership and operation of \nour vessels. These requirements include, but are not limited to, the United States (U.S.) Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act (generally referred to as CERCLA), the U.S. Clean Water Act (CWA), the U.S. Clean Air Act (CAA), the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf \nLands Act, European Union (EU) Regulations, the IMO, International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969 (as from time to time amended \nand generally referred to as CLC), the IMO International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships of 1973 (as from time to time amended and generally \nreferred to as MARPOL, including the designation of emission control areas (ECAs) thereunder), the IMO International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of \n1974 (as from time to time amended and generally referred to as SOLAS), the IMO International Convention on Load Lines of 1966 (as from time to time amended), the \nInternational Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage (generally referred to as the Bunker Convention), the IMO’s International Management \nCode for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (generally referred to as the ISM Code), the International Convention for the Control and \nManagement of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments Discharge (generally referred to as the BWM Convention), International Ship and Port Facility Security Code \n(ISPS), and the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (generally referred to as the MTSA). Compliance with such laws, regulations and standards, where \napplicable, may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes and may affect the resale value or useful lives of our vessels. We may also incur \nadditional costs in order to comply with other existing and future regulatory obligations, including, but not limited to, costs relating to air emissions, including \ngreenhouse gases, the management of ballast waters, maintenance and inspection, development and implementation of emergency procedures and insurance \ncoverage or other financial assurance of our ability to address pollution incidents. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of \noperations, cash flows and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends. A failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative \nand civil penalties, criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations. Environmental laws often impose strict liability for remediation of spills and \nreleases of oil and hazardous substances, which could subject us to liability without regard to whether we were negligent or at fault. Under OPA, for example, owners, \noperators and bareboat charterers are jointly and severally strictly liable for the discharge of oil within the 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone around the U.S. \n(unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war). An oil spill could result in significant liability, including fines, \npenalties, criminal liability and remediation costs for natural resource damages under other international and U.S. federal, state and local laws, as well as third-party \ndamages, including punitive damages, and could harm our reputation with current or potential charterers of our tankers. We are required to satisfy insurance and \nfinancial responsibility requirements for potential oil (including marine fuel) spills and other pollution incidents. Although we have arranged insurance to cover \ncertain environmental risks, and risk of environmental damages and impacts there can be no assurance that such insurance will be sufficient to cover all such risks or \nthat any claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and our ability to pay dividends. \n  \n14 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "Furthermore, the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon and the subsequent release of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, or other similar incidents in the future, may \nresult in further regulation of the tanker industry, and modifications to statutory liability schemes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, \nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement’s (“BSEE”) revised Production \nSafety Systems Rule (“PSSR”), effective December 27, 2018, modified and relaxed certain environmental and safety protections under the 2016 PSSR.  Additionally, \nthe BSEE amended the Well Control Rule, effective July 15, 2019, which rolled back certain reforms regarding the safety of drilling operations, and former U.S. \nPresident Trump had proposed leasing new sections of U.S. waters to oil and gas companies for offshore drilling.  In January 2021, current U.S. President Biden \nsigned an executive order temporarily blocking new leases for oil and gas drilling in federal waters.  However, attorney generals from 13 states filed suit in March 2021 \nto lift the executive order, and in June 2021, a federal judge in Louisiana granted a preliminary injunction against the Biden administration, stating that the power to \npause offshore oil and gas leases “lies solely with Congress.” In August 2022, a federal judge in Louisiana sided with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, along with \nthe other 12 plaintiff states, by issuing a permanent injunction against the Biden Administration’s moratorium on oil and gas leasing on federal public lands and \noffshore waters. With these rapid changes, compliance with any new requirements of OPA and future legislation or regulations applicable to the operation of our \nvessels could impact the cost of our operations and adversely affect our business. \n  \nAdditional legislation, regulations, or other requirements applicable to the operation of our vessels that may be implemented in the future could adversely \naffect our business. \n  \nIt should be noted that the U.S. is currently experiencing changes in its environmental policy, the results of which have yet to be fully determined.  For \nexample, in March 2017, former U.S. President Trump signed an executive order to review and possibly eliminate the EPA’s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and \nin August 2019, the Administration announced plans to weaken regulations for methane emissions. On August 13, 2020, the EPA released rules rolling back \nstandards to control methane and volatile organic compound emissions from new oil and gas facilities.  However, U.S. President Biden recently directed the EPA to \npublish a proposed rule suspending, revising, or rescinding certain of these rules, and on November 2, 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule under the CAA \ndesigned to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas sources. The proposed rule would reduce 41 million tons of methane emissions between 2023 and 2035 and \ncut methane emissions in the oil and gas sector by approximately 74 percent compared to emissions from this sector in 2005. EPA also issued a supplemental \nproposed rule in November 2022 to include additional methane reduction measures following public input and anticipates issuing a final rule in 2023. If these new \nregulations are finalized, they could affect our operations. \n  \nThese numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include, among others, data privacy requirements (in particular the European General Data \nProtection Regulation, enforceable as from May 25, 2018 and the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, as adopted by the European Commission on July 12, 2016), labor \nrelations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export requirements, U.S. laws such as the FCPA and other U.S. federal laws and \nregulations established by the office of Foreign Asset Control, local laws such as the UK Bribery Act 2010 or other local laws which prohibit corrupt payments to \ngovernmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that we, our agent or other \nintermediaries may inadvertently breach certain provisions thereunder. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, \nour officers or our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance \nprograms, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Violations of laws and regulations also could result in prohibitions on our ability to operate in one or \nmore countries and could materially damage our reputation, our ability to attract and retain employees, or our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nFurthermore, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior \nmanagement. Though we have implemented monitoring procedures and required policies, guidelines, contractual terms and audits, these measures may not prevent \nor detect failures by our agents or intermediaries regarding compliance. \n \nIn addition, many environmental requirements are designed to reduce the risk of pollution, such as from oil spills, and our compliance with these \nrequirements could be costly. To comply with these and other regulations, including: (i) the sulfur emission requirements of Annex VI of the International Convention \nfor the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”), which instituted a global 0.5% (lowered from 3.5% as of January 1, 2020) sulfur cap on marine fuel \nconsumed by a vessel, unless the vessel is equipped with a scrubber, and (ii) the BWM Convention of the International Maritime Organization (“IMO”), which \nrequires vessels to install expensive ballast water treatment systems, we may be required to incur additional costs to meet new maintenance and inspection \nrequirements, develop contingency plans for potential spills, and obtain insurance coverage. The increased demand for low sulfur fuels may increase the costs of fuel \nfor our vessels, none of which have scrubbers. Additional conventions, laws and regulations may be adopted that could limit our ability to do business or increase \nthe cost of doing business and which may materially and adversely affect our operations. \n \n15 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "Regulations relating to ballast water discharge may adversely affect our revenues and profitability. \n  \nThe IMO has imposed updated guidelines for ballast water management systems specifying the maximum amount of viable organisms allowed to be \ndischarged from a vessel’s ballast water.  Depending on the date of the IOPP renewal survey, existing vessels constructed before September 8, 2017 must comply with \nthe updated D-2 standard on or after September 8, 2019.  For most vessels, compliance with the D-2 standard will involve installing on-board systems to treat ballast \nwater and eliminate unwanted organisms.  Ships constructed on or after September 8, 2017 are to comply with the D-2 standards on or after September 8, 2017.  We \ncurrently have 2 vessels that do not comply with the updated guideline and costs of compliance may be substantial and adversely affect our revenues and \nprofitability. \n  \nFurthermore, United States regulations are currently changing. Although the 2013 Vessel General Permit (“VGP”) program and U.S. National Invasive \nSpecies Act (“NISA”) are currently in effect to regulate ballast discharge, exchange and installation, the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (“VIDA”), which was signed \ninto law on December 4, 2018, requires that the EPA develop national standards of performance for approximately 30 discharges, similar to those found in the VGP \nwithin two years. On October 26, 2020, the EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Vessel Incidental Discharge National Standards of Performance under \nVIDA. Within two years after the EPA publishes its final Vessel Incidental Discharge National Standards of Performance, the U.S. Coast Guard must develop \ncorresponding implementation, compliance and enforcement regulations regarding ballast water. The new regulations will require the installation of new equipment, \nwhich may cause us to incur substantial costs. \n  \nClimate change and greenhouse gas restrictions may adversely impact our operations and markets. \n  \nDue to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries and the IMO have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks \nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures may include, among others, adoption of cap-and-trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency \nstandards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. More specifically, on October 27, 2016, the International Maritime Organization’s Marine Environment \nProtection Committee (\"MEPC\") announced its decision concerning the implementation of regulations mandating a reduction in sulfur emissions from 3.5% currently \nto 0.5% as of the beginning of January 1, 2020. Additionally, in April 2018, nations at the MEPC 72 adopted an initial strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nfrom ships. The initial strategy identifies levels of ambition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including (1) decreasing the carbon intensity from ships through \nimplementation of further phases of the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) for new ships; (2) reducing carbon dioxide emissions per transport work, as an average \nacross international shipping, by at least 40% by 2030, pursuing efforts towards 70% by 2050, compared to 2008 emission levels; and (3) reducing the total annual \ngreenhouse emissions by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 while pursuing efforts towards phasing them out entirely. The European Union on the other hand \nhas indicated that it intends to accelerate its plans to include shipping into the emissions trading scheme. \n  \nThe European Commission has proposed adding shipping to the EU Emission Trading Scheme (“EU ETS”) as of 2023 with a phase-in period. It is expected \nthat shipowners will need to purchase and surrender a number of emission allowances that represent their recorded carbon emission exposure for a specific reporting \nperiod. The person or organisation responsible for the compliance with the EU ETS should be the shipping company, defined as the shipowner or any other \norganisation or person, such as the manager or the bareboat charterer, that has assumed the responsibility for the operation of the ship from the shipowner. On \nDecember 18, 2022, the Environmental Council and European Parliament agreed to include maritime shipping emissions within the scope of the EU ETS on a gradual \nintroduction of obligations for shipping companies to surrender allowances: 40% for verified emissions from 2024, 70% for 2025 and 100% for 2026.  Most large \nvessels will be included in the scope of the EU ETS from the outset.  Compliance with the Maritime EU ETS could result in additional compliance and administration \ncosts to properly incorporate the provisions of the Directive into our business routines. Additional EU regulations which are part of the EU’s Fit-for-55, could also \naffect our financial position in terms of compliance and administration costs when they take effect. \n  \n16 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "The EU ETS will be applied for maritime shipping as of 2024 with a phase-in period. Shipowners will need to purchase and surrender a number of emission \nallowances that represent their Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (“MRV”)-recorded carbon emission exposure for a specific reporting period. The geographical \nscope covers emissions generated at berth and on intra-EU voyages as well as 50% of the energy sources used on voyages inbound and outbound to/from the EU. \nThe person or organization responsible for the compliance with the EU ETS should be the shipping company, defined as the shipowner or any other organization or \nperson, such as the manager or the bareboat charterer, that has assumed the responsibility for the operation of the ship from the shipowner. Compliance with the \nMaritime EU ETS will result in additional compliance and administration costs to properly incorporate the provisions of the Directive into our business routines. \nAdditional EU regulations which are part of the EU’s Fit-for-55, could also affect our financial position in terms of compliance and administration costs when they \ntake effect. \n  \nWhile an EU ETS could accelerate building more efficient ships, any regional system comes with significant administrative burden and a risk of market \ndistortion. To drive the market towards more energy efficient ships, it is crucial that the EU polluter pays principle is applied. In terms of shipping chartering \nagreements, the 'polluter' might be considered as the body responsible for the decision of speed. The level of speed is dictating the fuel consumption during voyage \nand impact of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. Therefore, we believe that compliance accountability should lie to the entities that decide on the operational speed \nof the vessel. \n  \nSince January 1, 2020, ships have to either remove sulfur from emissions or buy fuel with low sulfur content, which may lead to increased costs and \nsupplementary investments for ship owners. The interpretation of \"fuel oil used on board\" includes use in main engine, auxiliary engines and boilers. Shipowners \nmay comply with this regulation by (i) using 0.5% sulfur fuels on board, which are available around the world but at a higher cost; (ii) installing scrubbers for cleaning \nof the exhaust gas; or (iii) by retrofitting vessels to be powered by liquefied natural gas or other alternative energy sources, which may not be a viable option due to \nthe lack of supply network and high costs involved in this process. Costs of compliance with these regulatory changes may be significant and may have a material \nadverse effect on our future performance, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. \n  \nIn addition, although the emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping currently are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, which required adopting countries to implement national programs to reduce emissions of certain gases, or the Paris \nAgreement (discussed further below), a new treaty may be adopted in the future that includes restrictions on shipping emissions. Compliance with changes in laws, \nregulations and obligations relating to climate change affects the propulsion options in subsequent vessel designs and could increase our costs related to acquiring \nnew vessels, operating and maintaining our existing vessels and require us to install new emission controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to our \ngreenhouse gas emissions or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program. Revenue generation and strategic growth opportunities may also be \nadversely affected. \n  \nMEPC 75 introduced draft amendments to Annex VI which impose new regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships. These amendments \nintroduce requirements to assess and measure the energy efficiency of all ships and set the required attainment values, with the goal of reducing the carbon intensity \nof international shipping. To achieve a 40% reduction in carbon emissions by 2023 compared to 2008, shipping companies are required to include: (i) a technical \nrequirement to reduce carbon intensity based on a new Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (“EEXI”), and (ii) operational carbon intensity reduction requirements, \nbased on a new operational carbon intensity indicator (“CII”). The EEXI is required to be calculated for ships of 400 gross tonnage and above. The IMO and MEPC \nwill calculated “required” EEXI levels based on the vessel’s technical design, such as vessel type, date of creation, size and baseline.  Additionally, an “attained” \nEEXI will be calculated to determine the actual energy efficiency of the vessel. A vessel’s attained EEXI must be less than the vessel’s required EEXI. Non-compliant \nvessels will have to upgrade their engine to continue to travel.  With respect to the CII, the draft amendments would require ships of 5,000 gross tonnage to \ndocument and verify their actual annual operational CII achieved against a determined required annual operational CII. The vessel’s attained CII must be lower than \nits required CII. Vessels that continually receive subpar CII ratings will be required to submit corrective action plans to ensure compliance. MEPC 79 also adopted \namendments to MARPOL Annex VI, Appendix IX to include the attained and required CII values, the CII rating and attained EEXI for existing ships in the required \ninformation to be submitted to the IMO Ship Fuel Oil Consumption Database.  The amendments will enter into force on May 1, 2024. \n  \n17 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "Additionally, MEPC 75 proposed draft amendments requiring that, on or before January 1, 2023, all ships above 400 gross tonnage must have an approved \nShip Energy Efficiency Management Plan, or SEEMP, on board. For ships above 5,000 gross tonnage, the SEEMP would need to include certain mandatory content. \nMEPC 75 also approved draft amendments to MARPOL Annex I to prohibit the use and carriage for use as fuel of heavy fuel oil by ships in Arctic waters on and after \nJuly 1, 2024. The draft amendments introduced at MEPC 75 were adopted at the MEPC 76 session held on June 2021, entered into force on November 1, 2022 and \nbecame effective on January 1, 2023. \n  \nMPEC 76 adopted amendments to the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships, 2001, or the AFS Convention, \nwhich have been entered into force on January 1, 2023. From this date, all ships shall not apply or re-apply anti-fouling systems containing cybutryne on or after \nJanuary 1, 2023; all ships bearing an anti-fouling system that contains cybutryne in the external coating layer of their hulls or external parts or surfaced on January 1, \n2023 shall either: remove the anti-fouling system or apply a coating that forms a barrier to this substance leaching from the underlying non-compliance anti-fouling \nsystem. \n  \nOn November 13, 2021, the Glasgow Climate Pact was announced following discussions at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (“COP26”). \nThe Glasgow Climate Pact calls for signatory states to voluntarily phase out fossil fuels subsidies. A shift away from these products could potentially affect the \ndemand for our vessels and negatively impact our future business, operating results, cash flows and financial position. COP26 also produced the Clydebank \nDeclaration, in which 22 signatory states (including the United States and United Kingdom) announced their intention to voluntarily support the establishment of \nzero-emission shipping routes. Governmental and investor pressure to voluntarily participate in these green shipping routes could cause us to incur significant \nadditional expenses to “green” our vessels. \n  \nIn addition, although the emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping currently are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, which required adopting countries to implement national programs to reduce emissions of certain gases, or the Paris \nAgreement (discussed further below), a new treaty may be adopted in the future that includes restrictions on shipping emissions. Compliance with changes in laws, \nregulations and obligations relating to climate change could increase our costs related to operating and maintaining our vessels and require us to install new emission \ncontrols, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program. Revenue \ngeneration and strategic growth opportunities may also be adversely affected. \n  \nIn March 2022, the SEC announced proposed rules with respect to climate-related disclosures, including with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and \ncertain climate-related financial statement metrics, which would apply to foreign private issuers listed on US national securities exchanges, such as us. Compliance \nwith such reporting requirements or any similar requirements may impose substantial obligations and costs on us. If we are unable to accurately measure and disclose \nrequired climate-related data in a timely manner, we could be subject to penalties in certain jurisdictions. \n  \nAdverse effects upon the oil and gas industry relating to climate change, including growing public concern about the environmental impact of climate \nchange, may also adversely affect demand for our services. For example, increased regulation of greenhouse gases or other concerns relating to climate change may \nreduce the demand for oil and gas in the future or create greater incentives for use of alternative energy sources. In addition to the peak oil risk from a demand \nperspective, the physical effects of climate change, including changes in weather patterns, extreme weather events, rising sea levels, scarcity of water resources, may \nnegatively impact our operations. Any long-term material adverse effect on the oil and gas industry could have a significant financial and operational adverse impact \non our business that we cannot predict with certainty at this time. \n  \n18 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "If we fail to comply with international safety regulations, we may be subject to increased liability, which may adversely affect our insurance coverage and may \nresult in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. \n  \nThe SOLAS Convention was amended to address the safe manning of vessels and emergency training drills.  The Convention of Limitation of Liability for \nMaritime Claims (the “LLMC”) sets limitations of liability for a loss of life or personal injury claim or a property claim against ship owners. We believe that all of our \nvessels are in substantial compliance with SOLAS and LLMC standards. \n  \nUnder Chapter IX of the SOLAS Convention, or the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (the \n“ISM Code”), our operations are also subject to environmental standards and requirements. The ISM Code requires the party with operational control of a vessel to \ndevelop an extensive safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth \ninstructions and procedures for operating its vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies. We rely upon the safety management system \nthat our technical management team have developed for compliance with the ISM Code. The failure of a vessel owner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ISM \nCode may subject such party to increased liability, may decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or \ndetention in, certain ports. \n  \nThe ISM Code requires that vessel operators obtain a safety management certificate for each vessel they operate. This certificate evidences compliance by a \nvessel’s management with the ISM Code requirements for a safety management system. No vessel can obtain a safety management certificate unless its manager has \nbeen awarded a document of compliance, issued by each flag state, under the ISM Code. We have obtained applicable documents of compliance for our offices and \nsafety management certificates for all of our vessels for which the certificates are required by the IMO. The documents of compliance and safety management \ncertificates are renewed as required. \n  \nRegulation II-1/3-10 of the SOLAS Convention governs ship construction and stipulates that ships over 150 meters in length must have adequate strength, \nintegrity and stability to minimize risk of loss or pollution. Goal-based standards amendments in SOLAS regulation II-1/3-10 entered into force in 2012, with July 1, \n2016 set for application to new oil tankers and bulk carriers.   The SOLAS Convention regulation II-1/3-10 on goal-based ship construction standards for bulk carriers \nand oil tankers, which entered into force on January 1, 2012, requires that all oil tankers and bulk carriers of 150 meters in length and above, for which the building \ncontract is placed on or after July 1, 2016, satisfy applicable structural requirements conforming to the functional requirements of the International Goal-based Ship \nConstruction Standards for Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers (GBS Standards). \n  \nAmendments to the SOLAS Convention Chapter VII apply to vessels transporting dangerous goods and require those vessels be in compliance with the \nInternational Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (“IMDG Code”). Effective January 1, 2018, the IMDG Code includes (1) updates to the provisions for radioactive \nmaterial, reflecting the latest provisions from the International Atomic Energy Agency, (2) new marking, packing and classification requirements for dangerous goods, \nand (3) new mandatory training requirements. Amendments which took effect on January 1, 2020 also reflect the latest material from the UN Recommendations on the \nTransport of Dangerous Goods, including (1) new provisions regarding IMO type 9 tank, (2) new abbreviations for segregation groups, and (3) special provisions for \ncarriage of lithium batteries and of vehicles powered by flammable liquid or gas. Additional amendments, which came into force on June 1, 2022, include (1) addition \nof a definition of dosage rate, (2) additions to the list of high consequence dangerous goods, (3) new provisions for medical/clinical waste, (4) addition of various ISO \nstandards for gas cylinders, (5) a new handling code, and (6) changes to stowage and segregation provisions. \n  \nThe IMO has also adopted the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (“STCW”).  As of February \n2017, all seafarers are required to meet the STCW standards and be in possession of a valid STCW certificate.  Flag states that have ratified SOLAS and STCW \ngenerally employ the classification societies, which have incorporated SOLAS and STCW requirements into their class rules, to undertake surveys to confirm \ncompliance. \n  \nThe IMO's Maritime Safety Committee and MEPC, respectively, each adopted relevant parts of the International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Water \n(the “Polar Code”). The Polar Code, which entered into force on January 1, 2017, covers design, construction, equipment, operational, training, search and rescue as \nwell as environmental protection matters relevant to ships operating in the waters surrounding the two poles. It also includes mandatory measures regarding safety \nand pollution prevention as well as recommendatory provisions.  The Polar Code applies to new ships constructed after January 1, 2017, and after January 1, 2018, \nships constructed before January 1, 2017 are required to meet the relevant requirements by the earlier of their first intermediate or renewal survey. \n  \n19 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "Furthermore, recent action by the IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee and United States agencies indicates that cybersecurity regulations for the maritime \nindustry are likely to be further developed in the near future in an attempt to combat cybersecurity threats. For example, cyber-risk management systems must be \nincorporated by ship-owners and managers by 2021. This might cause companies to create additional procedures for monitoring cybersecurity, which could require \nadditional expenses and/or capital expenditures.  The impact of such regulations is hard to predict at this time. \n  \nIn June 2022, SOLAS also set out new amendments that will take effect January 1, 2024, which include new requirements for: (1) the design for safe mooring \noperations, (2) the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (“GMDSS”), (3) watertight integrity, (4) watertight doors on cargo ships, (5) fault-isolation of fire \ndetection systems, (6) life-saving appliances, and (7) safety of ships using LNG as fuel.  These new requirements may impact the cost of our operations. \n  \nDevelopments in safety and environmental requirements relating to the recycling of vessels may result in escalated and unexpected costs. \n  \nThe 2009 Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships, or the Hong Kong Convention, aims to ensure \nships, being recycled once they reach the end of their operational lives, do not pose any unnecessary risks to the environment, human health and safety. Upon the \nHong Kong Convention’s entry into force, each ship sent for recycling will have to carry an inventory of its hazardous materials. The hazardous materials, whose use \nor installation are prohibited in certain circumstances, are listed in an appendix to the Hong Kong Convention. Ships will be required to have surveys to verify their \ninventory of hazardous materials initially, throughout their lives and prior to the ship being recycled. The Hong Kong Convention, which is currently open for \naccession by IMO Member States, will enter into force 24 months after the date on which 15 IMO Member States, representing at least 40% of world merchant \nshipping by gross tonnage, have ratified or approved accession. As of the date of this annual report, 20 countries have ratified or approved accession of the Hong \nKong Convention, yet the requirement of 40% of world merchant shipping by gross tonnage has not yet been satisfied. \n  \nOn November 20, 2013, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU adopted the Ship Recycling Regulation, which retains the requirements of the \nHong Kong Convention and requires that certain commercial seagoing vessels flying the flag of an EU Member State may be recycled only in facilities included on \nthe European list of permitted ship recycling facilities. \n  \nThese regulatory developments, when implemented, may lead to cost escalation by shipyards, repair yards and recycling yards. This may then result in a \ndecrease in the residual scrap value of a vessel, and a vessel could potentially not cover the cost to comply with latest requirements, which may have an adverse \neffect on our future performance, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. \n  \nRisks Related to our Indebtedness \n  \nServicing our debt limits funds available for other purposes and if we cannot service our debt, we may lose our vessels. \n  \nBorrowing under our credit facilities and financing arrangements requires us to dedicate a part of our cash flow from operations to paying interest and \ninstalments on our indebtedness. These payments limit funds available for working capital, capital expenditures and other purposes, including making distributions to \nshareholders and further equity or debt financing in the future. Amounts borrowed under the credit facilities bear interest at variable rates. Increases in prevailing \nrates could increase the amounts that we would have to pay to our lenders, even though the outstanding principal amount remains the same, and our net income and \ncash flows would decrease. We expect our earnings and cash flow to vary from year to year due to the cyclical nature of the tanker industry. In addition, our current \npolicy is not to accumulate cash, but rather to distribute our available cash to shareholders.

If we are unable to meet our debt \nobligations or if some other default occurs under our credit facilities, the lenders could elect to declare that debt, together with accrued interest and fees, to be \nimmediately due and payable and proceed against the collateral securing that debt, which constitutes our entire fleet. \n  \nOur borrowing facilities contain restrictive covenants, which could negatively affect our growth, cause our financial performance to suffer and limit our ability to \npay dividends. \n  \nOur outstanding debt requires us or our subsidiaries to maintain financial covenants. Because some of these ratios are dependent on the market value of \nvessels, should charter rates or vessel values materially decline in the future, we may be required to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to \nour business objectives to meet any such financial ratios and satisfy any such financial covenants. Events beyond our control, including changes in the economic \nand business conditions in the shipping markets in which we operate, interest rate developments, changes in the funding costs of our banks, changes in vessel \nearnings and asset valuations and outbreaks of epidemic and pandemic of diseases, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, may affect our ability to comply with these \ncovenants. We cannot assure you that we will meet these ratios or satisfy our financial or other covenants or that our lenders will waive any failure to do so. \n  \nThese financial and other covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities \nor take certain corporate actions. The covenants may also restrict our flexibility in planning for changes in our business and the industry and make us more \nvulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments. A breach of any of the covenants in, or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios under the \nborrowing facilities would prevent us from paying dividends to our shareholders and could result in a default under our borrowing facilities. If a default occurs under \nour borrowing facilities, the lenders could elect to declare the issued and outstanding debt, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and \npayable and foreclose on the collateral securing that debt, which could constitute all or substantially all of our assets. \n  \nAs of December 31, 2022, and as of the date of this annual report, we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained and other restrictions in our \ndebt agreements. \n  \nVolatility of LIBOR and potential changes of the use of LIBOR as a benchmark could affect our profitability, earnings and cash flow. \n \nOn March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced the future cessation or loss of representativeness of LIBOR as currently published by the ICE \nBenchmark Administration (“IBA”) with a target date immediately after June 30, 2023.

The United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to cease issuing U.S. Dollar LIBOR \ninstruments after 2021. As such, any new loan agreements we enter into will not use LIBOR as an interest rate, and we will need to transition our existing loan \nagreements from U.S. Dollar LIBOR to an alternative reference rate prior to June 2023. \n \n21 \nTable of Contents \n•\nseeking to raise additional capital; \n•\nrefinancing or restructuring our debt; \n•\nselling vessels or other assets; or \n•\nreducing or delaying capital investments."

No assurance can however be given that the \nuse of these derivative instruments, if any, may effectively protect us from adverse interest rate movements. The use of interest rate derivatives may affect our results \nthrough mark to market valuation of these derivatives. Also, adverse movements in interest rate derivatives may require us to post cash as collateral, which may \nimpact our free cash position. Interest rate derivatives may also be impacted by the transition from LIBOR to SOFR or other alternative rates. \n \nThe discontinuation of LIBOR presents a number of risks to our business, including volatility in applicable interest rates among our financing agreements, potential \nincreased borrowing costs for future financing agreements or unavailability of or difficulty in attaining financing, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our \nprofitability, earnings and cash flow. \n \nVariable rate indebtedness could subject us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly. \n \nOur credit facilities use variable interest rates and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate \nindebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, and our profitability and cash available for servicing our indebtedness would decrease. \n \nWe may not be able to finance our future capital commitments. \n  \nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain financing at all or on terms acceptable to us. If adequate funds are not available, we may have to reduce \nexpenditures for investments in new and existing projects, which could hinder our growth and prevent us from realizing potential revenues from prior investments \nwhich will have a negative impact on our cash flows and results of operations. \n  \nThe current state of the global financial markets and current economic conditions may adversely impact our results of operation, financial condition, cash flows \nand ability to obtain financing or refinance our existing and future credit facilities on acceptable terms. \n  \nGlobal financial markets and economic conditions have been disrupted and volatile at times over the past decade, including in 2020, 2021 and 2022 as a result \nof the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. While the global economy had improved in recent years, the outbreak of COVID-19 \ndramatically disrupted the global economy. Economic growth is expected to slow, including due to supply-chain disruption, the recent surge in inflation and related \nactions by central banks and geopolitical conditions, with a significant risk of recession in many parts of the worlds in the near term. Credit markets and the debt and \nequity capital markets have been distressed and the uncertainty surrounding the future of the global credit markets has resulted in reduced access to credit \nworldwide, particularly for the shipping industry. These issues, along with significant write-offs in the financial services sector, the re-pricing of credit risk and the \nuncertain economic conditions, have made, and may continue to make, it difficult to obtain additional financing. The current state of global financial markets and \ncurrent economic conditions might adversely impact our ability to issue additional equity at prices that will not be dilutive to our existing shareholders or preclude us \nfrom issuing equity at all. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares. \n  \nAlso, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally, and the solvency of counterparties specifically, the availability and cost of \nobtaining money from the public and private equity and debt markets has become more difficult. Many lenders have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending \nstandards, refused to refinance existing debt at all or on terms similar to current debt, and reduced, and in some cases ceased, to provide funding to borrowers and \nother market participants, including equity and debt investors, and some have been unwilling to invest on attractive terms or even at all. Due to these factors, we \ncannot be certain that financing will be available if needed and to the extent required, or that we will be able to refinance our existing and future credit facilities, on \nacceptable terms or at all. If financing or refinancing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet our \nobligations as they come due or we may be unable to enhance our existing business, complete additional vessel acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business \nopportunities as they arise. \n  \n22 \nTable of Contents"

If the ships in our fleet are deemed not to satisfy the emissions and other sustainability standards contemplated by the \nPoseidon Principles, to which we are a participant, the availability and cost of bank financing for such vessels may be adversely affected. \n  \nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness. \n  \nIn the event that we are unable to service or repay our debt obligations out of our operating activities, we may need to refinance our indebtedness and we \ncannot assure you that we will be able to do so on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. The actual or perceived tanker market rate environment and prospects and \nthe market value of our fleet, among other things, may materially affect our ability to obtain new debt financing. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness, we \nmay choose to issue securities or sell certain of our assets in order to satisfy our debt obligations. \n  \nWe are subject to certain risks with respect to our counterparties on contracts, and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause us to \nsuffer losses or negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. \n  \nWe have entered into various contracts, including charter agreements with our customers, our borrowing facilities, and from time to time we may enter into \nnewbuilding contracts. Such agreements subject us to counterparty risks. The ability of each of our counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with us \nwill depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the maritime and \noffshore industries, the overall financial condition of the counterparty, charter rates received for specific types of vessels, work stoppages and other labor \ndisturbances, including as a result of COVID-19 and various expenses. For example, the combination of a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in world trade, \na reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in the \nability of our charterers to make charter payments to us. In addition, in depressed market conditions, our charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that is \ncurrently under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates. As a result, charterers and customers may seek to renegotiate the \nterms of their existing charter parties or avoid their obligations under those contracts. Should a counterparty fail to honor its obligations under agreements with us, \nwe could sustain significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result, \nwe could sustain significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as \nour ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future, and comply with covenants in our borrowing facilities. \n  \nRisks Relating to Investing in Our Common Shares \n  \nOur share price may continue to be highly volatile, which could lead to a loss of all or part of a shareholder’s investment. \n  \nThe market price of our common shares has fluctuated widely since our common shares began trading in on the NYSE. Over the last few years, the stock \nmarket has experienced price and volume fluctuations, especially due to factors relating to impacts of COVID-19. This volatility has sometimes been unrelated to the \noperating performance of particular companies. During 2022, the price of our common shares experienced a high of $3.80 in November and a low of $1.41 in February.  \nAs of April 21, 2023, the price of our common shares was $3.58. This market and share price volatility relating to the effects of the conflict in Ukraine and COVID-19, \nas well as general economic, market or political conditions, has and could further reduce the market price of our common shares in spite of our operating performance \nand could also increase our cost of capital, which could prevent us from accessing debt and equity capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. \n  \n23 \nTable of Contents"

It is possible that our revenues could be reduced as a result of decreases in charter rates or \nthat we could incur other expenses or contingent liabilities that would reduce or eliminate the cash available for distribution as dividends. Further, our credit facilities \nlimit our ability to distribute dividends. For more information, please see “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospectus—B. Liquidity and Capital \nResources—Our Borrowing Activities.” We may not continue to pay dividends at rates previously paid or at all.  If we do not pay dividends, the market price for our \ncommon shares must appreciate for investors to realize a gain on their investment. This appreciation may not occur and our common shares may in fact depreciate in \nvalue, in part because of any future decreases in or elimination of our dividend payments. \n  \nFuture sales of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. \n  \nThe market price of our common stock could decline due to sales of our shares in the market or the perception that such sales could occur.

Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the \npreparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement \nrequired new or improved controls, or if the Company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the Company’s business and financial results could be harmed \nand the Company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. \n  \nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lenders and other market participants with respect to our Environmental, Social and Governance \n(“ESG”) policies may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks. \n  \nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG policies. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, \ninvestment funds, lenders and other market participants are increasingly focused on ESG practices, especially as they relate to the environment health and safety, \ndiversity, labor conditions and human rights in recent years, and have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. \n  \nIn February 2021, the Acting Chair of the SEC issued a statement directing the Division of Corporation Finance to enhance its focus on climate-related \ndisclosure in public company filings and in March 2021 the SEC announced the creation of a Climate and ESG Task Force in the Division of Enforcement (the “Task \nForce”). The Task Force’s goal is to develop initiatives to proactively identify ESG-related misconduct consistent with increased investor reliance on climate and \nESG-related disclosure and investment. To implement the Task Force’s purpose, the SEC has taken several enforcement actions, with the first enforcement action \ntaking place in May 2022, and promulgated new rules. On March 21, 2022, the SEC proposed that all public companies are to include extensive climate-related \ninformation in their SEC filings. On May 25, 2022, SEC proposed a second set of rules aiming to curb the practice of \"greenwashing\" (i.e., making unfounded claims \nabout one's ESG efforts) and would add proposed amendments to rules and reporting forms that apply to registered investment companies and advisers, advisers \nexempt from registration, and business development companies.

Failure to adapt to or comply with evolving investor, lender or other industry \nshareholder expectations and standards, or the perception of not responding appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a \nlegal requirement to do so, may damage such a company’s reputation or stock price, resulting in direct or indirect material adverse effects on the company’s business \nand financial condition. \n  \nThe increase in shareholder proposals submitted on environmental matters and, in particular, climate-related proposals in recent years indicates that we may \nface increasing pressures from investors, lenders and other market participants, who are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy \npractices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability. As a result, we may be required to implement more stringent ESG procedures or standards so that \nour existing and future investors and lenders remain invested in us and make further investments in us, especially given the highly focused and specific trade of \ncrude oil transportation in which we are engaged. If we do not meet these standards, our business and/or our ability to access capital could be harmed. \n  \nWe may face increasing pressures from investors, lenders, customers and other market participants, who are increasingly focused on climate change, to \nprioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability. As a result, we may be required to implement more stringent ESG \nprocedures or standards so that our existing and future investors and lenders remain invested in us and make further investments in us. If we do not meet these \nstandards, our business and/or our ability to access capital could be harmed. \n  \nAdditionally, certain investors and lenders may exclude shipping companies, such as us, from their investing portfolios altogether due to environmental, \nsocial and governance factors.  These limitations in both the debt and equity capital markets may affect our ability to grow as our plans for growth may include \naccessing the equity and debt capital markets.  If those markets are unavailable, or if we are unable to access alternative means of financing on acceptable terms, or at \nall, we may be unable to implement our business strategy, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and impair \nour ability to service our indebtedness. Further, it is likely that we will incur additional costs and require additional resources to implement, monitor, report and \ncomply with wide ranging ESG requirements.  The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. \n  \nMoreover, from time to time, in alignment with our sustainability priorities, we aim at establishing and publicly announce goals and commitments in respect \nof certain ESG items, such as shipping decarbonization. While we may create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, many of the \nstatements in those voluntary disclosures are based on hypothetical expectations and assumptions that may or may not be representative of current or actual risks or \nevents or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be \nprone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established standardized approach to identifying, measuring and \nreporting on many ESG matters. If we fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our environmental goals and commitments, the resulting \nnegative publicity could adversely affect our reputation and/or our access to capital. \n  \nIn the future there may be additional sustainability reporting requirements that the Company becomes subject to that may require us to incur additional \nexpenditures in the future. When effective, we will focus on monitoring, managing and securing compliance with any new directives. \n  \nFinally, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating \ncompanies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavourable ESG ratings and \nrecent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with fossil fuel-related assets could lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and \nour industry and to the diversion of investment to other, non-fossil fuel markets, which could have a negative impact on our access to and costs of capital. \n  \n26 \nTable of Contents"

Our shareholders’ rights plan is not intended to deter offers that our Board \ndetermines are in the best interests of our shareholders. \n  \nIf our vessels call on ports located in countries or territories that are subject to sanctions or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government, the European Union, the \nUnited Nations or other governmental authorities, it could result in monetary fines or other penalties, and may adversely affect our reputation and the market and \ntrading price of our common stock. \n  \n  The U.S. sanctions and embargo laws and regulations vary in their application, as they do not all apply to the same covered persons or proscribe the same \nactivities, and such sanctions and embargo laws and regulations may be amended or expanded over time as is the case with the war in Ukraine.  Current or future \ncounterparties of ours, including charterers, may be affiliated with persons or entities that are or may be in the future the subject of sanctions or embargoes imposed \nby the U.S., the EU, and/or other international bodies.

These sanctions adversely affect our ability to operate in the region and also \nrestrict parties whose cargo we may carry. Sanctions against Russia have also placed significant prohibitions on the maritime transportation of seaborne Russian oil, \nthe importation of certain Russian energy products and other goods, and new investments in the Russian Federation.  These sanctions further limit the scope of \npermissible operations and cargo we may carry. \n  \nBeginning in February of 2022, President Biden and several European leaders announced various economic sanctions against Russia in connection with the \naforementioned conflicts in the Ukraine region, which may adversely impact our business, given Russia’s role as a major global exporter of crude oil and natural gas. \nBoth the EU as well as the United States have implemented sanction programs, which includes prohibitions on the import of certain Russian energy products into the \nUnited States, including crude oil, petroleum, petroleum fuels, oils, liquefied natural gas and coal, as well as prohibitions on new investments in Russia, among other \nrestrictions.  Furthermore, the EU and the United States has also prohibited a variety of specified services related to the maritime transport of Russian Federation \norigin crude oil and petroleum products, including trading/commodities brokering, financing, shipping, insurance (including reinsurance and protection and \nindemnity), flagging, and customs brokering. These prohibitions took effect on December 5, 2022 with respect to the maritime transport of crude oil and took effect on \nFebruary 5, 2023 with respect to the maritime transport of other petroleum products.  An exception exists to permit such services when the price of the seaborne \nRussian oil does not exceed the relevant price cap; but implementation of this price exception relies on a recordkeeping and attestation process that allows each party \nin the supply chain of seaborne Russian oil to demonstrate or confirm that oil has been purchased at or below the price cap.  Violations of the price cap policy or the \nrisk that information, documentation, or attestations provided by parties in the supply chain are later determined to be false may pose additional risks adversely \naffecting our business. \n  \n27 \nTable of Contents"

In \naddition, you should not assume that courts in the countries in which we are incorporated or where our vessels are located (1) would enforce judgments of U.S. \ncourts obtained in actions against us based upon the civil liability provisions of applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws or (2) would enforce, in original \nactions, liabilities against us based on those laws. \n  \nWe may have to pay tax on United States source income, which would reduce our earnings. \n  \nUnder the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, 50% of the gross shipping income of a vessel owning or chartering \ncorporation, such as ourselves, attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States will be characterized as \nU.S. source shipping income and such income is subject to a 4% United States federal income tax, without the benefit of deductions, unless that corporation is \nentitled to a special tax exemption under the Code which applies to income derived by certain non-United States corporations from the international operations of \nships. We believe that we currently qualify for this statutory tax exemption and we have taken, and will continue to take, this position on the Company’s United \nStates federal income tax returns. However, there are several risks that could cause us to become subject to tax on our United States source shipping income. Due to \nthe factual nature of the issues involved, we can give no assurances as to our tax-exempt status for our future taxable years. \n  \n28 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "If we are not entitled to this statutory tax exemption for any taxable year, we would be subject for any such year to a 4% U.S. federal income tax on our U.S. \nsource shipping income, without the benefit of deductions. The imposition of this tax could have a negative effect on our business and would result in decreased \nearnings available for distribution to our shareholders. \n  \nIf the United States Internal Revenue Service were to treat us as a “passive foreign investment company,” that could have adverse tax consequences for United \nStates shareholders. \n  \nA foreign corporation is treated as a “passive foreign investment company,” or PFIC, for United States federal income tax purposes, if either (1) at least 75% \nof its gross income for any taxable year consists of certain types of “passive income” or (2) at least 50% of the average value of the corporation’s assets produce or \nare held for the production of those types of passive income. For purposes of these tests, cash is treated as an asset that produces passive income, and passive \nincome includes dividends, interest, and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties which are \nreceived from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business. Income derived from the performance of services does not constitute \npassive income. United States shareholders of a PFIC may be subject to a disadvantageous United States federal income tax regime with respect to the distributions \nthey receive from the PFIC and the gain, if any, they derive from the sale or other disposition of their shares in the PFIC. \n  \nWe believe that we ceased to be a PFIC beginning with the 2005 taxable year. Based on our current and expected future operations, we believe that we are \nnot currently a PFIC, nor do we anticipate that we will become a PFIC for any future taxable year. As a result, non-corporate United States shareholders should be \neligible to treat dividends paid by us in 2006 and thereafter as “qualified dividend income” which is subject to preferential tax rates. \n  \nWe expect to derive more than 25% of our income each year from our spot chartering or time chartering activities. We also expect that more than 50% of the \nvalue of our assets will be devoted to our spot chartering and time chartering. Therefore, since we believe that such income will be treated for relevant United States \nfederal income tax purposes as services income, rather than rental income, we have taken, and will continue to take, the position that such income should not \nconstitute passive income, and that the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income, in particular our vessels, should not \nconstitute assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income for purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC in any taxable year. \n  \nThere is, however, no direct legal authority under the PFIC rules addressing our method of operation. We believe there is substantial legal authority \nsupporting our position consisting of case law and United States Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, pronouncements concerning the characterization of income \nderived from time charters and voyage charters as services income rather than rental income for other tax purposes. However, there is also authority which \ncharacterizes time charter income as rental income rather than services income for other tax purposes.  Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the IRS or a court \nof law will accept our position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law could determine that we are a PFIC. Moreover, no assurance can be given that we \nwould not constitute a PFIC for any future taxable year if there were to be changes in the nature and extent of our operations. \n  \nIf the IRS or a court of law were to find that we are or have been a PFIC for any taxable year beginning with the 2005 taxable year, our United States \nshareholders who owned their shares during such year would face adverse United States federal income tax consequences and certain information reporting \nobligations. Under the PFIC rules, unless those United States shareholders made or make an election available under the Code (which election could itself have \nadverse consequences for such United States shareholders), such United States shareholders would be subject to United States federal income tax at the then \nhighest income tax rates on ordinary income plus interest upon excess distributions (i.e., distributions received in a taxable year that are greater than 125% of the \naverage annual distributions received during the shorter of the three preceding taxable years or the United States shareholder’s holding period for our common \nshares) and upon any gain from the disposition of our common shares, as if the excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the United States \nshareholder’s holding period of our common shares. In addition, non-corporate United States shareholders would not be eligible to treat dividends paid by us as \n“qualified dividend income” if we are a PFIC in the taxable year in which such dividends are paid or in the immediately preceding taxable year. \n  \n29 \nTable of Contents"

Although at that time not considered “non-cooperative jurisdictions,” certain countries, including Bermuda and the Marshall Islands \nwere listed as having “tax regimes that facilitate offshore structures which attract profits without real economic activity.” In connection with the Conclusions, and to \navoid being placed on the list of “non-cooperative jurisdictions,” the government of Bermuda, among others, committed to addressing COCG proposals relating to \neconomic substance for entities doing business in or through their respective jurisdictions and to pass legislation to implement any appropriate changes by the end \nof 2018. \n  \nThe Economic Substance Act 2018 and the Economic Substance Regulations 2018 of Bermuda (the “Economic Substance Act” and the “Economic \nSubstance Regulations”, respectively) became operative on 31 December 2018.

A relevant activity for the purposes of \nthe Economic Substance Act is banking business, insurance business, fund management business, financing and leasing business, headquarters business, shipping \nbusiness, distribution and service centre business, intellectual property business and conducting business as a holding entity, which means acting as a pure equity \nholding entity. \n  \nThe Economic Substance Act provides that a registered entity that carries on a relevant activity complies with economic substance requirements if (a) it is \ndirected and managed in Bermuda, (b) its core income-generating activities (as may be prescribed) are undertaken in Bermuda with respect to the relevant activity, (c) \nit maintains adequate physical presence in Bermuda, (d) it has adequate full time employees in Bermuda with suitable qualifications and (e) it incurs adequate \noperating expenditure in Bermuda in relation to the relevant activity. \n  \nA registered entity that carries on a relevant activity is obliged under the Economic Substance Act to file a declaration in the prescribed form (the \n“Declaration”) with the Registrar of Companies (the “Registrar”) on an annual basis. \n  \nThe Economic Substance Regulations provide that minimum economic substance requirements shall apply in relation to an entity if the entity is a pure \nequity holding entity whose sole function is to acquire and hold shares or an equitable interest in other entities, and the shares or equitable interest are controlling \nstakes in other entities. The minimum economic substance requirements include a) compliance with applicable corporate governance requirements set forth in the \nBermuda Companies Act 1981 including keeping records of account, books and papers and financial statements and b) submission of a Declaration.

      "text": "As of December 31, 2022, and through to the date of this report, our fleet was as follows: \n  \n \nEmployment of Our Fleet \n  \nIt is our policy to operate the majority of our vessels either in the spot market or on shorter-term time charters. Large international oil companies, oil traders \nand independent oil companies both in the Western and the Eastern parts of the world are important customers. \n  \nSpot Charters: Tankers operating in the spot market are typically chartered for a single voyage which may last up to several weeks. Under a voyage charter, \nwe are responsible for paying voyage expenses and the charterer is responsible for any delay at the loading or discharging ports. When our tankers are operating on \nspot charters, the vessels are traded fully at the risk and reward of the Company. Revenues are recognized in a manner to reflect the transfer of the services to our \ncustomers over the duration of the voyage and freight is generally billed to the customer upon discharge of the cargo. The Company considers it appropriate to \npresent this type of arrangement on a gross basis in the Statements of Operations. For further information concerning our accounting policies, please see Note 2 to \nour financial statements. \n  \nThe tanker industry has historically been stronger in the fall and winter months in anticipation of increased oil consumption in the norther hemisphere \nduring the winter months. Seasonal variations in tanker demand normally result in seasonal fluctuations in the spot market charters. \n  \nTime Charters: Under a time charter, the charterer is responsible and pays for the voyage expenses, such as port, canal and fuel costs, while the shipowner \nis responsible and pays for vessel operating expenses, including, among other costs, crew costs, provisions, deck and engine stores, lubricating oil, insurance, \nmaintenance and repairs and costs relating to a vessel’s intermediate and special surveys. Revenue from time charter contracts are recognized daily over the term of \nthe charter. Time charter agreements with profit-sharing are recognized when the contingency related to it is resolved. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any \ntime charter agreements with profit-sharing. \n  \nTechnical Management \n  \nThe technical management of our vessels is handled by companies under direct instructions from NAT. The ship management firms V.Ships Norway AS, \nColumbia Shipmanagement Ltd, Cyprus and Hellespont Ship Management GmbH & Co KG, Germany, provide the technical management services.

      "text": "The International Tanker Market \n  \nInternational seaborne oil and petroleum products transportation services are mainly provided by two types of operators: major oil company captive fleets \n(both private and state-owned) and independent shipowner fleets.  Both types of operators transport oil under short-term contracts (including single-voyage “spot \ncharters”) and long-term time charters with oil companies, oil traders, large oil consumers, petroleum product producers and government agencies.  The oil companies \nown, or control through long-term time charters, approximately one third of the current world tanker capacity, while independent companies own or control the \nbalance of the fleet.  The oil companies use their fleets not only to transport their own oil, but also to transport oil for third-party charterers in direct competition with \nindependent owners and operators in the tanker charter market. \n  \nThe oil transportation industry has historically been subject to regulation by national authorities and through international conventions.  Over recent years, \nhowever, an environmental protection regime has evolved which may have a significant impact on the operations of participants in the industry in the form of \nincreasingly more stringent inspection requirements, closer monitoring of pollution-related events, and generally higher costs and potential liabilities for the owners \nand operators of tankers. \n  \nIn order to benefit from economies of scale, tanker charterers typically charter the largest possible vessel to transport oil or products, consistent with port \nand canal dimensional restrictions and optimal cargo lot sizes.  A tanker’s carrying capacity is measured in deadweight tons, or dwt, which is the amount of crude oil \nmeasured in metric tons that the vessel is capable of loading but also in barrels of oil.  VLCCs that can carry 2 million barrels of crude oil typically transport oil in long-\nhaul trades, such as from the Arabian Gulf to Far East and Rotterdam via the Cape of Good Hope or from West Africa and US Gulf to the Far East via Cape of Good \nHope. Suezmax tankers that carry 1 million barrels of crude oil also engage in long-haul as well as in medium-haul trades, such as from the Mediterranean, Black Sea, \nWest Africa, South America and Arabian Gulf towards a variety of destinations such as India, Far East, Europe and US. Aframax-size vessels generally engage in \nboth medium-and short-haul trades of less than 1,500 miles and carry crude oil or petroleum products.  Smaller tankers mostly transport petroleum products in short-\nhaul to medium-haul trades. \n \nThe 2022 Tanker Market (Source; Fearnleys) \n  \nSuezmax earnings in 2022, basis fixture date for forward loading for modern vessels, averaged $48,800/day, significantly higher than the average $5,200/day \nin 2021 according to Fearnleys. Note, however, that this average was boosted by very high rates for Russia related trade. For comparison the average rate for the \nbenchmark West Africa – UK/Continent route averaged $29,000/day. While the Russia/Ukraine crisis and its impact dominated headlines, increasing overall tanker \nvolumes and slower fleet growth led to steadily higher rates through the year. Earnings in the highly correlated VLCC and Aframax segments averaged $30,300/day \nand $45,400/day in 2022, respectively. \n \nThe total crude oil and product tanker fleet above 25,000 dwt grew by a net 2.9% in 2022, with the crude tanker fleet expanding 3.2% and the product tanker \nfleet growing 1.9%. This was higher than the 2.2% growth seen in 2021 due to more deliveries and less demolition. It was still below the ten-year average total tanker \nfleet growth of 3.2%. \n \nSuezmax fleet growth of 4% was up from 2.3% in 2021 and 3.1% in 2020, albeit slightly lower than the 4.1% in 2019. It was slightly higher than the last ten \nyears’ average of 3.7%. 33 vessels were delivered vs. 20 the preceding year, while eight vessels were demolished, vs. seven in 2021. This took the total fleet at the end \nof 2022 to 602 vessels. Deliveries in 2022 were again front-end loaded, where 20 vessels were delivered in the first half vs. 13 in the second. By the end of the year, \nalmost 37% of the fleet were modern, fuel-efficient vessels, up from 32% a year earlier. \n \nAs earnings rose, tanker demolition slowed through the year. The 5.2 million dwt which were broken up was down from 8.1m the previous year, and while it \nwas higher than 2019 and 2020 combined it was still below the historical average of 7.2m. As of the beginning of 2023 there were 43 vessels at or above the past 10-\nyear average scrap age of 22 years, and 64 vessels within the 20+ years age group. \n \n35 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "The Suezmax orderbook stood at just 10 vessels of 1.6 million dwt at the beginning of 2023, or 1.7% of the fleet. The total crude oil and product tanker \norderbook for vessels above 25,000 dwt counted 24 million dwt, or just 3.9% vs. the fleet. This is the lowest since 1983. \n \nThe year started off similarly as in 2021. Slow production increases from the OPEC+ and others did initially not sufficiently move the needle for tanker \ndemand. While global oil supply gradually rose through the first half, demand was higher. This resulted in a tight oil market and was exacerbated by lower Russian \nsupply and shortage fears. A steeply backwardated Brent forward curve and softer Asian than Atlantic basin oil demand development, resulted in little long-haul \nAtlantic-East flows. \n \nFor Aframax, Suezmax and product tankers the Russia/Ukraine conflict and its impact on trade flow was a key turning point. When western buyers self-\nsanctioned away from Russian oil, more Baltic and Black Sea exports were shipped long-haul to the East, giving extraordinary rate outperformance for those vessels \nwhich entered into the trade. \n \nFor the broader tanker market the key turning point was the flattening forward curves at the same time as WTI became discounted vs. Middle Eastern crude \n– driven by 1 mbpd U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve releases which boosted U.S. exports. When this West-East arbitrage opened, USG-East volumes soared to new \nall-time highs in September through November. This came on top of MEG exports which also reached new all-time highs, around the same time as global oil supply \nreached near all-time highs - and resulted in a sharp rate recovery. Toward the end of the year slower U.S. SPR releases and OPEC+ production cuts led volumes \nlower, which inevitably had a negative effect on rates. \n \nWith increased earnings also came a significant repricing of asset values. This was also supported by high newbuild prices, not from high tanker ordering \nbut rather from activity in other segments, and high input costs. Values increased the most for the older end of the age bracket. \n \nThe Tanker Market 2023 \n  \n Reported spot rates in the first quarter of 2023 have lowered since the fourth quarter of 2022, and the average Suezmax earnings per day decreased from \n$81,281 in the fourth quarter of 2022 to $73,942 for the first quarter of 2023 based on the indicated rates published by Clarkson Research. The indicated rates are an \naverage of observations and routes. Some of the trade routes going into the average are routes involving Russian oil trade and as such not routes representing an \naverage for all market participants. From the time a voyage is booked and the rate is reported to the market, until the vessel loads the cargo and commences the \nvoyage, there can be a delay of up to 30 days. As such, from an accounting perspective, a voyage booked at the end of a quarter may see the majority of its revenues \nbeing recorded in the following quarter’s results. The earnings for vessel operators are, for this reason, not necessarily expected to fluctuate in an identical manner as \nthe indicative rates reported by Clarkson Research on a quarter by quarter basis. \n  \nAs a consequence of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine, commencing February 20, 2022, and the West’s strong reaction, energy security became of paramount \nconcern during 2022 and still is. The first quarter of 2022 saw a steep increase in the price of oil that moved from $75 per barrel at the beginning of 2022 to close off \nabove $123 per barrel on March 8, 2022. The still ongoing war, added to an already tight supply situation for energy world-wide with low oil inventories and the \nenergy logistics turned upside down. Oil production increased during 2022 and several countries released strategic oil reserves to the market during the year. Further \nadding to demand for oil transportation was the increased voyage distances created by the official and self-imposed sanctions, with oil needing to be sourced from \nother regions than in the past. These changes in the energy logistics particularly favored the flexible and versatile medium sized Aframax and Suezmax tankers. \nDespite these challenges, 2022 ended with an oil price only $5 per barrel above the beginning of the year ($80 per barrel WTI), higher oil inventories globally and a \nresurgence in Oil E&P spending and expectations of increased oil production going forward. \n  \n36 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "2022 also saw a continued zero tolerance for Covid-19 in China and a delayed reopening in Asia after the pandemic. The muted demand for long haul \ntransportation of oil to China kept earnings for the Very Large Crude Carriers low for the most of 2022. With the full reopening of China and Asian economies in 2023, \nwe now see the longer-term trend returning, namely increased demand for oil from hundreds of millions of people in Asia, where a strong middle class has taken root \nand continues to grow rapidly. This will have a positive impact on the overall tanker market and the larger classes of oil tankers specifically. \n  \nFinally, the Tanker Market stands to benefit from the fact that the supply of tanker vessels will remain at historic low levels for at least the next two or three \nyears. As of April 12, 2023, the orderbook for conventional Suezmax tankers stood at 18 vessels in total. Five orders for a Suezmax vessel have been placed with the \nshipyards so far in 2023. In 2023, a total of seven Suezmaxes are expected to be added to the world fleet and two of these have been delivered as of April 12, 2023. \nEnvironmental regulations, increased steel and production costs, and higher interest rates make investing in new ships quite challenging and a smaller order book for \nnew tankers has always helped the tanker industry. On the demand side, we see a strong surge in demand for oil after Asian economies fully opened up after the \npandemic this year. Despite this, OPEC announced a production cut starting in May 2023 of 1.15 million barrels per day. The effectiveness of these cuts will be a \nfunction of discipline among the OPEC members and the overall demand for oil. \n  \nEnvironmental and Other Regulations in the Shipping Industry \n  \nGovernment regulation and laws significantly affect the ownership and operation of our fleet. We are subject to international conventions and treaties, \nnational, state and local laws and regulations in force in the countries in which our vessels may operate or are registered relating to safety and health and \nenvironmental protection including the storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of hazardous and non-hazardous materials, and the remediation of \ncontamination and liability for damage to natural resources. Compliance with such laws, regulations and other requirements entails significant expense, including \nvessel modifications and implementation of certain operating procedures. \n  \nA variety of government and private entities subject our vessels to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections. These entities include the local port \nauthorities (applicable national authorities such as the United States Coast Guard (“USCG”), harbor master or equivalent), classification societies, flag state \nadministrations (countries of registry) and charterers, particularly terminal operators. Certain of these entities require us to obtain permits, licenses, certificates and \nother authorizations for the operation of our vessels. Failure to maintain necessary permits or approvals could require us to incur substantial costs or result in the \ntemporary suspension of the operation of one or more of our vessels. \n  \nIncreasing environmental concerns have created a demand for vessels that conform to stricter environmental standards. We are required to maintain \noperating standards for all of our vessels that emphasize operational safety, quality maintenance, continuous training of our officers and crews and compliance with \nUnited States and international regulations. We believe that the operation of our vessels is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and \nregulations and that our vessels have all material permits, licenses, certificates or other authorizations necessary for the conduct of our operations. However, because \nsuch laws and regulations frequently change and may impose increasingly stricter requirements, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these \nrequirements, or the impact of these requirements on the resale value or useful lives of our vessels. In addition, a future serious marine incident that causes \nsignificant adverse environmental impact could result in additional legislation or regulation that could negatively affect our profitability. \n  \n37 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "International Maritime Organization \n  \nThe International Maritime Organization, the United Nations agency for maritime safety and the prevention of pollution by vessels (the “IMO”), has adopted \nthe International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto, collectively referred to as \nMARPOL 73/78 and herein as “MARPOL,” the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1974 (“SOLAS Convention”), and the International \nConvention on Load Lines of 1966 (the “LL Convention”). MARPOL establishes environmental standards relating to oil leakage or spilling, garbage management, \nsewage, air emissions, handling and disposal of noxious liquids and the handling of harmful substances in packaged forms.  MARPOL is applicable to drybulk, tanker \nand LNG carriers, among other vessels, and is broken into six Annexes, each of which regulates a different source of pollution. Annex I relates to oil leakage or \nspilling; Annexes II and III relate to harmful substances carried in bulk in liquid or in packaged form, respectively; Annexes IV and V relate to sewage and garbage \nmanagement, respectively; and Annex VI, lastly, relates to air emissions. Annex VI was separately adopted by the IMO in September of 1997; new emissions \nstandards, titled IMO-2020, took effect on January 1, 2020. \n  \nIn 2013, the IMO’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee, or the “MEPC,” adopted a resolution amending MARPOL Annex I Condition Assessment \nScheme, or “CAS.” These amendments became effective on October 1, 2014, and require compliance with the 2011 International Code on the Enhanced Programme of \nInspections during Surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers, or “ESP Code,” which provides for enhanced inspection programs. We may need to make certain \nfinancial expenditures to comply with these amendments. \n  \nAir Emissions \n  \nIn September of 1997, the IMO adopted Annex VI to MARPOL to address air pollution from vessels. Effective May 2005, Annex VI sets limits on sulfur oxide \nand nitrogen oxide emissions from all commercial vessel exhausts and prohibits “deliberate emissions” of ozone depleting substances (such as halons and \nchlorofluorocarbons), emissions of volatile compounds from cargo tanks and the shipboard incineration of specific substances. Annex VI also includes a global cap \non the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for special areas to be established with more stringent controls on sulfur emissions, as explained below.  Emissions of \n“volatile organic compounds” from certain vessels, and the shipboard incineration (from incinerators installed after January 1, 2000) of certain substances (such as \npolychlorinated biphenyls, or “PCBs”) are also prohibited.  We believe that all our vessels are currently compliant in all material respects with these regulations. \n  \nThe Marine Environment Protection Committee, or “MEPC,” adopted amendments to Annex VI regarding emissions of sulfur oxide, nitrogen oxide, \nparticulate matter and ozone depleting substances, which entered into force on July 1, 2010.  The amended Annex VI seeks to further reduce air pollution by, among \nother things, implementing a progressive reduction of the amount of sulfur contained in any fuel oil used on board ships. On October 27, 2016, at its 70th session, the \nMEPC agreed to implement a global 0.5% m/m sulfur oxide emissions limit (reduced from 3.50%) starting from January 1, 2020.  This limitation can be met by using \nlow-sulfur compliant fuel oil, alternative fuels or certain exhaust gas cleaning systems.  Ships are now required to obtain bunker delivery notes and International Air \nPollution Prevention (“IAPP”) Certificates from their flag states that specify sulfur content.  Additionally, at MEPC 73, amendments to Annex VI to prohibit the \ncarriage of bunkers above 0.5% sulfur on ships were adopted and took effect March 1, 2020, with the exception of vessels fitted with exhaust gas cleaning equipment \n(“scrubbers”) which can carry fuel of higher sulfur content.  These regulations subject ocean-going vessels to stringent emissions controls, and may cause us to \nincur substantial costs. \n  \nSulfur content standards are even stricter within certain “Emission Control Areas,” or (“ECAs”). As of January 1, 2015, ships operating within an ECA were \nnot permitted to use fuel with sulfur content in excess of 0.1% m/m. Amended Annex VI establishes procedures for designating new ECAs. Currently, the IMO has \ndesignated four ECAs, including specified portions of the Baltic Sea area, North Sea area, North American area and United States Caribbean area.  Ocean-going \nvessels in these areas will be subject to stringent emission controls and may cause us to incur additional costs. Other areas in China are subject to local regulations \nthat impose stricter emission controls. In December 2021, the member states of the Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea Against Pollution \n(“Barcelona Convention”) agreed to support the designation of a new ECA in the Mediterranean. On December 15, 2022, MEPC 79 adopted the designation of a new \nECA in the Mediterranean, with an effective date of May 1, 2025. If other ECAs are approved by the IMO, or other new or more stringent requirements relating to \nemissions from marine diesel engines or port operations by vessels are adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or the states where we \noperate, compliance with these regulations could entail significant capital expenditures or otherwise increase the costs of our operations. \n  \n38 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "Amended Annex VI also establishes new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for marine diesel engines, depending on their date of \ninstallation. At the MEPC meeting held from March to April 2014, amendments to Annex VI were adopted which address the date on which Tier III Nitrogen Oxide \n(NOx) standards in ECAs will go into effect.  Under the amendments, Tier III NOx standards apply to ships that operate in the North American and U.S. Caribbean Sea \nECAs designed for the control of NOx produced by vessels with a marine diesel engine installed and constructed on or after January 1, 2016.  Tier III requirements \ncould apply to areas that will be designated for Tier III NOx in the future. At MEPC 70 and MEPC 71, the MEPC approved the North Sea and Baltic Sea as ECAs for \nnitrogen oxide for ships built on or after January 1, 2021. The EPA promulgated equivalent (and in some senses stricter) emissions standards in 2010.  As a result of \nthese designations or similar future designations, we may be required to incur additional operating or other costs. \n  \nAs determined at the MEPC 70, the new Regulation 22A of MARPOL Annex VI became effective as of March 1, 2018 and requires ships above 5,000 gross \ntonnage to collect and report annual data on fuel oil consumption to an IMO database, with the first year of data collection having commenced on January 1, 2019.  \nThe IMO intends to use such data as the first step in its roadmap (through 2023) for developing its strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships, as \ndiscussed further below. \n  \nAs of January 1, 2013, MARPOL made mandatory certain measures relating to energy efficiency for ships. All ships are now required to develop and \nimplement Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plans (“SEEMP”), and new ships must be designed in compliance with minimum energy efficiency levels per capacity \nmile as defined by the Energy Efficiency Design Index (“EEDI”).  Under these measures, by 2025, all new ships built will be 30% more energy efficient than those built \nin 2014.   Additionally, MEPC 75 adopted amendments to MARPOL Annex VI which brings forward the effective date of the EEDI’s “phase 3” requirements from \nJanuary 1, 2025 to April 1, 2022 for several ship types, including gas carriers, general cargo ships, and LNG carriers. \n  \nAdditionally, MEPC 75 introduced draft amendments to Annex VI which impose new regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships.  These \namendments introduce requirements to assess and measure the energy efficiency of all ships and set the required attainment values, with the goal of reducing the \ncarbon intensity of international shipping.  The requirements include (1) a technical requirement to reduce carbon intensity based on a new Energy Efficiency Existing \nShip Index (“EEXI”), and (2) operational carbon intensity reduction requirements, based on a new operational carbon intensity indicator (“CII”).  The attained EEXI is \nrequired to be calculated for ships of 400 gross tonnage and above, in accordance with different values set for ship types and categories.  With respect to the CII, the \ndraft amendments would require ships of 5,000 gross tonnage to document and verify their actual annual operational CII achieved against a determined required \nannual operational CII.  Additionally, MEPC 75 proposed draft amendments requiring that, on or before January 1, 2023, all ships above 400 gross tonnage must have \nan approved SEEMP on board.  For ships above 5,000 gross tonnage, the SEEMP would need to include certain mandatory content. MEPC 75 also approved draft \namendments to MARPOL Annex I to prohibit the use and carriage for use as fuel of heavy fuel oil (“HFO”) by ships in Arctic waters on and after July 1, 2024. The \ndraft amendments introduced at MEPC 75 were adopted at the MEPC 76 session on June 2021and entered into force in November 2022, with the requirements for \nEEXI and CII certification coming into effect from January 1, 2023. MEPC 77 adopted a non-binding resolution which urges Member States and ship operators to \nvoluntarily use distillate or other cleaner alternative fuels or methods of propulsion that are safe for ships and could contribute to the reduction of Black Carbon \nemissions from ships when operating in or near the Arctic. MEPC 79 adopted amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, Appendix IX to include the attained and required \nCII values, the CII rating and attained EEXI for existing ships in the required information to be submitted to the IMO Ship Fuel Oil Consumption Database.  The \namendments will enter into force on May 1, 2024. \n  \nWe may incur costs to comply with these revised standards. Additional or new conventions, laws and regulations may be adopted that could require the \ninstallation of expensive emission control systems and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \n  \nSafety Management System Requirements \n  \nThe SOLAS Convention was amended to address the safe manning of vessels and emergency training drills.  The Convention of Limitation of Liability for \nMaritime Claims (the “LLMC”) sets limitations of liability for a loss of life or personal injury claim or a property claim against ship owners. We believe that our vessels \nare in substantial compliance with SOLAS and LLMC standards. \n  \n39 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "Under Chapter IX of the SOLAS Convention, or the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (the \n“ISM Code”), our operations are also subject to environmental standards and requirements. The ISM Code requires the party with operational control of a vessel to \ndevelop an extensive safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth \ninstructions and procedures for operating its vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies. We rely upon the safety management system \nthat our technical management teams have developed for compliance with the ISM Code. The failure of a vessel owner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ISM \nCode may subject such party to increased liability, may decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or \ndetention in, certain ports. \n  \nThe ISM Code requires that vessel operators obtain a safety management certificate for each vessel they operate. This certificate evidences compliance by a \nvessel’s management with the ISM Code requirements for a safety management system. No vessel can obtain a safety management certificate unless its manager has \nbeen awarded a document of compliance, issued by each flag state, under the ISM Code. We have obtained applicable documents of compliance for our offices and \nsafety management certificates for all of our vessels for which the certificates are required by the IMO. The documents of compliance and safety management \ncertificates are renewed as required. \n  \nRegulation II-1/3-10 of the SOLAS Convention governs ship construction and stipulates that ships over 150 meters in length must have adequate strength, \nintegrity and stability to minimize risk of loss or pollution. Goal-based standards amendments in SOLAS regulation II-1/3-10 entered into force in 2012, with July 1, \n2016 set for application to new oil tankers and bulk carriers.   The SOLAS Convention regulation II-1/3-10 on goal-based ship construction standards for bulk carriers \nand oil tankers, which entered into force on January 1, 2012, requires that all oil tankers and bulk carriers of 150 meters in length and above, for which the building \ncontract is placed on or after July 1, 2016, satisfy applicable structural requirements conforming to the functional requirements of the International Goal-based Ship \nConstruction Standards for Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers (“GBS Standards”). \n  \nAmendments to the SOLAS Convention Chapter VII apply to vessels transporting dangerous goods and require those vessels be in compliance with the \nInternational Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (“IMDG Code”). Effective January 1, 2018, the IMDG Code includes (1) updates to the provisions for radioactive \nmaterial, reflecting the latest provisions from the International Atomic Energy Agency, (2) new marking, packing and classification requirements for dangerous goods \nand (3) new mandatory training requirements.  Amendments which took effect on January 1, 2020 also reflect the latest material from the UN Recommendations on the \nTransport of Dangerous Goods, including (1) new provisions regarding IMO type 9 tank, (2) new abbreviations for segregation groups, and (3) special provisions for \ncarriage of lithium batteries and of vehicles powered by flammable liquid or gas. Additional amendments, which came into force on June 1, 2022, include (1) addition \nof a definition of dosage rate, (2) additions to the list of high consequence dangerous goods, (3) new provisions for medical/clinical waste, (4) addition of various ISO \nstandards for gas cylinders, (5) a new handling code, and (6) changes to stowage and segregation provisions. \n  \nThe IMO has also adopted the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (“STCW”).  As of February \n2017, all seafarers are required to meet the STCW standards and be in possession of a valid STCW certificate.  Flag states that have ratified SOLAS and STCW \ngenerally employ the classification societies, which have incorporated SOLAS and STCW requirements into their class rules, to undertake surveys to confirm \ncompliance. \n  \nThe IMO's Maritime Safety Committee and MEPC, respectively, each adopted relevant parts of the International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Water \n(the “Polar Code”). The Polar Code, which entered into force on January 1, 2017, covers design, construction, equipment, operational, training, search and rescue as \nwell as environmental protection matters relevant to ships operating in the waters surrounding the two poles. It also includes mandatory measures regarding safety \nand pollution prevention as well as recommendatory provisions.  The Polar Code applies to new ships constructed after January 1, 2017, and after January 1, 2018, \nships constructed before January 1, 2017 are required to meet the relevant requirements by the earlier of their first intermediate or renewal survey. \n  \n40 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "Furthermore, recent action by the IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee and United States agencies indicates that cybersecurity regulations for the maritime \nindustry are likely to be further developed in the near future in an attempt to combat cybersecurity threats. By IMO resolution, administrations are encouraged to \nensure that cyber-risk management systems are incorporated by ship-owners and managers by their first annual Document of Compliance audit after January 1, 2021.  \nIn February 2021, the U.S. Coast Guard published guidance on addressing cyber risks in a vessel’s safety management system. This might cause companies to create \nadditional procedures for monitoring cybersecurity, which could require additional expenses and/or capital expenditures.  The impact of future regulations is hard to \npredict at this time. \n  \nIn June 2022, SOLAS also set out new amendments that will take effect January 1, 2024, which include new requirements for: (1) the design for safe mooring \noperations, (2) the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (“GMDSS”), (3) watertight integrity, (4) watertight doors on cargo ships, (5) fault-isolation of fire \ndetection systems, (6) life-saving appliances, and (7) safety of ships using LNG as fuel.  These new requirements may impact the cost of our operations. \n  \nPollution Control and Liability Requirements \n  \nThe IMO has negotiated international conventions that impose liability for pollution in international waters and the territorial waters of the signatories to \nsuch conventions. For example, the IMO adopted an International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments (the “BWM \nConvention”) in 2004. The BWM Convention entered into force on September 8, 2017.  The BWM Convention requires ships to manage their ballast water to remove, \nrender harmless or avoid the uptake or discharge of new or invasive aquatic organisms and pathogens within ballast water and sediments.  The BWM Convention’s \nimplementing regulations call for a phased introduction of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements, to be replaced in time with mandatory concentration limits, \nand require all ships to carry a ballast water record book and an international ballast water management certificate. \n  \nOn December 4, 2013, the IMO Assembly passed a resolution revising the application dates of the BWM Convention so that the dates are triggered by the \nentry into force date and not the dates originally in the BWM Convention.  This, in effect, makes all vessels delivered before the entry into force date “existing \nvessels” and allows for the installation of ballast water management systems on such vessels at the first International Oil Pollution Prevention (“IOPP”) renewal \nsurvey following entry into force of the convention. The MEPC adopted updated guidelines for approval of ballast water management systems (G8) at MEPC 70. At \nMEPC 71, the schedule regarding the BWM Convention’s implementation dates was also discussed and amendments were introduced to extend the date existing \nvessels are subject to certain ballast water standards.  Those changes were adopted at MEPC 72.  Ships over 400 gross tons generally must comply with a “D-1 \nstandard,” requiring the exchange of ballast water only in open seas and away from coastal waters.  The “D-2 standard” specifies the maximum amount of viable \norganisms allowed to be discharged, and compliance dates vary depending on the IOPP renewal dates. Depending on the date of the IOPP renewal survey, existing \nvessels must comply with the D-2 standard on or after September 8, 2019. For most ships, compliance with the D-2 standard will involve installing on-board systems \nto treat ballast water and eliminate unwanted organisms.  Ballast water management systems, which include systems that make use of chemical, biocides, organisms \nor biological mechanisms, or which alter the chemical or physical characteristics of the ballast water, must be approved in accordance with IMO Guidelines \n(Regulation D-3).  As of October 13, 2019, MEPC 72’s amendments to the BWM Convention took effect, making the Code for Approval of Ballast Water Management \nSystems, which governs assessment of ballast water management systems, mandatory rather than permissive, and formalized an implementation schedule for the D-2 \nstandard.  Under these amendments, all ships must meet the D-2 standard by September 8, 2024.    Costs of compliance with these regulations may be substantial. \nAdditionally, in November 2020, MEPC 75 adopted amendments to the BWM Convention which would require a commissioning test of the ballast water management \nsystem for the initial survey or when performing an additional survey for retrofits.  This analysis will not apply to ships that already have an installed BWM system \ncertified under the BWM Convention.   These amendments have entered into force on June 1, 2022. In December 2022, MEPC 79 agreed that it should be permitted to \nuse ballast tanks for temporary storage of treated sewage and grey water.  MEPC 79 also established that ships are expected to return to D-2 compliance after \nexperiencing challenging uptake water and bypassing a BWM system should only be used as a last resort.  Guidance will be developed at MEPC 80 (in July 2023) to \nset out appropriate actions and uniform procedures to ensure compliance with the BWM Convention. \n  \n41 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "Once mid-ocean exchange ballast water treatment requirements become mandatory under the BWM Convention, the cost of compliance could increase for \nocean carriers and may have a material effect on our operations. However, many countries already regulate the discharge of ballast water carried by vessels from \ncountry to country to prevent the introduction of invasive and harmful species via such discharges. The U.S., for example, requires vessels entering its waters from \nanother country to conduct mid-ocean ballast exchange, or undertake some alternate measure, and to comply with certain reporting requirements. \n  \nThe IMO adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969, as amended by different Protocols in 1976, 1984 and 1992, \nand amended in 2000 (“the CLC”).  Under the CLC and depending on whether the country in which the damage results is a party to the 1992 Protocol to the CLC, a \nvessel’s registered owner may be strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil, subject to \ncertain exceptions.  The 1992 Protocol changed certain limits on liability expressed using the International Monetary Fund currency unit, the Special Drawing Rights.  \nThe limits on liability have since been amended so that the compensation limits on liability were raised.  The right to limit liability is forfeited under the CLC where the \nspill is caused by the shipowner’s actual fault and under the 1992 Protocol where the spill is caused by the shipowner’s intentional or reckless act or omission where \nthe shipowner knew pollution damage would probably result.  The CLC requires ships over 2,000 tons covered by it to maintain insurance covering the liability of the \nowner in a sum equivalent to an owner’s liability for a single incident.  We have protection and indemnity insurance for environmental incidents. P&I Clubs in the \nInternational Group issue the required Bunkers Convention “Blue Cards” to enable signatory states to issue certificates.  All of our vessels are in possession of a \nCLC State issued certificate attesting that the required insurance coverage is in force. \n  \nThe IMO also adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage (the “Bunker Convention”) to impose strict liability \non ship owners (including the registered owner, bareboat charterer, manager or operator) for pollution damage in jurisdictional waters of ratifying states caused by \ndischarges of bunker fuel. The Bunker Convention requires registered owners of ships over 1,000 gross tons to maintain insurance for pollution damage in an amount \nequal to the limits of liability under the applicable national or international limitation regime (but not exceeding the amount calculated in accordance with the LLMC).  \nWith respect to non-ratifying states, liability for spills or releases of oil carried as fuel in ship’s bunkers typically is determined by the national or other domestic laws \nin the jurisdiction where the events or damages occur. \n  \nShips are required to maintain a certificate attesting that they maintain adequate insurance to cover an incident. In jurisdictions, such as the United States \nwhere the CLC or the Bunker Convention has not been adopted, various legislative schemes or common law govern, and liability is imposed either on the basis of \nfault or on a strict-liability basis. \n  \nAnti-Fouling Requirements \n \nIn 2001, the IMO adopted the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships, or the “Anti-fouling Convention.” The \nAnti-fouling Convention, which entered into force on September 17, 2008, prohibits the use of organotin compound coatings to prevent the attachment of mollusks \nand other sea life to the hulls of vessels. Vessels of over 400 gross tons engaged in international voyages will also be required to undergo an initial survey before the \nvessel is put into service or before an International Anti-fouling System Certificate (the “IAFS Certificate”) is issued for the first time; and subsequent surveys when \nthe anti-fouling systems are altered or replaced. Vessels of 24 meters in length or more but less than 400 gross tonnage engaged in international voyages will have to \ncarry a Declaration on Anti-fouling Systems signed by the owner or authorized agent. \n \nIn November 2020, MEPC 75 approved draft amendments to the Anti-fouling Convention to prohibit anti-fouling systems containing cybutryne, which \nwould apply to ships from January 1, 2023, or, for ships already bearing such an anti-fouling system, at the next scheduled renewal of the system after that date, but \nno later than 60 months following the last application to the ship of such a system.  In addition, the IAFS Certificate has been updated to address compliance options \nfor anti-fouling systems to address cybutryne. Ships which are affected by this ban on cybutryne must receive an updated IAFS Certificate no later than two years \nafter the entry into force of these amendments. Ships which are not affected (i.e. with anti-fouling systems which do not contain cybutryne) must receive an updated \nIAFS Certificate at the next Anti-fouling application to the vessel. These amendments were formally adopted at MEPC 76 in June 2021. \n \n42 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "We have obtained Anti-fouling System Certificates for all of our vessels that are subject to the Anti-fouling Convention. \n  \nCompliance Enforcement \n  \nNoncompliance with the ISM Code or other IMO regulations may subject the ship owner or bareboat charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in \navailable insurance coverage for affected vessels and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. The USCG and European Union authorities \nhave indicated that vessels not in compliance with the ISM Code by applicable deadlines will be prohibited from trading in U.S. and European Union ports, \nrespectively.  As of the date of this report, each of our vessels is ISM Code certified. However, there can be no assurance that such certificates will be maintained in \nthe future.  The IMO continues to review and introduce new regulations. It is impossible to predict what additional regulations, if any, may be passed by the IMO and \nwhat effect, if any, such regulations might have on our operations. \n  \nUnited States Regulations \n  \nThe U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act \n  \nThe U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) established an extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and cleanup of the environment from \noil spills. OPA affects all “owners and operators” whose vessels trade or operate within the U.S., its territories and possessions or whose vessels operate in U.S. \nwaters, which includes the U.S.’s territorial sea and its 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone around the U.S.  The U.S. has also enacted the Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), which applies to the discharge of hazardous substances other than oil, except in limited \ncircumstances, whether on land or at sea.  OPA and CERCLA both define “owner and operator” in the case of a vessel as any person owning, operating or chartering \nby demise, the vessel.  Both OPA and CERCLA impact our operations. \n  \nUnder OPA, vessel owners and operators are “responsible parties” and are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless the spill results solely from the act or \nomission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war) for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges \nof oil from their vessels, including bunkers (fuel).  OPA defines these other damages broadly to include: \n  \n(i)         injury to, destruction or loss of, or loss of use of, natural resources and related assessment costs; \n  \n(ii)        injury to, or economic losses resulting from, the destruction of real and personal property; \n  \n(iii)       loss of subsistence use of natural resources that are injured, destroyed or lost; \n  \n(iv)       net loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees or net profit revenues resulting from injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property, or natural \nresources; \n  \n(v)        lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property or natural resources; and \n  \n(vi)      net cost of increased or additional public services necessitated by removal activities following a discharge of oil, such as protection from \nfire, safety or health hazards, and loss of subsistence use of natural resources. \n  \n43 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "OPA contains statutory caps on liability and damages; such caps do not apply to direct clean-up costs.  Effective November 12, 2019, the USCG adjusted \nthe limits of OPA liability for a tank vessel, other than a single-hull tank vessel, over 3,000 gross tons liability to the greater of $2,300 per gross ton or $19,943,400 \n(subject to periodic adjustment for inflation). On December 23, 2022, the USCG issued a final rule to adjust the limitation of liability under the OPA.  Effective March \n23, 2022, the new adjusted limits of OPA liability for a tank vessel, other than a single-hull tank vessel, over 3,000 gross tons liability to the greater of $2,500 per gross \nton or $21,521,300 (subject to periodic adjustment for inflation). These limits of liability do not apply if an incident was proximately caused by the violation of an \napplicable U.S. federal safety, construction or operating regulation by a responsible party (or its agent, employee or a person acting pursuant to a contractual \nrelationship) or a responsible party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The limitation on liability similarly does not apply if the responsible party fails or refuses \nto (i) report the incident as required by law where the responsible party knows or has reason to know of the incident; (ii) reasonably cooperate and assist as \nrequested in connection with oil removal activities; or (iii) without sufficient cause, comply with an order issued under the Federal Water Pollution Act (Section 311 \n(c), (e)) or the Intervention on the High Seas Act. \n  \nCERCLA contains a similar liability regime whereby owners and operators of vessels are liable for clean-up, removal and remedial costs, as well as damages \nfor injury to, or destruction or loss of, natural resources, including the reasonable costs associated with assessing the same, and health assessments or health effects \nstudies. There is no liability if the discharge of a hazardous substance results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war. Liability \nunder CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5.0 million for vessels carrying a hazardous substance as cargo and the greater of $300 per gross ton \nor $500,000 for any other vessel. These limits do not apply (rendering the responsible person liable for the total cost of response and damages) if the release or threat \nof release of a hazardous substance resulted from willful misconduct or negligence, or the primary cause of the release was a violation of applicable safety, \nconstruction or operating standards or regulations.  The limitation on liability also does not apply if the responsible person fails or refused to provide all reasonable \ncooperation and assistance as requested in connection with response activities where the vessel is subject to OPA. \n  \nOPA and CERCLA each preserve the right to recover damages under existing law, including maritime tort law.  OPA and CERCLA both require owners and \noperators of vessels to establish and maintain with the USCG evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the maximum amount of liability to which the \nparticular responsible person may be subject. Vessel owners and operators may satisfy their financial responsibility obligations by providing a proof of insurance, a \nsurety bond, qualification as a self-insurer or a guarantee. We comply and plan to comply going forward with the USCG’s financial responsibility regulations by \nproviding applicable certificates of financial responsibility. \n  \nThe 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in additional regulatory initiatives or statutes, including higher liability caps under OPA, \nnew regulations regarding offshore oil and gas drilling and a pilot inspection program for offshore facilities.  However, several of these initiatives and regulations \nhave been or may be revised.  For example, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement’s (“BSEE”) revised Production Safety Systems Rule (“PSSR”), \neffective December 27, 2018, modified and relaxed certain environmental and safety protections under the 2016 PSSR.  Additionally, the BSEE amended the Well \nControl Rule, effective July 15, 2019, which rolled back certain reforms regarding the safety of drilling operations, and former U.S. President Trump had proposed \nleasing new sections of U.S. waters to oil and gas companies for offshore drilling.  In January 2021, current U.S. President Biden signed an executive order temporarily \nblocking new leases for oil and gas drilling in federal waters.  However, attorney generals from 13 states filed suit in March 2021 to lift the executive order, and in June \n2021, a federal judge in Louisiana granted a preliminary injunction against the Biden administration, stating that the power to pause offshore oil and gas leases “lies \nsolely with Congress.” In August 2022, a federal judge in Louisiana sided with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, along with the other 12 plaintiff states, by issuing \na permanent injunction against the Biden Administration’s moratorium on oil and gas leasing on federal public lands and offshore waters. With these rapid changes, \ncompliance with any new requirements of OPA and future legislation or regulations applicable to the operation of our vessels could impact the cost of our operations \nand adversely affect our business. \n  \n44 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "OPA specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries, \nprovided they accept, at a minimum, the levels of liability established under OPA and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for oil \nspills.  Many U.S. states that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and \ndamages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance.  These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law.  Moreover, some states \nhave enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for discharge of pollutants within their waters, although in some cases, states which have enacted this type \nof legislation have not yet issued implementing regulations defining vessel owners’ responsibilities under these laws. The Company intends to comply with all \napplicable state regulations in the ports where the Company’s vessels call. \n  \nWe currently maintain pollution liability coverage insurance in the amount of $1.0 billion per incident for each of our vessels. If the damages from a \ncatastrophic spill were to exceed our insurance coverage, it could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation. \n  \nOther United States Environmental Initiatives \n  \nThe U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970 (including its amendments of 1977 and 1990) (“CAA”) requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of \nvolatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. Our vessels are subject to vapor control and recovery requirements for certain cargoes when loading, \nunloading, ballasting, cleaning and conducting other operations in regulated port areas. The CAA also requires states to draft State Implementation Plans, or “SIPs,” \ndesigned to attain national health-based air quality standards in each state. Although state-specific, SIPs may include regulations concerning emissions resulting \nfrom vessel loading and unloading operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment. Our vessels operating in such regulated port areas with \nrestricted cargoes are equipped with vapor recovery systems that satisfy these existing requirements. \n  \nThe U.S. Clean Water Act (“CWA”) prohibits the discharge of oil, hazardous substances and ballast water in U.S. navigable waters unless authorized by a \nduly-issued permit or exemption, and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for any unauthorized discharges.  The CWA also imposes substantial liability for \nthe costs of removal, remediation and damages and complements the remedies available under OPA and CERCLA.  In 2015, the EPA expanded the definition of \n“waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”), thereby expanding federal authority under the CWA.  Following litigation on the revised WOTUS rule, in December 2018, \nthe EPA and Department of the Army proposed a revised, limited definition of WOTUS.  In 2019 and 2020, the agencies repealed the prior WOTUS Rule and \npromulgated the Navigable Waters Protection Rule (“NWPR”) which significantly reduced the scope and oversight of EPA and the Department of the Army in \ntraditionally non-navigable waterways. On August 30, 2021, a federal district court in Arizona vacated the NWPR and directed the agencies to replace the rule. On \nDecember 7, 2021, the EPA and the Department of the Army proposed a rule that would reinstate the pre-2015 definition, which is subject to public comment until \nFebruary 7, 2022. On December 30, 2022, the EPA and the Department of Army announced the final WOTUS rule that largely reinstated the pre-2015 definition.  \n  \nThe EPA and the USCG have also enacted rules relating to ballast water discharge, compliance with which requires the installation of equipment on our \nvessels to treat ballast water before it is discharged or the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures at potentially substantial costs, \nand/or otherwise restrict our vessels from entering U.S. Waters.  The EPA will regulate these ballast water discharges and other discharges incidental to the normal \noperation of certain vessels within United States waters pursuant to the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (“VIDA”), which was signed into law on December 4, 2018 \nand replaces the 2013 Vessel General Permit (“VGP”) program (which authorizes discharges incidental to operations of commercial vessels and contains numeric \nballast water discharge limits for most vessels to reduce the risk of invasive species in U.S. waters, stringent requirements for exhaust gas scrubbers, and \nrequirements for the use of environmentally acceptable lubricants) and current Coast Guard ballast water management regulations adopted under the U.S. National \nInvasive Species Act (“NISA”), such as mid-ocean ballast exchange programs and installation of approved USCG technology for all vessels equipped with ballast \nwater tanks bound for U.S. ports or entering U.S. waters.  VIDA establishes a new framework for the regulation of vessel incidental discharges under Clean Water Act \n(CWA), requires the EPA to develop performance standards for those discharges within two years of enactment, and requires the U.S. Coast Guard to develop \nimplementation, compliance and enforcement regulations within two years of EPA’s promulgation of standards.  Under VIDA, all provisions of the 2013 VGP and \nUSCG regulations regarding ballast water treatment remain in force and effect until the EPA and U.S. Coast Guard regulations are finalized.  Non-military, non-\nrecreational vessels greater than 79 feet in length must continue to comply with the requirements of the VGP, including submission of a Notice of Intent (“NOI”) or \nretention of a PARI form and submission of annual reports. We have submitted NOIs for our vessels where required. Compliance with the EPA, U.S. Coast Guard and \nstate regulations could require the installation of ballast water treatment equipment on our vessels or the implementation of other port facility disposal procedures at \npotentially substantial cost or may otherwise restrict our vessels from entering U.S. waters. \n  \n45 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "European Union Regulations \n  \nIn October 2009, the European Union amended a directive to impose criminal sanctions for illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances, including \nminor discharges, if committed with intent, recklessly or with serious negligence and the discharges individually or in the aggregate result in deterioration of the \nquality of water. Aiding and abetting the discharge of a polluting substance may also lead to criminal penalties. The directive applies to all types of vessels, \nirrespective of their flag, but certain exceptions apply to warships or where human safety or that of the ship is in danger. Criminal liability for pollution may result in \nsubstantial penalties or fines and increased civil liability claims.  Regulation (EU) 2015/757 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2015 (amending \nEU Directive 2009/16/EC) governs the monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from maritime transport, and, subject to some exclusions, \nrequires companies with ships over 5,000 gross tonnage to monitor and report carbon dioxide emissions annually, which may cause us to incur additional expenses. \n  \nThe European Union has adopted several regulations and directives requiring, among other things, more frequent inspections of high-risk ships, as \ndetermined by type, age and flag as well as the number of times the ship has been detained. The European Union also adopted and extended a ban on substandard \nships and enacted a minimum ban period and a definitive ban for repeated offenses. The regulation also provided the European Union with greater authority and \ncontrol over classification societies, by imposing more requirements on classification societies and providing for fines or penalty payments for organizations that \nfailed to comply. Furthermore, the EU has implemented regulations requiring vessels to use reduced sulfur content fuel for their main and auxiliary engines. The EU \nDirective 2005/33/EC (amending Directive 1999/32/EC) introduced requirements parallel to those in Annex VI relating to the sulfur content of marine fuels. In addition, \nthe EU imposed a 0.1% maximum sulfur requirement for fuel used by ships at berth in the Baltic, the North Sea and the English Channel (the so called “SOx-Emission \nControl Area”). As of January 2020, EU member states must also ensure that ships in all EU waters, except the SOx-Emission Control Area, use fuels with a 0.5% \nmaximum sulfur content. \n  \nOn September 15, 2020, the European Parliament voted to include greenhouse gas emissions from the maritime sector in the European Union’s carbon market, the \nEU Emissions Trading System (“EU ETS”).  On July 14, 2021, the European Parliament formally proposed its plan, which will require shipowners to buy permits to \ncover these emissions.  The Environment Council adopted a general approach on the proposal in June 2022. On December 18, 2022, the Environmental Council and \nEuropean Parliament agreed to include maritime shipping emissions within the scope of the EU ETS on a gradual introduction of obligations for shipping companies \nto surrender allowances: 40% for verified emissions from 2024, 70% for 2025 and 100% for 2026.  Most large vessels will be included in the scope of the EU ETS from \nthe start. \n  \nInternational Labour Organization \n  \nThe International Labour Organization (the “ILO”) is a specialized agency of the UN that has adopted the Maritime Labor Convention 2006 (“MLC 2006”). A \nMaritime Labor Certificate and a Declaration of Maritime Labor Compliance is required to ensure compliance with the MLC 2006 for all ships that are 500 gross \ntonnage or over and are either engaged in international voyages or flying the flag of a Member and operating from a port, or between ports, in another country. We \nbelieve that all our vessels are in substantial compliance with and are certified to meet MLC 2006. \n  \n46 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "Greenhouse Gas Regulation \n  \nCurrently, the emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change, which entered into force in 2005 and pursuant to which adopting countries have been required to implement national programs to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions with targets extended through 2020.  International negotiations are continuing with respect to a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, \nand restrictions on shipping emissions may be included in any new treaty. In December 2009, more than 27 nations, including the U.S. and China, signed the \nCopenhagen Accord, which includes a non-binding commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris \nresulted in the Paris Agreement, which entered into force on November 4, 2016 and does not directly limit greenhouse gas emissions from ships.  The U.S. initially \nentered into the agreement, but on June 1, 2017, former U.S. President Trump announced that the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and \nthe withdrawal became effective on November 4, 2020. On January 20, 2021, U.S. President Biden signed an executive order to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which the \nU.S. officially rejoined on February 19, 2021. \n  \nAt MEPC 70 and MEPC 71, a draft outline of the structure of the initial strategy for developing a comprehensive IMO strategy on reduction of greenhouse \ngas emissions from ships was approved. In accordance with this roadmap, in April 2018, nations at the MEPC 72 adopted an initial strategy to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions from ships.  The initial strategy identifies “levels of ambition” to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including (1) decreasing the carbon intensity from \nships through implementation of further phases of the EEDI for new ships; (2) reducing carbon dioxide emissions per transport work, as an average across \ninternational shipping, by at least 40% by 2030, pursuing efforts towards 70% by 2050, compared to 2008 emission levels; and (3) reducing the total annual \ngreenhouse emissions by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 while pursuing efforts towards phasing them out entirely.  The initial strategy notes that \ntechnological innovation, alternative fuels and/or energy sources for international shipping will be integral to achieve the overall ambition. These regulations could \ncause us to incur additional substantial expenses. At MEPC 77, the Member States agreed to initiate the revision of the Initial IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG \nemissions from ships, recognizing the need to strengthen the ambition during the revision process. MEPC 79 revised the EEDI calculation guidelines to include a CO2 \nconversion factor for ethane, a reference to the updated ITCC guidelines, and a clarification that in case of a ship with multiple load line certificates, the maximum \ncertified summer draft should be used when determining the deadweight. A final draft Revised IMO GHG Strategy would be considered by MEPC 80 (scheduled to \nmeet in July 2023), with a view to adoption. \n  \nThe EU made a unilateral commitment to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions from its member states from 20% of 1990 levels by 2020. The EU also \ncommitted to reduce its emissions by 20% under the Kyoto Protocol’s second period from 2013 to 2020.  Starting in January 2018, large ships over 5,000 gross \ntonnage calling at EU ports are required to collect and publish data on carbon dioxide emissions and other information. As previously discussed, regulations relating \nto the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions from the maritime sector in the European Union’s carbon market, EU ETS, are also forthcoming. \n  \nIn the United States, the EPA issued a finding that greenhouse gases endanger the public health and safety, adopted regulations to limit greenhouse gas \nemissions from certain mobile sources and proposed regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from large stationary sources. However, in March 2017, former \nU.S. President Trump signed an executive order to review and possibly eliminate the EPA’s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and in August 2019, the \nAdministration announced plans to weaken regulations for methane emissions. On August 13, 2020, the EPA released rules rolling back standards to control methane \nand volatile organic compound emissions from new oil and gas facilities.  However, U.S. President Biden recently directed the EPA to publish a proposed rule \nsuspending, revising, or rescinding certain of these rules. On November 2, 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule under the CAA designed to reduce methane \nemissions from oil and gas sources. The proposed rule would reduce 41 million tons of methane emissions between 2023 and 2035 and cut methane emissions in the \noil and gas sector by approximately 74 percent compared to emissions from this sector in 2005. EPA also issued a supplemental proposed rule in November 2022 to \ninclude additional methane reduction measures following public input and anticipates issuing a final rule in 2023.  If these new regulations are finalized, they could \naffect our operations. \n  \nAny passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, the EU, the U.S. or other countries where we operate, or any treaty \nadopted at the international level to succeed the Kyoto Protocol or Paris Agreement, that restricts emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to make \nsignificant financial expenditures which we cannot predict with certainty at this time. Even in the absence of climate control legislation, our business may be indirectly \naffected to the extent that climate change may result in sea level changes or certain weather events. \n \n47 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "Vessel Security Regulations \n  \nSince the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United States, there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security such as the \nU.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”). To implement certain portions of the MTSA, the USCG issued regulations requiring the implementation \nof certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and at certain ports and facilities, some of which \nare regulated by the EPA. \n  \nSimilarly, Chapter XI-2 of the SOLAS Convention imposes detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities and mandates compliance with the \nInternational Ship and Port Facility Security Code (“the ISPS Code”). The ISPS Code is designed to enhance the security of ports and ships against terrorism. To \ntrade internationally, a vessel must attain an International Ship Security Certificate (“ISSC”) from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel’s flag \nstate. Ships operating without a valid certificate may be detained, expelled from or refused entry at port until they obtain an ISSC.  The various requirements, some of \nwhich are found in the SOLAS Convention, include, for example, on-board installation of automatic identification systems to provide a means for the automatic \ntransmission of safety-related information from among similarly equipped ships and shore stations, including information on a ship’s identity, position, course, speed \nand navigational status; on-board installation of ship security alert systems, which do not sound on the vessel but only alert the authorities on shore; the \ndevelopment of vessel security plans; ship identification number to be permanently marked on a vessel’s hull; a continuous synopsis record kept onboard showing a \nvessel’s history including the name of the ship, the state whose flag the ship is entitled to fly, the date on which the ship was registered with that state, the ship’s \nidentification number, the port at which the ship is registered and the name of the registered owner(s) and their registered address; and compliance with flag state \nsecurity certification requirements. \n  \nThe USCG regulations, intended to align with international maritime security standards, exempt non-U.S. vessels from MTSA vessel security measures, \nprovided such vessels have on board a valid ISSC that attests to the vessel’s compliance with the SOLAS Convention security requirements and the ISPS Code. \nFuture security measures could have a significant financial impact on us.  We intend to comply with the various security measures addressed by MTSA, the SOLAS \nConvention and the ISPS Code. \n  \nThe cost of vessel security measures has also been affected by the escalation in the frequency of acts of piracy against ships, notably off the coast of \nSomalia, including the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea area.  Substantial loss of revenue and other costs may be incurred as a result of detention of a vessel or \nadditional security measures, and the risk of uninsured losses could significantly affect our business. Costs are incurred in taking additional security measures in \naccordance with Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy, notably those contained in the BMP5 industry standard. \n  \nInspection by Classification Societies \n  \nThe hull and machinery of every commercial vessel must be classed by a classification society authorized by its country of registry. The classification \nsociety certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and SOLAS. Most \ninsurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage and lending that a vessel be certified “in class” by a classification society which is a member of the \nInternational Association of Classification Societies, the IACS.  The IACS has adopted harmonized Common Structural Rules, or “the Rules,” which apply to oil \ntankers and bulk carriers contracted for construction on or after July 1, 2015.  The Rules attempt to create a level of consistency between IACS Societies.  All of our \nvessels are certified as being “in class” by all the applicable Classification Societies (e.g., American Bureau of Shipping, Lloyd’s Register of Shipping). \n  \nA vessel must undergo annual surveys, intermediate surveys, drydockings and special surveys. In lieu of a special survey, a vessel’s machinery may be on \na continuous survey cycle, under which the machinery would be surveyed periodically over a five-year period. Every vessel is also required to be drydocked every 30 \nto 36 months for inspection of the underwater parts of the vessel.  If any vessel does not maintain its class and/or fails any annual survey, intermediate survey, \ndrydocking or special survey, the vessel will be unable to carry cargo between ports and will be unemployable and uninsurable which could cause us to be in \nviolation of certain covenants in our loan agreements. Any such inability to carry cargo or be employed, or any such violation of covenants, could have a material \nadverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. \n  \n48 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "Risk of Loss and Liability Insurance \n  \nGeneral \n  \nThe operation of any cargo vessel includes risks such as mechanical failure, physical damage, collision, property loss, cargo loss or damage and business \ninterruption due to political circumstances in foreign countries, piracy incidents, hostilities and labor strikes. In addition, there is always an inherent possibility of \nmarine disaster, including oil spills and other environmental mishaps, and the liabilities arising from owning and operating vessels in international trade. OPA, which \nimposes virtually unlimited liability upon shipowners, operators and bareboat charterers of any vessel trading in the exclusive economic zone of the United States for \ncertain oil pollution accidents in the United States, has made liability insurance more expensive for shipowners and operators trading in the United States market. We \ncarry insurance coverage as customary in the shipping industry. However, not all risks can be insured, specific claims may be rejected, and we might not be always \nable to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates. \n  \nHull and Machinery Insurance \n  \nWe procure marine hull and machinery and war risk insurance, which include the risk of actual or constructive total loss, for all of the vessels in our fleet. \nThe vessels in our fleet are each covered up to at least fair market value, with deductibles of $350,000 per vessel per incident. We also arranged increased value \ncoverage for each vessel. Under this increased value coverage, in the event of total loss of a vessel, we will be able recover for amounts not recoverable under the \nhull and machinery policy.  We generally do not maintain insurance against loss of hire (except for certain charters for which we consider it appropriate), which \ncovers business interruptions that result in the loss of use of a vessel. \n  \nProtection and Indemnity Insurance \n  \nProtection and indemnity insurance is provided by mutual protection and indemnity associations, or “P&I Associations,” and covers our third-party \nliabilities in connection with our shipping activities. This includes third-party liability and other related expenses of injury or death of crew, passengers and other \nthird parties, loss or damage to cargo, claims arising from collisions with other vessels, damage to other third-party property, pollution arising from oil or other \nsubstances and salvage, towing and other related costs, including wreck removal. Protection and indemnity insurance is a form of mutual indemnity insurance, \nextended by protection and indemnity mutual associations, or “clubs.” \n  \nOur current protection and indemnity insurance coverage for pollution is $1 billion per vessel per incident. The 13 P&I Associations that comprise the \nInternational Group insure approximately 90% of the world’s commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association’s liabilities. \nThe International Group’s website states that the Pool provides a mechanism for sharing all claims in excess of US$ 10 million up to, currently, approximately $8.58 \nbillion.  As a member of a P&I Association, which is a member of the International Group, we are subject to calls payable to the associations based on our claim \nrecords as well as the claim records of all other members of the individual associations and members of the shipping pool of P&I Associations comprising the \nInternational Group. \n  \nCompetition \n  \nWe operate in what we refer to as the Nordic American System, which describes our operation of our homogenous Suezmax tanker fleet in markets that are \nhighly competitive and based primarily on supply and demand. We currently operate the majority of our vessels in the spot market. We compete for charters on the \nbasis of price, vessel location, size, age and condition of the vessel, as well as on our reputation as an operator. For more information on the “Nordic American \nSystem”, please see “Item 4.A. History and Development of the Company.” \n  \n49 \nTable of Contents"

The indicative rates \npresented by Clarkson Research are an average of observations and routes and some of the trade routes going into the average are routes involving Russian oil trade \nand as such not routes representing an average for all market participants. \n  \nAs a result of i) and ii) net voyage revenues increased by 168.8% from $62.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, to $168.8 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022. \n  \nVoyage expenses increased to $170.5 million from $128.3 million, or 32.9%. The increase in voyage expenses was primarily due to an increase in bunker costs. \nConsumption of fuel oil was lower in 2022 than in 2021 due to less vessel calendar days, but the price of fuel oil increased sharply in the first half of 2022 with a peak \nin June 2022, before falling in the latter part of 2022. As such, the average price of fuel oil increased in 2022 compared to 2021 and caused a significant increase in \nvoyage expenses. The increase in fuel prices Further, as a result of improved freight rates in 2022 compared to 2021, there has also been an increase in commission \ncosts incurred. \n  \nVessel operating expenses decreased by $4.2 million, or 6.3%, from $67.7 million in 2021 to $63.4 million in 2022, and reflects that there is a net reduction of \nthree vessels in the fleet during 2022. In cooperation with our technical managers we maintain our focus on keeping the fleet in top technical condition whilst keeping \ncosts low. \n  \nImpairment Loss on Vessels decreased to $0.3 million in 2022 compared to $60.3 million in 2021. We recorded impairment charges related to six of our 2002 \nand 2003 built vessels in 2021. One of these vessels was classified as Held for Sale as of December 31, 2021, and this vessel was subject to impairment charges of $0.3 \nmillion in 2022 as a result of changes in fair value of the vessel before the vessel was disposed of. \n  \nIn 2022, we have sold five of the six vessels where impairment charges were taken in 2021. We have recorded a gain upon disposal of vessels of $6.0 million \nin 2022 compared to $0 in 2021 and the gain is mainly related to the last vessel sold in October 2022 reflecting rising second-hand vessel prices that evolved during \nthe year. \n  \nDepreciation expenses decreased by $18.0 million, or 26.2%, from $68.4 million in 2021 to $50.4 million in 2022. The decrease in 2022 compared to 2021 is \nprimarily due to sale of vessels in 2022 resulting in a net reduction of three vessels in the fleet, in combination with impairment charges recorded in 2021 that lowered \nthe carrying values of six vessels built in the years from 2002 and 2003 and accordingly lowering the associated depreciation charges for these vessels in 2022. \n  \nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $3.2 million, or 20.3%, from $15.6 million in 2021 to $18.8 million in 2022.

      "text": "As a result of i) and ii) net voyage revenues decreased by 73.1% from $233.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to $62.8 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2021. Other Income relates to a distribution from an insurance association and we received a net amount of $4.6 million. \n  \nVoyage expenses increased to $128.3 million from $121.1 million, or 5.9%. Voyage expenses mainly consist of port charges, bunkers and commissions and the \nmost influential cost is the cost of bunkers. Cost of bunkers is influenced by actual consumption in a year and the price of the fuel. The increase in voyage expenses \nin 2021 was primarily due to an increase in bunker costs caused by an increase in fuel oil prices compared to prior year, offset by a reduction in commission costs. \nVoyage expenses are relatively similar in 2021 as in 2020 and shows the activity level of our vessels and that we have operated a similar number of vessels in both \nyears. \n  \nVessel operating expenses increased by $0.8 million, or 1.2%, from $66.9 million in 2020 to $67.7 million in 2021, and reflects that the number of vessels in the \nfleet was similar in 2021 as in 2020 with a similar expense per vessel for the two years. In cooperation with our technical managers we maintain our focus on keeping \nthe fleet in top technical condition whilst keeping costs low. \n  \nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $2.0 million, or 11.2%, from $17.6 million in 2020 to $15.6 million in 2021. The decrease in cost is mainly \nrelated to a decrease in staff cost. \n  \nDepreciation expenses increased by $0.5 million, or 0.8%, from $67.8 million in 2020 to $68.4 million in 2021. The insignificant increase in 2021 compared to \n2021 is primarily a result of increase in capitalized cost in 2021 related to drydocking of our vessels that is depreciated over a period until next drydocking, offset by \nless depreciation related to one vessel sold in 4Q21 and one vessel held for sale. \n  \nImpairment Loss on Vessels increased to $60.3 million in 2021 compared to $0 in 2020. We have recorded $8.9 million in impairment charges to adjust the \ncarrying value to fair value less cost to sell related to one vessel classified as Held for Sale at December 31, 2021, and sold in 2022. Further $51.4 million in impairment \ncharges related to five of our 2002 and 2003 built vessels have been recorded due to estimated undiscounted cash flows being lower than the carrying values when \nperforming our impairment testing for these vessels and the carrying values have accordingly been adjusted to reflect the fair value at December 31, 2021. \n  \nInterest expenses decreased by $5.1 million, or 16.2%, from $31.5 million in 2020 to $26.4 million in 2021. The decrease is due to repayments on our credit \nfacilities in 2020 and 2021 that lowers the outstanding loan balances and related interest cost. \n  \nInflation \n  \nConstruction cost and periodical maintenance costs for oil tankers tend to fluctuate with the cyclicality in raw material costs, especially the price of steel and \ncopper, and the general demand for shipbuilding services. Newbuilding prices for oil tankers have increased in 2022 as a result of full orderbooks at the shipyards for \nthe coming years and an optimistic outlook for many shipping segments. Prices of metals have also fluctuated significantly during 2022 and at levels above previous \nperiods. Operating costs for oil tankers have been stable with very little, or moderate inflation over the years, and our operating cost in 2022 has been in line with \nprevious years. However, there is currently inflationary pressure in most parts of the world and we are monitoring this closely. The shipping industry has historically \nbeen able to absorb and neutralize significant cost increases related to operation of the vessels. However, oil transportation is a specialized area and if number of \nvessels where to increase significantly, increased demand for qualified crew can be expected, potentially putting pressure on crew cost. A general cost inflation in the \nworld could impact the shipping industry and put inflationary pressure on cost items such as, but not limited to crew costs, spare parts, maintenance, insurance etc. \n  \n54 \nTable of Contents"

Further, the agreement contains an excess cash mechanism that equals 50% of the net earnings from the \ncollateral vessels, less capex provision and fixed loan amortization. Net proceeds obtained from sale of a vessel used as security are at our lender’s discretion subject \nto repayment of the outstanding loan balance and we have repaid $80.4 million from vessel sales in 2022. The agreement contains covenants that require a minimum \nliquidity of $30.0 million and a loan-to-vessel value ratio of maximum 70%. \n \nOn December 16, 2020, we entered into a new loan agreement for the borrowing of $30.0 million (the “$30 million Accordion Loan”). The loan is considered \nan accordion loan to the 2019 Senior Secured Credit Facility loan agreement and has the same amortization profile, carries a floating interest rate and matures in \nFebruary 2024. Excess cash flow payments as described above are applied to the balance of the 2019 Senior Secured Credit Facility before being applied to the $30 \nmillion Accordion Loan. The security of the loan is attached to the security of the 2019 Senior Secured Credit Facility and has equal priority, same financial covenants \nand repayment clauses. \n \nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $223.1 million drawn under our 2019 Senior Secured Credit Facility, where $29.5 million, net of deferred financing cost of \n$2.3 million, was presented as Current Portion of Long-Term Debt that included $14.9 million in debt associated with a Vessel Held for Sale. \n \n55 \nTable of Contents \nB.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources"

Riley Securities, Inc, acting as sales agent, under which the Company \nmay, from time to time, offer and sell common stock through an At-the-Market Offering (the “$60 million 2021 ATM”) program having an aggregate offering price of \nup to $60,000,000. As of December 31, 2021, we had raised gross and net proceeds (after deducting sales commissions and other fees and expenses) of $22.3 million \nand $21.7 million, respectively, by issuing and selling 10,222,105 common shares. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, and through to February 14, 2022, we raised \ngross and net proceeds of $16.9 million and $16.5 million, respectively, by issuing and selling 10,764,990 common shares.

In 2022, we have raised gross and net proceeds of $33.6 million and $32.7 million, respectively, by selling and issuing 14,337,258 commons shares \nwith a gross remaining available balance of $26.4 million under this ATM. Based on the share price of the Company of $3.58 as of April 21, 2023, it would have \nresulted in 7,386,354 new shares being issued, if fully utilizing the remaining balance available of the $60 million 2022 ATM. \n \nLiquidity and covenant compliance \n \nCash, restricted cash and cash equivalents are predominantly held in U.S. Dollars and cash and cash equivalents was $59.6 million and $34.7 million as of \nDecember 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Minor cash balances are held in NOK. Restricted cash was $3.7 million and $9.9 million as of December 31, \n2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The restricted cash deposit is nominated and available for use for drydocking and other capex commitments related to the \nvessels used as collateral under the 2019 Senior Secured Credit Facility. \n \nWe monitor compliance with our financial covenants on a regular basis and as of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in \nour debt facilities. Historically, our financial minimum liquidity covenant of $30.0 million is the most sensitive covenant. However, we had a cash balance as of \nDecember 31, 2022, of $59.6 million. \n \nOn a regular basis, we perform cash flow projections to evaluate whether we will be in a position to cover our liquidity needs for the next 12-month period \nand the compliance with financial and security ratios under our existing and future financing agreements. In developing estimates of future cash flows, we make \nassumptions about the vessels’ future performance, market rates, operating expenses, capital expenditure, fleet utilization, general and administrative expenses, loan \nrepayments and interest charges. The assumptions applied are based on historical experience and future expectations. \n \nWe prepare cash flow projections for different scenarios and a key input factor to the cash flow projections is the estimated freight rates. We apply an \naverage of several broker estimates in combination with own estimates for the coming 12-months period. Freight rates have strengthened during 2022 with historically \nstrong rates in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. As such, our company generates significant positive cash flow from operations that can be \nused for dividends, investments or repayment of outstanding loan balances. Our 2019 Senior Secured Credit Facility matures in February 2024 and the remaining loan \nbalance at maturity will have to be repaid from cash generated from operations in the preceding period, refinanced with a new loan or an extension of the agreed \nmaturity date with the current lenders. In the first quarter of 2023, we have repaid $18.2 million on the facility and the loan-to-value ratio for the 2019 Senior Secured \nCredit Facility and the fourteen vessels used as collateral for the loan, is below 20%, based on an outstanding balance of $111.0 million as of the date of this report. \n \n57 \nTable of Contents"

See “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview –The International Tanker Market.” \n  \n  \nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. On a regular basis, \nmanagement reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in \naccordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions \nand estimates, and such differences could be material. For a description of our material accounting policies, please read Item 18. Financial Statements Note 2 - \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies. \n  \nRevenues and voyage expenses \n  \nRevenues and voyage expenses are recognized on an accruals basis over the duration of each spot charter. \n  \nFor vessels operating on spot charters, voyage revenues are recognized ratably over the estimated length of each voyage, calculated on a load-to-discharge \nbasis under ASC 606 and, therefore, are allocated between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each period, and revenue is therefore recognized on a \npro-rata basis commencing on the date that the cargo is loaded and concluded on the date of discharge of the cargo. Voyage expenses are capitalized between the \ndischarge port of previous cargo, or contract date if later, and the load port of the cargo to be chartered if they qualify as fulfillment costs. Incremental cost to obtain \na contract is capitalized and amortized ratably over the estimated length of each voyage, calculated on a load-to-discharge basis. The impact of recognizing voyage \nexpenses ratably over the length of each voyage is not materially different on a quarterly and annual basis from a method of recognizing such costs when incurred. \nWe do not capitalize fulfilment cost or recognize revenue when a charter has not been contractually committed to by a customer. \n  \nVessel Impairment \n  \nThe carrying values of the Company’s vessels may not represent their fair value at any point in time since the market prices of second-hand vessels tend to \nfluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of newbuildings. Historically, both charter rates and vessel values tend to be cyclical. \n  \nOur vessels are evaluated for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a vessel may not be \nrecoverable. Undiscounted future cash flows are estimated on a vessel by vessel basis if events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be \nrecoverable. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from continued use of the vessel and its eventual disposal is less than the carrying amount of \nthe vessel, the vessel is deemed to be impaired. When applicable, we also consider if there are other factors that impact the probability for disposal of a vessel at its \nfair value before the end of its useful life. If a vessel is deemed to be impaired, the impairment charge is recognized based on the difference between the fair value of \nthe vessel and its carrying value. Fair value is based on broker estimates that could be adjusted if there are actual entity specific comparable transactions available. \n  \n60 \nTable of Contents \nC.\nResearch and Development, Patents and Licenses, Etc. \nD.\nTrend Information \nE.\nCritical Accounting Estimates"

      "text": "We have recognized impairment charges on vessels for the year ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 of $0.3 million, $60.3 million \nand $0.0 million, respectively. The impairment charge recorded in 2022 is related to a vessel classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2021, and as a result of a \nchange in fair value before disposal, an impairment charge was recognized, and not due to any broader market-based impairment indicators being identified in 2022. \nThe impairment charges of $60.3 million recognized in 2021 included an impairment loss of $8.9 million related to a Vessel Held for Sale that was presented at its fair \nvalue less cost to sell as of December 31, 2021. \n  \nAs of December 31, 2022, as required under US GAAP, we have considered as a first step whether there were events or changes in circumstances that may \nindicate that the carrying value of our vessels may not be recoverable including a consideration of whether any of the key forward-looking assumptions applied in \nour 2021 impairment analysis, which included preparing estimates of future undiscounted cash flows, have developed negatively in 2022. There are several positive \nfactors identified in 2022 in the areas we closely monitor, such as (1) the expected upturn in freight rates materialized including improved current earnings, (2) broker \nestimates for the coming years predict improved freight rates compared to broker estimates obtained one year ago, (3) a continued low order book for Suezmax tankers \nand (4) higher vessel values than a year ago despite adding one year of age to the vessels. We also monitor other external and internal factors including, but not \nlimited to, our market capitalization, industry regulations, cost of operating the vessels and technological developments.  We have concluded that there were no \nimpairment indicators present and accordingly, in following US GAAP, we have not prepared an analysis of future undiscounted cash flows for our vessels as of \nDecember 31, 2022. \n  \nWhen impairment indicators are identified, as in 2021, we develop estimates of future undiscounted cash flows, where we make assumptions and estimates \nabout the vessels’ future performance, with the significant assumptions being related to charter rates, fleet utilization, operating expenses, capital \nexpenditures/periodical maintenance, residual value and the estimated remaining useful life of each vessel. Many of these assumptions are relatively stable over time. \nHowever, charter rates are volatile and require management to apply significant judgment when assessing if impairment indicators are present, and when they are, for \nestimating future charter rates when preparing estimates of undiscounted cash flows. \n  \nThe assumptions used to develop estimates of future undiscounted cash flows, when necessary, are based on historical trends as well as future \nexpectations. The estimated net operating revenues are determined by considering an estimated daily time charter equivalent for the remaining operating days over \nthe useful life of the vessel. The daily time charter equivalent rates are converted to annual forecasted revenues by multiplying the daily rate by the number of days in \nthe year less days for expected off-hire and dry-docking. Although the Company believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable \nand appropriate, such assumptions are subjective. There can be no assurance whether the actual outcome will be close to the estimates applied, as the tanker market \nis volatile in respect of both vessel values and charter rates, and we might experience changes in demand for transportation services, oil production, regulations and \nthe size of the global tanker fleet. \n  \nThe most important assumption in determining undiscounted cash flows, when necessary, is the estimated charter rates. Charter rates are volatile and the \nanalyses have in prior periods been based on market rates obtained from third parties, in combination with historical achieved rates by us. We have historically \napplied an estimated daily time charter equivalents based on an average of several broker estimates for the first two years of our analysis. For the remaining period \nfrom year three and to the end of the useful life of each vessel, we have applied a daily time charter equivalent equalling the trailing fifteen-year historical company-\nspecific average spot market rate. The broker estimates applied in year one and two are considered a more precise forecast as it captures the shorter-term expected \nmarket development of our business. The broker estimates are normally not available for a period exceeding two years. For year 3 and beyond, we believe that the 15-\nyear historical company-specific average is a reasonable proxy for our expected cash flows as this average is most likely to encompass the charter rate cycles that our \nvessels will experience. \n  \nWhen we calculate the expected undiscounted net cash flows for the vessels, we deduct operating expenses and expected cost of dry-docking and other \nexpected capital expenditures from the operating revenues before adding an estimated residual value of the vessel at the end of its useful life. The operating expenses \napplied are based on the forecasted operating cost for the vessels, which is adjusted in subsequent periods for expected growth. We have historically applied a \ncompounded growth factor to the operating expenses, which is calculated based on the average increase in our operating expenses over the last fifteen years. \nEstimated cash outflows for dry-docking are based on historical and forecasted expenditure. Vessel utilization is based on historical average levels achieved. The \nresidual value applied is a long term estimate based on an estimated market price of scrap per ton multiplied by lightweight tonnage of the vessel, less estimated cost \nassociated with scrapping the vessel. The scrap price applied is less than the prevailing scrap price for steel and is based on observation over a longer period of time \nto capture both peaks and troughs in metal prices.  All vessels are maintained for and assumed to have a useful life of 25 years. \n  \n61 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "Further, we consider if there are present factors that impact the probability of disposal of a vessel before the end of its estimated useful life. These factors \ncould include the current price of second-hand vessels, expected capital expenditure, prevailing freight rates and the price of oil. The second-hand prices of Suezmax \nvessels were attractive in 2021 and 2022 from a historical perspective and we have disposed of five vessels in 2022 that were subject to impairment charges in 2021. \nAll vessels are held for use as of December 31, 2022. \n  \nIn 2021, we disclosed that our 15-year historical company-specific average rate was $23,548, which was above the 2021 break-even rate of $22,023 that is the \nlevel that rates would have needed to fall to before the undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value for the first vessel in our fleet as of December 31, \n2021. In 2022, we achieved a TCE rate of $24,725 and the five and ten-year average rates charter rates achieved by the Company increased from $18,259 and $20,160 \nfor the periods 2017- 2021 and 2012 – 2021, to $20,397 and $21,466 for the periods from 2018-2022 and 2013-2022, respectively.  Our 15-year historical company-specific \naverage rate and the breakeven rate as of December 31, 2022 were at approximately the same levels as in 2021. \n \nThe Total Fleet – Comparison of Carrying Value versus Market Value: During the past five years, the market values of vessels have experienced particular \nvolatility for many vessel classes. Our fleet of Suezmax vessels experienced a positive valuation curve both in 2022 and 2021 with values at the end of 2022 above the \nvaluations received at the end of 2021. The increase in 2021 was mainly driven by the increase in steel prices and the further increase in 2022 is considered as a \nreflection of the strengthening of the freight rates in the Suezmax tanker market. According to Clarkson Research 190 Suezmax tankers were sold and bought in total \nbetween 2018 and 2022, however such transactions may not be vessels as well maintained as the vessels in our fleet. For impairment testing, as described above, we \nperform our analysis on a vessel by vessel basis. However, as further described below, we believe that our fleet should be valued as a transportation system as it is \nnot meaningful under our strategy to solely assess the value of each individual vessel. \n  \nEvents and circumstances which could impact our estimates of future cash flows of our vessels, when developed, include: \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nOur estimates of market value assume that our vessels are all in good and seaworthy condition without need for repair and, if inspected, would be certified in \nclass without notations of any kind, and are held for use. Most oil companies require CAP 2 notation or better. All relevant vessels in our fleet have CAP1 notation \nfor Hull, as well as Machinery & Cargo. CAP is an abbreviation for Condition Assessment Program. The quality of the NAT fleet is at the top as evidenced by our \nvetting statistics, that is, inspections of our ships by clients. In such vetting processes safety for our crew, the environment and our assets are main considerations. \n  \n62 \nTable of Contents \n•\nDeclines in prevailing market charter rates; \n•\nDelays in anticipated tanker market upturn; \n•\nChanges in behaviours and attitudes of our charterers towards actual and preferred technical, operational and environmental standards; \n•\nChanges in regulations over the requirements for the technical and environmental capabilities of our vessels; and \n•\nIncreased inflation as a result of factors outside our control. \n•\nChanges in steel prices \n•\nPolitical uncertainty including changes in trading routes and demand"

      "text": "Our estimates are based on the estimated market values for our vessels that we have received from shipbrokers and these are inherently uncertain. The \nmarket value of a vessel as determined by shipbrokers could be an arbitrary assessment giving an estimate of a value for a transaction that has not taken place. In \nManagement’s view the valuation of the Company on the NYSE should not be based solely upon net asset value (NAV), a measure that only is linked to the steel \nvalue of our ships. We have our own ongoing system value with a large and homogenous fleet allowing us to offer our transportation services to our clients across \nthe globe, well-functioning processes and established customer relationships with oil majors and other reputable customers. \n  \n \nThe carrying value of our vessels as of December 31, 2022 is $735.1 million. We have obtained broker estimates from two independent shipbrokers indicating \na fair market value of our vessels held and used on a charter free basis to be $955.0 million, based on an average of the two estimates including the inherent \nuncertainty in such estimates. One vessel marked with an asterisk (*) has a fair market value that is lower than the carrying value.

Vessels are stated at their historical cost and the estimated \neconomic useful life of a vessel is 25 years from the date of delivery from the shipyard. Certain subsequent expenditures for vessel upgrades are also capitalized if it is \ndetermined that they appreciably extend the life, increase the earning capacity or improve the efficiency or safety of the vessel and depreciated over the remaining \nuseful life of the vessel. \n  \nDepreciation is calculated based on cost less estimated residual value using the straight-line method. The residual value is estimated by management and \nreviewed periodically, where the market price of scrap per ton is considered and we are monitoring the development from period to period. For the financial year \nended December 31, 2022, we have maintained the scrap value of $8.0 million in our estimates as the estimate is considered as a long-term estimate and we will \nobserve a longer period of increased scrap values before adjusting our estimates. \n  \n63 \nTable of Contents \nVessel \n \nBuilt \nDeadweight \nTons \nCarrying Value \n$ (millions) \nDec 31, 2022 \nCarrying Value \n$ (millions) \nDec 31, 2021 \nNordic Apollo \n2003 \n \n159,998\n \n14.5\n \n16.5\nNordic Pollux \n2003 \n \n150,103\n \n19.0\n \n18.0\nNordic Luna \n2004 \n \n150,037\n \n22.0\n \n20.9\nNordic Castor \n2004 \n \n150,249\n \n19.1\n \n19.8\nNordic Freedom \n2005 \n \n159,331\n \n30.6\n \n31.8\nNordic Sprinter \n2005 \n \n159,089\n \n23.8\n \n23.3\nNordic Skier \n2005 \n \n159,089\n \n22.3\n \n24.7\nNordic Light \n2010 \n \n158,475\n \n41.6\n \n44.6\nNordic Cross \n2010 \n \n158,475\n \n41.9\n \n45.0\nNordic Vega* \n2010 \n \n163,940\n \n52.3\n \n56.1\nNordic Breeze \n2011 \n \n158,597\n \n42.7\n \n45.5\nNordic Zenith \n2011 \n \n158,645\n \n43.2\n \n46.1\nNordic Star \n2016 \n \n157,738\n \n51.8\n \n54.5\nNordic Space \n2017 \n \n157,582\n \n52.9\n \n54.0\nNordic Tellus \n2018 \n \n157,407\n \n49.2\n \n51.4\nNordic Aquarius \n2018 \n \n157,338\n \n47.9\n \n50.1\nNordic Cygnus \n2018 \n \n157,526\n \n48.4\n \n50.7\nNordic Hunter \n2022 \n \n157,037\n \n56.2\n \n-\nNordic Harrier \n2022 \n \n157,094\n \n55.7\n \n-"

Vessels exceeding 15 years are subject to periodical maintenance surveys \nevery 30 months, whereas vessels under 15 years of age are subject to survey intervals every 60 months. We capitalize a substantial portion of the costs incurred \nduring drydocking and amortize those costs on a straight-line basis from the completion of a drydocking or intermediate survey to the estimated completion of the \nnext drydocking. Drydocking costs include a variety of costs incurred while vessels are placed within drydock, including direct expenses incurred related to the \npreparation for docking and port expenses at the drydock shipyard, general shipyard expenses, expenses related to hull, external surfaces and decks, expenses related \nto machinery and engines of the vessel, as well as expenses related to the testing and correction of findings related to safety equipment on board.  We include in \ncapitalized drydocking those costs incurred as part of the drydock to meet classification and regulatory requirements. Expenditures for normal repairs and \nmaintenance performed during drydocking are expensed as incurred. Ballast tank improvements are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of \neight years. The capitalized and unamortized drydocking costs are included in the book value of the vessels.

The holders of the restricted \nshares were entitled to voting rights as well as dividends paid during the vesting period. All 537,665 common shares allocated have been fully vested and this part of \nthe plan is as such completed and closed. \n  \nIn October 2019, we amended and restated the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan to reserve an additional 1,000,000 stock options for issuance to persons employed \nin the management of the Company and members of the Board of Directors under the same terms as the original plan. On October 28, 2019, the Company granted \n755,000 and 234,000 stock options with vesting over a period of two and three years, respectively, and an exercise price of $4.70 per share. In October 2021, the \nvesting period for the 755,000 stock options that originally vested in October 2021 was prolonged with one year. The stock options vested in October 2022 without \nany options being exercised as the strike price of the options was above the share price at the vesting date. After the expiration in October 2022, these options \nbecame eligible for re-distribution. \n  \nIn November 2022, the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan was amended to reserve an additional 3,000,000 stock option for issuance to persons employed in the \nmanagement of the Company and members of the Board of Directors. On November 1, 2022, we granted 3,990,000 stock options with vesting over a period of two \nyears and an exercise price of $3.60 per share, adjusted for dividends in the period, to 21 persons amongst our directors, employees and consultants. The options are \nexercisable in a period of 12 months following the vesting date. \n  \nA copy of the Amended and Restated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan is filed as Exhibit 4.11 to this annual report. \n  \n  \nThe members of our Board of Directors serve until the next annual general meeting following his or her election.

However, under Bermuda law, a company may by resolution in general \nmeeting, elect to dispense with the holding of an annual general meeting for (a) the year in which it is made and any subsequent year or years; (b) for a specified \nnumber of years; or (c) indefinitely.  Our Board of Directors may call special general meetings of shareholders at its discretion or as required by the Companies Act. \nUnder the Companies Act, holders of one-tenth of our issued common shares may call special general meetings. \n  \nUnder our bye-laws, five days advance notice of an annual general meeting or any special general meeting must be given to each shareholder entitled to \nvote at that meeting unless, in the case of an annual general meeting, a shorter notice period for such meeting is agreed to by all of the shareholders entitled to vote \nthereat and, in the case of any other meeting, a shorter notice period for such meeting is agreed to by at least 75% of the shareholders entitled to vote thereat. Under \nBermuda law, accidental failure to give notice will not invalidate proceedings at a meeting.

In general terms, it works by imposing a \nsignificant penalty upon any person or group that acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common shares without the approval of the Board. If a shareholder’s \nbeneficial ownership of our common shares as of the time of the public announcement of the rights plan and associated dividend declaration is at or above the \napplicable threshold, that shareholder’s then-existing ownership percentage would be grandfathered, but the rights would become exercisable if at any time after such \nannouncement, the shareholder increases its ownership percentage by 1% or more. \n  \nThe Rights may have anti-takeover effects. The Rights will cause substantial dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire us without the \napproval of our Board. As a result, the overall effect of the Rights may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us. Because our Board can \napprove a redemption of the Rights for a permitted offer, the Rights should not interfere with a merger or other business combination approved by our Board. \n  \nFor those interested in the specific terms of the Rights Agreement, we provide the following summary description. Please note, however, that this \ndescription is only a summary, and is not complete, and should be read together with the entire Rights Agreement, which is an exhibit to the Form 8-A filed by us on \nJune 16, 2017 and incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Rights Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. \n  \nThe Rights. The Rights trade with, and are inseparable from, our common shares. The Rights are evidenced only by certificates that represent our common \nshares. New Rights will accompany any new common shares of the Company issues after June 26, 2017 until the Distribution Date described below. \n  \n71 \nTable of Contents"

Each Right allows its holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a Series A Participating Preferred Share (a “Preferred \nShare”) for $30.00 (the “Exercise Price”), once the Rights become exercisable.

Prior to exercise, the Right does not give its holder any dividend, voting, or liquidation rights. \n  \nExercisability. The Rights are not exercisable until ten days after the public announcement that a person or group has become an “Acquiring Person” by \nobtaining beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our outstanding common shares. \n  \nCertain synthetic interests in securities created by derivative positions, whether or not such interests are considered to be ownership of the underlying \ncommon shares or are reportable for purposes of Regulation 13D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are treated as beneficial ownership of the \nnumber of our common shares equivalent to the economic exposure created by the derivative position, to the extent our actual common shares are directly or \nindirectly held by counterparties to the derivatives contracts. Swaps dealers unassociated with any control intent or intent to evade the purposes of the Rights \nAgreement are exempt from such imputed beneficial ownership. \n  \nFor persons who, prior to the time of public announcement of the Rights Agreement, beneficially own 15% or more of our outstanding common shares, the \nRights Agreement “grandfathers” their current level of ownership, so long as they do not purchase additional shares in excess of certain limitations. \n  \nThe date when the Rights become exercisable is the “Distribution Date.” Until that date, our common share certificates (or, in the case of uncertificated \nshares, by notations in the book-entry account system) will also evidence the Rights, and any transfer of our common shares will constitute a transfer of Rights. \nAfter that date, the Rights will separate from our common shares and will be evidenced by book-entry credits or by Rights certificates that the Company will mail to all \neligible holders of our common shares.

The Board may redeem the Rights for $0.01 per Right at any time before any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person. If the Board \nredeems any Rights, it must redeem all of the Rights. Once the Rights are redeemed, the only right of the holders of the Rights will be to receive the redemption price \nof $0.01 per Right.

In addition, there is no capital gains tax in Bermuda, and profits can be accumulated \nby the Company, as required, without limitation. \n  \n  \nBermuda Tax Considerations \n  \nUnder current Bermuda law, there are no taxes on profits, income or dividends nor is there any capital gains tax.  Furthermore, the Company has received \nfrom the Minister of Finance of Bermuda under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act of 1966, as amended, an undertaking that, in the event that Bermuda \nenacts any legislation imposing tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or \ninheritance tax, then the imposition of any such tax shall not be applicable to the Company or to any of its operations, or the common shares, debentures or other \nobligations of the Company, until March 31, 2035.  This undertaking does not, however, prevent the imposition of any such tax or duty on such persons as are \nordinarily resident in Bermuda and holding such shares, debentures or obligations of the Company or of property taxes on Company-owned real property or \nleasehold interests in Bermuda. \n  \nThe United States does not have a comprehensive income tax treaty with Bermuda. However, Bermuda has legislation in place (U.S.A. – Bermuda Tax \nConvention Act 1986) which authorizes the enforcement of certain obligations of Bermuda pursuant to the Convention Between The Government Of The United \nKingdom of Great Britain And Northern Ireland (On Behalf Of The Government Of Bermuda) And The Government Of The United States Of America Relating To \nThe Taxation Of Insurance Enterprises And Mutual Assistance In Tax Matters entered into on 11 July 1986 (the “Convention”).

Shipping Income that is attributable to transportation that both begins and ends in the United States will be \nconsidered to be 100% derived from sources within the United States. \n  \nShipping Income that is attributable to transportation exclusively between non-United States ports will be considered to be 100% derived from sources \noutside the United States. Shipping Income derived from sources outside the United States will not be subject to United States federal income tax. \n  \nOur vessels will be operated in various parts of the world and, in part, are expected to be involved in transportation of cargoes that begins or ends, but that \ndoes not both begin and end, in United States ports. Accordingly, it is not expected that we will engage in transportation that gives rise to 100% United States-\nSource Shipping Income. \n  \nExemption of Operating Income from United States Federal Income Taxation \n  \nPursuant to section 883 of the Code, we will be exempt from United States federal income taxation on our United States-Source Shipping Income if (i) we are \norganized in a foreign country that grants an equivalent exemption from income taxation to corporations organized in the United States, which we refer to as the \nCountry of Organization Requirement, and (ii) either (A) more than 50% of the value of our common shares is owned, directly or indirectly, by individuals who are \n“residents” of such country or of another foreign country that grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the United States, which we refer to as the \n50% Ownership Test, or (B) our common shares are “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in such country, in another country that \ngrants an equivalent exemption to United States corporations, or in the United States, which we refer to as the Publicly-Traded Test. \n  \nBermuda, the country in which we are incorporated, grants an equivalent exemption to United States corporations. Therefore, we will satisfy the Country of \nOrganization Requirement and will be exempt from United States federal income taxation with respect to our United States-Source Shipping Income if we satisfy either \nthe 50% Ownership Test or the Publicly-Traded Test. \n  \nThe regulations promulgated by the United States Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury Regulations”) under section 883 of the Code provide that \nstock of a foreign corporation will be considered to be “primarily traded” on an established securities market in a country if the number of shares of each class of \nstock that is traded during any taxable year on all established securities markets in that country exceeds the number of shares in each such class that is traded during \nthat year on established securities markets in any other single country. \n  \nThe Publicly-Traded Test also requires our common shares be “regularly traded” on an established securities market.  Under the Treasury Regulations, our \ncommon shares are considered to be “regularly traded” on an established securities market if shares representing more than 50% of our outstanding common shares, \nby both total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and total value, are listed on the market, referred to as the “Listing Threshold.” The \nTreasury Regulations further require that with respect to each class of stock relied upon to meet the listing threshold, (i) such class of stock is traded on the market, \nother than in minimal quantities, on at least 60 days during the taxable year or 1/6 of the days in a short taxable year, which is referred to as the Trading Frequency \nTest; and (ii) the aggregate number of shares of such class of stock traded on such market during the taxable year is at least 10% of the average number of shares of \nsuch class of stock outstanding during such year (as appropriately adjusted in the case of a short taxable year), which is referred to as the Trading Volume Test.  \nEven if we do not satisfy both the Trading Frequency and Trading Volume Tests, the Treasury Regulations provide that the Tests will be deemed satisfied if our \ncommon shares are traded on an established securities market in the United States and such stock is regularly quoted by dealers making a market in our common \nshares. \n  \n76 \nTable of Contents"

In the event the 5% Override Rule is triggered, the 5% Override Rule will nevertheless not apply if we can establish that among the closely-held group of 5% \nShareholders, there are sufficient 5% Shareholders that are considered to be “qualified shareholders” for purposes of section 883 of the Code to preclude non-\nqualified 5% Shareholders in the closely-held group from owning 50% or more of our common shares for more than half the number of days during the taxable year.  \nIn order to determine the persons who are 5% Shareholders, we are permitted to rely on those persons that are identified on Schedule 13G and Schedule 13D filings \nwith the SEC as having a 5% or more beneficial interest in our common shares. \n  \nWe are not aware of any facts which would indicate that 50% or more of our common shares were actually or constructively owned by 5% Shareholders \nduring our 2022 taxable year.  Accordingly, we expect that our common shares will be considered to be “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities \nmarket” and that we will, therefore, qualify for the exemption under section 883 of the Code for our 2022 taxable year.  However, because of the factual nature of the \nissues relating to this determination, no assurance can be given that we will qualify for the exemption in any future taxable year. For example, if 5% Shareholders \nowned 50% or more of our common shares, then we would have to satisfy certain requirements regarding the identity and residence of our 5% Shareholders. These \nrequirements are onerous and there is no assurance that we could satisfy them. \n  \nUnited States Federal Income Taxation of Gain on Sale of Vessels \n  \nRegardless of whether we qualify for exemption under section 883 of the Code, we will generally not be subject to United States federal income taxation with \nrespect to gain realized on the sale of a vessel, provided the sale is considered to occur outside of the United States under United States federal income tax \nprinciples.  In general, a sale of a vessel will be considered to occur outside of the United States for this purpose if title to the vessel, and risk of loss with respect to \nthe vessel, pass to the buyer outside of the United States.  It is expected that any sale of a vessel by us will be considered to occur outside of the United States. \n  \n4% Gross Basis Tax Regime \n  \nTo the extent that the benefits of section 883 of the Code are unavailable with respect to any item of United States-Source Shipping Income, such Shipping \nIncome that is considered not to be “effectively connected” with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, as discussed below, would be subject to a \n4% tax imposed by section 887 of the Code on a gross basis, without benefit of deductions, which we refer to as the 4% Gross Basis Tax Regime. Since under the \nsourcing rules described above, no more than 50% of our Shipping Income would be derived from United States sources, the maximum effective rate of United States \nfederal income tax on our gross Shipping Income would never exceed 2% under the 4% Gross Basis Tax Regime. \n  \n77 \nTable of Contents"

In \naddition, we may be subject to the 30% “branch profits” taxes on earnings effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business, as determined after \nallowance for certain adjustments, and on certain interest paid or deemed paid attributable to the conduct of the United States trade or business. \n  \nOur United States-Source Shipping Income would be considered “effectively connected” with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business only if (i) we have, or \nare considered to have, a fixed place of business in the United States involved in the earning of Shipping Income and (ii) substantially all of our United States-Source \nShipping Income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that followed a published schedule with repeated sailings at \nregular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the United States, or, in the case of income from the chartering of a vessel, is attributable \nto a fixed place of business in the United States. \n  \nWe do not intend to have a fixed place of business in the United States involved in the earning of Shipping Income. Based on the foregoing and on the \nexpected mode of our shipping operations and other activities, we believe that none of our United States-Source Shipping Income will be “effectively connected” \nwith the conduct of a United States trade or business. \n  \nUnited States Federal Income Taxation of United States Holders \n  \nAs used herein, the term “United States Holder” means, for United States federal income tax purposes, a beneficial owner of common shares who is (A) an \nindividual citizen or resident of the United States, (B) a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation) created or organized in or under the laws of the United \nStates or of any state or the District of Columbia, (C) an estate the income of which is includible in gross income for United States federal income tax purposes \nregardless of its source, or (D) a trust if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more \nUnited States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) it has an election in place to be treated as a United States person. \n  \nIf a partnership holds our common shares, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the \nactivities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership holding our common shares, you are urged to consult your tax advisors. \n  \nDistributions \n  \nSubject to the discussion below of passive foreign investment companies, or PFICs, any distributions made by us with respect to our common shares to a \nUnited States Holder will generally constitute dividends, which may be taxable as ordinary income or “qualified dividend income,” as described in more detail below, \nto the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under United States federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of our \nearnings and profits will be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the United States Holder’s tax basis in his common shares on a dollar-for-\ndollar basis and thereafter as capital gain. Because we are not a United States corporation, United States Holders that are corporations will generally not be entitled to \nclaim a dividends received deduction with respect to any distributions they receive from us. Dividends paid with respect to our common shares will generally be \ntreated as “passive category income” or, in the case of certain types of United States Holders, “general category income” for purposes of computing allowable \nforeign tax credits for United States foreign tax credit purposes. \n  \n78 \nTable of Contents"

Any dividends paid by us which are not eligible for these preferential rates will be taxed as ordinary income to a United States Individual Holder. \n  \nIf we pay an “extraordinary dividend” on our common shares (generally, a dividend in an amount which is equal to or in excess of 10% of a shareholder’s \nadjusted tax basis (or fair market value in certain circumstances) in the common shares or dividends received within a one-year period that, in the aggregate, equal or \nexceed 20% of a shareholder’s adjusted tax basis (or fair market value upon the shareholder’s election)) that is treated as “qualified dividend income,” then any loss \nderived by a United States Individual Holder from the sale or exchange of such common shares will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of such dividend. \n  \nSale, Exchange or other Disposition of Common Shares \n  \nAssuming we do not constitute a PFIC for taxable years after 2004, a United States Holder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss upon a sale, exchange \nor other disposition of our common shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized by the United States Holder from such sale, exchange or \nother disposition and the United States Holder’s tax basis in such common shares. Such gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the United \nStates Holder’s holding period is greater than one year at the time of the sale, exchange or other disposition. Such capital gain or loss will generally be treated as \nUnited States-source income or loss, as applicable, for United States foreign tax credit purposes. A United States Holder’s ability to deduct capital losses is subject \nto certain limitations. \n  \nSpecial rules may apply to a United States Holder who purchased shares before 2005 and did not make a timely QEF election or a mark-to-market election (as \ndiscussed below).

      "text": "For taxable years through 2004, we were a PFIC. However, based on our current operations and future projections, we do not believe that we have been, or \nwill become, a PFIC with respect to our taxable years after 2004. Although there is no legal authority directly on point, and we are not relying upon an opinion of \ncounsel on this issue, our belief is based principally on the position that, for purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC, the gross income we derive or are \ndeemed to derive from our time chartering and voyage chartering activities should constitute services income, rather than rental income. Correspondingly, such \nincome should not constitute passive income, and the assets that we own and operate or are deemed to own and operate in connection with the production of such \nincome, in particular, the vessels, should not constitute passive assets for purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC. We believe there is substantial legal \nauthority supporting our position consisting of case law and Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, pronouncements concerning the characterization of income derived \nfrom time charters and voyage charters as services income for other tax purposes. However, we note that there is also authority which characterizes time charter \nincome as rental income rather than services income for other tax purposes. In the absence of any legal authority specifically relating to the statutory provisions \ngoverning PFICs, the IRS or a court could disagree with our position. In addition, although we intend to conduct our affairs in a manner to avoid being classified as a \nPFIC, we cannot assure you that the nature of our operations will not change in the future. \n  \nAs discussed more fully below, if we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year which included a United States Holder’s holding period in our \ncommon shares, then such United States Holder would be subject to different United States federal income taxation rules depending on whether the United States \nHolder makes an election to treat us as a “qualified electing fund,” which election we refer to as a QEF Election. As an alternative to making a QEF election, a United \nStates Holder should be able to make a “mark-to-market” election with respect to our common shares, as discussed below.  In addition, if we were to be treated as a \nPFIC for a taxable year ending on or after December 31, 2013, a United States Holder of our common shares would be required to file an annual information return with \nthe IRS for such year. \n  \nUnited States Holders Making a Timely QEF Election \n  \nPass-Through of Ordinary Earnings and Net Capital Gain. A United States Holder who makes a timely QEF Election with respect to our common shares, or \nan Electing Holder, would report for United States federal income tax purposes his pro rata share of our “ordinary earnings” (i.e., the net operating income determined \nunder United States federal income tax principles) and our net capital gain, if any, for our taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year of the Electing Holder. \nOur “net capital gain” is any excess of any of our net long term capital gains over our net short term capital losses and is reported by the Electing Holder as long term \ncapital gain. Our net operating losses or net capital losses would not pass through to the Electing Holder and will not offset our ordinary earnings or net capital gain \nreportable to Electing Holders in subsequent years (although such losses would ultimately reduce the gain, or increase the loss, if any, recognized by the Electing \nHolder on the sale of his common shares). \n  \nFor purposes of calculating our ordinary earnings, the cost of each vessel is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the applicable recovery period for \nvessels. Any gain on the sale of a vessel would be treated as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, to the extent of such depreciation deductions with respect to \nsuch vessel. \n  \nIn general, an Electing Holder would not be taxed twice on his share of our income. Thus, distributions received from us by an Electing Holder are excluded \nfrom the Electing Holder’s gross income to the extent of the Electing Holder’s prior inclusions of our ordinary earnings and net capital gain. The Electing Holder’s tax \nbasis in his shares would be increased by any amount included in the Electing Holder’s income. Distributions received by an Electing Holder, which are not includible \nin income because they have been previously taxed, would decrease the Electing Holder’s tax basis in the common shares. Distributions, if any, in excess of such tax \nbasis would be treated as capital gain (which gain will be treated as long-term capital gain if the Electing Holder held its common shares for more than one year at the \ntime of distribution). \n  \nDisposition of Common Shares. An Electing Holder would generally recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or exchange of common shares in an amount \nequal to the difference between the amount realized by the Electing Holder from such sale or exchange and the Electing Holder’s tax basis in the common shares. \nSuch gain or loss would generally be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the Electing Holder’s holding period in the common shares at the time of the sale or \nexchange is more than one year. A United States Holder’s ability to deduct capital losses may be limited. \n  \nMaking a QEF Election. A United States Holder makes a QEF Election for a taxable year by completing and filing IRS Form 8621 (Return by a Shareholder of \na Passive Foreign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund) in accordance with the instructions thereto. If we were aware that we were to be treated as a PFIC \nfor any taxable year, we would provide each United States Holder with all necessary information in order to make the QEF Election described above. \n  \n80 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "United States Holders Making a Timely Mark-to-Market Election \n  \nMark-to-Market Regime. A United States Holder who does not make a QEF Election may make a “mark-to-market” election under section 1296 of the Code, \nprovided that the common shares are regularly traded on a “qualified exchange.” The NYSE, on which the common shares are traded, is a “qualified exchange” for \nthese purposes. A United States Holder who makes a timely mark-to-market election with respect to the common shares would include annually in the United States \nHolder’s income, as ordinary income, any excess of the fair market value of the common shares at the close of the taxable year over the United States Holder’s then \nadjusted tax basis in the common shares. The excess, if any, of the United States Holder’s adjusted tax basis at the close of the taxable year over the then fair market \nvalue of the common shares would be deductible in an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of the excess or the net mark-to-market gains that the United States \nHolder included in income in previous years with respect to the common shares. A United States Holder’s tax basis in his common shares would be adjusted to reflect \nany income or loss amount recognized pursuant to the mark-to-market election. \n  \nDisposition of Common Shares. A United States Holder who makes a timely mark-to-market election would recognize ordinary income or loss on a sale, \nexchange or other disposition of the common shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized by the United States Holder from such sale, \nexchange or other disposition and the United States Holder’s tax basis in the common shares; provided, however, that any ordinary loss on the sale, exchange or \nother disposition may not exceed the net mark-to-market gains that the United States Holder included in income in previous years with respect to the common shares. \nThe amount of any loss in excess of such net mark-to market gains is treated as capital loss. \n  \nMaking the Mark-to-Market Election. A United States Holder makes a mark-to-market election for a taxable year by completing and filing IRS Form 8621 \n(Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund) in accordance with the instructions thereto. \n  \nUnited States Holders Not Making a Timely QEF Election or Mark-to-Market Election \n  \nA United States Holder who does not make a timely QEF Election or a timely mark-to-market election, which we refer to as a Non-Electing Holder, would be \nsubject to special rules with respect to (i) any “excess distribution” (generally, the portion of any distributions received by the Non-Electing Holder on the common \nshares in a taxable year in excess of 125% of the average annual distributions received by the Non-Electing Holder in the three preceding taxable years, or, if shorter, \nthe Non-Electing Holder’s holding period for the common shares), and (ii) any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of common shares. Under these rules, (i) \nthe excess distribution or gain would be allocated ratably over the Non-Electing Holder’s holding period for the common shares; (ii) the amount allocated to the \ncurrent taxable year, and any taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which we were a PFIC, would be taxed as ordinary income; and (iii) the amount allocated to \neach of the other prior taxable years would be subject to tax at the highest rate of tax in effect for the applicable class of taxpayer for that year, and an interest charge \nfor the deemed tax deferral benefit would be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable to each such other taxable year. If a Non-Electing Holder dies while \nowning common shares, the Non-Electing Holder’s successor would be ineligible to receive a step-up in the tax basis of those common shares. \n  \nDistributions received by a Non-Electing Holder that are not “excess distributions” would be includible in the gross income of the Non-Electing Holder as \ndividend income to the extent that such distributions are paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under United States federal \nincome tax principles. Such dividends would not be eligible to be treated as “qualified dividend income” eligible for preferential tax rates. Distributions in excess of \nour current or accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of the United States Holder’s tax basis in the common shares (thereby increasing the \namount of any gain or decreasing the amount of any loss realized on the subsequent sale or disposition of such common shares) and thereafter as capital gain. \n  \n81 \nTable of Contents"

We believe that our established practices in the area of corporate governance are in line with the spirit of the NYSE standards and provide adequate \nprotection to our shareholders. \n  \nThere are four significant differences between our corporate governance practices and the NYSE standards applicable to listed U.S. companies. The NYSE \nrequires that non-management directors meet regularly in executive sessions without management. The NYSE also requires that all independent directors meet in an \nexecutive session at least once a year. As permitted under Bermuda law and our bye-laws, our non-management directors do not regularly hold executive sessions \nwithout management and we do not expect them to do so in the future. The NYSE requires that a listed U.S. company have a nominating/corporate governance \ncommittee of independent directors and a committee charter specifying the purpose, duties and evaluation procedures of the committee. As permitted under Bermuda \nlaw and our bye-laws, we do not currently have a nominating or corporate governance committee. The NYSE requires, among other things, that a listed U.S. company \nhave an audit committee with a minimum of three members, all of whom are independent. As permitted by Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our \naudit committee consists of one independent member of our Board of Directors. The NYSE requires U.S. companies to adopt and disclose corporate governance \nguidelines. The guidelines must address, among other things: director qualification standards, director responsibilities, director access to management and \nindependent advisers, director compensation, director orientation and continuing education, management succession and an annual performance evaluation. We are \nnot required to adopt such guidelines under Bermuda law and we have not adopted such guidelines. \n  \n  \nNot applicable. \n  \n  \nNot applicable. \n  \nPART III \n  \n  \nSee Item 18. \n  \n  \nThe financial information required by this Item is set forth on pages F-1 to F-24 filed as part of this annual report. \n  \n88 \nTable of Contents \nITEM 16F.\nCHANGE IN REGISTRANT`S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT. \nITEM 16G.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nITEM 16H.\nMINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE \nITEM 16I.\nDISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS \nITEM 17.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nITEM 18.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS"

In our \nopinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \n  \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance \nsheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and \ncash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our \nreport dated April 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. \n  \nBasis for Opinion \n  \nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal \ncontrol over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to \nexpress an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are \nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities \nand Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n  \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance \nabout whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included \nobtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and \noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the \ncircumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n  \nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n  \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the \npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial \nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions \nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial \nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with \nauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized \nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n  \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of \neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with \nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n  \n \n/s/ KPMG AS \n  \nOslo, Norway \nApril 27, 2023 \n \nF-2 \nTable of Contents"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements \npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for \neach of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n  \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal \ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee \nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated April 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the \nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. \n  \nBasis for Opinion \n  \nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated \nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the \nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n  \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable \nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing \nprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that \nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial \nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall \npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n \nCritical Audit Matter \n  \nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or \nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) \ninvolved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the \nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical \naudit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n \nImpairment indicators of vessels \n \nAs discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the carrying value of vessels as of December 31, 2022 was $735.1 million. As discussed in \nNote 2 to the consolidated financial statements, at each reporting date, the Company reviews its vessels for impairment whenever events or circumstances \nindicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company’s evaluation of events or circumstances that may indicate impairment include, \namongst others, an assessment of estimated cash flows, influenced primarily by future charter rates. The Company did not identify any indicators of \nimpairment as at December 31, 2022. \n  \nWe identified the assessment of indicators of impairment for vessels as a critical audit matter. A higher degree of subjective auditor judgment was required \nto assess the Company’s evaluation of events or circumstances that impact estimated cash flows, particularly estimated future charter rates including charter \nrates for the initial two-year period and for the remaining estimated useful life of the vessel. Changes in assumptions about estimated future charter rates \ncould have a significant effect on the Company’s conclusion regarding indicators of impairment. \n  \nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness \nof an internal control related to the Company’s identification and evaluation of indicators of impairment, including an assessment of estimated future charter \nrates. We evaluated the Company’s estimated future charter rates for 2023 and 2024 by comparing the Company’s historical expected future charter rates to \nactual charter rates and comparing current expectations of charter rates to forecasts from brokers and publicly available information about the industry. To \nevaluate the Company’s estimated charter rates from 2025 to the end of the useful life of the vessel, we compared the Company’s estimated future charter \nrates to both Company specific historical results and to historical charter rates from brokers and publicly available information about the industry. \n  \n  \n/s/ KPMG AS \n  \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2015. \n    \nOslo, Norway \nApril 27, 2023 \n \nF-3 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "NORDIC AMERICAN TANKERS LIMITED \n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n(All amounts in USD ‘000 except where noted) \n \n \nNordic American Tankers Limited (“NAT”) was formed on June 12, 1995 under the laws of the Islands of Bermuda. The Company’s shares trade under the symbol \n“NAT” on the New York Stock Exchange. The Company was formed for the purpose of acquiring and chartering out double-hull tankers. \n \nThe Company is an international tanker company that has a fleet of 19 Suezmax tankers as of December 31, 2022. The Company has in 2022 disposed of five vessels \nbuilt in 2002 and 2003 and taken delivery of two newbuildings from Samsung shipyard in South Korea. The vessels in the fleet are considered homogeneous and \ninterchangeable as they have approximately the same freight capacity and ability to transport the same type of cargo. The fleet of 19 Suezmax tankers are \npredominantly employed in the spot market, together with four vessels on longer term time charter agreements, where the two newbuildings delivered in 2022 are \nchartered out on six-year time charter agreements that commenced directly after delivery from the shipyard in May and June 2022 and further two vessels are \nchartered out on agreements expiring in late 2023 with an option to extend the agreement for a year for one of these vessels.  \n \nThe Company’s Fleet  \n \nThe Company’s fleet as of December 31, 2022, consists of 19 Suezmax crude oil tankers of which the vast majority have been built in Korea. \n \n \nF-9 \nTable of Contents \n1.\nNATURE OF BUSINESS \nVessel \n \nBuilt in \nDeadweight  \nTons \nNordic Apollo \n2003 \n159,998 \nNordic Pollux \n2003 \n150,103 \nNordic Castor \n2004 \n150,249 \nNordic Luna \n2004 \n150,037 \nNordic Freedom \n2005 \n159,331 \nNordic Skier \n2005 \n159,089 \nNordic Sprinter \n2005 \n159,089 \nNordic Cross \n2010 \n158,475 \nNordic Light \n2010 \n158,475 \nNordic Vega \n2010 \n163,940 \nNordic Breeze \n2011 \n158,597 \nNordic Zenith \n2011 \n158,645 \nNordic Star \n2016 \n157,738 \nNordic Space \n2017 \n157,582 \nNordic Aquarius \n2018 \n157,338 \nNordic Cygnus \n2018 \n157,526 \nNordic Tellus \n2018 \n157,407 \nNordic Harrier \n2022 \n157,094 \nNordic Hunter \n2022 \n157,037"

      "text": "Basis of Accounting: These consolidated financial statements (“financial statements”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally \naccepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). \n \nPrinciples of Consolidation: Entities in which NAT has controlling financial interest are consolidated. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is \nobtained. The subsidiaries’ accounting policies are in conformity with U.S. GAAP. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in \nconsolidation. \n \nUse of Estimates: Preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported \namounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and \nexpenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The effects of changes in accounting estimates are accounted for in the same \nperiod in which the estimates are changed. \n \nForeign Currency Translation: The functional currency of NAT is the United States (“U.S.”) dollar as substantially all revenues are nominated in U.S. dollars and \nthe majority of the expenditures are incurred and paid in U.S. dollars. Transactions in foreign currencies during the year are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of \nexchange in effect at the date of the transaction. The Company’s subsidiaries NAT Chartering AS, and the European branch of Scandic American Shipping Ltd, have \nNorwegian kroner as their functional currency. All assets and liabilities of those entities are translated into U.S. dollars as of each balance sheet date. Translation \ngains and losses are reflected in shareholders’ equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). \n \nRevenue and Expense Recognition: Revenues and expenses are recognized on an accrual basis. Revenues are generated from spot and time charters. \n \nSpot Charters: For vessels operating on spot charters, voyage revenues are recognized ratably over the estimated length of each voyage, on a load-to-discharge \nbasis and, therefore, are allocated between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each period. Voyage expenses are capitalized between the discharge \nport of the immediately previous cargo, or contract date if later, and the load port of the cargo to be chartered if they qualify as fulfillment costs. Incremental cost to \nobtain a contract is capitalized and amortized ratably over the estimated length of each voyage, calculated on a load-to-discharge basis. The impact of recognizing \nvoyage expenses ratably over the length of each voyage is not materially different on a quarterly and annual basis from a method of recognizing such costs as \nincurred. Expected losses that are deemed probable on voyages are provided for in full at the time such losses can be estimated. A voyage is deemed to commence \nupon loading of cargo and is deemed to end upon the completion of discharge of the same cargo. The Company does not capitalize fulfilment cost or recognize \nrevenue if a charter has not been contractually committed to by a customer. \n \nAs the Company’s performance obligations are services which are received and consumed by our customers as we perform such services, revenues are recognized \nover time proportionate to the days elapsed since the service commencement compared to the total days anticipated to complete the service. Freight is generally \nbilled to the customers after the cargo has been discharged and the performance obligation fulfilled by the Company. The Company is responsible for paying voyage \nexpenses and the charterer is responsible for any delay at the load and discharge ports. Demurrage earned during a spot charter represents a variable consideration. \nThe Company recognizes such revenues in the voyage estimates only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue \nrecognized will not occur. Voyage estimates are reviewed and updated over the duration of the spot charter contract. When the Company’s tankers are operating on \nspot charters the vessels are traded fully at the risk and reward of the Company. The Company considers it appropriate to present the gross amount of earned \nrevenue from the spot charter, showing voyage expenses related to the voyage separately in the Statements of Operations. \n \nF-10 \nTable of Contents \n2.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES"

      "text": "Time Charters: Under a time charter, the charterer pays for the voyage expenses, such as port, canal and fuel costs, while the Company pays for vessel operating \nexpenses, including, among other costs, crew costs, provisions, deck and engine stores, lubricating oil, insurance, maintenance and repairs and costs relating to a \nvessel’s intermediate and special surveys. Revenues from time charter contracts where the Company is a lessor are accounted for as fixed rate operating leases under \nASC 842 Leases and are recognized daily over the term of the charter. Time charter revenues are generally billed to the customers on a monthly basis in advance \nbefore and through the charter period. Time charter agreements with profit-sharing are recognized when the contingency related to it is resolved. The Company has \napplied the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease component and instead to account for those components as a single \ncomponent if the non-lease component otherwise would be accounted for under the new revenue guidance (ASC 606); and both of the following are met: (1) the \ntiming and patterns of transfer of the non-lease component and associated lease are the same; and (2) the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be \nclassified as  an operating lease. The pattern of revenue recognition has not changed as a result of implementation of ASC 842 Leases. \n \nVessel Operating Expenses: Vessel operating expenses include crewing, repair and maintenance, insurance, stores, lubricants, management fee, communication \nexpenses and tonnage tax. These expenses are recognized when incurred. \n \nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash: Cash, cash equivalents and Restricted Cash consist of highly liquid investments such as time deposits with original \nmaturities when acquired of three months or less. Amounts included in restricted cash represent those required to be set aside by a contractual agreement with a \nbanking institution for the payment of future estimated drydocking expenditure related to the vessels used as collateral. \n \nAccounts Receivable, Net: Accounts receivable and other receivables are presented net of allowance for doubtful balances. The Company regularly reviews its \naccounts receivables and estimates the amount of uncollectible receivables each period and provides for an allowance for uncollectable amounts. The assessment of \nthe allowance is based on the age of the unpaid receivables, financial status of the customer and other relevant information. \n \nInventories: Inventories are comprised of bunker fuel and lubrication oil. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) basis. \n \nVessels: Vessels are stated at their historical cost, which consists of the contracted purchase price and any direct expenses incurred upon acquisition (including \nimprovements, on site supervision expenses incurred during the construction period, commissions paid, delivery expenses and other expenditures to prepare the \nvessel for its initial voyage) less accumulated depreciation. Financing costs incurred during the construction period of the vessels are capitalized and included in \nvessels’ cost based on the weighted-average method. Certain subsequent expenditures for conversions and major improvements are capitalized if it is determined that \nthey appreciably extend the life, increase the earning capacity or improve the efficiency or safety of the vessel. Depreciation is calculated based on cost less \nestimated residual value, and is expensed over the estimated useful life of the related assets using the straight-line method. The estimated useful life of a vessel is 25 \nyears from the date the vessel is delivered from the shipyard. Estimated useful life of ballast tank improvements is eight years. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are \nexpensed as incurred. Vessels are classified separately as held for sale as part of current assets in the balance sheet when their carrying amount is expected to be \nrecovered through a sale rather than continued use. For this to be the case, certain criteria should be met including, but not limited to, that the vessel must be \navailable for immediate sale in its present condition, an active program to locate a buyer must be initiated, its sale must be highly probable and the sale should be \nexpected to be completed within one year. Vessels classified as held for sale are stated at their fair value less cost to sell. Fair value is based on broker estimates that \ncould be adjusted if there are actual entity-specific comparable transactions available. \n \nF-11 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "Impairment of Vessels: The Company reviews for impairment long-lived assets held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the \ncarrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Undiscounted future cash flows are estimated on a vessel by vessel basis if events or change in circumstances \nindicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. When applicable, estimates of future undiscounted cash flows are prepared and include assumptions and \nestimates about the vessels’ future performance, with the significant assumptions being related to charter rates, fleet utilization, operating expenses, capital \nexpenditures/periodical maintenance, residual value and the estimated remaining useful life of each vessel. The assumptions used to develop estimates of future \nundiscounted cash flows are based on historical trends as well as future expectations. The estimated net operating cash flows are determined by considering an \nestimated daily time charter equivalent for the remaining operating days of the vessel, net of brokerage commissions, expected outflows for vessels’ maintenance and \nvessel operating expenses (including planned drydocking expenditures). The Company estimates the daily time charter equivalent for the remaining operating days, \nutilizing available market data for spot market rates for the initial two-year period and the most recent fifteen-year historical company-specific average rates for the \nremaining estimated life of the vessel. Useful economic life is assumed to be 25 years from the delivery of the vessel from the shipyard. The Company may apply a \nprobability-weighted approach when estimating undiscounted cash flows if multiple outcomes are reasonably possible, such as vessel sales or to account for \nestimation uncertainty. The long-term residual value used in the impairment test is estimated to be $8.0 million per vessel. If the Company’s estimate of undiscounted \nfuture cash flows for any vessel is lower than the vessel’s carrying value, the carrying value is written down to its fair value, by recording an impairment charge. The \nimpairment loss is determined by the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. Fair value is based on broker estimates that could be \nadjusted if there are actual entity specific comparable transactions available. \n \nDrydocking: The Company’s vessels are required to be drydocked approximately every 30 to 60 months. The Company capitalizes eligible costs incurred during \ndrydocking and amortizes those costs on a straight-line basis from the completion of a drydocking or intermediate survey to the estimated completion of the next \ndrydocking. Drydocking costs include a variety of costs incurred while vessels are placed within drydock, including expenses related to the dock preparation and \nport expenses at the drydock shipyard, general shipyard expenses, expenses related to hull, external surfaces and decks, expenses related to machinery and engines \nof the vessel, as well as expenses related to the testing and correction of findings related to safety equipment on board. The Company includes in capitalized \ndrydocking those costs incurred as part of the drydock to meet classification and regulatory requirements. Expenditures for normal repairs and maintenance \nperformed during drydocking are expensed as incurred. The capitalized and unamortized drydocking costs are included in the book value of the vessels. Amortization \nexpense of the drydocking costs is included in depreciation expense. \n \nLeases: The Company bareboat charters certain vessels under leasing agreements. Sale-leaseback arrangements where the transaction is not considered a sale under \nASC 606 are accounted for as a financing transaction. Consideration received in such sale-leaseback arrangements is recorded as a financial liability. Each lease \npayment is allocated between liability and interest expense to achieve a constant rate on the financial liability outstanding. The interest element is charged as Interest \nExpense over the lease period. The Company has certain office lease contracts resulting in a right-of-use asset and a lease liability and the Company has applied an \nincremental borrowing rate as the discount rate to calculate the respective asset and liability. The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at \ncontract inception. The Company recognizes a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is \ninitially and subsequently measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date. Optional periods are not included in the \ncalculation. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before \nthe lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. For operating leases, the right-of-use asset is subsequently \nmeasured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the lease liability, plus initial direct costs, plus (minus) any prepaid (accrued) lease payments, less the \nunamortized balance of lease incentives received. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n \nF-12 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "Investment Securities: Equity securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. \n \nSegment Information: The Company has identified only one operating segment. The Company has only one type of vessel – Suezmax crude oil tankers. The \nCompany does not provide a geographical analysis because the Company’s business is global in nature and the location of its vessels continually changes. \n \nFair Value of Financial Instruments: The fair values of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities \napproximate carrying value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. \n \nDeferred Financing Costs: Financing costs, including fees, commissions and legal expenses are deferred and amortized over the term of the arrangement, which \napproximates the effective interest method. Incurred fees related to loans not yet drawn are presented as Other non-current Assets. Unamortized deferred financing \ncosts are deducted from the carrying value of the associated financial liability. \n \nShare Based Compensation: \n \nRestricted shares \nThe fair value of restricted shares to employees is estimated based on the market price of the Company’s shares. The fair value of restricted shares granted to \nemployees is measured at grant date and the Company records the compensation expense for such awards over the requisite service period. \n \nStock options \nThe Company grants stock options as incentive-based compensation to certain employees. The Company measures the cost of such awards using the grant date fair \nvalue of the award and recognizes that cost over the requisite service period. \n \nIncome Taxes: The Company is incorporated in Bermuda. Under current Bermuda law, the Company is not subject to corporate income taxes. The statutory applicable \nrate to consolidated corporate earnings is 0%. \n \nTwo of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries are located in Norway and are subject to income tax in that jurisdiction at 22% for the years ended December 31, \n2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of their taxable profit. The income tax expensed for year ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $23,000, $59,000 and $64,000, \nrespectively. Deferred tax assets related to these entities are inconsequential. The Company does not have any unrecognized tax benefits, material accrued interests \nor penalties related to income taxes. \n \nConcentration of Credit Risk: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash \nequivalents and accounts receivable. The Company’s cash is primarily held in major banks and financial institutions and typically insured up to a set amount. \nAccordingly, the Company believes the risk of any potential loss on deposits held in these institutions is remote. Concentrations of credit risk relative to accounts \nreceivable are limited to our client base in the oil and energy industry that may be affected by changes in economic or other external conditions. The Company does \nnot require collateral for its accounts receivable. \n \nFor the years ending December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, one customer accounted for 12.2%, 12.5% and 11.4% of the voyage revenues, \nrespectively. \n \nAccounts receivable, Net, as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, were $20.5 million and $9.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, three charterers \naccounted for 54% of the outstanding accounts receivable, each representing 29.8%, 13.3% and 10.9% of the balance. As of December 31, 2021, three charterers \naccounted for 48% of the outstanding accounts receivable, each representing 22.3%, 13.3% and 12.4% of the balance.

      "text": "Recent Accounting Pronouncements \n \nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (ASC 848) which provides relief for companies preparing for discontinuation of interest rates \nsuch as LIBOR. A contract modification is eligible to apply the optional relief to account for the modifications as a continuation of the existing contracts without \nadditional analysis and consider embedded features to be clearly and closely related to the host contract without reassessment, if all of the following criteria are met: \n(i) contract references a rate that will be discontinued; (ii) modified terms directly replace (or have potential to replace) this reference rate; and (iii) changes to any \nother terms that change (or have potential to change) amount and timing of cash flows must be related to replacement of the reference rate. Relief provided by this \nASU is optional and expires December 31, 2024. \n \nIn January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (ASC 848) to refine the scope of ASC 848 and to clarify some of its guidance. The Company \nhas determined that its primary exposure to LIBOR is in relation to its floating rate borrowing facilities to which it is a party.

The loan is considered \nan accordion loan to the 2019 Senior Secured Credit Facility loan agreement and has the same amortization profile, carries a floating interest rate and matures in \nFebruary 2024. Excess cash flow payments as described above are applied to the balance of the 2019 Senior Secured Credit Facility before being applied to the $30 \nmillion Accordion Loan. The security of the loan is attached to the security of the 2019 Senior Secured Credit Facility and has equal priority, the same financial \ncovenants and repayment clauses. \n \nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had $223.1 million drawn under its 2019 Senior Secured Credit Facility, where $29.5 million, net of deferred financing cost of \n$2.3 million, was presented as Current Portion of Long-Term Debt that included $14.9 million in debt associated with Vessel Held for Sale. \n \nThe Company has repaid $93.9 million of the facility in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the total outstanding balance was \n$129.2 million. The Company has presented $25.8 million, net of deferred financing cost of $1.5 million, under Current Portion of Long-Term Debt. Earnings generated \nin the fourth quarter of 2022 resulted in an additional payment of $15.2 million related to the excess cash flow mechanism that was paid in February 2023. \n \nSubsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company has repaid in total $18.2 million, including the excess cash flow payment of $15.2 million described above, and the \ntotal outstanding balances as of the date of this report is $111.0 million. \n \nThe estimated fair value for the long-term debt is considered to be approximately equal to the carrying value since it carries a variable interest rate. \n \nFinancing of 2018-built Vessels \n \nThe three vessels were delivered in July, August and October 2018, respectively. Under the terms of the financing agreement, the lender has provided financing of \n77.5% of the purchase price for each of the three 2018-built vessels. Upon delivery of each of the vessels, the Company entered into ten-year bareboat charter \nagreements. The Company has obligations to purchase each vessel for $13.6 million upon the completion of the ten-year bareboat charter agreements, and also has \nthe option to purchase the vessels after sixty and eighty-four months. The purchase options have to be declared six months in advance of the sixty or eighty-four \nmonths’ anniversaries for each vessel and the Company has as of the date of this report elected not to exercise any of the options related to the sixty-month \nanniversary. The financing agreements for the three vessels have a total effective interest rate as of December 31, 2022, ranging from 8.08% to 9.86% including a \nfloating LIBOR element that is subject to annual adjustment. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company has agreed a replacement of the LIBOR element with a \nterm Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), plus a Credit Adjustment Spread (“CAS”) of 26 basis points. The Company has incurred $2.3 million in financing \ncost, which is amortized over the term of the financing arrangement and presented net of the outstanding loan balance. The financing agreement contains certain \nfinancial covenants requiring us on a consolidated basis to maintain a minimum value adjusted equity of $175.0 million and ratio of 25%, minimum liquidity of $20.0 \nmillion; and a minimum vessel value to outstanding lease clause. \n \nThe outstanding amounts under this financing arrangement were $96.0 million and $104.3 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, where $8.5 million \nand $8.1 million, net of deferred financing costs, have been presented as Current Portion of Long-Term Debt, respectively. \n \nFinancing of 2022 Newbuildings \n \nIn 2020, the Company announced that it had entered into financing agreements for the two Suezmax newbuildings delivered in 2022. The two vessels, Nordic Harrier \nand Nordic Hunter, were delivered from Samsung shipyard in May and June 2022. Under the terms of the financing agreement, the lender has provided financing of  \n80.0% of the purchase price for each of the two newbuildings.

The financial minimum liquidity covenant of $30.0 million has historically been the most sensitive covenant. As of December 31, 2022, \nthe cash balance of the Company was $59.6 million. \n \nOn a regular basis, the Company performs cash flow projections to evaluate whether it will be in a position to cover the liquidity needs for the next 12-month period \nand the compliance with financial and security ratios under its existing and future financing agreements. In developing estimates of future cash flows, the Company \nmakes assumptions about the vessels’ future performance, market rates, operating expenses, capital expenditure, fleet utilization, general and administrative expenses, \nloan repayments and interest charges. The assumptions applied are based on historical experience and future expectations. \n \nThe Company prepares cash flow projections for different scenarios and a key input factor to the cash flow projections is the estimated freight rates. The Company \napplies an average of several broker estimates in combination with own estimates for the coming 12-months period. Freight rates have strengthened during 2022 with \nhistorically strong rates in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. As such, the Company generates significant positive cash flow from operations that \ncan be used for dividends, investments or repayment of outstanding loan balances. Our 2019 Senior Secured Credit Facility matures in February 2024 and the \nremaining loan balance at maturity will have to be repaid from cash generated from operations in the preceding period, refinanced with a new loan or an extension of \nthe agreed maturity date with the current lenders. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company has repaid $18.2 million on the facility and the loan-to-value ratio for the \n2019 Senior Secured Credit Facility and the fourteen vessels used as collateral for the loan, is below 20%, based on an outstanding balance of $111.0 million as of the \ndate of this report. \n \nThe Suezmax freight rates in the first quarter of 2023 has continued to generate significant positive earnings and the Company expects that additional loan \nrepayments will be made during 2023 due to the excess cash flow mechanism included in the 2019 Senior Secured Credit Facility. \n \nGiven the current conditions of the Suezmax tanker market, which the Company and external market sources expect to continue at least until maturity of the 2019 \nSenior Secured Credit facility and the $30 million Accordion Loan in February 2024 and considering various reasonable sensitivities, the Company expects that it will \nbe able to repay the debt with cash flows from operations.

The Share Premium Fund cannot be distributed without \ncomplying with certain legal procedures designed to protect the creditors of the Company, including public notice to its creditors and a subsequent period for \ncreditor notice of concern, regarding the Company’s intention, following shareholder approval, to transfer such funds to the Company’s Contributed Surplus \nAccount and thereby make such funds available for distribution. \n \nThe Share Premium Fund was $167.1 million and $118. million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Credits and charges to Additional Paid in Capital were a \nresult of the accounting for the Company’s share based compensation programs and issuance of shares. \n \nContributed Surplus Account \n \nThe Company’s Contributed Surplus Account as defined by Bermuda law, consists of amounts previously recorded as share premium, transferred to Contributed \nSurplus Account when resolutions are adopted by the Company’s shareholders to make Share Premium Fund distributable or available for other purposes. As \nindicated by the laws governing the Company, the Contributed Surplus Account can be used for dividend distribution and to cover accumulated losses from its \noperations. \n \nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid a dividend of $22.7 million that was charged to the Contributed Surplus Account. For the year ended \nDecember 31, 2021, the Company paid a dividend of $9.7 million that was charged to the Contributed Surplus Account. The Company’s Contributed Surplus account \nwas $507.1 million and $529.8 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n \nShareholders’ Rights Plan \n \nOn June 16, 2017, the Board of Directors adopted a new shareholders’ rights agreement and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right to purchase \none one-thousandth of a Series A Participating Preferred Share of the Company for each outstanding common share, par value $0.01 per share. The dividend was \npayable on June 26, 2017 to shareholders of record on that date. Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from us one one-thousandth of a Series A \nParticipating Preferred Share of the Company at an exercise price of $30.00, subject to adjustment. The Company can redeem the rights at any time prior to a public \nannouncement that a person or group has acquired ownership of 15% or more of the Company’s common shares. As at December 31, 2022, no shares were issued \npursuant to the plan. \n \nF-22 \nTable of Contents"

      "text": "This shareholders’ rights plan was designed to enable us to protect shareholder interests in the event that an unsolicited attempt is made for a business combination \nwith, or a takeover of, the Company. Our shareholders’ rights plan is not intended to deter offers that the Board determines are in the best interests of our \nshareholders. \n \n \nThe Company may become a party to various legal proceedings generally incidental to its business and is subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control \nlaws and regulations. As is the case with other companies in similar industries, the Company faces exposure from actual or potential claims and legal proceedings. \nAlthough the ultimate disposition of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of the Company’s management that the outcome of any \nclaim which might be pending or threatened, either individually or on a combined basis, will not have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the \nCompany, but could materially affect the Company’s results of operations in a given year. \n \nNo material claims have been filed against the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n \nThe Company’s newbuilding program was completed in 2022 with the delivery of the two Suezmax newbuildings in May and June 2022 from Samsung shipyard in \nSouth Korea and as such, the Company does not have any material commitments outside the ordinary operations of the Company. \n \n \nThe majority of the Company’s transactions, assets and liabilities are denominated in United States dollars, the functional currency of the Company. There is no \nsignificant risk that currency fluctuations will have a material negative effect on the value of the Company’s cash flows. \n \nThe Company categorizes its fair value estimates using a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value for those assets that are recorded on the \nBalance Sheet at fair value. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value as follows: \n \n \nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments and other financial assets. \n \n \nF-23 \nTable of Contents \n13.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \n14.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES \nLevel 1.\nQuoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date. \nLevel 2.\nInputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and \nLevel 3.\nUnobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. \n-\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, is a reasonable estimate of fair value. \n-\nThe estimated fair value for the long-term debt is considered to be approximately equal to the carrying values since it bears spreads and variable interest \nrates which approximate market rates."
