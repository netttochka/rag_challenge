      "text": "PART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOVERVIEW\nThe terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Company,” \"Integra LifeSciences,\" and “Integra” refer to Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation, a Delaware corporation,\nand its subsidiaries, unless the context suggests otherwise.\nIntegra LifeSciences is a global leader in regenerative tissue technologies and neurological solutions dedicated to limiting uncertainty for clinicians so they\ncan focus on providing the best patient care. Founded in 1989 with the acquisition of an engineered collagen technology platform used to repair and\nregenerate tissue, Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol\n“IART.” Integra has developed numerous product lines from this technology for applications ranging from burn and deep tissue wounds to the repair of dura\nmater in the brain, as well as nerves and tendons. The Company has expanded its base regenerative technology business to include surgical instruments,\nneurosurgical products and advanced wound care through global acquisitions and product development to meet the evolving needs of its customers and\nenhance patient care.\nIntegra products are sold in more than 130 countries through a direct sales force as well as distributors and wholesalers. We manufacture and sell medical\ntechnologies and products in two reportable business segments: Codman Specialty Surgical (\"CSS\") and Tissue Technologies (\"TT\"). The CSS segment,\nwhich represents approximately two-thirds of our total revenue, consists of market-leading technologies and instrumentation used for a wide range of\nspecialties, such as neurosurgery, neurocritical care and otolaryngology. We are the world leader in neurosurgery and one of the top three providers in\ninstruments used in precision, specialty, and general surgical procedures. Our TT segment generates about one-third of our overall revenue and focuses on\nthree main areas: complex wound surgery, surgical reconstruction, and peripheral nerve repair.\nWe have key manufacturing and research facilities located in California, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Puerto Rico, Tennessee, Utah,\nFrance, Germany, Ireland and Switzerland. We source most of our handheld surgical instruments and dural sealant products through specialized third-party\nvendors.\nVision\nWe aspire to continue to be a worldwide leader in neurosurgery and reconstructive surgery with a portfolio of leading businesses that delivers outstanding\ncustomer experiences through innovation, execution and teamwork to positively impact the lives of millions of patients and their families.\nStrategy\nIntegra is committed to delivering high quality products that positively impact the lives of millions of patients and their families. We focus on four key pillars\nof our strategy: 1) enabling an execution-focused culture, 2) optimizing relevant scale, 3) advancing innovation and agility, and 4) leading in customer\nexperience. We believe that by sharpening our focus on these areas through improved planning and communication, optimization of our infrastructure, and\nstrategically aligned acquisitions, we can build scale, increase competitiveness and achieve our long-term goals.\nTo this end, the executive leadership team has established the following key priorities aligned to the following areas of focus:\nStrategic Acquisitions. An important part of the our strategy is pursuing strategic transactions and licensing agreements that increase relevant scale in the\nclinical areas in which Integra competes. Our growth strategy includes the acquisition of businesses, assets or products lines to increase the breadth of our\nofferings, the reach of our product portfolios and drive relevant scale to our customers. On December 6, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of\nSurgical Innovation Associates, Inc. (\"SIA\"), which develops, markets and sells DuraSorb®, a resorbable synthetic matrix for plastic and reconstructive\nsurgery. This acquisition will advance Integra’s global strategy in breast reconstruction, expanding plans to access the U.S. market where SIA is pursuing pre-\nmarket approval for use in implant-based breast reconstruction (\"IBBR\"). We also continued to expand our product offering of regenerative technologies from\nour 2021 acquisition of ACell, Inc. (\"ACell\"), an innovative regenerative medicine company specializing in the manufacturing of porcine urinary bladder\nextracellular matrices. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K) for additional details.\nNew Product Introductions and Portfolio Optimization. We are investing in innovative product development to drive a multi-generational pipeline for our key\nproduct franchises. Our product development efforts span across our key global franchises focused on potential technological innovations for significant\nreturns on investment. In addition to new product development, we are funding studies to gather clinical evidence to support launches, ensure market access\nand improve reimbursement for existing products. In addition to acquisitions and organic reinvestment, we continually look to optimize our portfolio towards\nhigher growth and higher margin businesses.\nAs such, we may opportunistically divest businesses or discontinue products where we see limited runway for future value creation in line with our\naspirations due in part to changes in the market, business fundamentals or the regulatory environment.\n4"

      "text": "In August 2022, we completed the sale of our non-core traditional wound care (\"TWC\") business to Gentell, LLC (\"Gentall\") for $28.8 million, which\nconsists of $27.8 million in cash plus $1.0 million in contingent consideration which may be received upon the achievement of certain revenue-based\nperformance milestones. In January 2021, we completed the sale of our Extremity Orthopedics business to Smith & Nephew USD Limited (\"Smith &\nNephew\"), a subsidiary of Smith & Nephew plc, for approximately $240 million in cash. Our portfolio optimization actions over the past two years have\nallowed us to increase our focus on Integra’s core portfolio of market-leading products in neurosurgery, surgical instrumentation and regenerative tissue and\nmoves us closer to achieving our long-term organic growth and profitability targets. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements (Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for additional details.\nCommercial Channel Investments. Investing in our sales channels is a core part of our strategy to create specialization and greater focus on reaching new and\nexisting customers and addressing their needs. To support our commercial efforts in Tissue Technologies, we utilize a two-tier specialist model to increase our\npresence in focused segments to help serve the evolving needs of our customers. In addition, we continue to build upon our leadership brands across our\nproduct franchises in both CSS and TT to engage customers through enterprise-wide contracts with leading hospitals, integrated delivery networks and global\npurchasing organizations in the United States. Internationally, we have increased our commercial resources significantly in key emerging markets and are\nmaking investments to support our sales organization and maximize our commercial opportunities. Domestically, we have also increased our TT sales force in\nthe United States to support the expanded regenerative tissue product portfolio that includes ACell products. These investments in our international and\ndomestic sales channel position us well for expansion and long-term growth.\nCustomer Experience. We aspire to be ranked as a best-in-class provider and are committed to strengthening our relationships with all customers. We continue\nto invest in technologies, systems and processes to enhance the customer experience. In 2022, we outsourced certain transactional back-office finance and\ncustomer service activities to enhance customer quality, build scale for future growth, and capture cost efficiencies. We also launched digital tools and\nprograms, resources and virtual product training to drive continued customer familiarity with our growing portfolio of medical technologies globally. .\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nIntegra currently manufactures and sells our products and technologies in the following two global reportable business segments: Codman Specialty Surgical\nand Tissue Technologies. We include financial information regarding our reportable business segments and certain geographic information under \"Item 7.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 16, Segment and Geographic Information to the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements (Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nCodman Specialty Surgical\nThe Codman Specialty Surgical business consists of a broad portfolio of market-leading brands, such as Codman , DuraGen , DuraSeal , CUSA ,\nMayfield ,Bactiseal , and Certas\nPlus,which are used for the management of multiple disease states, including brain tumors, traumatic brain injury,\nhydrocephalus and other neurological conditions. The growth in this business in the recent years has been fueled by geographic expansion and new product\nregistrations in markets, such as China, Japan, and Europe, which we expect to continue in the near-to-long term.\nIn 2022, we made progress to several enhancements to our CUSA Clarity Tissue Ablation System. The extended laparoscopic tip was launched in the U.S. to\nenhance laparoscopic liver procedures. In addition, a single-sided bone tip received 510(k) clearance. Commercial launch is expected in the first quarter of\n2023. We continue to update our CUSA Clarity platform by incorporating new ultrasonic handpiece and integrated electrosurgical capabilities.\nMoreover, we are expanding into minimally invasive surgery (\"MIS\") and the surgical management of intracerebral hemorrhages (\"ICH\"), with the 2021\nclinical launch of Aurora  Surgiscope , a proprietary surgical solution with integrated visualization and capabilities designed specifically for use in deep-\nseated brain lesions. We continue to gather clinical evidence using this same technology for early surgical intervention of ICH. We believe this technology\noffers the promise of transforming the standard of care in neurosurgery. In 2022, we launched the Aurora  Evacuator with Coagulation device in the U.S.,\ndesigned to be used in conjunction with our Aurora Surgiscope to safely address and evacuate blood in the brain caused by hemorrhagic stroke. \nRounding out the portfolio is a catalog of surgical headlamps and surgical instrumentation, as well as after-market service. With thousands of surgical\ninstrument products, including specialty surgical instruments, we call on the central sterile processing unit of hospitals and acute care surgical centers.\nAdditionally, through a strong U.S. distribution model, we serve the needs of hundreds of medical offices.\nWe also expanded our product offerings in 2021 with the launch of our new intracranial pressure (\"ICP\") monitoring system, CereLink  in the U.S. and\nEurope and continued the global rollout in the first half of 2022. See additional discussion regarding certain matters with CereLink under \"Item 1A.

      "text": "and under \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - General - FDA Matters\" of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\nOur global commercial network includes clinical specialists, a large direct global sales force and strategic partnerships and distributors that serve hospitals,\nintegrated health networks, group purchasing organizations, clinicians, surgery centers and health care providers.\nTissue Technologies\nThe Tissue Technologies segment consists of five unique regenerative technology areas - highly engineered bovine collagen, bovine dermis, porcine urinary\nbladder, human amniotic tissue, and resorbable synthetic mesh. This broad regenerative platform, which includes multiple leading brands such as Integra\nDermal Matrices, AmnioExcel , SurgiMend , MicroMatrix  and NeuraGen , primarily addresses the needs of plastic, reconstructive and general surgeons\nfocused on the treatment of acute wounds, such as burns, chronic wounds, including diabetic foot ulcers, and surgical tissue repair, such as hernia, tendon,\nperipheral nerve repair and protection. During 2022, we completed the acquisition of Surgical Innovation Associates, Inc. (\"SIA\"), which is seeking approval\nby the U.S Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") of the PMA application for its core technology, DuraSorb, for use in IBBR.\nWe have a specialized sales organization composed of directly employed sales representatives, as well as specialty distributors, organized based upon their\ncall point. Our wound reconstruction sales representatives call on surgeons doing procedures in limb salvage, trauma, wound reconstruction and burns,\nchronic wounds primarily in the inpatient wound care clinic setting. We also have a dedicated surgical reconstruction sales team focused on plastic and\nreconstructive surgery and hernia procedures with differentiated products. Finally, we have a distributor network focused on biologics. Outside the U.S., we\nhave a combination of direct and indirect sales channels in international markets to sell certain product lines.\nThis business segment also includes private-label sales of a broad set of our regenerative and wound care technologies. Our customers are other medical\ntechnology companies that sell to end markets primarily in spine, surgical and wound care.\nWe anticipate new product introductions and new clinical indications will continue to contribute to the growth of the segment. In 2022, we launched\nNeuraGen  3D Nerve Guide Matrix, a resorbable implant for repair of peripheral nerve discontinuities and engineered to create an optimized environment for\nnerve regeneration. In the third quarter of 2021, we filed the PMA application for a specific indication for SurgiMend in the use of post-mastectomy breast\nreconstruction, for which we hope to obtain FDA approval in 2024.\nCOMPETITION\nOur competitors for CSS are Medtronic, Inc., Stryker Corporation, Becton Dickinson and Company, and B. Braun Medical, Inc. In addition, we compete with\nmany smaller specialized companies and larger companies that do not otherwise focus on the offerings of Codman Specialty Surgical technologies. We rely\non the depth and breadth of our sales and marketing organization, our innovative technologies, and our procurement and manufacturing operations to maintain\nour competitive position.\nOur competition for TT includes Smith & Nephew plc, Organogenesis Holdings Inc., MiMedx Group, Inc., Allergan PLC, Becton Dickinson and Company,\nand Axogen, Inc. We compete with many additional companies who partially participate in soft tissue reconstruction of complex wounds, peripheral nerve\nrepair and surgical reconstruction. In addition, our products also compete against medical practices that treat a condition without using a medical device or\nany particular product, such as medical practices that utilize autograft tissue instead of our dermal regeneration products, duraplasty products and nerve repair\nproducts. Depending on the product line, we compete based on our products' features, strength of our sales force or distributors, sophistication of our\ntechnology and cost effectiveness of our solution.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY\nOur research and development activities focus on identifying unmet surgical needs and addressing those needs with innovative solutions and products. We\napply our core competency in regenerative technology to innovate products for neurosurgical, wound applications, plastic surgery, and reconstructive surgery\nand we have extensive R&D development programs for our core platforms of electromechanical technologies. Additionally, we conduct products and clinical\nstudies to generate efficacy and health economic evidence.\nRegenerative Technologies. Integra was the first company to receive a FDA claim for regeneration of dermal tissue and is a world leader in regenerative\ntechnology. Because regenerative technology products represent a fast-growing, high-margin opportunity for us, we allocate a large portion of our research\nand development budget to these projects. Our regenerative technology development program applies our expertise in bioengineering to a range of\nbiomaterials including natural materials such as purified collagen, intact human or animal tissues, honey as well as resorbable synthetic polymers with our\nDuraSorb and DuraSeal product lines. These unique product designs are used for neurosurgical and reconstructive surgical applications, as well as dermal\nregeneration, including the healing of chronic and acute wounds, tendon and nerve repair.

As\nsurgeons look for ways to efficiently and effectively repair and close wounds, IBWM helps address the efficiency needed in operating rooms by reducing both\nthe operating time and costs to hospitals and patients. In 2021, we completed one of the largest diabetic foot ulcers (\"DFU\"), randomized controlled trials of\nthe PriMatrix  Dermal Repair Scaffold for the management of DFU. This multi-center study enrolled more than 225 patients with chronic DFU's over the\ncourse of 12-week treatments and 4-week follow-up phases. The results of this study, which was published in the Journal of Wound Care, demonstrated that\nPriMatrix plus standard of care (\"SOC\") consisting of sharp debridement, infection elimination, use of dressings and offloading was significantly more likely\nto achieve complete wound closure compared with SOC alone, with a median number of one application of the product. Integra is currently pursuing pre-\nmarket approval for implant-based breast reconstruction with our Surgimend product. In 2022, we acquired SIA, which is also pursuing a pre-market approval\nfor IBBR. By offering two distinct product solutions, we believe we have the opportunity to build a leading position in the market. We completed design\ncontrol activities in 2022 for a Q1 2023 launch of Cytal and MicroMatrix in Europe and a pilot launch of the Cardion Pericardial Patch to gain clinical\nexperience for finding a private label partner for that product.\nElectromechanical Technologies and Instrumentation. Because our electromechanical products and instruments address significant needs in surgical\nprocedures and limit uncertainty for surgeons, we continue to invest in approvals for new indications and next generation improvements to our market-leading\nproducts. We have several active programs focused on life cycle management and innovation for capital and disposable products in our portfolio. Our product\ndevelopment efforts are focused on core clinical applications in cerebrospinal fluid (\"CSF\") management, neuro-critical care monitoring, minimally invasive\ninstruments and electrosurgery and ultrasonic medical technologies, as well as our ambition to transform the standard of care in neurosurgery with product\nadvancements in MIS and ICH. Our lighting franchise is among the most dynamic in the industry.\nWe are focused on the development of core clinical applications in our electromechanical technologies portfolio. In 2022, we made progress to several\nenhancements to our CUSA Clarity Tissue Ablation System. The extended laparoscopic tip was launched in the U.S. to enhance laparoscopic liver\nprocedures. In addition, a single-sided bone tip received 510(k) approval. Commercial launch is expected in the first quarter of 2023. We continue to update\nour CUSA Clarity platform by incorporating new ultrasonic handpiece and integrated electrosurgical capabilities. We continue to work with several\ninstrument partners to bring new surgical instrument platforms to the market.\nWe are focused on the development of core clinical applications in our electromechanical technologies portfolio. In June 2022, we launched the Neutus  EVD\nsystem, our first external ventricular drain (“EVD\") in China. The Neutus EVD system is manufactured in China by Shanghai Haoju Medical Technology Co.,\nLtd. under an exclusive distribution arrangement. The device is used in the management of cerebrospinal fluid and is highly complementary to our Bactiseal\ncatheter and advanced intercranial pressure monitoring products.\nIn the third quarter of 2021, we launched our CereLink ICP Monitor System in the U.S. and Europe and continued the global rollout in the first half of 2022.\nOn August 18, 2022, the Company, after consultation with the FDA and other regulatory authorities outside of the United States, initiated an immediate\nvoluntary global product removal of all CereLink  intracranial pressure monitors. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, under the heading Risks Related to our\nRegulatory Environment and under Item 7. General Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - FDA Matters\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nIn 2022, we continued to advance the early-stage technology platforms we acquired in 2019. Through the acquisition of Arkis Biosciences, Inc. (\"Arkis\") we\nadded a platform technology, CerebroFlo  external ventricular drainage (\"EVD\"), catheter with Endexo  technology, a permanent additive designed to reduce\nthe potential for catheter obstruction due to thrombus formation. The CerebroFlo EVD Catheter has demonstrated an average of 99% less thrombus\naccumulation onto its surface, in vitro, compared to a market leading EVD catheter. Our work to combine our bactiseal antimicrobial technology with the\nEndexo anti-occlusive technology obtained through our 2019 acquisition of Arkis continues to progress for both a silicone-based hydrocephalus and EVD\nproject.\nIn 2019, we also acquired Rebound Therapeutics Corporation (\"Rebound Therapeutics\"), a company that specialized in single-use medical device, known as\nAurora Surgiscope, which is the only tubular retractor system designed for cranial surgery with an integrated access channel, camera and lighting. In the third\nquarter of 2021, we conducted a limited clinical launch of the Aurora Surgiscope for use in minimally invasive neurosurgery as well as initiated a registry\ncalled MIRROR to collect data on early surgical intervention using this same technology platform for the treatment of ICH.

For reasons of quality assurance, availability, or cost\neffectiveness, certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. Our practice is to maintain sufficient inventory of components so\nthat our production will not be significantly disrupted even if a particular component or material is not available for a period of time.\nCertain of our products, including but not limited to our dermal regeneration products, duraplasty products, wound care products, and nerve and tendon repair\nproducts, contain material derived from bovine tissue. We take great care to provide products that are safe and free of agents that can cause disease. In\nparticular, the collagen used in the products that we manufacture is derived from the deep flexor tendon of cattle less than 24 months old from New Zealand, a\ncountry that has never had a reported case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (\"BSE\") (otherwise known as mad cow disease), from the U.S. or from fetal\nbovine dermis. The World Health Organization classifies different types of cattle tissue for relative risk of BSE transmission. Deep flexor tendon and fetal\nbovine skin are in the lowest-risk category for BSE transmission, and therefore considered to have a negligible risk of containing the agent that causes BSE.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe seek patent and trademark protection for our key technology, products and product improvements, both in the U.S. and in selected foreign countries.\nWhen determined appropriate, we have enforced and plan to continue to enforce and defend our patent and trademark rights. In general, however, we do not\nrely solely on our patent and trademark estate to provide us with any significant competitive advantages as it relates to our existing product lines. We also rely\nupon trade secrets and continuing technological innovations to develop and maintain our competitive position.

The main exceptions to this\npattern occur because of material acquisitions as well as impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION AND COMPLIANCE\nWe are a manufacturer and marketer of medical devices and Human Tissue and Cell Based Products (\"HCT/Ps\") and therefore are subject to extensive\nregulation by the FDA, the Center for Medicare Services of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, other federal governmental agencies and, in\nsome jurisdictions, by state and foreign governmental authorities. These regulations govern the introduction of new medical devices and HCT/Ps, the\nobservance of certain standards with respect to the design, manufacture, testing, labeling, promotion and sales of the products, the maintenance of certain\nrecords, the ability to track devices, the reporting of potential product defects, the import and export of products, and other matters.\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n® \n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®,\n®,\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®,\n®\n®\n®\n®,\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®, \n®\n®\n®\n®,\n®\ny®\n®\n®,\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®\n®,\n®\n8"

      "text": "United States Food and Drug Administration\nOur products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety, efficacy and adherence to FDA Quality System Regulation, and related\nmanufacturing standards. Medical device products are subject to rigorous FDA and other governmental agency regulations in the United States and similar\nregulations of foreign agencies abroad. The FDA regulates the design, development, research, preclinical and clinical testing, introduction, manufacture,\nadvertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution, import and export, and record keeping for such products, in order to ensure that medical products\ndistributed in the United States are safe and effective for their intended use. In addition, the FDA is authorized to establish special controls to provide\nreasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions, fines, civil\nand administrative penalties, injunctions, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the\ngovernment to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts, and criminal prosecution. The regulatory process for obtaining\nproduct approvals and clearances can be onerous and costly. The FDA requires, as a condition to marketing a medical device in the U.S., that we secure a\nPremarket Notification clearance pursuant to Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the \"FD&C Act\"), or an approved PMA application\n(or supplemental PMA application). Obtaining these approvals and clearances can take up to several years and may involve preclinical studies and clinical\ntrials. The FDA also may require a post-approval clinical study as a condition of approval. To perform clinical trials for significant risk devices in the U.S. on\nan unapproved product, we are required to obtain an Investigational Device Exemption from the FDA. The FDA also may require a filing for approval prior to\nmarketing products that are modifications of existing products or new indications for existing products. Moreover, after clearance/approval is given, if the\nproduct is shown to be hazardous or defective, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies have the power to withdraw the clearance or approval, as the case\nmay be, or require us to change the device, its manufacturing process or its labeling, to supply additional proof of its safety and effectiveness or to recall,\nrepair, replace or refund the cost of the medical device. Because we currently export medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that have not been approved by\nthe FDA for distribution in the U.S., we are required to obtain approval/registration in the country to which we are exporting and maintain certain records\nrelating to exports and make these available to the FDA for inspection, if required.\nHuman Cells, Tissues and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products\nIntegra, through its wholly-owned subsidiary BioD LLC (\"BioD\"), is involved with the recovery, processing, storage, transportation and distribution of\ndonated amniotic tissue. The FDA has specific regulations governing HCT/Ps. An HCT/P is a product containing, or consisting of, human cells or tissue\nintended for transplantation into a human patient. Examples of HCT/Ps include bone, ligament, skin and cornea.\nSome HCT/Ps fall within the definition of a biological product, medical device or drug regulated under the FD&C Act. These biologic, device or drug\nHCT/Ps must comply both with the requirements exclusively applicable to HCT/Ps and, in addition, with requirements applicable to biologics, devices or\ndrugs, including premarket clearance or approval from the FDA.\nSection 361 of the Public Health Service Act (\"Section 361\") authorizes the FDA to issue regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of\ncommunicable disease. HCT/Ps regulated as “361” HCT/Ps are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the FDA,\nscreening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, and Good Tissue Practices when processing, storing, labeling, and distributing HCT/Ps, including required\nlabeling information, stringent record keeping, and adverse event reporting.\nThe American Association of Tissue Banks (\"AATB\") has issued operating standards for tissue banking. Compliance with these standards is a requirement in\norder to become an AATB-accredited tissue establishment. In addition, some states have their own tissue banking regulations. We are licensed or have permits\nfor tissue banking in California, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Oregon, and Tennessee. In Tennessee, we are registered with the FDA Center for\nBiological Evaluations and Research.\nProcurement of certain human organs and tissue for transplantation is subject to the restrictions of the National Organ Transplant Act, which prohibits the\ntransfer of certain human organs, including skin and related tissue for valuable consideration, but permits the reasonable payment associated with the removal,\ntransportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control and storage of human tissue and skin. BioD is a registered Tissue Bank and is involved\nwith the recovery, storage and transportation of donated human amniotic tissue.\nOn June 22, 2015, the FDA issued an Untitled Letter (the \"Untitled Letter\") alleging that BioD's morselized amniotic membrane tissue-based products do not\nmeet the criteria for regulation as HCT/Ps solely under Section 361 and that, as a result, BioD would need a biologics license to lawfully market those\nmorselized products. Since the issuance of the Untitled Letter, BioD and the Company has made known to the FDA their disagreement with the FDA’s\nassertion that certain products are more than minimally manipulated. The FDA has not changed its position that certain of the BioD acquired products are not\neligible for marketing solely under Section 361. In July 2020, the FDA issued the final guidance document related to human tissue titled, “Regulatory\nConsiderations for Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use” (the “2020 HCT/P Final\nGuidance”). The 2020 HCT/P Final Guidance document supersedes the November 2017 guidance by the same title.\n9"

      "text": "The HCT/P Final Guidance maintains the FDA’s position that products such as the Company’s morselized amniotic membrane tissue-based products do not\nmeet the criteria for regulation solely as HCT/Ps. In addition, in the November 2017 guidance, the FDA articulated a risk-based approach to enforcement and,\nwhile some uses for amniotic membrane tissue-based products would have as much as thirty-six months of enforcement discretion, other high risk uses could\nbe subject to immediate enforcement action. The 2020 HCT/P Final Guidance maintained this approach and extended the discretionary enforcement period to\nMay 31, 2021.\nConsidering the risk of enforcement action, the Company discontinued the manufacturing of all morselized amniotic membrane tissue-based products prior to\nMay 31, 2021. We no longer distribute these products. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not received any further notice of enforcement action from\nthe FDA regarding its morselized amniotic membrane tissue-based products.\nMedical Device Regulations\nUnless an exemption applies, the FDA requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical\ndevice obtain either a Section 510(k) premarket notification clearance or a PMA, before introducing it into the U.S. market. The type of marketing\nauthorization is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on\nthe degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and\neffectiveness.\nThe process of obtaining a Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data, which in some cases can be\nextensive, to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the\nFDA to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre-1976 device, a predecessor device is referred to as “predicate device.” As a result, FDA clearance\nrequirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time. In addition, in some cases, the FDA may require additional review by an\nadvisory panel, which can further lengthen the process. The PMA process, which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any\npredicate device and for high-risk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life, may take several years and requires the submission of\nextensive performance and clinical information.\nMedical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific\nintended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of\nmanufacture or intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and payment of an FDA user fee. The determination as to whether or not\na modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the\nFDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing\nand recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or\npenalties.\nWe also are required to register with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and any devices we manufacture and distribute pursuant to clearance or\napproval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. These include product listing and\nestablishment registration requirements, which help facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory actions, and our manufacturing sites are subject to\nperiodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulations. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and\nmaintain our documents in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing and control activities. Further, we are required to comply with\nvarious FDA requirements and other legal requirements for labeling and promotion. If the FDA believes that a company is not in compliance with applicable\nregulations, it may issue a warning letter, institute proceedings to detain or seize products, issue a recall order, impose operating restrictions, enjoin future\nviolations and assess civil penalties against that company, its officers or its employees and may recommend criminal prosecution to the U.S. Department of\nJustice. All Integra manufacturing facilities participate in the Medical Device Single Audit Program and are audited annually for compliance with the Quality\nSystem for US FDA, Canada, Australia, Brazil, and Japan.\nMedical device regulations also are in effect in many of the countries in which we do business outside the U.S. In the European Economic Area (\"EEA\"),\nwhich is comprised of the 27 member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medical devices need to comply with specific\nrequirements. These requirements were previously known as \"Essential Requirements\" under the former EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive\n93/42/EEC, or MDD) and are now defined \"General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR)\" under the new EU Medical Devices Regulation\n(Regulation (EU) 2017/745, or \"EU MDR\"). Although the requirements set forth in the EU MDR are generally consistent with those laid out in the MDD\n(with a few exceptions), the EU MDR is intended, among other things, to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework\nacross the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. These laws range from comprehensive medical\ndevice approval and Quality System requirements for some or all of our medical device products to simpler requests for product data or certifications. Under\nthe European Union Medical Device Directive, medical devices must meet the Medical Device Directive standards and receive\n10"

Although we continue to transition our certification profile to meet the new EU MDR requirements,\nthese stricter regulations set forth in the EU MDR may pose additional challenges for Integra to continue marketing products in the EU as these regulations\ncome into force. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are subject to stringent domestic and foreign medical device regulations and oversight and any adverse\naction may adversely affect our ability to compete in the marketplace and our financial condition and business operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-\nK.\nCE Mark Certification requires a comprehensive quality system program, technical documentation, clinical evaluation and data on the product which are then\nreviewed, by a Notified Body. A Notified Body is an organization designated by the national governments of the EU member states to make independent\njudgments about whether a product complies with the requirements established by each CE marking directive. The Medical Device Directive, Medical Device\nRegulation, ISO 9000 series and ISO 13485 are recognized international quality standards that are designed to ensure that we develop and manufacture\nquality medical devices. Other countries are also instituting regulations regarding medical devices or interpreting and enforcing existing regulations more\nstrictly. Compliance with these regulations requires extensive documentation and clinical reports for our products, revisions to labeling, and other\nrequirements such as facility inspections to comply with the registration requirements. A recognized Notified Body audits our facilities annually to verify our\ncompliance with the ISO 13485 Quality System standard.\nCertain countries, as well as the EU, have issued regulations that govern products that contain materials derived from animal sources. Regulatory authorities\nare particularly concerned with materials infected with the agent that causes BSE. These regulations affect our dermal regeneration products, duraplasty\nproducts, hernia repair products, biomaterial products for the spine, nerve and tendon repair products and certain other products, all of which contain material\nderived from bovine tissue. Although we take great care to provide that our products are safe and free of agents that can cause disease, products that contain\nmaterials derived from animals, including our products, may become subject to additional regulation, or even be banned in certain countries, because of\nconcern over the potential for prion transmission. Significant new regulations, a ban of our products, or a movement away from bovine-derived products\nbecause of an outbreak of BSE could have a material, adverse effect on our current business or our ability to expand our business. See “Item 1A. Risk\nFactors – Risks Related to our Regulatory Environment\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPostmarket Requirements. After a device is cleared or approved for commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include the FDA\nQuality System Regulations which cover the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging,\nsterilization, storage and shipping of medical devices; the FDA's general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or 'off-label' uses; the\nMedical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or\nserious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and the Reports of Corrections\nand Removals regulation, which require manufacturers to report recalls and field corrective actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by\nthe device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act. Postmarket requirements are also followed globally where our products are registered and approved.\nThese foreign jurisdictions have similar requirements to the FDA which include reporting requirements such as adverse events and recalls.\nOther regulations\nAnti-Bribery Laws. In the U.S., we are subject to laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician\nself-referral laws that regulate the means by which companies in the health care industry may market their products to hospitals and health care professionals\nand may compete by discounting the prices of their products. Similar anti-bribery laws exist in many of the countries in which we sell our products outside the\nU.S., as well as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (which addresses the activities of U.S. companies in foreign markets). Our products also are\nsubject to regulation regarding reimbursement, and U.S. healthcare laws apply when a customer submits a claim for a product that is reimbursed under a\nfederally funded healthcare program. These global laws require that we exercise care in designing our sales and marketing practices, including interactions\nwith healthcare professionals, and customer discount arrangements. See “Item  1A. Risk Factors – We are exposed to a variety of risks relating to our\ninternational sales and operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nImport-export. Our international operations subject us to laws regarding sanctioned countries, entities and persons, customs, and import-export. Among other\nthings, these laws restrict, and in some cases can prevent, U.S. companies from directly or indirectly selling goods, technology or services to people or entities\nin certain countries. In addition, these laws require that we exercise care in our business dealings with entities in and from foreign countries.\nHazardous materials. Our research, development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials. We are subject to\ncountry-specific, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and certain\nwaste products. We believe that our environmental, health and safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards\nprescribed by the controlling laws and regulations. However, risk of accidental releases or injury from these materials is possible. These risks are managed to\nminimize or eliminate associated business impacts. In the event of this type of accident, we could be held liable for damages\n11"

We could be subject to a regulatory shutdown of a facility that could prevent the distribution and sale of\nproducts manufactured there for a significant period of time, and we could suffer a casualty loss that could require a shutdown of the facility in order to repair\nit, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business. Although we continuously strive to maintain full compliance with respect to all\napplicable global environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could incur substantial costs to fully comply with future laws and regulations, and\nour operations, business or assets may be negatively affected. Furthermore, global environmental, health and safety compliance is an ongoing process. Integra\nhas compliance procedures in place for compliance with Employee Health & Safety laws, driven by a centrally led organizational structure that ensures proper\nimplementation, which is essential to our overall business objectives.\nIn addition to the above regulations, we are, and may be, subject to regulation under country-specific federal and state laws, including, but not limited to,\nrequirements regarding record keeping, and the maintenance of personal information, including personal health information. As a public Company, we are\nsubject to the securities laws and regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We also are subject to other present and could be subject to possible\nfuture, local, state, federal and foreign regulations.\nThird-Party Reimbursement. Healthcare providers that purchase medical devices generally rely on third-party payors, including, in the U.S., the Medicare and\nMedicaid programs and private payors, such as indemnity insurers, employer group health insurance programs and managed care plans, to reimburse all or\npart of the cost of the products. As a result, demand for our products is and will continue to be dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies\nof these payors. The manner in which reimbursement is sought and obtained varies based upon the type of payor involved and the setting in which the product\nis furnished and utilized. Reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors may be subject to periodic adjustments as a result of\nlegislative, regulatory and policy changes, as well as budgetary pressures. Possible reductions in, or eliminations of, coverage or reimbursement by third-party\npayors, or denial of, or provision of uneconomical reimbursement for new products may affect our customers' revenue and ability to purchase our products.\nAny changes in the healthcare regulatory, payment or enforcement landscape relative to our customers' healthcare services have the potential to significantly\naffect our operations and revenue.\nData Privacy and Cybersecurity Laws and Regulations. As a business with a significant global footprint, compliance with evolving regulations and standards\nin data privacy and cybersecurity (relating to the confidentiality and security of our information technology systems, products such as medical devices, and\nother services provided by us) may result in increased costs, lower revenue, new complexities in compliance, new challenges for competition, and the threat\nof increased regulatory enforcement activity. Our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including\npersonal information, financial information, intellectual property, and other sensitive information related to our customers and workforce.\nFor example, in the U.S., the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of certain personal information and the security of\nmedical devices are regulated at the U.S. federal and state, and industry levels. U.S. federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health\ninformation, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by health care providers. For example, in the\nU.S. we are obligated to comply with the requirements of the Health Insurance and Portability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information\nTechnology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (collectively, “HIPPA”). Under HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services has issued\nregulations, including the HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Rules, to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or\ndisclosed by covered entities including health care providers and their business associates, as well as covered subcontractors. HIPAA also regulates\nstandardization of data content, codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. Penalties\nfor violations of HIPAA regulations include significant civil and criminal penalties for each violation. In addition, the FDA has issued guidance advising\nmanufacturers to take cybersecurity risks into account in product design for connected medical devices and systems, to assure that appropriate safeguards are\nin place to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or modification to medical devices that contain software and reduce the risk of introducing threats into\nhospital systems that are connected to such devices. The FDA also issued guidance on post market management of cyber security in medical devices.\nOutside the U.S., we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international, national and regional level, and on an industry specific\nbasis. Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, handling and transfer of personal data and, potentially, intellectual property\ncontinue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes. In Europe, for example, we are subject to EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\")\nwhich requires member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection, use and transfer of personal data and includes, among other things, a\nrequirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance.\nThe GDPR also requires companies processing personal data of individuals residing in the EU to comply with EU privacy and data protection rules.\n12"

These\nprograms are paid for directly by Integra.\nEmployee Health and Safety:\nIntegra is committed to providing a safe environment for all employees and visitors. We rely on our environmental, health and safety management systems as\nwell as entrusting our managers to oversee and ensure health and safety at their respective sites and foster a workplace culture to achieve that end. We\nimplement our approach globally by our systems and support at regional and country levels from colleagues that implement proper safety protocols, identify\nand correct hazards, and remain safety conscious at all times. Managers are expected to enforce health and safety regulations, including compliance with\napplicable federal, state and local laws. Our Environmental Health and Safety (\"EH&S\") organizational structure incorporates both workplace EH&S\ncoordinators and compliance teams. We have developed an Incident Procedure Policy and General Safety Rules that guide our colleagues to improve our\nworkplace environment, improve safety, and reduce risk and costs.\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have placed a high priority on employee health, providing resources to support our workforce. At the outset of the\npandemic, we sought to protect the health and safety of our employees unable to work remotely, including those in research and development, quality,\nmanufacturing, distribution and sales roles. Such measures included the institution of robust hygiene practices, distribution of personal protective equipment,\nand the adoption of increased sanitation and social distancing protocols. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants and\nrespond based on guidance from U.S. and global health organizations, relevant governmental guidance, and evolving practices.\nEmployee Engagement & Wellbeing\nWe regularly seek employee feedback and sentiment about our workplace through global engagement surveys conducted on a bi-annual basis. After each\nsurvey is complete, we share detailed results with senior management and all employees within each department. Each function or division appoints survey\nadministrators who work with their respective teams to understand the feedback and establish action items. We believe this process enables us to monitor\nemployee engagement and create a continuously improving, satisfying work environment for our employees.\nWe are committed to improving the quality of life of our employees and their families. Our health and wellbeing programs differ by country and typical\nbenefits include comprehensive health insurance, disability coverage, workplace accommodations, parental leave and other leaves of absence based on health\nor life events (e.g., bereavement), employee assistance programs, fitness reimbursement, and flu shots. We also provide on-demand health advocates to help\nemployees navigate the health insurance system, access to digital health solutions, a weight management program, smoking cessation assistance, a substance\nuse disorder helpline, a diabetes health program and other similar programs to drive healthy behaviors and awareness.\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS\nFinancial information about our geographical areas is set forth in our financial statements Note 16, Segment and Geographic Information, to the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements (Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nWe are subject to the informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act\").

RISK FACTORS\nGLOBAL CHALLENGES AND MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS\nThe continuing worldwide macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty may adversely affect our business and prospects.\nGlobal economic disruptions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have continued to impact the global supply chain, primarily through constraints on raw\nmaterials and electronic components. Additionally, we have observed a reduction in both inbound and outbound transportation capacity as a result of port\nclosures and delays associated with the pandemic, which is causing longer lead times in receiving raw materials, as well as increased freight costs. These\nhighly competitive and constrained supply chain conditions are increasing our cost of sales, which has and may continue to adversely impact our profitability.\nGiven the ongoing uncertainty regarding the duration and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are uncertain as to the duration and extent of constraint on\nour supply chain and are unable to predict the extent to which it will affect our global operations.\nContinued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long-term and wide-spread recession and geopolitical issues, including the war in Ukraine, have\ncontributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for economic growth in the world. Our business and results of operations have been\nand may continue to be adversely impacted by changes in macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates and the accessibility of capital\nmarkets. Uncertainty about global economic conditions may also cause decreased demand for our products and services and increased competition, which\ncould result in lower sales volume and downward pressure on the prices for our products, longer sales cycles, and slower adoption of new technologies. A\nweakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers, which could result in interruptions in supply.\nMarket acceptance of our medical products in the U.S. and other countries is dependent upon the medical equipment purchasing and procurement practices of\nour customers, patient need for our products and procedures and the reimbursement of patients' medical expenses by government healthcare programs and\nthird-party payors. The continuing uncertainty surrounding global economic conditions and financial markets may cause the purchasers of medical equipment\nto decrease their procurement activities. Economic uncertainty, an increase in unemployment rates, as well as increasing health insurance premiums, co-\npayments and deductibles may adversely affect demand for our products and procedures. Furthermore, governments and other third-party payors around the\nworld facing tightening budgets could move to further reduce the reimbursement rates or the scope of coverage offered, which could adversely affect sales of\nour products.\nPublic health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and could in the future have, a negative effect on our business.\n17"

      "text": "Our global operations and interactions with healthcare systems, providers and patients around the world expose us to risks associated with public health\ncrises, including epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause significant volatility and uncertainty\nin the global and regional economies, leading to changes in consumer and business behavior, market fluctuations, materials and product shortages and\nrestrictions on business and individual activities, all of which are materially impacting supply and demand in broad sectors of the world markets. Additionally,\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, together with general macroeconomic conditions, have led to disruptions in the global supply chain, primarily through a lack of\navailability of raw materials and electronic components. We have experienced challenges associated with material and component availability for certain\nproduct lines, longer shipping and delivery times for raw materials and components, constrained logistics capacity related to the movement of our products,\navailability of skilled labor and increased costs of raw materials, components, labor, and freight and courier services. Regional COVID-19 case volumes\n(including those related to subsequent variants), actions taken by governmental authorities, private businesses and individuals, such as “shelter-in-place”\norders and restrictions on travel and access to our customers or temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers, disruption and/or higher\ncosts to the Company’s supply chain, staffing shortages in hospitals and labor constraints in our facilities, could further impact our gross margins and our\nability to ship our products and supply our customers.\nThe emergence of new variants, vaccinations and public health measures are driving the pace of economic recovery unevenly in various regions. The direct\nand indirect disruptions caused by the pandemic and the responses of both governments and individuals could negatively impact the number of surgical and\nmedical intervention procedures performed and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The\nextent to which fear of exposure to or actual effects of COVID-19, new variants, disease outbreak, epidemic or a similar widespread health concern impacts\nour business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the speed and extent of\ngeographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions, the efficacy of vaccination and treatment; impact on the U.S. and\ninternational healthcare systems, the U.S. economy and worldwide economy; the timing, scope and effectiveness of U.S. and international governmental\nresponse; and the impact on the health, well-being and productivity of our employees.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur operating results may fluctuate.\nOur operating results, including components of operating results such as gross margin and operating expenses, may fluctuate from time to time, and such\nfluctuations could affect our stock price. Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to do so from time to time in the future. Some\nof the factors that may cause these fluctuations include:\n•\neconomic conditions worldwide, which could affect the ability of hospitals and other customers to purchase our products and could result in a\nreduction in elective and non-reimbursed operative procedures;\n•\nthe impact of acquisitions, our ability to integrate acquisitions, and our restructuring activities including portfolio rationalization, and divestitures;\n•\nrisks related to COVID-19 and other epidemics or similar widespread health concerns;\n•\nexpenditures for major initiatives, including acquired businesses and integrations thereof and restructuring;\n•\nthe timing of significant customer orders, which tend to increase in the fourth quarter coinciding with the end of budget cycles;\n•\nincreased competition for a wide range of customers across all our product lines in the markets our products are sold;\n•\nmarket acceptance of our existing products, as well as products in development;\n•\nretention of current employees and recruiting of new employees in light of market competition for talent and relevant skills;\n•\nthe timing of regulatory approvals as well as changes in country-specific regulatory requirements;\n•\nchanges in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies of countries in which we do business;\n•\nchanges in the variable interest rates of our debt instruments which could impact debt service requirements;\n•\npotential backorders, lost sales and expenses incurred in connection with product recalls or field corrective actions;\n•\ndisruption of our operations and sales resulting from extreme weather conditions or natural disasters that damage our manufacturing, distribution, or\ninfrastructure of those facilities, or the suppliers and service providers for those facilities;\n•\nour ability to manufacture and ship our products efficiently or in sufficient quantities to meet sales demands;\n•\nchanges in the cost or decreases in the supply of raw materials and services, including sterilization, energy, steel and honey;\n•\nthe timing of our research and development expenditures;\n•\nreimbursement for our products by third-party payors such as Medicare, Medicaid, private and public health insurers and foreign governmental\nhealth systems;\n•\nthe ability to maintain existing distribution rights to and from certain third parties;\n•\nthe ability to maintain business if or when we opt to convert such business from distributors to a direct sales model;\n•\nthe ability of our commercial sales representatives to obtain sales targets in a reasonable time frame;\n18"

We compete with established medical technology companies in many of our product areas.\nCompetition also comes from early-stage companies, universities, research institutions and other non-profit entities. In certain cases, our products compete\nprimarily against medical practices that treat a condition without using a device or any particular product, such as the medical practices that use autograft\ntissue instead of our dermal regeneration products, duraplasty products and nerve repair products, or that use other technologies that cost less than our\nproducts. Many of our competitors have access to greater financial, technical, research and development, marketing, manufacturing, sales, distribution,\nadministrative, consulting and other resources than we do. Our competitors may be more effective at developing commercial products or navigating the\nregulatory approval process in the markets in which we operate. They may be able to gain market share by offering lower-cost products or products that enjoy\nbetter reimbursement from third-party payors and foreign governmental health systems.\nOur competitive position depends on our ability to achieve market acceptance for our products, develop new products, implement marketing plans, secure\nregulatory approval for products under development, demonstrate clinical and economic effectiveness, obtain and maintain reimbursement coverage and\nfunding under third-party payors and foreign governmental health systems, obtain patent protection and produce products consistently in sufficient quantities\nto meet demand. We may need to develop new applications for our products to remain competitive. Technological advances by one or more of our current or\nfuture competitors or their achievement of superior reimbursement from third-party payors and foreign governmental health systems could render our present\nor future products obsolete or uneconomical. Our future success will depend upon our ability to compete effectively against current technology as well as to\nrespond effectively to technological advances, changes in customers' requirements or in payor or regulatory evidence requirements. Additionally, purchasing\ndecisions of our customers may be based on clinical evidence or comparative effectiveness studies and, because of our vast array of products, we might not be\nable to fund the studies necessary to gain entry or maintain our position or provide the required information to compete effectively. Other companies may\nhave more resources available to fund such studies. For example, competitors have launched and are developing products to compete with our dural repair\nproducts, regenerative skin, neuro critical care monitors and ultrasonic tissue ablation devices, among others. In the current environment of managed care,\nconsolidation among health care providers, increased competition, and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the\nbasis of price. Competitive pressures could adversely affect our profitability. Given these factors, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete\neffectively or continue our level of success in the areas in which we compete.\nChanges in the healthcare industry may require us to decrease the selling price for our products, may reduce the size of the market for our products, or\nmay eliminate a market, any of which could have a negative impact on our financial performance.\nTrends toward managed care, healthcare cost containment and other changes in government and private sector initiatives in the U.S. and other countries in\nwhich we do business are placing increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies that could adversely affect the sale and/or the\nprices of our products. For example:\n•\nthird-party payors of hospital services and hospital outpatient services, including Medicare, Medicaid, private and public health insurers and foreign\ngovernmental health systems, annually revise their payment methodologies, which can result in stricter standards for reimbursement of hospital\ncharges for certain medical procedures or the elimination of reimbursement;\n•\nseveral foreign countries have implemented reforms of their respective healthcare sectors in an effort to reduce healthcare spending, including\nrestricting funding to only those medical technologies and procedures with proven effectiveness, increasing patient co-payments and providing for\npayback measures. Governmental health systems have revised and continue to consider revisions of healthcare budgets, which could result in stricter\nstandards for implementing certain medical procedures, increased scrutiny of medical devices, and downward pricing pressure;\n19"

Between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022, we\nhave acquired two businesses at a total cost of approximately $358.4 million which amount includes our acquisition of ACell, Inc. in January 2021 for $306.9\nmillion and our acquisition of Surgical Innovation Associates, Inc. for $51.5 million in December 2022. Both of these acquisitions added products to our\ncomplex wound management and plastic and reconstructive surgery product portfolios, respectively, and provides additional growth opportunities for our TT\nsegment.\nWe may be unable to continue to implement our growth strategy and it may ultimately be unsuccessful. A significant portion of our growth in revenues has\nresulted from, and is expected to continue to result from, the acquisition of businesses or products complementary to our own. We engage in evaluations of\npotential acquisitions and are in various stages of discussion regarding possible acquisitions, certain of which, if consummated, could be significant to us. Any\nnew acquisition could result in material transaction expenses, increased operating, amortization and interest expenses, and possible in-process research and\ndevelopment charges for acquisitions that do not meet the definition of a “business,” any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our operating\nresults. Certain businesses that we acquire may not have adequate financial, disclosure, regulatory, quality or other compliance controls at the time we acquire\nthem and could require significant expenditures to address those controls or subject us to increased risk. As we grow by acquisition, we must manage and\nintegrate the new businesses to bring them into our systems for financial, disclosure, compliance, regulatory and quality control, realize economies of scale,\nand control costs. Failure to integrate acquired businesses and operations (including acquired employees and systems), retain key customers and suppliers of\nany acquired business or manage the cost of providing our products or price our products appropriately could preclude realization of the full benefits that we\nexpect from there transactions. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the business in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the\nacquisitions could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, our activities and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In\naddition, acquisitions involve other risks, including diversion of management resources otherwise available for the running of our business and the\ndevelopment of our business as well as risks associated with entering markets in which our marketing teams and sales force has limited experience or where\nexperienced distribution alliances are not available. Some acquisitions may include the need for ongoing product development to occur consistent with time\nsensitive milestones in order for the Company to achieve its commercial projections for the acquisition. Our future profitability will depend in part upon our\nability to develop our resources to adapt to these new products or business areas and to identify and enter into or maintain satisfactory distribution networks.\nAs a result of our acquisitions of other healthcare businesses, we may be subject to the risk of unanticipated business uncertainties, regulatory and other\ncompliance matters or legal liabilities relating to those acquired businesses for which the sellers of the acquired businesses may not indemnify us, for which\nwe may not be able to obtain insurance (or adequate insurance), or for which the indemnification may not be sufficient to cover the ultimate liabilities.

Certain potential\nacquisitions are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic acquisitions and could result in mandated\ndivestitures. If we are unsuccessful in our acquisition strategy, we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\nThese risks may be heightened in cases where the majority of the former businesses’ operations, employees and customers are located outside the U.S. Any\none or all of these factors could increase operating costs or lower anticipated financial performance. Many of these factors are also outside of our control. In\naddition, dispositions of certain key products, technologies and other rights, including pursuant to conditions imposed on us to obtain regulatory approvals,\nmay affect our business operations.\nEven if the operations of the businesses are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition, including the synergies, cost\nsavings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Additional\nunanticipated costs could be incurred in the integration of the businesses. All of these factors could cause a reduction to our earnings per share, decrease or\ndelay the expected accretive effect of the transaction, and negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nOur future financial results could be adversely affected by impairments or other charges.\nWe are required to test both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach, rather than\namortizing them over time. We are also required to test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs\nsuch as a significant decline in revenues or cash flows for certain products, or the discount rates used in the calculations of discounted cash flows change\nsignificantly, or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. If such a decline, rate change or\ncircumstance were to materialize, we may record an impairment of these intangible assets that could be material to the financial statements. See\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates” of this report.\nThe guidance on long-lived assets requires that we assess the impairment of our long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable as measured by the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows.\nAlso, Company decisions and other economic factors relating to our trade names may occur over time. For instance, we may discontinue certain products in\nthe future as we continue to assess the profitability of our product lines. As a result, we may need to record impairment charges or accelerate amortization on\ncertain trade names or technology-related intangible assets in the future.\nThe value of a medical device business is often volatile, and the assumptions underlying our estimates made in connection with our assessments under the\nguidance may change as a result of that volatility or other factors outside our control and may result in impairment charges. The amount of any such\nimpairment charges could be significant and have a material, adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken and\ncould have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, including the notes and the common stock into which they may be converted.\nLack of market acceptance for our products or market preference for technologies that compete with our products could reduce our revenues and\nprofitability.\nMarket acceptance of our products depends on many factors, including our ability to convince prospective customers that our technology is an attractive\nalternative to other technologies, to manufacture products in sufficient quantities and at acceptable costs, and to supply and service sufficient quantities of our\nproducts directly or through our distribution alliances. For example, the use of autograft tissue is a well-established means for repairing the dermis, and it\ncompetes for acceptance in the market with our collagen-based wound care products. In addition, unfavorable payment amounts or adverse coverage\ndeterminations of third-party payors, including Medicare, Medicaid, private and public health insurers, and foreign governmental health systems, regarding\nour products or third-party determinations that favor a competitor’s product over ours, could harm acceptance or continued use of our products. For example,\ngreater market acceptance of our wound graft products may ultimately depend on our ability to demonstrate that coverage and reimbursement are available\nand favorable, or because they are an attractive, cost-effective alternative to other treatment options.\nIf there are negative events in the healthcare industry, whether real or perceived, there could be a negative impact on the industry as a whole. The industry is\nsubject to rapid and continuous change arising from, among other things, consolidation, technological improvements, the pressure on governments, third-party\npayors and providers to reduce healthcare costs, and healthcare reform legislation and initiatives domestically and internationally. In addition, our future\nsuccess depends, in part, on our ability to license and develop additional products. Even if we determine that a product candidate has medical benefits, the\ncost of commercializing, either through internal development or payments associated with licensing arrangements, could be too high to justify development\nand we could ultimately face competitors with more effective products and better reimbursement status that cost less and are ready for commercial\nintroduction before our products. If we are unable to develop additional commercially viable products, our future prospects could be materially and adversely\naffected.\n21"

      "text": "One or more of these factors could vary unpredictably, and such variations could have a material, adverse effect on our competitive position. We may not be\nable to adjust our contemplated plan of development to meet changing market demands.\nIt could be difficult to replace some of our suppliers.\nOutside vendors, some of whom are sole-source suppliers, provide key components and raw materials used in the manufacture of our products. Although we\nbelieve that alternative sources for many of these components and raw materials are available, any interruption in supply of a limited or sole-source\ncomponent or raw material could harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new or alternative source of supply is identified and qualified. In\naddition, an uncorrected defect or supplier’s variation in a component or raw material, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process,\ncould harm our ability to manufacture products. We may not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable time period, or on commercially\nreasonable terms, if at all, and our ability to produce and supply our products could be impaired. We believe that these factors are most likely to affect the\nfollowing products that we sell:\n•\nour collagen-based products and bovine-based products, such as the Integra Dermal Regeneration Template and wound matrix products, the\nDuraGen  family of products, our Absorbable Collagen Sponges, PriMatrix  and SurgiMend products;\n•\nour products made from silicone, such as our neurosurgical shunts and drainage systems and hemodynamic shunts;\n•\nproducts which use many different specialty parts, electrical components, or chemicals from numerous suppliers, such as our intracranial monitors,\nshunts, catheters, tissue ablation, and headlights;\n•\nour biosynthetic products, including the DuraSeal sealant system and DuraSorb biosynthetic mesh scaffold;\n•\nproducts which are amniotic tissue-based\n•\nproducts which are porcine tissue-based;\n•\nproducts that use medical grade leptospermum honey, such as our Medihoney products; and\n•\nour TCC-EZ  total contact cast system products.\nThe availability of amniotic tissue-based products depends upon, among other factors, the availability of tissue from human donors. Access to donated\namniotic tissue could also be adversely impacted by regulatory changes or evolving public perceptions of the donor process.\nAdditionally, many of our products require sterilization by third-party suppliers. To the extent these suppliers are unable to provide sterilization services,\nwhether due to lack of capacity, regulatory requirements, environmental concerns such as those relating to ethylene oxide or otherwise, we may be unable to\ntransition sterilization to other suppliers in a timely or cost effective manner, or at all, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nOur supply chain and our cost of goods also may be negatively impacted by unanticipated price increases due to factors such as global economic disruptions,\nelectronic component shortages, fear of future or ongoing pandemics, inflation, including wage inflation, recessionary conditions and geopolitical events,\nincluding the war in Ukraine, all of which are beyond our control or the control of our suppliers.\nWhile it is our policy to maintain sufficient inventory of components so that our production will not be significantly disrupted even if a particular component\nor material is not available for a period of time, we remain at risk that we will not be able to qualify new components or materials quickly enough to prevent a\ndisruption if one or more of our suppliers ceases production of important components or materials.\nWe may experience difficulties, delays, performance impact or unexpected costs from consolidation of facilities and transfer of manufacturing facilities.\nIn recent years, we consolidated several facilities or transferred manufacturing operations from third parties to our existing internal manufacturing facilities\nand may further undertake similar consolidations or transfers in the future in order to improve our cost structure, achieve increased operating efficiencies, and\nimprove our competitive standing or results of operations and/or to address unfavorable economic conditions. As part of these initiatives, we may also lose\nfavorable tax incentives or not be able to renew leases on acceptable terms. We may further reduce staff, make changes to certain capital projects, close\ncertain production operations and abandon leases for certain facilities that will not be used in our operations. In conjunction with any actions, we will continue\nto make significant investments and build the framework for our future growth. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits and savings\nfrom these efforts because of unforeseen difficulties, delays, implementation issues or unexpected costs. If we are unable to achieve or maintain all of the\nresulting savings or benefits to our business or other unforeseen events occur, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may have significant product liability exposure and our insurance may not cover all potential claims.\nWe are exposed to product liability and other claims if our technologies or products are alleged to have caused harm. We may not be able to obtain insurance\nfor the potential liability on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at reasonable costs. Any potential product liability claims could exceed the amount of\nour insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of the policy.

As a result, hospitals and other customers could reduce budgets or put all or part of their budgets on hold or close their\noperations, which could have a negative effect on our sales, particularly the sales of capital equipment such as our ultrasonic surgical aspirators,\nneuromonitors and cranial stabilization products, or result in a reduction in elective and non-reimbursed procedures. The occurrence of those economic\nconditions could make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities and depending on their severity, could have a\nmaterial, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur private-label product lines depend significantly on key relationships with third parties, which we could be unable to establish and maintain.\nOur private-label business depends in part on entering into and maintaining long-term supply agreements with third parties. The third parties with whom we\nhave entered into agreements might terminate these agreements for a variety of reasons, including developing other sources for the products that we supply.\nTermination of our most important relationships could adversely affect our expectations for the growth of private-label products.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\nThe adoption of healthcare reform in the U.S. and initiatives sponsored by other governments may adversely affect our business, results of operations\nand/or financial condition.\nOur operations may be substantially affected by potential fundamental changes in the global political, economic and regulatory landscape of the healthcare\nindustry. Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs are continuing in the U.S., and in many other countries in which we\ndo business, causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective treatments. These initiatives include price regulation,\ncompetitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements. The\nadoption of some or all of these initiatives could have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”), signed into law in March 2010, includes several provisions that impact our\nbusinesses in the U.S. The ACA includes provisions that, among other things, reduce and/or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have\nhealth insurance (with limited exceptions), and require detailed disclosure of transfers of value made to healthcare professionals. Other legislative changes\nhave been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, including The Budget Control Act of 2011, The American Taxpayer Relief Act\nof 2012 and Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which, among other things, have reduced payments under Medicare and Medicaid to\ncertain healthcare providers or altered the formula by which Medicare makes annual payment adjustments. Congress also drafts and introduces, from time to\ntime, legislation that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulation of medical devices. In addition, the FDA may change its\nclearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions, which may prevent or delay approval or\nclearance of our future products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. For example, over the\nlast several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data\nand a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products.\nWe cannot predict what impact ongoing uncertainty regarding federal and state health reform proposals, including the implementation or repeal of the ACA,\njudicial review and interpretation of the ACA and other healthcare laws, instability of the insurance markets, changes in the U.S. administration and policy, an\nexpansion in government’s role in and/or additional proposals and/or changes to the U.S. health care system or its legislation will have on our customer’s\npurchasing decisions and/or reimbursement which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We expect that additional state and federal health care\nreform measures will be adopted in the future, including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products, any of which could limit the\namounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services, which could adversely affect the growth of the market for our\nproducts or demand for our products, or result in additional pricing pressures. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare\nreform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us. We continue to monitor the implementation of such legislation and, to the extent new market or\nindustry trends or new governmental programs evolve, we will consider implementing or implement programs in response.\nWe are subject to stringent domestic and foreign medical device regulations and oversight and any adverse action may adversely affect our ability to\ncompete in the marketplace and our financial condition and business operations.\nOur products, development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by numerous government agencies,\nincluding the FDA and comparable foreign agencies, as discussed in “Part 1, Item 1. Business –\n23"

      "text": "Government Regulation.” To varying degrees, each of these agencies monitors and enforces our compliance with laws and regulations governing the\ndevelopment, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our medical devices. We are also subject to regulations that may apply to certain\nof our products that are Drug/Device Combination products or are considered to be subject to pharmaceutical regulations outside the U.S. The process of\nobtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies for new products, or for enhancements or modifications\nto existing products could be costly, time consuming and burdensome, lead to failed clinical trials or weakened clinical evidence, involve modifications,\nrepairs or replacements of our products and result in limitations on the indicated use of our products, which may negatively impact our ability to market our\nproducts and services, result in delays or prevent full commercial realization of future products or service. Furthermore, failure to obtain timely approvals or\nrenewals may result in significant penalties and fines. Additional regulations govern the approval, initiation, conduct, monitoring, documentation and\nreporting of clinical studies to regulatory agencies in the countries or regions in which they are conducted. Failure to comply, could subject us to significant\nenforcement actions and sanctions, including halting the study, rejection of data generated in the study, seizure of investigational devices or data, sanctions\nagainst investigators, civil or criminal penalties, and other actions. In addition, without the data from one or more clinical studies, it may not be possible for us\nto secure the data necessary to support certain regulatory submissions, to secure reimbursement or demonstrate other requirements. We cannot assure that\naccess to clinical investigators, sites and subjects, documentation and data will be available on the terms and timeframes necessary.\nWe are subject to extensive complex regulatory requirements by domestic and foreign government agencies and any failure to comply with our ongoing\nresponsibilities under their applicable laws and regulations could result in a material adverse impact on our business. Failure to comply with applicable\nregulations could result in future product recalls, injunctions preventing the shipment of products or other enforcement actions that could have a material\nadverse effect on our business.\nWe also are subject to the European Medical Device Regulation, which was adopted by the European Union (“EU”) as a common legal framework for all EU\nmember states. The implementation for Class I products occurred on May 26, 2021 and the EUDAMED Database was implemented on May 26, 2022. Under\nthis regulation, companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member states must meet certain quality system, and safety\nrequirements as well as ongoing product monitoring responsibilities. Companies must also obtain a “CE” marking (i.e., a mandatory conformity marking for\ncertain products sold within the European Economic Area) for their products. Complying with the requirements of these regulations may require us to incur\nsignificant expenditures. Expenditures for European Union Medical Device Regulation compliance activities amounted to $45.1 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and we anticipate incurring additional expenditures in connection with our on-going efforts to obtain certification for our products under\nthe European Medical Device Regulation. Various penalties exist for non-compliance with the laws implementing the European Medical Device Regulations\nwhich if incurred, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, the regulatory environment in China continues to evolve, and officials in the Chinese government exercise broad discretion in deciding how to\ninterpret and apply regulations. It is possible that the Chinese government's current or future interpretation and application of existing or new regulations will\nnegatively impact our China operations, result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties.\nIn addition, we are subject to laws and regulations that govern the means by which companies in the healthcare industry may market their products to\nhealthcare professionals and may compete by discounting the prices of their products, including for example, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal\nFalse Claims Act, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, state law equivalents to these federal laws that are meant to protect\nagainst fraud and abuse and analogous laws in foreign countries. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, but not\nlimited to, in some instances civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including\nMedicare and Medicaid. Although we exercise care in structuring our sales and marketing practices and customer discount arrangements to comply with those\nlaws and regulations, we cannot assure that:\n•\ngovernment officials charged with responsibility for enforcing those laws will not assert that our sales and marketing practices or customer discount\narrangements are in violation of those laws or regulations; or\n•\ngovernment regulators or courts will interpret those laws or regulations in a manner consistent with our interpretation.\nWe have in place policies and procedures for compliance that we believe are at least as stringent as those set forth in the AdvaMed Code of Ethics which was\ndeveloped by AdvaMed, a trade association that represents the medical device industry, and which is intended to represent best practices with respect to\nmedical device companies' interactions with healthcare providers. We regularly train our sales and marketing personnel on our policies regarding sales and\nmarketing practices. Pursuant to the AdvaMed Code, we have certified our adoption of the AdvaMed Code. The sales and marketing practices of our industry\nhave been the subject of increased scrutiny from federal and state government agencies, and we believe that this trend will continue. Various hospital\norganizations, medical societies and trade associations are establishing their own practices that may require detailed disclosures of relationships between\nhealthcare professionals and medical device companies or ban or restrict certain marketing and sales practices such as gifts and business meals. Since these\nlaws, regulations and ultimate enforcement continue to evolve, we cannot predict with certainty, what, if any, impact, changes to them may have on our\nbusiness or our customers.\n24"

      "text": "Outside of the U.S. we are subject to privacy and data security regulations at the international, national and regional level, as well as on an industry specific\nbasis. For example, in Europe, we are subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") which is related to the collection, processing, storage,\ntransfer and use of personal data. In the U.S., we are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) and other similar laws in the United\nStates, at both the federal and state level. Noncompliance with GDPR could trigger fines of up to 4% of global annual revenues. In addition, we are subject to\nthe new China Personal Information Protection Law that went into effect November 1, 2021 which focuses on protecting personal information and cross\nborder transfers of the information. Compliance with these requirements, either individually or in the aggregate, may require changes in business practices\nadded complexity and additional management oversight. They also may complicate our clinical research activities, as well as product offerings that involve\ntransmission or use of clinical data. Non-compliance may result in proceedings against us by governmental or other entities and/or significant fines which\ncould negatively impact our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nShould we delay or fail to comply with one or more of the regulatory requirements we could have reduced sales, increased costs, delays to new product\nintroductions, enhancements or our strategic plans, or harm to our reputation or competitiveness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business\nand financial results.\nOur medical device products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls, even after receiving regulatory clearance, approval or certification, which could\nharm our reputation, business and financial results.\nAfter a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply, which require manufacturers to follow, among other things, design, testing,\nproduction, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; labeling regulations, which prohibit the\npromotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and medical device reporting regulations that require us to\nreport to FDA or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunction in\na way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. The FDA and similar governmental bodies in\nother countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event\nthat a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. We may, under own initiative, recall a product if a reasonable possibility of serious injury or any material\ndeficiency in a device is found, or withdraw a product to improve device performance or for other reasons.\nRecalls of any of our products may divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA recall could harm our reputation with customers and consumers which could reduce the sales of our products. In addition, the FDA or other foreign\ngovernmental agencies may implement enforcement actions in connection with a recall which could impair our product offerings and be harmful to our\nbusiness and financial results.\nCertain of our products contain materials derived from animal sources and may become subject to additional regulation.\nCertain of our products are derived from bovine or porcine tissue sources. As a result, we may experience difficulties in processing and producing our bovine\nand porcine tissue products at scale, including problems related to yields, quality control and assurance, tissue availability, adequacy of control policies and\nprocedures and availability of skilled personnel.\nWith respect to bovine, among other products, our dermal regeneration products, duraplasty products, wound care products, bone void fillers, nerve and\ntendon repair products and certain other products, contain material derived from bovine tissue. In 2022, 43.3% of our revenues derived from products\ncontaining material derived from bovine tissue. Products that contain materials derived from animal sources, including food, pharmaceuticals and medical\ndevices, are subject to scrutiny in the media and by regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities are concerned about the potential for the transmission of\ndisease from animals to humans via those materials. This public scrutiny has been particularly acute in Japan and Western Europe with respect to products\nderived from animal sources, because of concern that materials infected with the agent that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy, otherwise known as\nBSE or mad cow disease, may, if ingested or implanted, cause a variant of the human Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, an ultimately fatal disease with no known\ncure. The World Organization for Animal Health recognizes the U.S. as having a negligible risk for BSE, which is the highest status available.\nWe take care to provide that our products are safe and free of agents that can cause disease. In particular, we qualified a source of collagen from a country\noutside the U.S. that is considered BSE/TSE-free. The World Health Organization classifies different types of bovine tissue for relative risk of BSE\ntransmission. Deep flexor tendon and bovine fetal skin, which are used in our products, are in the lowest-risk categories for BSE transmission and are\ntherefore considered to have a negligible risk of containing the agent that causes BSE (an improperly folded protein known as a prion). Nevertheless, products\nthat contain materials derived from animals, including our products, could become subject to additional regulation, or even be banned in certain countries,\nbecause of concern over the potential for the transmission of prions. Significant new regulations, or a ban of our products, could have a material, adverse\neffect on our current business or our ability to expand our business.\nCertain countries, such as Japan, China, Taiwan and Argentina, have issued regulations that require our collagen products be sourced from countries where no\ncases of BSE have occurred, and the EU has requested that our dural replacement products and other products that are used in neurological tissue be sourced\nfrom a country where no cases of BSE have occurred. Currently, we source bovine fetal hides from the U.S. and purchase tendon from the U.S. and New\nZealand. New Zealand has\n25"

We received approval in the U.S., the EU, Japan, Taiwan, China, Argentina as well as other countries for the use of New Zealand-\nsourced tendon in the manufacturing of our products. If we cannot continue to use or qualify a source of tendon from New Zealand or another country that has\nnever had a case of BSE, we could be prohibited from selling our collagen products in certain countries.\nWe are subject to current and potential future requirements relating to protection of the environment, such as hazardous materials regulations, which\nmay impose significant compliance or other costs on us.\nCertain of our processes in manufacturing and research and development involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials. In addition, we own and/or\nlease a number of facilities at which hazardous materials have been used in the past. Finally, we have acquired various companies that historically have used\ncertain hazardous materials and that have owned and/or leased facilities at which hazardous materials have been used. For all of these reasons, we are subject\nto federal, state, foreign, and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, transportation, handling, treatment, remediation, and disposal\nof hazardous materials and certain waste products (“Environmental, Health, Safety and Transportation Laws”). Although we believe that our procedures for\nhandling, transporting, and disposing of hazardous materials comply with the Environmental, Health, Safety and Transportation Laws, such laws may be\namended in ways that increase our cost of compliance, perhaps materially.\nFurthermore, the potential risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated, and there is also a risk that such\ncontamination previously has occurred in connection with one of our facilities or in connection with one of the companies we have purchased. In the event of\nsuch an accident or contamination, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any related liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the\ncoverage of our insurance and could exceed our resources. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur business and operations are subject to risks related to climate change.\nThe long-term effects of global climate change present both physical risks (from the increased frequency of extreme weather conditions or natural disasters)\nand transition risks (from regulatory requirements or technology changes). Such extreme weather conditions could pose physical risks to our facilities and\ndisrupt operation of our supply chain and may impact operational costs. Concern over global climate change could result in new legal or regulatory\nrequirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or\nregulatory requirements, we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations and such measures may interrupt our\noperations or the operations of our suppliers, potentially leading to higher costs, and therefore negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to requirements relating to information technology which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and prevent disruptions, outages, or data breaches, we may suffer regulatory\nconsequences in addition to business consequences. Our worldwide operations means that we are subject to laws and regulations, including data protection\nand cyber security laws and regulations, in many jurisdictions. The variety of U.S. and international privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations impacting\nour operations are described in “Item 1. Business - Government Regulation - Other Factors - Data Privacy and Cybersecurity Laws and Regulations.\" We\nhave programs to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations. However, there is no guarantee that we will avoid enforcement actions by governmental\nbodies. Enforcement actions may be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business. In addition, there has been a developing trend of civil lawsuits and\nclass actions relating to breaches of consumer data held by large companies or incidents arising from other cyber-attacks. While Integra has not been named in\nany such suits, if a substantial breach or loss of data were to occur, we could become a target of such litigation.\nIf we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees, our business could suffer.\nIf we fail to recruit, develop and retain the necessary personnel, our business and our ability to obtain new customers, develop new products and provide\nacceptable levels of customer service could suffer. The success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel. Our\nsuccess also depends on our ability to recruit, develop and retain and motivate highly skilled sales, marketing, manufacturing and scientific personnel.\nCompetition for these persons in our industry is intense, and we may not be able to successfully recruit, train or retain qualified personnel. We are\nexperiencing increasing challenges in building and retaining our workforce in certain markets, where pressure from inflation and competition have\nexacerbated turnover and retention trends continuing from the COVID-19 pandemic. Labor shortages and competition for qualified personnel could cause\ndisruptions in our business operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO TAX AND DEBT\nWe may have additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities. In the ordinary course of our\nbusiness, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our\nworldwide provision for income taxes. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related\nlitigation could be materially different\n26"

The results of an audit or litigation could have a material, adverse effect on our financial statements in\nthe period or periods for which that determination is made.\nChanges in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company's operating results.\nWe are subject to income taxes, as well as taxes that are not income-based, in both the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Taxes could significantly increase\ndue to changes in tax laws or changes in our interpretation of those laws. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, a global policy\nforum, is developing a global tax framework that, if implemented, includes a global minimum tax rate of 15%. Taxes could also significantly increase due to changes\nin accounting guidance. Our future effective tax rate could be unfavorably affected by numerous factors including a change in, or the interpretation of, tax rules\nand regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate (including changes in legislation currently being considered), a change in our geographic earnings\nmix, and/or to the jurisdictions in which we operate, or a change in the measurement of our deferred taxes.\nOur leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business.\nOur leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business. As of December 31, 2022, our total consolidated external debt was\napproximately $1.5 billion (See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5, Debt, to the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for a discussion of our consolidated external debt). We\nmay also incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our substantial indebtedness could have material, adverse consequences, including:\n•\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;\n•\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions, and placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors\nthat are less leveraged;\n•\nlimiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n•\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes.\nOur debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other\ncorporate purposes, including funding future expansion of our business, acquisitions, and ongoing capital expenditures, which could impede our growth. In\naddition, our ability to comply with, renegotiate or extend the Company’s debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in\nturn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Any disruptions in our operations, the financial\nmarkets, or the overall economy, including as a result of COVID-19, may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us and/or our ability to comply\nwith our existing obligations.\nChanges in the calculation and or complete replacement of LIBOR could have an impact on our business.\nThe United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced in July 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require\nbanks to submit rates for LIBOR. On March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers LIBOR, and the FCA announced that all LIBOR\nsettings will either cease to be provided by any administrator, or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021, for all non-U.S. dollar\nLIBOR settings and one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings, and immediately after June 30, 2023 for the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings.\nWe have multiple debt facilities which utilizes a variable rate equal to Eurodollar LIBOR rate as a component of our interest rate.\nManagement expects all LIBOR-based contracts to be replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), which is calculated based on overnight\ntransactions under repurchase agreements backed by Treasury securities. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of private-market participants\nconvened by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the New York Federal Reserve, has recommended the use of SOFR as a more robust reference rate\nalternative to LIBOR. The use of SOFR as a substitute for LIBOR is, however, voluntary and may not be suitable for all market participants. There can be no\nassurance that the replacement rate will be economically equivalent to LIBOR, which could result in higher interest rates for us under our debt facilities.\nThere is no guarantee that a transition from LIBOR to SOFR will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates, or our\nborrowing costs, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur intellectual property rights may not provide meaningful commercial protection for our products, potentially enabling third parties to use our\ntechnology or very similar technology and could reduce our ability to compete in the market.\nTo compete effectively, we depend, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies and manufacturing processes, which includes\nthe ability to obtain, protect and enforce patents on our technology and to protect our\n27"

Others may challenge our patents and, as a result, our patents could be narrowed, invalidated or rendered unenforceable. Competitors\nmay develop products similar to ours that our patents do not cover. In addition, the approval or rejection of patent applications may take several years and our\ncurrent and future patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents in the U.S. or foreign countries.\nOur competitive position depends, in part, upon unpatented trade secrets, which we may be unable to protect.\nOur competitive position also depends upon unpatented trade secrets, which are difficult to protect. We cannot assure that others will not independently\ndevelop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, that our trade secrets will not be\ndisclosed or that we can effectively protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets.\nIn an effort to protect our trade secrets, we require our employees, consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements\nupon commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that, except in specified circumstances, all confidential\ninformation developed or made known to the individual during the course of their relationships with us must be kept confidential. We cannot assure, however,\nthat these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of the unauthorized use or\ndisclosure of confidential information.\nOur success will depend partly on our ability to operate without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others.\nWe may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, we may find it necessary, if threatened, to initiate a lawsuit seeking a\ndeclaration from a court that we do not infringe the proprietary rights of others or that their rights are invalid or unenforceable. If we do not prevail in any\nlitigation, in addition to any damages we might have to pay, we would be required to stop the infringing activity (which could include a cessation of selling\nthe products in question) or obtain a license for the proprietary rights involved. Any required license may be unavailable to us on acceptable terms, if at all. In\naddition, some licenses may be nonexclusive and allow our competitors to access the same technology we license.\nIf we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design our products so as not to infringe on the proprietary rights of others, we may be unable to sell\nsome of our products, and this potential inability could have a material, adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits relating to our intellectual property rights and promotional practices, which may be expensive.\nTo protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may have to initiate or defend legal proceedings, such as infringement suits or opposition\nproceedings, against or by third parties. In addition, we may have to institute proceedings regarding our competitors’ promotional practices or defend\nproceedings regarding our promotional practices. Legal proceedings are costly, and, even if we prevail, the cost of the legal proceedings could affect our\nprofitability. In addition, litigation is time-consuming and could divert management's attention and resources away from our business. Moreover, in response\nto our claims against other parties, those parties could assert counterclaims against us.\nRISKS RELATED TO GLOBAL OPERATIONS\nIf any of our facilities or those of our suppliers were damaged and/or our manufacturing or business processes interrupted, we could experience lost\nrevenues and our business could be seriously harmed.\nDamage to our manufacturing, distribution, development and/or research facilities because of fire, extreme weather conditions, natural disaster, power loss,\ncommunications failure, geopolitical disruption, unauthorized entry or other events, such as a flu or other health epidemic, such as COVID-19, could\nsignificantly disrupt our operations, the operations of suppliers and critical infrastructure and delay or prevent product manufacture and shipment during the\ntime required to repair, rebuild or replace the damaged facilities. Certain of our manufacturing facilities are located in Puerto Rico, which in the past has\nexperienced both severe hurricanes and other natural disasters. Climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions\nand natural disasters and, consequently, risks to our operations and growth. Although we maintain property damage and business interruption insurance\ncoverage on these facilities, our insurance might not cover all losses under such circumstances, and we may not be able to renew or obtain such insurance in\nthe future on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at reasonable costs.\nWe are exposed to a variety of risks relating to our international sales and operations.\nWe generate significant revenues outside the U.S. in multiple foreign currencies, and in U.S. dollar-denominated transactions conducted with customers who\ngenerate revenue in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

Our most significant currency exchange risk relates to\ntransactions conducted in Australian dollars, British pounds, Canadian dollars, Chinese yuan, Euros, Japanese yen, and Swiss francs.\nWe cannot predict the consolidated effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved, the\nvariability of currency exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates. Although we address currency risk management through regular\noperating and financing activities, and, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial instruments, those actions may not prove to be fully\neffective. For a description of our use of derivative financial instruments, see Note 6, Derivative Instruments to the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements (Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nOur international operations subject us to laws regarding sanctioned countries, entities and persons, customs, import-export, laws regarding transactions in\nforeign countries, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery and other laws regarding interactions with healthcare professionals, and\nproduct registration requirements. Among other things, these laws restrict, and in some cases prevent, U.S. companies from directly or indirectly selling\ngoods, technology or services to people or entities in certain countries. In addition, these laws require that we exercise care in structuring our sales and\nmarketing practices and effecting product registrations in foreign countries.\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict and resulting sanctions and export restrictions are creating barriers to doing business in Russia and adversely impacting global\nsupply chains. While we have no manufacturing, distribution or direct material suppliers in the region, we are closely monitoring the potential raw material or\nsupplier impact in both Russia and Ukraine. Materials like palladium and neon, which are both dependent on Russia supply, are part of broader semiconductor\nshortages in industry. Additional sanctions, export restrictions, and potential countermeasures within Russia may lead to greater uncertainty and geopolitical\nshifts in Asia that could cause additional adverse impacts on global supply chains and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe United Kingdom’s (“UK”) exit from the European Union on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit, has caused, and may continue to cause\nuncertainty in the global political markets. It is possible that Brexit could, among other things, affect the legal and regulatory environments, including the\nregulatory landscape concerning medical devices, to which our business is subject, impose greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and the\nEU and other parties, increase currency volatility and create economic and political uncertainty in the region.\nAs we seek to continue to expand and strengthen our international operations, we may experience difficulty in growing our sales in certain new markets and\nother international markets in which we are attempting to increase our presence due to, among other things, customer acceptance, undeveloped and/or\nunfamiliar distribution channels, regulatory restrictions and changes, and business knowledge of these markets.\nFrom time to time, proposals are made to significantly change existing trade agreements and relationships between the U.S. and other countries. In recent\nyears, the U.S. government has implemented substantial changes to U.S. trade policies, including import restrictions, increased import tariffs and changes in\nU.S. participation in multilateral trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to replace the former North American Free Trade\nAgreement. The ongoing global economic competition and trade tensions between the U.S. and China has resulted in the U.S. government assessing\nsupplemental tariffs on certain goods imported from China and China’s assessment of retaliatory tariffs on certain imports of U.S. goods into China. In\naddition, the United States has assessed or proposed supplemental tariffs and quantitative restrictions on U.S. imports of certain products from other countries\nas well. Owing to the complex relationships between the U.S. and such other countries, political, diplomatic, military, or other events could result in business\ndisruptions, including increased regulatory enforcement against companies, tariffs, trade embargoes, export restrictions and the termination or modification of\nexisting trade agreements. The imposition of such restrictions could increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that\ngo into making them, require the Company to change its operations and the products it offers and negatively impact consumer confidence and spending, all of\nwhich, both individually and in the aggregate, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nCyber-attacks or other disruptions to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our infrastructure and to support business decisions. Our information systems\nrequire an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with\ncontinuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer\ninformation, and changing customer\n29"

As a result of the COVID-19\npandemic, we may face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely,\nwhich may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. If we, or third parties on whom we rely, fail to maintain or protect our\ninformation systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, suffer backlash from negative\npublic relations, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data\nprivacy breach, or suffer other adverse consequences.\nWe have programs, processes (including ongoing improvements) and technologies in place to prevent, detect, contain, respond to and mitigate security related\nthreats and potential incidents. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or interrupt services change frequently and can be difficult to\ndetect, anticipating, identifying or preventing these threats or mitigating them if and when they occur, may be challenging. We are also dependent on third\nparty vendors to supply and/or support certain aspects of our information technology systems which may contain defects in design or manufacture or other\nproblems that could result in system disruption or unexpectedly compromise the information security of our own systems. In addition, as we grow in part\nthrough new acquisitions we may face risks due to implementation, modification, or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies relating to data privacy\nand cybersecurity at the acquired business. We continue to consolidate and integrate the number of systems we operate, and to upgrade and expand our\ninformation system capabilities for stable and secure business operations. Despite our implementation of controls to protect our systems and sensitive,\nconfidential or personal data or information, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, employee errors\nand/or malfeasance (including misappropriation by departing employees) that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal\ndata or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of\ninformation, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions.

Risk Factors and Item 15. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nGENERAL\nIntegra LifeSciences is a global leader in regenerative tissue technologies and neurological solutions dedicated to limiting uncertainty for clinicians so they\ncan focus on providing the best patient care. Founded in 1989 with the acquisition of an engineered collagen technology platform used to repair and\nregenerate tissue, Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol\n“IART.” Integra has developed numerous product lines from this technology for applications ranging from burn and deep tissue wounds to the repair of dura\nmater in the brain, as well as nerves and tendons. The Company has expanded its base regenerative technology business to include surgical instruments,\nneurosurgical products and advanced wound care through global acquisitions and product development to meet the evolving needs of its customers and\nenhance patient care.\nIntegra manufactures and sells medical technologies and products in two reportable business segments: Codman Specialty Surgical (\"CSS\") and Tissue\nTechnologies (\"TT\"). The CSS segment, which represents approximately two-thirds of our total revenue, consists of market-leading technologies and\ninstrumentation used for a wide range of specialties, such as neurosurgery, neurocritical care and otolaryngology. We are the world leader in neurosurgery and\none of the top three providers in instruments used in precision, specialty, and general surgical procedures. Our TT segment generates about one-third of our\noverall revenue and focuses on three main areas: complex wound surgery, surgical reconstruction, and peripheral nerve repair.\nWe have key manufacturing and research facilities located in California, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Puerto Rico, Tennessee, Utah,\nFrance, Germany, Ireland and Switzerland. We source most of our handheld surgical instruments and dural sealant products through specialized third-party\nvendors.\nIntegra is committed to delivering high quality products that positively impact the lives of millions of patients and their families. We focus on four key pillars\nof our strategy: 1) enabling an execution-focused culture, 2) optimizing relevant scale, 3) advancing innovation and agility, and 4) leading in customer\nexperience. We believe that by sharpening our focus on these areas through improved planning and communication, optimization of our infrastructure, and\nstrategically aligned acquisitions, we can build scale, increase competitiveness and achieve our long-term goals.\nTo this end, the executive leadership team has established the following key priorities aligned to the following areas of focus:\nStrategic Acquisitions. An important part of the Company's strategy is pursuing strategic transactions and licensing agreements that increase relevant scale in\nthe clinical areas in which Integra competes. Our growth strategy includes the acquisition of businesses, assets or products lines to increase the breadth of our\nofferings, the reach of our product portfolios and drive relevant scale to our customers. On December 6, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of SIA,\nwhich develops, markets and sells DuraSorb, a resorbable synthetic matrix for plastic and reconstructive surgery. This acquisition will advance Integra’s\nglobal strategy in breast reconstruction, expanding plans to access the U.S. market where SIA is pursuing pre-market approval for use in IBBR. We also\ncontinued to advance the development of pioneering neurosurgical technologies with the expansion our product offering of regenerative technologies from our\n2021 ACell acquisition. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K) for additional details.\n33"

      "text": "Portfolio Optimization and New Product Introductions. We are investing in innovative product development to drive a multi-generational pipeline for our key\nproduct franchises. Our product development efforts span across our key global franchises focused on potential technological innovations for significant\nreturns on investment. In addition to new product development, we are funding studies to gather clinical evidence to support launches, ensure market access\nand improve reimbursement for existing products. In addition to acquisitions and organic reinvestment, we continually look to optimize our portfolio towards\nhigher growth and higher margin businesses. As such, we may opportunistically divest businesses or discontinue products where we see limited runway for\nfuture value creation in line with our aspirations due in part to changes in the market, business fundamentals or the regulatory environment.\nCommercial Channel Investments. Investing in our sales channels is a core part of our strategy to create specialization and greater focus on reaching new and\nexisting customers and addressing their needs. To support our commercial efforts in Tissue Technologies, we utilize a two-tier specialist model to increase our\npresence in focused segments to help serve the evolving needs of our customers. In addition, we continue to build upon our leadership brands across our\nproduct franchises in both CSS and TT to engage customers through enterprise-wide contracts with leading hospitals, integrated delivery networks and global\npurchasing organizations in the United States. Internationally, we have increased our commercial resources significantly in key emerging markets and are\nmaking investments to support our sales organization and maximize our commercial opportunities. Domestically, we have also increased our TT sales force in\nthe United States to support the expanded regenerative tissue product portfolio that includes ACell products. These investments in our international and\ndomestic sales channel position us well for expansion and long-term growth.\nCustomer Experience. We aspire to be ranked as a best-in-class provider and are committed to strengthening our relationships with all customers. We continue\nto invest in technologies, systems and processes to enhance the customer experience. In 2022, we outsourced certain transactional back-office finance and\ncustomer service activities to enhance customer quality, build scale for future growth, and capture cost efficiencies. We also launched digital tools and\nprograms, resources and virtual product training to drive continued customer familiarity with our growing portfolio of medical technologies globally. .\nNew Product Introductions and Research and Development Updates\nWe continue to invest in collecting clinical evidence to support the Company's existing products and new product launches, and to ensure that we obtain\nmarket access for broader and more cost-effective solutions.\nIn 2022, we made progress to several enhancements to our CUSA Clarity Tissue Ablation System. The extended laparoscopic tip was launched in the U.S. to\nenhance laparoscopic liver procedures. In addition, a single-sided bone tip received 510(k) clearance. Commercial launch is expected in the first quarter of\n2023. We continue to update our CUSA Clarity platform by incorporating new ultrasonic handpiece and integrated electrosurgical capabilities.\nIn each area, we continue to benefit from products launched over the past several years, including our new electrosurgery generator and irrigator system, an\ninnovative customer-centric toolkit for our Certas  Plus Programmable Valve along with additional shunt configurations. In Japan, we are experiencing strong\ngrowth as a result of the successful launch of DuraGen in mid-2019, which is the first and only collagen xenograft approved for use as a dural substitute in the\ncountry.\nIn 2022, we continued to advance the two early-stage technology platforms we acquired in 2019. Through the acquisition of Arkiss, we added a platform\ntechnology, CerebroFlo EVD, which is a catheter with Endexo technology, a permanent additive designed to reduce the potential for catheter obstruction due\nto thrombus formation. The CerebroFlo EVD Catheter has demonstrated an average of 99% less thrombus accumulation onto its surface, in vitro, compared to\na market leading EVD catheter. In 2019, we also acquired Rebound Therapeutics which specialized in a single-use medical device, known as Aurora\nSurgiscope, which is the only tubular retractor system designed for cranial surgery with an integrated access channel, camera and lighting. In 2021, we began\nand continued to conduct a limited clinical launch of the Aurora Surgiscope for use in minimally invasive neurosurgery as well as initiated a registry called\nMIRROR to collect data on early surgical intervention using this same technology platform for the treatment of ICH. In 2022, we have continued to execute\non our growth initiatives. We launched the Aurora Evacuator with Coagulation device in the U.S., designed to be used in conjunction with our Aurora\nSurgiscope to safely address and evacuate blood in the brain caused by hemorrhagic stroke. \nWe are focused on the development of core clinical applications in our electromechanical technologies portfolio. In June 2022, we launched the Neutus  EVD\nsystem, our first EVD in China. The Neutus EVD system is manufactured in China by Shanghai Haoju Medical Technology Co., Ltd. under an exclusive\ndistribution arrangement. The device is used in the management of CSF and is highly complementary to our Bactiseal  catheter and advanced intercranial\npressure monitoring products. In 2021, we launched our CereLink ICP Monitor System in the U.S. and Europe direct markets and continued the global rollout\nin the first half of 2022. CereLink provides enhanced accuracy, usability and advanced data presentation that provides clinicians with uncompromised,\nadvanced continuous ICP monitoring that until now, has not been available when treating patients with traumatic brain injuries.

During 2021, we completed one of the largest diabetic foot ulcers (\"DFU\"),\nrandomized controlled trials of the PriMatrix Dermal Repair Scaffold for the management of DFU. This multi-center study enrolled more than 225 patients\nwith chronic DFU's over the course of 12-week treatments and 4-week follow-up phases. The results of this study, which was published in the Journal of\nWound Care, demonstrated that PriMatrix plus standard of care SOC consisting of sharp debridement, infection elimination, use of dressings and offloading\nwas significantly more likely to achieve complete wound closure compared with SOC alone, with a median number of one application of the product. During\n2020, we announced positive clinical and economic data on Integra  Bilayer Wound Matrix (\"IBWM\") in complex lower extremity reconstruction based on\ntwo retrospective studies recently published in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, the official journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. As\nsurgeons look for ways to efficiently and effectively repair and close wounds, IBWM helps address the efficiency needed in operating rooms by reducing both\nthe operating time and costs to hospitals and patients.\nFDA Matters\nOn August 18, 2022, the Company, after consultation with the FDA and other regulatory authorities outside of the United States, initiated an immediate\nvoluntary global product removal of all CereLink intracranial pressure monitors as a result of customer reports about monitors whose pressure readings were\nout of range. The Company believes that the out-of-range readings are principally caused by electrical interference from the external environment and/or\ninterference from a component on the circuit board of the monitor. These out-of-range readings have occurred at a low incidence rate and at a limited number\nof sites; however, out of an abundance of caution, the Company removed all CereLink monitors from the field.\nThe Company Is continuing its investigation into the matter in order to remedy the observed issue and plans to resume shipment of the CereLink monitors as\nsoon as any such issues have been resolved. Based on outlook for returning the product to market and feedback from customers, the Company recorded a $1.9\nmillion provision for product returns, as a reduction of net revenue, and a $0.8 million rework accrual in cost of goods sold in 2022.\nWe manufacture and distribute products derived from human tissue for which FDA has specific regulations governing human cells, tissues and cellular and\ntissue-based products (\"HCT/P\"). An HCT/P is a product containing or consisting of human cells or tissue intended for transplantation into a human patient.\nRefer to Item 1. Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further details around these FDA regulations and their potential effect on the Company's portfolio of\nmorselized amniotic material-based products as well as the impact on consolidated revenues.\nOn March 7, 2019, TEI Biosciences, Inc. (\"TEI\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company received a Warning Letter (the “Warning Letter”), dated March\n6, 2019, from the FDA. The warning letter related to quality systems issues at TEI's manufacturing facility located in Boston, Massachusetts. The letter\nresulted from an inspection held at that facility in October and November 2018 and did not identify any new observations that were not already provided in\nthe Form 483 that followed the inspection. The Company submitted its initial response to the FDA Warning Letter on March 28, 2019 and provides regular\nprogress reports to the FDA as to its corrective actions and, since the conclusion of the inspection, has undertaken significant efforts to remediate the\nobservations and continues to do so. On October 28, 2021 the FDA initiated an inspection of the facility and at the conclusion of the inspection issued a FDA\nForm 483 on November 12, 2021 (the \"2021 Form 483\"). The Company provided an initial response to the inspection observations and will continue to\nprovide responses to FDA. The Warning Letter and the 2021 FDA Form 483 do not restrict the Company’s ability to manufacture or ship products or require\nthe recall of any products, nor do they restrict our ability to seek FDA 510(k) clearance of products. Additionally, premarket approval applications for Class\nIII devices to which the Quality System regulation violations are reasonably related will not be approved until the violations have been corrected. The TEI\nBoston facility manufactures extracellular bovine matrix products. We cannot give any assurances that the FDA will be satisfied with our response to the\nWarning Letter or as to the expected date of the resolution of the matters included in the letter. Until the issues cited in the letter are resolved to the FDA’s\nsatisfaction, the FDA may initiate additional regulatory action without further notice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict\nus from effectively manufacturing, marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nRevenues of products manufactured in the TEI Boston facility for the year ended December 31, 2022 were approximately 5.3% of consolidated revenues.\n®\n35"

These efforts are expected to continue and while we expect a positive impact from ongoing\nrestructuring, integration, and manufacturing transfer and expansion activities, such results remain uncertain. In support of our continued focus on product\nmargins during 2022, we closed a manufacturing facility located in France and began the transfer of production to the Company’s existing Switzerland\nfacility. The transfer completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. In 2022, we outsourced certain transactional back-office finance and customer service activities\nto enhance customer quality, build scale for future growth, and capture cost efficiencies. This transition also completed in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Excluding the impacts of these items, domestic revenues increased by $41.6 million, or\n3.8%. International revenues increased by $21.7 million or 4.8%.\nIn the CSS segment, revenues were $1,019.6 million which was a decrease of $5.7 million, or 0.6% as compared to the prior-year period. This increase is\ninclusive of a $34.1 million unfavorable foreign currency impact on revenue. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, the CSS segment revenues increased\n$28.4 million as compared to the prior year period. This increase was driven primarily by low single digits growth in both our Neurosurgery and Instruments\nportfolios as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in our Neurosurgery portfolio was driven primarily by growth in advanced energy\nand CSF management, partially offset by the voluntary recall of the CereLink ICP monitoring system.\nIn the TT segment, revenues were $538.1 million, which was an increase of $20.9 million, or 4.0% as compared to the prior-year period.. Excluding the\nimpact of foreign currency of $3.8 million and the divestiture impact of TWC of $10.2 million, the TT segment revenues in the third quarter increased by\n$34.9 million. This increase was driven by mid-single digit increases in our Wound Reconstruction business, led by Integra  Dermal Matrices, SurgiMend and\nACell MicroMatrix and low double digit increased in our Private Label business driven by higher customer demand and favorable order timing.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was $970.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $25.7 million from $944.6 million for the same period last year. Gross\nmargin as a percentage of revenues was 62.3% in 2022 and 61.2% in 2021. The increase in gross margin percentage was due to higher revenues and a\nreduction of inventory step up amortization in connection with the acquisition of ACell in the prior year. These were partially offset by CereLink recall\nimpacts, unfavorable regional mix, and higher material and labor costs.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following is a summary of operating expenses as a percent of total revenues: \n \nYears Ended December 31,\n \n2022\n2021\nResearch and development\n6.5 %\n6.0 %\nSelling, general and administrative\n39.6 %\n41.3 %\nIntangible asset amortization\n0.9 %\n1.1 %\n Total operating expenses\n47.0 %\n48.4 %\nTotal operating expenses, which consist of research and development, selling, general and administrative, and intangible asset amortization expenses,\ndecreased by $16.0 million or 2.1% to $731.4 million in 2022, compared to $747.4 million in the prior year. The decrease in operating expenses is due to\nlower selling, general and administrative costs and amortization partially offset by higher R&D spending.\n®\n \n38"

We consider these factors and others, including our history of generating taxable earnings, in assessing our ability to realize deferred tax assets. We\nestimate our worldwide effective income tax rate for 2023 to be approximately 20.7%, estimated based on existing tax laws.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had $9.7 million of valuation allowance against the remaining $195.2 million of gross deferred tax assets recorded at\nDecember 31, 2022. Our deferred tax asset valuation allowance decreased by $0.1 million in 2022, remaining substantially unchanged in 2021. This valuation\nallowance relates to deferred tax assets for which the Company does not believe it has satisfied the more likely than not threshold for realization.\nAt December 31, 2022, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $79.5 million for federal income tax purposes, $75.5 million for foreign income tax\npurposes and $37.9 million for state income tax purposes to offset future taxable income.

See Note 12, Income Taxes to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for details.\nThe Company cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the uncertain tax benefits may be realized.\nEmployee Termination Benefits\nThe Company incurred employee termination costs on restructuring activities associated with a closure of a manufacturing facility located in France,\noutsourcing plans for select transactional back office activities, and executive reorganization in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. In 2021, the Company incurred employee termination costs on restructuring activities associated with the closure of the manufacturing\nfacility in France. Restructuring costs were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part IV, Item 15 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K) for further details.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE USE OF ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these financial statements requires\nus to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities, and the reported\namounts of revenues and expenses. Significant estimates affecting amounts reported or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements include allowances\nfor doubtful accounts receivable and sales returns and allowances, net realizable value of inventories, valuation of intangible assets including amortization\nperiods for acquired intangible assets, discount rates and estimated projected cash flows used to value and test impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill,\nestimates of projected cash flows and depreciation and amortization periods for long-lived assets, computation of taxes, valuation allowances recorded against\ndeferred tax assets, the valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of derivative instruments, valuation of contingent liabilities, the fair value of debt\ninstruments and loss contingencies. These estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable\nunder the current circumstances.\nAs we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and recent variants of the virus, as well as the adverse impacts to global economic conditions, supply\nchain and our operations, there may be impact to future estimates including, but not limited to, inventory valuations, fair value measurements, goodwill and\nlong-lived asset impairments, the effectiveness of the Company’s hedging instruments, deferred tax valuation allowances, and allowances for doubtful\naccounts receivable.\nWe believe that the following accounting policies, which form the basis for developing these estimates, are those that are most critical to the presentation of\nour consolidated financial statements and require the more difficult subjective and complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the\neffect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of this uncertainty, actual results could differ from these estimates.\n43"

      "text": "Inventories\nInventories, consisting of purchased materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead, are stated at the lower of cost (determined by the first-in, first-out\nmethod) or net realizable value. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate ending inventories for excess quantities, obsolescence or shelf-life expiration. Our\nevaluation includes an analysis of historical sales levels by product, projections of future demand by product, the risk of technological or competitive\nobsolescence for our products, general market conditions, a review of the shelf-life expiration dates for our products, and the feasibility of reworking or using\nexcess or obsolete products or components in the production or assembly of other products that are not obsolete or for which we do not have excess quantities\nin inventory. To the extent that we determine there are excess or obsolete quantities or quantities with a shelf life that is too near its expiration for us to\nreasonably expect that we can sell those products prior to their expiration, we adjust their carrying value to estimated net realizable value. If future demand or\nmarket conditions are lower than our projections, or if we are unable to rework excess or obsolete quantities into other products, we may record further\nadjustments to the carrying value of inventory through a charge to cost of product revenues in the period the revision is made. As of December 31, 2022, our\nreserve for inventory obsolesce is 6% of total inventory on our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with certain products prior to regulatory approval, based on management's judgment of probable\neconomic benefit. The Company could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre-approval inventory upon a change in such judgment,\ndue to, among other potential factors, a denial or delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies or a decision by management to discontinue the related\ndevelopment program.\nAcquisitions\nResults of operations of acquired companies are included in the Company’s results of operations as of the respective acquisition dates. The Company accounts\nfor the acquisition of a business in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (\"ASC Topic 805\"). Amounts paid to acquire a business are\nallocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value\nof the net assets acquired in recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred.\nContingent consideration is recorded at fair value as measured on the date of acquisition. The value recorded is based on estimates of future financial\nprojections under various potential scenarios using either a Monte Carlo simulation or the probability-weighted income approach derived from revenue\nestimates and probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving contingent obligations. Contingent payments related to acquisitions consist of\ndevelopment, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments, in addition to sales-based payments, and are valued using discounted cash flow techniques.\nEach quarter until such contingent amounts are earned, the fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting period and adjusted as a component of\noperating expenses based on changes to the underlying assumptions. The change in the fair value of sales-based payments is based upon future revenue\nestimates and increases or decreases as revenue estimates or expectation of timing of payment charges. The estimates used to determine the fair value of the\ncontingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment and actual results are likely to differ from the amounts originally recorded.\nThe Company determines the fair value of acquired intangible assets based on detailed valuations that use certain information and assumptions provided by\nmanagement. The Company allocates any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill. Determining\nthe fair value of these intangible assets, acquired as part of a business combination requires the Company to make significant estimates. These estimates\ninclude the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value, the assessment of the\nasset’s life cycle, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks. The fair value assigned to other intangible assets is\ndetermined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate\nused is determined at the time of measurement in accordance with accepted valuation methodologies.\nIn our most recent acquisition of SIA, the key areas of judgement relating to the valuation of the acquired definite-lived developed technology intangible\nassets were the net revenue growth rates, cost of sales, selling and marketing costs, discounts rates, and asset useful life. The key areas of judgement relating\nto the valuation of the contingent consideration are the inputs to the Monte-Carlo model including revenue-adjusted discount rate, counterpart discount rate,\nrevenue volatility and forecasted revenue, earnings before income taxes and fixed costs. These assumptions were developed with the assistance of a third-\nparty valuation expert.\n44"

      "text": "Acquired IPR&D is recognized at fair value and initially characterized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, irrespective of whether the acquired IPR&D has\nan alternative future use. The Company uses the income approach to determine the fair value of developed technology and IPR&D acquired in a business\ncombination. This approach determines fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to the respective asset over its useful life and then\ndiscounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of those asset valuations\ninclude the estimated net cash flows for each year for each product including net revenues, cost of sales, R&D costs, selling and marketing costs, the\nappropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset’s life cycle, and\ncompetitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream. The Company also uses the income approach, as described above, to determine the\nestimated fair value of certain other identifiable intangible assets including customer relationships, trade names and business licenses. Customer relationships\nrepresent established relationships with customers, which provide a ready channel for the sale of additional products and services. Trade names represent\nacquired company and product names.\nIPR&D acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed\nas incurred. Upon receipt of regulatory approval, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a\nstraight-line basis or accelerated basis, as appropriate, over its estimated useful life. If the research and development project is subsequently abandoned, the\nindefinite-lived intangible asset is charged to expense. IPR&D acquired outside of a business combination is expensed immediately.\nDue to the uncertainty associated with research and development projects, there is risk that actual results will differ materially from the original cash flow\nprojections and that the research and development project will result in a successful commercial product. The risks associated with achieving\ncommercialization include, but are not limited to, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approvals to conduct clinical trials, delay or failure to obtain required\nmarket clearances, delays or issues with patent issuance, or validity and litigation.\nIf the acquired net assets do not constitute a business under the acquisition method of accounting, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition and\nno goodwill is recognized. In an asset acquisition, the amount allocated to acquired IPR&D with no alternative future use is charged to expense at the\nacquisition date. Payments that would be recognized as contingent consideration in a business combination are expensed when probable in an asset\nacquisition. Refer to Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K) for details.\nValuation of Goodwill\nThe excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is reviewed\nfor impairment at the reporting unit level annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. The Company's assessment of the recoverability of\ngoodwill is based upon a comparison of the carrying value of goodwill with its estimated fair value. Key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of\ngoodwill include the Company's discounts rate and forecasted operating results. The Company had goodwill on the balance sheet of $1 billion as of December\n31, 2022. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment in the third quarter every year in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\n(\"ASC Topic 350\"), and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Refer to Note 7,\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for more\ninformation.\nValuation of Identifiable Intangible Assets\nThe Company tests intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually in the third quarter in accordance with ASC Topic 350. Additionally, the\nCompany may perform interim tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of a indefinite lived intangible\nasset below its carrying amount. The Company tests for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative\nevaluation is an assessment of factors, including specific operating results as well as industry, market and general economic conditions, to determine whether\nit is more likely than not that the fair values of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. The Company may elect to bypass this qualitative\nevaluation and perform a quantitative test. There were no changes to identifiable intangible assets as a result of the Company's assessments.\nProduct rights and other definite-lived intangible assets are tested periodically for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and\nEquipment, (\"ASC Topic 360\") when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment test\ninvolves comparing the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows. In the event the carrying value of the\nasset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying value is considered not recoverable and impairment exists. An impairment loss is measured as\nthe excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value, calculated using discounted future cash flows. The computed impairment loss is recognized in the\nperiod that the impairment occurs.\n45"

      "text": "As of December 31, 2022, the Company has $1.1 billion of identifiable intangible assets, net on the balance sheets.\nIncome Taxes\nSince we conduct operations on a global basis, our effective tax rate has and will depend upon the geographic distribution of our pre-tax earnings among\nlocations with varying tax rates. Changes in the tax rates of the various jurisdictions in which we operate affect our profits. In addition, we maintain a reserve\nfor uncertain tax benefits, changes to which could impact our effective tax rate in the period such changes are made. The effective tax rate can also be\nimpacted by changes in valuation allowances of deferred tax assets, and tax law changes.\nOur provision for income taxes may change period-to-period based on specific events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as\nwell as general factors, including the geographic mix of income before taxes, state and local taxes and the effects of the Company's global income tax\nstrategies. We maintain strategic management and operational activities in overseas subsidiaries. See Note 12, Income Taxes, to the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements (Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), in our consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to foreign and\ndomestic pretax income, foreign and domestic income tax expense (benefit) and the effect foreign taxes have on our overall effective tax rate.\nWe recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of\nthe position. The amount of the accrual for which an exposure exists is measured by determining the amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of\nbeing realized upon ultimate settlement of the position. Components of the reserve are classified as a long-term liability in the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe record interest and penalties accrued in relation to uncertain tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nWe believe that we have identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and that the reserve we have established for identifiable exposures is appropriate\nunder the circumstances; however, it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures will be settled at amounts different from the amounts\nreserved. It is also possible that changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of our tax\nreserves.\nOur deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting\npurposes and their basis for income tax purposes, and the temporary differences created by the tax effects of capital loss, net operating loss and tax credit\ncarryforwards. We record valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We could\nrecognize no benefit from our deferred tax assets or we could recognize some or all of the future benefit depending on the amount and timing of taxable\nincome we generate in the future.\nWe intend to indefinitely reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries unless there is a tax–free manner under which to remit\nthe earnings. The current analysis indicates that we have sufficient U.S. liquidity, including borrowing capacity, to fund foreseeable U.S. cash needs without\nrequiring the repatriation of foreign cash. One time or unusual items that may impact our ability or intent to keep the foreign earnings and cash indefinitely\nreinvested include significant U.S. acquisitions, loans from a foreign subsidiary, and changes in tax laws.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has not provided deferred income taxes on unrepatriated earnings from foreign subsidiaries as they are deemed to be\nindefinitely reinvested unless there is a manner under which to remit the earnings with no material tax cost. Such taxes would primarily be attributable to\nforeign withholding taxes and local income taxes when such earnings are distributed.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K), to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition. To manage the volatility relating to these typical business exposures, we may enter into various derivative transactions\nwhen appropriate. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.\n46"

      "text": "Foreign Currency Exchange and Other Rate Risks\nWe operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial condition, results\nof operations and cash flows. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in\nEuros, British pounds, Swiss francs, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, Mexican pesos, Brazilian reais, Australian dollars and Chinese yuan. We manage the\nforeign currency exposure centrally, on a combined basis, which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets. To mitigate the\nimpact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments in the\nform of foreign currency exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions. We temporarily record realized and unrealized gains and losses on\nthese contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income, and then recognize them in other income or expense when the hedged item\naffects net earnings.\nFrom time to time, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for transactions denominated in a currency other\nthan an entity’s functional currency. As a result, the impact of foreign currency gains/losses recognized in earnings are partially offset by gains/losses on the\nrelated foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period. Refer to Note 6, Derivative Instruments, to the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements (Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for additional information.\nWe maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities. With respect to derivatives, changes in hedged items are generally\nexpected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments. Consequently, foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to\nmaterial risk due to exchange rate movements, because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities or transactions being\nhedged.\nThe results of operations discussed herein have not been materially affected by inflation.\nInterest Rate Risk\nCash and Cash Equivalents - We are exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations on the interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. A\nhypothetical 100 basis points movement in interest rates applicable to our cash and cash equivalents outstanding at December 31, 2022 would increase interest\nincome by approximately $5.1 million on an annual basis. No significant decrease in interest income would be expected as our cash balances are earning\ninterest at rates of approximately one basis points. We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to cash balances maintained in foreign\ncurrencies.\nDebt - Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar LIBOR-indexed borrowings. We use interest rate swap derivative instruments to manage our\nearnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates. These interest rate swaps fix the interest rate on a portion of our expected LIBOR-indexed\nfloating-rate borrowings.

Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit\nrelationship of possible controls and procedures. Management has designed our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of\nachieving the desired control objectives.\nAs required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), we have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,\nincluding our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures as of December 31, 2022. Based upon this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022 to provide such reasonable assurance.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates of America (“GAAP”). We recognize that because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria described in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based upon this evaluation, management\nconcluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter\nended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.\nOTHER INFORMATION\nThe following disclosure is intended to satisfy any obligation to provide disclosures pursuant to Item 5.03 of Form 8-K.\nEffective as of February 21, 2023, based on the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors (the\n“Board”) of Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation (the “Company”), in connection with the new Securities and Exchange Commission rules and\nchanges to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), regarding universal proxy cards, certain recent changes to the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\"), and a periodic review of corporate governance matters, the Board approved amendments to the Company’s Second\nAmended and Restated Bylaws, as amended (the “Third A&R Bylaws”).\nThe Third A&R Bylaws, among other things:\n•\nAddress matters relating to Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act (the \"Universal Proxy Rules\"), including requiring: (a) the stockholder’s nomination\nnotice to include a representation that it intends to solicit proxies from stockholders representing at least 67% of the voting power of shares entitled\nto vote on the election of directors; (b) the stockholder to comply with the Universal Proxy Rules and provide reasonable evidence thereof prior to\nthe stockholder meeting; and (c) the stockholder to use a proxy card color other than white, which is reserved for the exclusive use of the Board.\n(Article 2, Sections 2.03, 2.08, and 2.10)\n•\nEnhance the informational and procedural requirements in connection with stockholder proposals and stockholder director nominations, including:\n(a) requiring additional information about the stockholder making the director\n49"

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal\nControl - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for convertible instruments in 2021.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and\nfor its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing\nsuch other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and\nF-1"

Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated\nor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements\nand (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nSurgical Innovation Associates, Inc. Acquisition - Valuation of Developed Technology Intangible Asset\nAs described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, on December 6, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of Surgical Innovation\nAssociates, Inc. (SIA) for an acquisition purchase price of $51.5 million, and will pay up to an additional $50 million upon the achievement of certain\nrevenue-based performance milestones in 2023, 2024, and 2025 and up to an additional $40.0M upon the approval by the FDA of the Premarketing Approval\nApplication for DuraSorb. The acquisition also resulted in a $75 million developed technology intangible asset being recorded. The estimated fair value of the\ndeveloped technology acquired was determined by management using the multi-period excess earnings method of the income approach. Management’s\nsignificant assumptions used in the estimate of fair value included the estimated net cash flows, including net revenues, cost of sales, research and\ndevelopment costs, selling and marketing costs, working capital, contributory asset charges, discount rate, the asset’s life cycle, and competitive trends\nimpacting the asset and the cash flow stream.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of developed technology intangible asset from the\nacquisition of Surgical Innovation Associates, Inc. is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value\nestimate of the acquired developed technology intangible asset, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment , subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and\nevaluating management’s significant assumptions related to net revenues, cost of sales, discount rate and the asset’s life cycle; and (iii) the audit effort\ninvolved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over\nmanagement’s valuation of the acquired developed technology intangible asset and controls over the development of significant assumptions related to net\nrevenues, cost of sales, discount rate and the asset’s life cycle. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement and (ii)\ntesting management’s process for developing the estimated fair value of the developed technology intangible asset. Testing management’s process included\nevaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method, testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the method, and\nevaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management related to net revenues, cost of sales, discount rate and the asset’s life cycle.\nEvaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to net revenues, cost of sales, and the asset’s life cycle involved considering (i) current\nand past performance of the product associated with the developed technology acquired; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii)\nwhether the assumptions are consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to\nassist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company’s multi-period excess earnings method and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate and the\nasset’s life cycle assumptions.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nFlorham Park, New Jersey\nFebruary 22, 2023\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1989.\nF-2"

      "text": "INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. BUSINESS\nIntegra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware in 1989. The Company is a worldwide leader in medical\ntechnology. The Company was founded with the acquisition of an engineered collagen technology platform used to repair and regenerate tissue. Since then,\nIntegra has developed numerous product lines from this technology for applications ranging from burn and deep tissue wounds to the repair of dura mater in\nthe brain, as well as nerves and tendons. The Company has expanded its base regenerative technology business to include surgical instruments, neurosurgical\nproducts and advanced wound care through global acquisitions and product development to meet the evolving needs of its customers and enhance patient\ncare. The Company sells its products directly through various sales forces and through a variety of other distribution channels.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION\nThese financial statements and the accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica and conform to Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for details of new subsidiaries included in the consolidation.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements is in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") which\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities, and\nthe reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant estimates affecting amounts reported or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements include\nallowances for doubtful accounts receivable and sales returns and allowances, net realizable value of inventories, valuation of intangible assets including\namortization periods for acquired intangible assets, discount rates and estimated projected cash flows used to value and test impairments of long-lived assets\nand goodwill, estimates of projected cash flows and depreciation and amortization periods for long-lived assets, computation of taxes, valuation allowances\nrecorded against deferred tax assets, the valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of derivative instruments, valuation of contingent liabilities, the fair\nvalue of debt instruments and loss contingencies. These estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be\nreasonable under the current circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. As the Company continues to navigate the novel coronavirus\n(\"COVID-19\") pandemic and recent variants of the virus as well as the adverse impacts to global economic conditions, supply chain and the operations, there\nmay be impact to future estimates including, but not limited to, inventory valuations, fair value measurements, goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, the\neffectiveness of the Company’s hedging instruments, deferred tax valuation allowances, and allowances for doubtful accounts receivable.\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nThe Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. These\ninvestments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.\nTRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company grants credit to customers in the normal course of\nbusiness, but generally does not require collateral or any other security to support its receivables.\nThe Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. The Company recognizes a provision for doubtful\naccounts that reflects the Company’s estimate of expected credit losses for trade accounts receivable. In circumstances where a specific customer is unable to\nmeet its financial obligations to the Company, a provision to the allowances for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net\nrecognized receivable to the amount that is reasonably expected to be collected. For all other customers, the Company evaluates measurement of all expected\ncredit losses for trade receivables held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nF - 8"

      "text": "INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\nThe Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020 using a modified retrospective transition method which requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the\nopening balance of retained earnings to be recognized on the date of adoption with no change to financial results reported in prior periods. The cumulative-\neffect adjustment recorded on January 1, 2020 was not material. The adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated\nfinancial statements and related disclosures. The Company's exposure to credit losses may increase if its customers are adversely affected by changes in\nhealthcare laws, coverage, and reimbursement, economic pressures or uncertainty associated with local or global economic recessions, disruption associated\nwith the COVID-19 pandemic and recent variants of the virus, and other customer-specific factors. Although the Company has historically not experienced\nsignificant credit losses, it is possible that there could be an adverse impact due to customer and governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nProvisions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded to selling, general and administrative expenses. Account balances are charged off against the\nallowance when it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered.

To the extent that management\ndetermines there are excess or obsolete inventory or quantities with a shelf life that is too near its expiration for the Company to reasonably expect that it can\nsell those products prior to their expiration, the Company adjusts the carrying value to estimated net realizable value.\nThe Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with certain products prior to regulatory approval, based on management's judgment of probable\neconomic benefit. The Company could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre-approval inventory upon a change in such judgment,\ndue to, among other potential factors, a denial or delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies or a decision by management to discontinue the related\ndevelopment program. No such amounts were capitalized at December 31, 2022 or 2021.\n(1)\nF-9"

The Company accounts\nfor the acquisition of a business in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (\"ASC Topic 805\"). Amounts paid to acquire a business are allocated to\nthe assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net\nassets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred.\nContingent consideration is recorded at fair value as measured on the date of acquisition. The value recorded is based on estimates of future financial\nprojections under various potential scenarios using either a Monte Carlo simulation or the probability-weighted income approach derived from revenue\nestimates and probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving contingent obligations. Contingent payments related to acquisitions consist of\ndevelopment, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments, in addition to sales-based payments, and are valued using discounted cash flow techniques.\nEach quarter until such contingent amounts are earned, the fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting period and adjusted as a component of\noperating expenses based on changes to the underlying assumptions. The change in the fair value of sales-based payments is based upon future revenue\nestimates and increases or decreases as revenue estimates or expectation of timing of payment charges. The estimates used to determine the fair value of the\ncontingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment and actual results are likely to differ from the amounts originally recorded.\nF-10"

      "text": "INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nThe Company determines the fair value of acquired intangible assets based on detailed valuations that use certain information and assumptions provided by\nmanagement. The Company allocates any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill. Determining\nthe fair value of these intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires the Company to make significant estimates. These estimates\ninclude the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value, the assessment of the\nasset’s life cycle, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks. The fair value assigned to other intangible assets is\ndetermined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate\nused is determined at the time of measurement in accordance with accepted valuation methodologies.\nAcquired IPR&D is recognized at fair value and initially characterized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, irrespective of whether the acquired IPR&D has\nan alternative future use. The Company uses the income approach to determine the fair value of developed technology and IPR&D acquired in a business\ncombination. This approach determines fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to the respective asset over its useful life and then\ndiscounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of those asset valuations\ninclude the estimated net cash flows for each year for each product including net revenues, cost of sales, R&D costs, selling and marketing costs, the\nappropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset’s life cycle, and\ncompetitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream. The Company also uses the income approach, as described above, to determine the\nestimated fair value of certain other identifiable intangible assets including customer relationships, trade names and business licenses. Customer relationships\nrepresent established relationships with customers, which provide a ready channel for the sale of additional products and services. Trade names represent\nacquired company and product names.\nIPR&D acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed\nas incurred. Upon receipt of regulatory approval, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a\nstraight-line basis or accelerated basis, as appropriate, over its estimated useful life. If the research and development project is subsequently abandoned, the\nindefinite-lived intangible asset is charged to expense. IPR&D acquired outside of a business combination is expensed immediately.\nDue to the uncertainty associated with research and development projects, there is risk that actual results will differ materially from the original cash flow\nprojections and that the research and development project will result in a successful commercial product. The risks associated with achieving\ncommercialization include, but are not limited to, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approvals to conduct clinical trials, delay or failure to obtain required\nmarket clearances, delays or issues with patent\nissuance, or validity and litigation.\nIf the acquired net assets do not constitute a business under the acquisition method of accounting, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition and\nno goodwill is recognized. In an asset acquisition, the amount allocated to acquired IPR&D with no alternative future use is charged to expense at the\nacquisition date. Payments that would be recognized as contingent consideration in a business combination are expensed when probable in an asset\nacquisition. Refer to Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures for more information.\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is reviewed\nfor impairment at the reporting unit level annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. The Company's assessment of the recoverability of\ngoodwill is based upon a comparison of the carrying value of goodwill with its estimated fair value. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment in the\nthird quarter every year in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\"ASC Topic 350\") and whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Refer to Note 7, Goodwill and Other Intangibles for more information.\nThe Company has two reportable segments with three underlying reporting units. Refer to Note 16, Segment and Geographic Information for more\ninformation on reportable segments.\nOther intangible assets include patents, trademarks, purchased technology, and supplier and customer relationships. Identifiable intangible assets are initially\nrecorded at fair market value at the time of acquisition generally using an income or cost approach. The Company capitalizes costs incurred to renew or\nextend the term of recognized intangible assets and amortizes those costs\nover their expected useful lives.\nF-11"

      "text": "INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nThe Company tests intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually in the third quarter in accordance with ASC Topic 350. Additionally, the\nCompany may perform interim tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible\nasset below its carrying amount. The Company tests for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative\nevaluation is an assessment of factors, including specific operating results as well as industry, market and general economic conditions, to determine whether\nit is more likely than not that the fair values of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. The Company may elect to bypass this qualitative\nevaluation and perform a quantitative test.\nProduct rights and other definite-lived intangible assets are tested periodically for impairment in accordance with ASC 350 Topic when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that an asset's carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset or\nasset group to the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows. In the event the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the\ncarrying value is considered not recoverable and impairment exists. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair\nvalue, calculated using discounted future cash flows. The computed impairment loss is recognized in the period that the impairment occurs.\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS\nLong-lived assets held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and leases are reviewed for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of evaluating the\nrecoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used, a recoverability test is performed using projected undiscounted net cash flows applicable to the long-\nlived assets. If an impairment exists, the amount of such impairment is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the asset. Impairments to long-lived\nassets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the applicable assets.\nINTEGRA FOUNDATION\nThe Company may periodically make contributions to the Integra Foundation, Inc. The Integra Foundation was incorporated in 2002 exclusively for\ncharitable, educational, and scientific purposes and qualifies under IRC 501(c)(3) as an exempt private foundation. Under its charter, the Integra Foundation\nengages in activities that promote health, the diagnosis and treatment of disease, and the development of medical science through grants, contributions and\nother appropriate means. The Integra Foundation is a separate legal entity and is not a subsidiary of the Company; therefore, its results are not included in\nthese consolidated financial statements. The Company contributed $0.0 million, $1.2 million and $0.8 million to the Integra Foundation during the years\nended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These contributions were recorded in selling, general, and administrative expense.\nDERIVATIVES\nThe Company develops, manufactures, and sells medical devices globally and its earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in interest\nrates and currency exchange rates. The Company addresses these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial\ninstruments and operates the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. All derivative financial instruments are recognized in the\nfinancial statements at fair value in accordance with the authoritative guidance. Under the guidance, for those instruments that are designated and qualify as\nhedging instruments, the hedging instrument must be designated as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation,\nbased on the exposure being hedged. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and\nqualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. The Company's derivative instruments do not subject its earnings\nor cash flows to material risk, and gains and losses on these derivatives generally offset losses and gains on the item being hedged. The Company has not\nentered into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. From time to time, the Company may enter into derivatives that are not designated as hedging\ninstruments in order to protect itself from currency volatility due to intercompany balances.\nAll derivative instruments are recognized at the fair values as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. The Company determines the fair value of its\nderivative instruments using the framework prescribed by the authoritative guidance, by considering the estimated amount the Company would receive to sell\nor transfer these instruments at the reporting date and by taking into account expected forward interest rates, currency exchange rates, the creditworthiness of\nthe counterparty for assets, and its creditworthiness for liabilities. In certain instances, the Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model to measure fair\nvalue. Generally, the Company uses inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, other observable inputs for the asset or\nliability and inputs derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means. The Company has classified all of its\nderivative assets and liabilities within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of its derivative\ninstruments. The Company classifies derivatives designated as hedges in the same category as the item being hedged for cash flow presentation purposes.\nF-12"

      "text": "INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nThe Company entered into foreign currency forward and foreign currency swap contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting\npurposes. These contracts are recorded at fair value, with the changes in fair value recognized into other income, net, on the consolidated financial statements.\nRefer to Note 6, Derivative Instruments for more information.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY\nAll assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries which have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated at the rate of exchange at year-end,\nwhile elements of the income statement are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. The net effect of these translation adjustments is\nshown as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These currency translation adjustments are not currently adjusted for income taxes\nas they relate to permanent investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign currency transaction net losses of $3.3 million, net gains of less than $0.1 million,\nand net losses $1.6 million are reported in other income, net in the statements of operations, for the year ended December  31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\nINCOME TAXES\nIncome taxes are accounted for by using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax\nconsequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. A\nvaluation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred\ntax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted.\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical\nmerits of the position. Reserves are established for positions that don't meet this recognition threshold. The reserve is measured as the largest amount of\nbenefit determined on a cumulative probability basis that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the position.\nThese reserves are classified as long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets of the Company, unless the reserves are expected to be paid in cash\nduring the next twelve months, in which case they are classified as current liabilities. The Company also records interest and penalties accrued in relation to\nuncertain tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nWhile the Company believes it has identified all reasonable exposures and the reserve it has established is appropriate under the circumstances, it is possible\nthat additional exposures exist and that exposures may be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved. It is also possible that changes in facts and\ncircumstances could cause the Company to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of its tax reserve.\nThe Company continues to indefinitely reinvest substantially all of its foreign earnings unless there is a manner under which to remit the earnings without a\nmaterial tax cost. The current provisional analysis indicates that the Company has sufficient U.S. liquidity, including borrowing capacity, to fund foreseeable\nU.S. cash needs without requiring the repatriation of foreign cash. One time or unusual items that may impact the ability or intent to keep the foreign earnings\nand cash indefinitely reinvested include significant U.S. acquisitions, loans from a foreign subsidiary and changes in tax laws.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nRevenue is recognized upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to the customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the\nCompany expects to receive in exchange for those products and services.\nTotal revenue, net, includes product sales, product royalties and other revenues, such as fees received from services.\nFor products shipped with FOB shipping point terms, the control of the product passes to the customer at the time of shipment. For shipments in which the\ncontrol of the product is transferred when the customer receives the product, the Company recognizes revenue upon receipt by the customer. Certain products\nthat the Company produces for private label customers have no alternative use and the Company has a right of payment for performance to date. Revenues\nfrom those products are recognized over the period that the Company manufactures these products, which is typically one month to three months. The\nCompany uses the input method to measure the manufacturing activities completed to date, which depicts the progress of the Company's performance\nobligation of transferring control of goods being manufactured for private label customers.\nA portion of the Company's product revenue is generated from consigned inventory maintained at hospitals and distributors, and also from inventory\nphysically held by field sales representatives. For these types of products sales, the Company retains control until the product has been used or implanted, at\nwhich time revenue is recognized.\nF-13"

For product sales, invoices are generally issued upon the transfer of control (or upon the completion of the manufacturing in the case of\nthe private label transactions recognized over time) and are typically payable 30 days after the invoice date. The Company performs a review of each specific\ncustomer's creditworthiness and ability to pay prior to acceptance as a customer. Further, the Company performs periodic reviews of its customers'\ncreditworthiness prospectively. Refer to Note 3, Revenue From Contracts With Customers for more information. The Company also maintains a provision for\nestimated returns and allowances in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. This reserve is based upon an analysis of actual credit memos issued\nfor pricing issues or returned goods over an extended period, as well as assumptions about outstanding accounts receivable and judgment in interpreting the\ndata.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nResearch and development costs, including salaries, depreciation, consultant and other external fees, and facility costs directly attributable to research and\ndevelopment activities, are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.\nEMPLOYEE TERMINATION BENEFITS\nThe Company does not have a written severance plan, and it does not offer similar termination benefits to affected employees in all restructuring initiatives.\nAccordingly, in situations where minimum statutory termination benefits must be paid to the affected employees, the Company records employee severance\ncosts associated with these restructuring activities in accordance with the authoritative guidance for non-retirement post-employment benefits. Charges\nassociated with these activities are recorded when the payment of benefits is probable and can be reasonably estimated. In all other situations where the\nCompany pays out termination benefits, including supplemental benefits paid in excess of statutory minimum amounts and benefits offered to affected\nemployees based on management's discretion, the Company records these termination costs in accordance with the authoritative guidance for ASC Topic 712\nCompensation - Nonretirement Benefits and ASC Topic 420 One-time Employee Termination Benefits.\nThe timing of the recognition of charges for employee severance costs other than minimum statutory benefits depends on whether the affected employees are\nrequired to render service beyond their legal notification period in order to receive the benefits. If affected employees are required to render service beyond\ntheir legal notification period, charges are recognized over the future service period. Otherwise, charges are recognized when management has approved a\nspecific plan and employee communication requirements have been met.\nThe Company incurred employee termination costs on restructuring activities associated with a closure of a manufacturing facility in France and other\nreorganization projects in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December  31, 2022. In 2021, the Company incurred employee\ntermination costs on restructuring activities associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility in France.

      "text": "INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nPENSION BENEFITS\nThe Company maintains defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees in France, Japan, Germany and Switzerland. Various factors are\nconsidered in determining the pension liability, including the number of employees expected to be paid their salary levels and years of service, the expected\nreturn on plan assets, the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligations, the timing of benefit payments and other actuarial assumptions.\nRetirement benefit plan assumptions are reassessed on an annual basis or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate a re-evaluation of assumptions\nare required. The key benefit plan assumptions are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is based on average rates on\nbonds that matched the expected cash outflows of the benefit plans. The expected rate of return is based on historical and expected returns on the various\ncategories of plan assets.\nThe Company uses the corridor approach in measuring the amount of net periodic benefit pension cost to recognize each period. The corridor approach defers\nall actuarial gains and losses resulting from variances between actual results and actuarial assumptions. Those unrecognized gains and losses are amortized\nwhen the net gains and losses exceed 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the\nyear. The amount in excess of the corridor is amortized over the average remaining service period to retirement date of active plan participants.\nDeferred Compensation Plan\nThe Company maintains a deferred compensation plan in which certain employees of the Company may defer the payment and taxation of up to 75% of their\nbase salary and up to 100% of bonus amounts and other eligible cash compensation.\nThis deferred compensation is invested in funds offered under the Plan and is valued based on Level 1 measurements in the fair value hierarchy. The purpose\nof the plan is to retain key employees by providing them with an opportunity to defer a portion of their compensation as elected by the participant in\naccordance with the plan. Any amounts set aside to defray the liabilities assumed by the Company will remain the general assets of the Company until such\namounts are distributed to the participants. Assets of the Company's deferred compensation plan are included in Other current assets and recorded at fair value\nbased on their quoted market prices.\nCONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK\nFinancial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, which are held\nat major financial institutions, investment-grade marketable debt securities and trade receivables.\nThe Company's products are sold on an uncollateralized basis and on credit terms based upon a credit risk assessment of each customer. A portion of the\nCompany's trade receivables to customers outside the United States includes sales to foreign distributors, who then sell to government owned or supported\nhealthcare systems.\nNone of the Company's customers accounted for 10% or more of the consolidated net sales during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes: Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, intended to simplify the accounting for\nincome taxes by eliminating certain exceptions related to the approach for intra-period tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an\ninterim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. This guidance also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise\ntaxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard is\neffective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2019-\n12 as of January 1, 2021. Adoption of the standard requires certain changes to be made prospectively, with some changes to be made retrospectively. The\nadoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nF-15"

Topic 848 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to\ncontracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments apply only to contracts,\nhedging relationships, and other transactions that reference London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") or another reference rate expected to be discontinued\nbecause of reference rate reform. The guidance generally can be applied from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. On October 5, 2022, the FASB\napproved an extension of the sunset date of the reference rate reform from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024, past LIBOR’s end date. The Company\ncurrently has contracts that are indexed to LIBOR and are continuing to evaluate the scope of impacted contracts and potential risk. The Company expects all\nLIBOR-based contracts to be replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), which is calculated based on overnight transactions under\nrepurchase agreements backed by Treasury securities. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of private-market participants convened by the\nU.S. Federal Reserve Board and the New York Federal Reserve, has recommended the use of SOFR as a more robust reference rate alternative to LIBOR. The\nuse of SOFR as a substitute for LIBOR is, however, voluntary and may not be suitable for all market participants. There can be no assurance that the\nreplacement rate will be economically equivalent to LIBOR, which could result in higher interest rates for us under our debt facilities. There is no guarantee\nthat a transition from LIBOR to SOFR will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates, or our borrowing costs, any of\nwhich could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt- Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts\nin Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40):Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity.  The guidance simplifies\naccounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments\nwill be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features.  The ASU removes certain settlement\nconditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify. The guidance\nalso simplifies the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas.  The ASU will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2021, and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years using\neither the modified retrospective or full retrospective method.\nAs detailed in Note 5, Debt, on February 4, 2020, the Company issued $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 0.5% Convertible Senior Notes due\n2025 (the \"2025 Notes\"). The 2025 Notes are subject to the guidance included in ASU 2020-06. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2021\nusing the modified retrospective approach which resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment that increased (decreased) the following consolidated balance\nsheet accounts:\nADJUSTMENT\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET CLASSIFICATION\nAMOUNT\n (in millions)\nDeferred tax impact of cumulative-effect adjustment\nDeferred tax liabilities\n$\n(20.6)\nDebt discount reclassification\nLong-term convertible securities\n89.1 \nEquity issuance costs reclassification\nLong-term convertible securities\n(2.5)\nDebt discount amortization and equity costs\nreclassification, net of tax\nRetained Earnings\n(2.8)\nNet impact of cumulative-effect adjustment\nAdditional paid-in capital\n(63.3)\nOn December 9, 2020, the Company made an irrevocable election under the indenture to require the principal portion of its 2025 Notes to be settled in cash\nand any excess in shares. Following the irrevocable notice, only the amounts settled in excess of the principal will be considered in diluted earnings per share\nunder the “if-converted” method. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company’s 2025 Notes were reflected entirely as a liability since the embedded\nconversion feature will no longer be separately presented within stockholders’ equity. Additionally, from January 1, 2021, the Company is no longer incurring\nnon-cash interest expense for the amortization of debt discount.\nIn October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-10, Codification Improvements, which updates various codification topics by clarifying or improving disclosure\nrequirements to align with the regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") . The ASU has been effective for the Company for\nannual and interim periods beginning after January 1, 2021. The Company adopted this standard on the January 1, 2021. The adoption of this guidance did not\nhave a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nF-16"

The Company recorded $5.0 million as an intangible asset in the consolidated balance sheet\nupon achieving the milestone. The remaining obligation was included in accrued liabilities at December 31, 2021 in the consolidated balance sheets. The\nmilestone was fully paid in 2022.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company achieved another developmental milestone which triggered a $20.0 million obligation to be paid to the former\nshareholders of Rebound.

The\nmilestone was paid during the fourth quarter of 2020.\n3. REVENUES FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\nSummary of Accounting Policies on Revenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to the customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the\nCompany expects to receive in exchange for those products and services.\nPerformance Obligations\nThe Company's performance obligations consist mainly of transferring control of goods and services identified in the contracts, purchase orders, or invoices.\nThe Company has no significant multi-element contracts with customers.\nSignificant Judgments\nUsage-based royalties and licenses are estimated based on the provisions of contracts with customers and recognized in the same period that the royalty-based\nproducts are sold by the Company's strategic partners. The Company estimates and recognizes royalty revenue based upon communication with licensees,\nhistorical information, and expected sales trends. Differences between actual reported licensee sales and those that were estimated are adjusted in the period in\nwhich they become known, which is typically the following quarter. Historically, such adjustments have not been significant.\nThe Company estimates returns, price concessions, and discount allowances using the expected value method based on historical trends and other known\nfactors. Rebate allowances are estimated using the most likely method based on each customer contract.\nThe Company's return policy, as set forth in its product catalogs and sales invoices, requires review and authorization in advance prior to the return of product.\nUpon the authorization, a credit will be issued for the goods returned within a set amount of days from the shipment, which is generally 90 days.\nF-17"

Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of those asset valuations\ninclude the estimated net cash flows for each year for each product including net revenues, cost of sales, R&D costs, selling and marketing costs, working\ncapital, and contributory asset charges, the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the\nassessment of the asset’s life cycle, and competitive trends impacting the asset and the cash flow stream.\nThe Company used a discount rate of 18% to arrive at the present value for the acquired intangible assets to reflect the rate of return a market participant\nwould expect to earn and incremental commercial uncertainty in the cash flow projections. No assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used\nto prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will not change. For these and other reasons, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.\nGoodwill\nThe Company allocated goodwill related to the SIA Acquisition to the Tissue Technologies segment. Goodwill is the excess of the consideration transferred\nover the net assets recognized and represents the expected revenue and cost synergies of the combined company and assembled workforce. A key factor that\ncontributes to the recognition of goodwill, and a driver for the Company’s acquisition of SIA, is the attractive growth opportunities presented by the surgical\nmatrix business in the breast reconstruction market. Goodwill recognized as a result of this acquisition is non-deductible for income tax purposes.\nContingent Consideration\nThe Company determines the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration obligations based on a probability-weighted income approach derived\nfrom revenue estimates and a probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving contingent obligations. The fair value measurement is based\non significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined using the fair value concepts in ASC 820.

Under the terms of the\nagreement, Gentell received inventory, equipment, and tooling to manufacture certain MediHoney® and TCC-EZ® products on behalf of the Company. On\nthe close date of this transaction, the Company transferred all inventory associated with these products to Gentell and recognized an asset of $11.1 million, as\na form of a deposit for the inventory transferred, which based on the expected timing of inventory purchases, was primarily included within prepaid expenses\nand other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet.

The Company continues to have the aggregate principal amount of up to approximately $2.2 billion available to it\nthrough the following facilities: (i) a $877.5 million Term Loan facility, and (ii) a $1.3 billion revolving credit facility, which includes a $60 million sublimit\nfor the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $60 million sublimit for swingline loans.\nThe Company’s maximum consolidated total leverage ratio in the financial covenants (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility) is the following:\nFiscal Quarter\nMaximum Consolidated Total Leverage\nRatio\nSeptember 30, 2022 through June 30, 2023\n4.50 to 1.00\nSeptember 30, 2023 and the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter\n4.00 to 1.00\nBorrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a rate equal to the following:\ni.\nthe Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the amendment and restatement) in effect from time to time plus the applicable rate (ranging from 1.00% to\n2.25%), or\nii.\nthe highest of:\n1.\nthe weighted average overnight Federal funds rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 0.50%\n2.\nthe prime lending rate of Bank of America, N.A. or\n3.\nthe one-month Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%\nThe applicable rates are based on the Company’s consolidated total leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of (a) consolidated funded indebtedness as of such date\nless cash that is not subject to any restriction on the use or investment thereof to (b) consolidated EBITDA (as defined by the July 2020 amendment), for the\nperiod of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on such date).\nF-24"

The Senior Credit\nFacility is subject to various financial and negative covenants and at December  31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. In\nconnection with the February 2020 Amendment, the Company capitalized $4.6 million of financing costs in connection with modification of the Senior Credit\nFacility and wrote off $1.2 million of previously capitalized financing costs during the first quarter of 2020. In connection with the July 2020 amendment, the\nCompany expensed $3.3 million of incremental financing costs in connection with the modification of the Senior Credit Facility during the third quarter of\n2020.\nThere was no balance outstanding at December 31, 2022 under the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facility and as of December 31, 2021, there was\n$31.3 million, outstanding under the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facility at weighted average interest rate of 1.4%.

This fair values\nwere determined by using a discounted cash flow model based on current market interest rates available to the Company. These inputs are corroborated by\nobservable market data for similar liabilities and therefore classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 2 inputs represent inputs that are\nobservable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, and are other than active market observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for\nidentical assets or liabilities\nLetters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 totaled $1.6 million. There were no amounts drawn as of December 31, 2022.\nContractual repayments of the Term Loan component of the Senior Credit Facility are due as follows:\nYear-ended December 31, 2022\nPrincipal Repayment\nDollars in thousands\n2023\n$\n38,125 \n2024\n$\n67,500 \n2025\n$\n669,375 \n$\n775,000 \nFuture interest payments on the term loan component of the Senior Credit Facility based on current interest rates are expected to approximate $42.7 million in\n2023, $39.1 million in 2024, and $3.6 million in 2025. Interest is calculated on the term loan portion of the Senior Credit Facility based on LIBOR plus the\nspread paid by the Company. As the revolving credit facility and Securitization Facility can be repaid at any time, no interest has been included in the\ncalculation.\nThe outstanding balance of the revolving credit component of the Senior Credit Facility is due on February 3, 2025.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn February 4, 2020, the Company issued $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 0.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the \"2025 Notes\"). The\n2025 Notes will mature on August 15, 2025 and bear interest at a rate of 0.5% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears, unless earlier converted,\nrepurchased or redeemed in accordance with the terms of the 2025 Notes. The portion of debt proceeds that was classified as equity at the time of the offering\nwas $104.5  million. The effective interest rate implicit in the liability component was 4.2%. In connection with this offering, the Company capitalized\n$13.2 million of financing fees.\nThe 2025 Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company, and are convertible into cash and shares of its common stock based on initial conversion\nrate, subject to adjustment of 13.5739 shares per $1,000 principal amounts of the 2025 Notes (which represents an initial conversion price of $73.67 per\nshare). The 2025 Notes convert only in the following circumstances: (1) if the closing price of the Company's common stock has been at least 130% of the\nconversion price during the period; (2) if the average trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2025 Notes is less than or equal to 98% of the average\nconversion value of the 2025 Notes during a period as defined in the indenture; (3) at any time on or after February 20, 2023; or (4) if specified corporate\ntransactions occur. As of December 31, 2022, none of these conditions existed with respect to the 2025 Notes and as a result the 2025 Notes are classified as\nlong term.\nF-25"

The Company irrevocably elected (1) to eliminate the Company’s\noption to choose physical settlement on any conversion of the 2025 Notes that occurs on or after the date of the First Supplemental Indenture and (2) with\nrespect to any Combination Settlement for a conversion of the 2025 Notes, the Specified Dollar Amount that will be settled in cash per $1,000 principal\namount of the 2025 Notes shall be no lower than $1,000.\nHolders of the Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at 100% of their principal amount, plus\nany accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture relating to the Notes). The Company will also be\nrequired to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their Notes in connection with certain fundamental changes occurring prior to the maturity\ndate or following delivery by the Company of a notice of redemption.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2025 Notes, the Company entered into call transactions and warrant transactions, primarily with affiliates of the initial\npurchasers of the 2025 Notes (the “hedge participants”). The cost of the call transactions was $104.2 million for the 2025 Notes. The Company received\n$44.5  million of proceeds from the warrant transactions for the 2025 Notes. The call transactions involved purchasing call options from the hedge\nparticipants, and the warrant transactions involved selling call options to the hedge participants with a higher strike price than the purchased call options. The\ninitial strike price of the call transactions was $73.67, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those in the 2025 Notes. The initial strike\nprice of the warrant transactions was $113.34 for the 2025 Notes, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments.\nAt December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of the liability was $575.0 million. The fair value of the 2025 Notes at December 31, 2022 was $560.5 million.\nFactors that the Company considered when estimating the fair value of the 2025 Notes included recent quoted market prices or dealer quote. The level of the\n2025 Notes is considered as Level 1.\nAs a result of the adoption of ASU 2020-06, for both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized only cash interest related to the\ncontractual interest coupon on the 2025 Notes of $2.9 million.\nSecuritization Facility\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company entered into an accounts receivable securitization facility (the \"Securitization Facility\") under which accounts\nreceivable of certain domestic subsidiaries are sold on a non-recourse basis to a special purpose entity (“SPE”), which is a bankruptcy-remote, consolidated\nsubsidiary of the Company. Accordingly, the assets of the SPE are not available to satisfy the obligations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. From time\nto time, the SPE may finance such accounts receivable with a revolving loan facility secured by a pledge of such accounts receivable. The amount of\noutstanding borrowings on the Securitization Facility at any one time is limited to $150.0 million. The Securitization Facility Agreement (\"Securitization\nAgreement\") governing the Securitization Facility contains certain covenants and termination events. An occurrence of an event of default or a termination\nevent under this Securitization Agreement may give rise to the right of its counterparty to terminate this facility. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was\nin compliance with the covenants and none of the termination events had occurred.\nOn May 28, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment (the \"May 2021 Amendment\") of the Securitization Facility which extended the maturity date\nfrom December 21, 2021 to May 28, 2024. The May 2021 Amendment does not increase the Company’s total indebtedness.\nAt December  31, 2022 and 2021, the Company  had $104.7  million and $112.5  million, of outstanding borrowings under its Securitization Facility at a\nweighted average interest rate of 5.0% and 1.1%, respectively. The fair value of the outstanding borrowing of the Securitization Facility at December 31, 2022\nwas $104.9  million. These fair values were determined by using a discounted cash flow model based on current market interest rates available to the\nCompany. These inputs are corroborated by observable market data for similar liabilities and therefore classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nLevel 2 inputs represent inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, and are other than active market observable inputs that\nreflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities.\nF-26"

The Company assesses the effectiveness of these derivative instruments and\nhas recorded the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge as unrealized gains or losses in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (“AOCI”), net of tax, until the hedged item affected earnings, at which point any gain or loss was reclassified to earnings. If the\nhedged cash flow does not occur, or if it becomes probable that it will not occur, the Company will reclassify the remaining amount of any gain or loss on the\nrelated cash flow hedge recorded in AOCI to interest expense at that time.\nForeign Currency Hedging\nFrom time to time, the Company enters into foreign currency hedge contracts intended to protect the U.S. dollar value of certain forecasted foreign currency\ndenominated transactions. The Company assesses the effectiveness of the contracts that are designated as hedging instruments. The changes in fair value of\nforeign currency cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI, net of tax. Those amounts are subsequently reclassified to earnings from AOCI as impacted by the\nhedged item when the hedged item affects earnings. If the hedged forecasted transaction does not occur, or if it becomes probable that it will not occur, the\nCompany will reclassify the amount of any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge to earnings at that time. For contracts not designated as hedging\ninstruments, the changes in fair value of the contracts are recognized in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operation, along with the offsetting\nforeign currency gain or loss on the underlying assets or liabilities.\nThe success of the Company’s hedging program depends, in part, on forecasts of certain activity denominated in foreign currency. The Company may\nexperience unanticipated currency exchange gains or losses to the extent that there are differences between forecasted and actual activities during periods of\ncurrency volatility. In addition, changes in currency exchange rates related to any unhedged transactions may affect earnings and cash flows.\nCross-Currency Rate Swaps\nOn October 2, 2017, the Company entered into cross currency swap agreements to convert a notional amount of $300.0 million equivalent to 291.2 million of\nSwiss Francs (\"CHF\") denominated intercompany loans into U.S. dollars. The CHF- denominated intercompany loans were the result of the purchase of\nintellectual property by a subsidiary in Switzerland as part of an acquisition. On September 26, 2022, the Company amended the CHF-denominated\nintercompany loan to extend the termination date to September 2023 and as a result, the Company early terminated the cross-currency swap designated as\ncash flow hedge of an intercompany loan with aggregate notional amount of $50.0 million.

The loss recorded by the Company upon the settlement of the swap was not material for the period. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, $49.1 million of the $300.0 million notional amount remain outstanding.\nOn December 21, 2020, the Company entered into cross-currency swap agreements to convert a notional amount of $471.6 million equivalent to 420.1\nmillion of a CHF-denominated intercompany loan into U.S. dollars. The CHF-denominated intercompany loan was the result of an intra-entity transfer of\ncertain intellectual property rights to a subsidiary in Switzerland completed during the fourth quarter of 2020. The intercompany loan requires quarterly\npayments of CHF 5.8  million plus accrued interest. As a result, the aggregate notional amount of the related cross-currency swaps will decrease by a\ncorresponding amount.\nThe objective of these cross-currency swaps is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in the foreign currency exchange rate.\nUnder the terms of these contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, the Company will make interest payments in Swiss Francs and receive\ninterest in U.S. dollars. Upon the maturity of these contracts, the Company will pay the principal amount of the loans in Swiss Francs and receive U.S. dollars\nfrom the counterparties.\nThe Company held the following cross-currency rate swaps as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021\nEffective Date\nTermination\nDate\nFixed Rate\nAggregate Notional Amount\nFair Value Asset (Liability)\nPay CHF\nOctober 2, 2017\nOctober 2, 2022\n1.95%\nCHF\n— \n145,598 \n— \n(8,283)\nReceive U.S.$\n4.52%\n$\n— \n150,000 \nPay CHF\nDecember 21, 2020\nDecember 22,\n2025\n3.00%\nCHF\n374,137 \n397,137 \n(4,241)\n41 \nReceive U.S.$\n3.98%\n$\n420,001 \n445,821 \nPay CHF\nSeptember 28,\n2022\nSeptember 29,\n2023\n1.95%\nCHF\n48,532 \n— \n(3,528)\n— \nReceive U.S.$\n5.32%\n$\n49,142 \n— \nTotal\n$\n(7,769) $\n(8,242)\nOn October 3 , 2022, in accordance with the termination date, the Company settled cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges of an intercompany\nloan with aggregate notional amounts of $100 million.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test.\nThe qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors including reporting unit specific operating results as well as industry, market and general economic\nconditions, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The\nCompany may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for its three reporting units and perform a quantitative test. The assumptions used in evaluating\ngoodwill for impairment are subject to change and are tracked against historical results by management.\nThe quantitative test estimates the fair value of the three reporting units using a discounted cash flow model, which incorporates significant estimates and\nassumptions made by management which, by their nature, are characterized by uncertainty. Inputs used to fair value the Company's reporting units are\nconsidered inputs of the fair value hierarchy. For Level 3 measurements, significant increases or decreases in long-term growth rates or discount rates in\nisolation or in combination could result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. The key assumptions impacting the valuation included the\nfollowing:\n•\nThe reporting unit's financial projections, which are based on management's assessment of regional and macroeconomic variables, industry trends\nand market opportunities, and the Company's strategic objectives and future growth plans.\n•\nThe projected terminal value for the reporting unit, which represents the present value of projected cash flows beyond the last period in the\ndiscounted cash flow analysis. The terminal value reflects the Company's assumptions related to long-term growth rates and profitability, which are\nbased on several factors, including local and macroeconomic variables, market opportunities, and future growth plans.\n•\nThe discount rate used to measure the present value of the projected future cash flows is set using a weighted-average cost of capital method that\nconsiders market and industry data as well as the Company's specific risk factors that are likely to be considered by a market participant. The\nweighted-average cost of capital is the Company's estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business\nenterprise.\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, the Company elected to perform a qualitative analysis for its three reporting units. The Company determined, after\nperforming the qualitative analysis, that there was no evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value was less that the carrying amounts, therefore, it\nwas not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test.\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill in 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nDollars in thousands\nCodman Specialty\nSurgical\n Tissue\nTechnologies\nTotal\nGoodwill at January 1, 2021\n$\n671,975 \n$\n260,392 \n$\n932,367 \nACell Acquisition\n— \n94,147 \n94,147 \nForeign currency translation\n(8,547)\n(4,509)\n(13,056)\nBalance at December 31, 2021\n$\n663,428 \n$\n350,030 \n$\n1,013,458 \nSale of non-core traditional wound care business\n— \n(5,019)\n(5,019)\nSIA Acquisition\n— \n41,855 \n41,855 \nForeign currency translation\n(7,209)\n(4,204)\n(11,413)\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n$\n656,219 \n$\n382,662 \n$\n1,038,881 \nF-32"

Additionally, the\nCompany may perform interim tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of a indefinite lived intangible\nasset below its carrying amount. The Company tests for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative\nevaluation is an assessment of factors, including specific operating results as well as industry, market and general economic conditions, to determine whether\nit is more likely than not that the fair values of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. The Company may elect to bypass this qualitative\nevaluation and perform a quantitative test.\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, the Company elected to perform a qualitative analysis for its intangible asset with indefinite lives. The Company determined,\nafter performing the qualitative analysis, that there was no evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value was less that the carrying amounts,\ntherefore, it was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test.\nProduct rights and other definite-lived intangible assets are tested periodically for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 360 when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that an asset's carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset or\nasset group to the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows. In the event the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the\ncarrying value is considered not recoverable and impairment exists. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair\nvalue, calculated using discounted future cash flows. The computed impairment loss is recognized in the period that the impairment occurs.\nAmortization expense (including amounts reported in cost of product revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $78.3 million,\n$83.3 million and $74.5 million, respectively.\nF-33"

The\n2000 and 2001 Equity Incentive Plans were terminated as of February 19, 2021, and no further awards may be issued under the plans.\nIn May 2010 and May 2017, the stockholders of the Company approved amendments to the 2003 Plan to increase by 3.5 million and 1.7 million, respectively,\nthe number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2003 Plan. The Company has reserved 4.0 million shares under each of the 2000 Plan and\nthe 2001 Plan, and 14.7 million shares under the 2003 Plan. The Plans permit the Company to grant incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock\nappreciation rights, restricted stock, contract stock, performance stock, or dividend equivalent rights to designated directors, officers, employees and\nassociates of the Company.\nStock options issued under the 2003 Plan became exercisable over specified periods, generally within four years from the date of grant for officers and\nemployees, and within one year from the date of the grant for members of the Board of Directors. The awards generally expire eight years from the grant date\nfor employees and from six to ten for directors and certain executive officers, except in certain instances that result in accelerated vesting due to death,\ndisability, retirement age or change in control provisions within their grant agreements. Restricted stock issued under the 2003 Plan vests ratably over\nspecified periods, generally three years after the date of grant. The vesting of performance stock issued under the 2003 Plan is subject to service and\nperformance conditions.\nStock Options\nThe Company values stock option grants using the binomial distribution model. Management believes that the binomial distribution model is preferable to the\nBlack-Scholes model because it is a more flexible model that gives consideration to the impact of non-transferability and vesting provisions in valuing\nemployee stock options.\nIn determining the value of stock options granted, the Company considered that it has never paid cash dividends and does not currently intend to pay cash\ndividends, and thus has assumed a 0% dividend yield. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock price. The expected\nlife of stock options is estimated based on historical data on exercise of stock options, post-vesting forfeitures and other factors to estimate the expected term\nof the stock options granted. The risk-free interest rates are derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for instruments with a\nremaining term similar to the expected life of the options.

The gain recognized during the period ended\nDecember 31, 2021, is primarily attributed to a change in the discount rate used to estimate the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans which\ncover certain employees in Switzerland. The combined accumulated benefit obligations for the defined benefit plans was $46.4 million and $60.3 million as\nof December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nUnrecognized gains and losses are amortized over the average remaining future service for each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized\nover the average life expectancy.

Common trusts are classified as Level 2 in fair value hierarchy. The fair value of\ncommon trusts is valued at net asset value based on the fair values of the underlying investments of the trusts as determined by the sponsor of the trusts. The\ninvestment strategy of the Company's defined benefit plans is both to meet the liabilities of the plans as they fall due and to maximize the return on invested\nassets within appropriate risk profile.\nThe benefit plans in France and Germany had no assets at December 31, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2022, no plan assets are expected to be returned to the Company in the next twelve months.\nThe following table is the summary of expected future benefit payments (in thousands):\n2023\n$\n2,211 \n2024\n$\n2,045 \n2025\n$\n2,050 \n2026\n$\n1,929 \n2027\n$\n1,868 \nNext five years\n$\n11,068 \nAs of December 31, 2022, contributions expected to be paid to the plan in 2022 is $2.6 million.\nDEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS\nThe Company also has various defined contribution savings plans that cover substantially all employees in the United States, Belgium, Canada, France, Japan,\nNetherlands, the U.K. and Puerto Rico. The Company matches a certain percentage of each employee’s contributions as per the provisions of the plans. Total\ncontributions by the Company to the plans were $9.8 million, $8.8 million and $6.7 million for the years ended December  31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\nDEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN\nThe Company maintains a Deferred Compensation Plan in which certain employees of the Company may defer the payment and taxation of up to 75% of\ntheir base salary and up to 100% of bonus amounts and other eligible cash compensation.\nThis deferred compensation is invested in funds offered under this plan and is valued based on Level 1 measurements in the fair value hierarchy.

LEASES AND RELATED PARTY LEASES\nThe Company leases administrative, manufacturing, research and distribution facilities and vehicles through operating lease agreements. The Company has no\nfinance leases as of December 31, 2022. Many of the Company's leases include both lease (e.g., fixed payments including rent) and non-lease components\n(e.g., common-area or other maintenance costs). For vehicles, the Company has elected the practical expedient to group lease and non-lease components. \nMost facility leases include one or more options to renew. The exercise of lease renewal options is typically at the Company's sole discretion, therefore, the\nmajority of renewals to extend the lease terms are not included in the ROU assets and lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of exercise. The\nCompany regularly evaluates renewal options and when they are reasonably certain of exercise, the renewal period is included in the lease term.\nAs most of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses a collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the information\navailable at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments.\nTotal operating lease expense for the year ended December  31, 2022 and 2021, was $22.6 million and $20.3 million, respectively, which includes $0.3\nmillion, in related party operating lease expense.\nF-39"

While the\ntransfer did not result in a taxable gain, the Company’s Swiss subsidiary received a step-up in tax basis based on the fair value of the transferred intellectual\nproperty rights. The Company determined the fair value using a discounted cash flow model based on expectations of revenue growth rates, royalty rates,\ndiscount rates, and useful lives of the intellectual property. The Company recorded a $59.2  million deferred tax benefit in Switzerland related to the\namortizable tax basis in the transferred intellectual property.\nDuring 2022, the Company’s foreign operations generated a $0.4 million increase in income tax expense when compared to the same period in 2021, because\nof geographic and business mix of taxable earnings and losses, among other factors.

Various\ngovernments, both U.S. and non-U.S., are increasingly focused on tax reform and revenue-raising legislation. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction\nAct of 2022 (the “Act”) was signed into law, the company does not expect the law to have a material impact on the company’s effective tax rate. Further,\nlegislation in foreign jurisdictions may be enacted, in response to the base erosion and profit-sharing (BEPS) project begun by the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD).

In general, Section 203 of the\nDGCL prevents an “interested stockholder,” which is defined generally as a person owning 15% or more of a Delaware corporation’s outstanding voting stock\nor any affiliate or associate of that person, from engaging in a broad range of “business combinations” with the corporation for three years following the date\nthat person became an interested stockholder unless:\n•\nbefore that person became an interested stockholder, the board of directors of the corporation approved the transaction in which that person became\nan interested stockholder or approved the business combination;\n•\non completion of the transaction that resulted in that person’s becoming an interested stockholder, that person owned at least 85% of the voting stock\nof the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, other than stock held by (1) directors who are also officers of the corporation\nor (2) any employee stock plan that does not provide employees with the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will\nbe tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or\n•\nfollowing the transaction in which that person became an interested stockholder, both the board of directors of the corporation and the holders of at\nleast two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation not owned by that person approve the business combination.\nUnder Section 203 of the DGCL, the restrictions described above also do not apply to specific business combinations proposed by an interested stockholder\nfollowing the announcement or notification of designated extraordinary transactions involving the corporation and a person who had not been an interested\nstockholder during the previous three years or who became an interested stockholder with the approval of a majority of the corporation’s directors, if a\nmajority of the directors who were directors prior to any person’s becoming an interested stockholder during the previous three years, or were recommended\nfor election or elected to succeed those directors by a majority of those directors, approve or do not oppose that extraordinary transaction.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws\nSome of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws discussed below may have the effect, either alone or in combination with the provisions\nof our certificate of incorporation discussed above and Section 203 of the DGCL, of making more difficult or discouraging a tender offer, proxy contest,\nmerger or other takeover attempt that our board of directors opposes but that a stockholder might consider to be in its best interest.\nSpecial Meetings of Stockholders. Our bylaws provide that a special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by (i) the chairman of our board of\ndirectors, (ii) the president or (iii) our board of directors.\nStockholder Action by Written Consent. Our stockholders may act by written consent without a meeting, subject to the requirements in our bylaws for setting a\nrecord date for the written consent. Any stockholder seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action must request that our Board of\nDirectors fix a record date. Such notice must include the same information required for a stockholder proposal and be submitted to our Board of Directors as\ndescribed in our bylaws.\nVacancies on the Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation provides that the number of directors will be fixed exclusively by, and may be increased\nor decreased exclusively by, our board of directors from time to time, but will not be less than three nor more than thirteen. Our bylaws provide that vacancies\non the board of directors arising through death, resignation, retirement or removal shall be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office whether or\nnot the remaining directors constitute a quorum. These provisions will prevent our stockholders from removing incumbent directors without cause and filling\nthe resulting vacancies with their own nominees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the number of directors will be fixed exclusively by, and may be increased or decreased exclusively by, our\nboard of directors from time to time, but will not be less than three nor more than thirteen. Our certificate of incorporation provides that directors may be\nremoved only by the Delaware Chancery Court under Section 225(c) of the DGCL or for cause (as such term is defined in our certificate of incorporation) as\ndetermined by a vote of at least 80% of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock. A vacancy on our board of directors may be filled by a vote of a\nmajority of"

Our bylaws contain provisions requiring that advance notice be delivered\nto us of any business to be brought by a stockholder before an annual meeting of stockholders and providing for certain procedures to be followed by\nstockholders in nominating persons for election to our board of directors. Generally, the advance notice provisions provide that the stockholder must give\nwritten notice to our Secretary not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting, except\nthat in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the\nstockholder to be timely must be so delivered not later than the 90th day prior to the date of such annual meeting (or, if later, then the 10th day following the\nday on which public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting was first made). The notice must set forth specific information regarding that stockholder\nand that business or director nominee, as described in our bylaws.\nAmendment of Certain Provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Under the DGCL, the stockholders of a corporation have the right to adopt,\namend or repeal the bylaws and, with the approval of the board of directors, the certificate of incorporation of a corporation. In addition, if the certificate of\nincorporation so provides, the bylaws may be adopted, amended or repealed by the board of directors. Our Certificate provides that the bylaws may be\namended or repealed by our board of directors. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws also confer on our board of directors the power to adopt, amend or\nrepeal our amended and restated bylaws with the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office.\nForum Selection. Our bylaws provide, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, that the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any\nderivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or\nother employees to us or our stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to\nany provision of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws (in each case, as they may be amended from time to time) or (d) any action\nasserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, will be a state court located within\nthe State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware). Any\nperson that purchases or otherwise acquires an interest in our stock will be deemed to have notice of and agree to comply with the foregoing provisions.\nOur bylaws provide that a state court of the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district\ncourt for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of Integra; (ii) any\naction asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer of Integra to Integra or the stockholders; (iii)  any action asserting a claim\nagainst Integra arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws (as each may be amended, from time to time); or\n(iv) any other action asserting a claim against Integra or any director or officer of Integra that is governed by or subject to the internal affairs doctrine for\nchoice of law purposes. However, the forum selection provision does not apply to any claims, actions or proceedings arising under the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended, which we refer to as the “Securities Act,” or the Exchange Act. Unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal\ndistrict courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Any person or entity purchasing or\notherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our stock will be deemed to have notice of and consented to the exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws.\nPreferred Stock. As discussed above under “General Matters—Preferred Stock,” our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors, without the\napproval of our stockholders, to provide for the issuance of all or any shares of our preferred stock in one or more series and to determine the designation,\npowers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions applicable to any of those\nrights, including dividend rights, voting rights, conversion or exchange rights, terms of redemption and liquidation preferences, of each series. The issuance of\nshares of our preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase shares of preferred stock, could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal.\nIn addition, under some circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of our common stockholders."

In granting the RSUs under the Plan, the Company will collect\nthe Participant’s personal data for purposes of allocating Shares and implementing, administering and managing the Plan.

The value of the financial assets held outside of Italy by Italian residents is subject to a foreign\nasset tax. Such tax is currently levied at an annual rate of 2 per thousand (0.2%). The taxable amount will be the fair market value\nof the financial assets (e.g., Shares) assessed at the end of the calendar year. No tax payment duties arise if the value of the foreign\nassets held abroad does not exceed a certain threshold.\nJAPAN\nNotifications\nExchange Control Information. If Participant acquires Shares valued at more than ¥100,000,000 in a single transaction, the\nParticipant must file a Securities Acquisition Report with the Ministry of Finance through the Bank of Japan within 20 days of the\nacquisition of the Shares.\nForeign Asset/Account Reporting Information. The Participant will be required to report details of any assets (such as Shares) held\noutside of Japan as of December 31st to the extent such assets have a total net fair market value exceeding ¥50,000,000. Such\nreport will be due by March 15th each year. The Participant should consult with his or her personal tax advisor as to whether the\nreporting obligation extends to any outstanding RSUs held by the Participant and to ensure compliance with applicable reporting\nobligations.\nMEXICO"
