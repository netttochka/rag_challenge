Similarly, candidates \nknow that, by coming to SThree, their skills will be \nfully appreciated and they will have access to a large \npool of employment opportunities with dynamic \norganisations across the world, accelerating their \nprofessional growth.\nAlthough these markets represent 75% of the global \nSTEM market, they are highly fragmented. Despite \nour market-leading positions (we are #1 in the \nNetherlands, and #2 in Germany), we have a relatively \nsmall market share (on average, we have reached 2% \nof the potential STEM market in the top five markets).\nNew market share gains will strengthen our position \nas the provider of choice in STEM talent and drive \neconomies of scale. We will leverage our operations to \nensure that top-line growth exceeds associated cost \ngrowth. This will allow favourable incremental drop-\nthrough, driving improvements in our conversion ratio.\nAlthough the unemployment rate has remained \nlow, a global energy crisis has resulted in the cost \nof living rising with surging inflation leading to the \ndecline in real-term incomes in the UK and many \nother European countries. \nThe magnitude and long-term downside risk to \neconomic growth is difficult to predict, but it is \nreasonable to say that the prolonged tightening of \nfinancial conditions to combat surging inflation may, \nto some extent, impact the economic activity and \nbusiness investment in the short to medium term.\nWhilst we are mindful of the wider macro-economic \nuncertainties, the demand for STEM talent, and \nflexible STEM talent in particular, is structural. Our \nposition as the number one destination for talent in the \nbest STEM markets and our strong contractor order \nbook underpins our continued confidence.\nThis has created challenges as well as opportunities \nfor the recruitment industry and continues to influence \nthe way we operate. In particular, the structural \ndemand for STEM skills and flexible working has been \nrising, underpinned by a few key global megatrends. \nThese are powerful, transformative forces that change \nthe global economy, business and society. These \nmegatrends, notwithstanding macroeconomics and \npolitical uncertainties, provide enormous opportunity \nfor SThree.\nThe global STEM talent market is valued at over £100 \nbillion in annual revenue.

They are adopting leaner ways of \nworking, with software-driven production, allowing \nmore capacity for innovation and cost efficiencies. \nThe Covid-19 pandemic has also accelerated digital \ntake-up, allowing some ventures to stage-skip \ninnovation cycles on a scale and at a pace never \nexperienced before.\nDirect investment in digital transformation is expected \nto be $6.3 trillion over the three years to 2024 and this \nrate of investment is accelerating, with a 16% five-year \ncompound annual growth rate (CAGR) reaching $3.4 \ntrillion by 2026.\nCoupled with changing customer demands, increased \ntechnological complexity and the adoption of \ninnovative digital technologies, artificial intelligence \nand machine learning are driving an explosion in \ndemand for specialist technology skills. In fact, it \nis forecast that 149 million new digital jobs will be \nrequired by 2025.\nEmbracing digital transformation will continue to \nbe a dominant trend across businesses for years to \ncome, with the aim of creating a new, inclusive global \neconomy and overcoming any future crises.\nOrganisations around the world are developing \neffective processes and roadmaps towards a net \nzero target. \nAchieving net zero by 2050 requires a complete \ntransformation of the global energy system and \nwill be achieved only through the development and \nwidespread adoption and deployment of innovative \ntechnologies and engineering skills.\nMost of the reductions in carbon emissions to 2030 \nwill come from technologies that already exist. But \nin 2050, almost half of the carbon reductions will be \npossible only if technologies that are currently at the \ndemonstration or prototype phase materialise.\nMajor clean energy innovation efforts must take place \nin the next decade to bring these new technologies \nto market in time. This will create millions of new \njobs, driving an exponential growth in demand for \nengineering and ‘green’ tech talent. According to the \nIEA*, by 2030 there will be 14 million new jobs created \nin global energy supply, and a further 16 million \nin clean energy end-uses, such as more efficient \nappliances, electric and fuel cell vehicles, building \nretrofits and energy-efficient construction.\n*International Energy Agency (IEA) data.\nThe recent pandemic has led to profound changes \nand developments that have significantly accelerated \nthe pace at which the Life Sciences sector is \nprogressing towards achieving a future of widespread \nhealth equality.\nResearch-led healthcare has received a lot of attention \naimed at ensuring that the relevant solutions and \nknowledge are developed in good time to address \nfuture healthcare priorities.\nDuring and post the Covid-19 pandemic, we have \nwitnessed unprecedented global efforts towards \nadoption of research findings in combatting the \nspread of the disease as well as in developing artificial \nintelligence and data indispensable to tackling future \nhealthcare crises.\nThe Life Sciences goal, of realising the long-term \nhealth potential of everyone, is inexhaustible.

Following \nthe gradual normalisation post the Covid-19 pandemic, \na challenging macro-economic and geopolitical \nbackdrop affected consumers as well as businesses \naround the world. Although unemployment rates in \nour key markets have remained low, a global energy \ncrisis has resulted in the cost of living rising, with \nsurging inflation leading to a decline in real-term \nincomes for many across major markets. However, \ndespite these macro challenges, I am proud that our \nGroup has remained resolute in our focus to deliver \nfor our clients and candidates as we continue to make \nprogress towards our 2024 ambitions and beyond. We \nhave delivered an exceptional financial performance, \nmaterially above initial market expectations, as we \nrealise the benefits of our well-established strategy, \nfocused on STEM and flexible talent. \nIn April 2022, after a thorough and extensive search \nprocess, reviewing both internal and external \ncandidates, the Board was delighted to appoint Timo \nLehne as permanent CEO. Since his appointment \nTimo has shown strategic thinking, drive and passion, \ndrawing on his extensive experience and building a \nstrong team around him. Across our Group there is a \nrenewed sense of energy, unity and excitement which \nI felt acutely as I had the opportunity to meet again \nin person with a number of our regional teams during \nthe year across Europe, the US and APAC. I would like \nto take this opportunity to thank SThree’s exceptional \nteams around the world for their hard work and \ndedication which has supported the delivery of our \nrecord financial results. \nFollowing the strong trading performance in the year, \ncoupled with a healthy balance sheet position, the \nBoard is proposing a final dividend at 11.0 pence per \nshare, which taken together with the interim dividend \nof 5.0 pence per share, gives the total dividend for \nthe year of 16.0 pence per share, an increase of 45% \non the prior year. This is in line with the Board’s aim to \noffer shareholders long-term ordinary dividend growth \nwithin a targeted cover range of 2.5x to 3.0x.\nWe were pleased to appoint Elaine O’Donnell as \nAudit & Risk Committee Chair and Non-Executive \nDirector in October. Elaine brings to SThree both \nbroad and deep business experience and financial \ncapability, plus highly developed commercial and \npeople judgement. Her extensive experience of \nworking with high-growth, FTSE-listed businesses \nwill serve to strengthen our Board as the Company \ncontinues to execute our growth strategy. In addition, \nwe were delighted to welcome Imogen Joss to the \nBoard in November.

      "text": "Chief Executive Officer’s statement\nStrategic Report\nA record year  \nof growth\nThis has been another record year of double-digit \ngrowth and strong profitability, materially ahead of \ninitial expectations, together with clear operational \nachievements.\nBasic earnings per share\n41.0p\n2021: 31.9p\nNet cash£65m\n2021: £58m\nExceptional year of growth\nThe effort of our dedicated team meant we placed over \n20,000 STEM specialists into highly skilled positions in \n2022, helping to deliver vital talent that will tackle many \nof the complex issues facing our world. We are proud of \nthe work we do in delivering our purpose of connecting \nskilled people with opportunities to build the future. \nWith a heritage as specialist STEM staffing pioneers for \nalmost 40 years, I believe the business has a huge and \nexciting opportunity ahead as we execute our vision \nto be the number one STEM talent provider in the best \nSTEM markets. \nThe Group’s strong performance in the year was \nagainst a market backdrop characterised by a return \nto a more normalised trading environment, followed \nby an increasingly uncertain and weakening macro-\neconomic environment towards the end of the period. \nThrough this, and against very strong post-Covid \ncomparators, the Group delivered net fee growth of \n19% in constant currency (21% on a reported basis) to \n£430.6 million and profit before tax growth of 28%, \non a reported basis, to £77.0 million. Overall, the \nperformance in the year reinforces our confidence in \nour strategic vision for the long term and demonstrates \nthat our mid-term ambitions are within reach.\nStrong foundations with a unique and \nresilient business model \nOur overarching mission is consistent: placing STEM \nspecialists in markets with high demand and limited \nsupply. Supply constraints of STEM talent continues to \nintensify, offering huge opportunity in a global market \nestimated to be worth over £100 billion in revenue and \nof which we currently have, on average, a 2% share \nacross our top five markets which account for 75% of \nthe addressable share of the global market. \nWe capitalise on the STEM opportunity with a \nconscious focus on Contract placements, which grew \nstrongly at 23% and now represents 78% of Group \nnet fee income, up from 75% a year ago. This focus \nenables us to service the changing world of work \nwith a clear and growing preference toward flexible \ntalent, a structure highly suited to STEM roles and a \nkey motivator for candidates. Motivations for work are \nchanging, with candidates aligning their careers to life \npriorities, of which flexible work is a top consideration. \nOur own recent survey demonstrated that flexible \nworking options are now expected to be a standard \ngiven of employment.\nWithin this context, our core and differentiated value \nproposition is a deep understanding of our clients’ \nrequirements together with an unparalleled candidate \nnetwork, meaning we often know of candidates before \nformal searches are needed and this enables us to be \nproactive in our approach to clients. \nOperating across 46 locations in 14 countries from the \nUSA, across Europe to Japan, our combination of global \nreach and expert local recruitment knowledge across \nspecialist STEM skills means we can deliver quality at \nspeed. We are trusted talent partners, helping more \nclients to succeed and more candidates to accelerate \ntheir careers.\nIn addition, demand for the Employed Contractor \nModel (ECM) continues to be a strong driver of \ngrowth. ECM is a model whereby contractors are \ndirectly employed by SThree for the duration of the \ncontract and is an area in which SThree has built a \nleading position. ECM now represents 45% of all \nContract work undertaken by the Group, compared \nto 43% in 2021.\nPermanent placements also play an important role \nin our overall offering, providing clients with a full-\nservice solution depending on their requirements. \nPermanent grew 6%, and we continue to focus our \nefforts on Permanent in markets where we can achieve \nthe best returns. \nOver time the Group has shown that the specialist \nfocus on STEM and flexible talent has proven more \nresilient and adaptable relative to the generalist \nstaffing market. The strength of our contractor order \nbook, which ended 2022 up 19% YoY, provides a \ngood degree of comfort against a more challenging \nand volatile backdrop. The strength of our business \nplatform, combining global scale with the flexibility \nof an agile business able to deploy resources as \nappropriate, has provided a robust foundation from \nwhich we advanced our disciplined and focused \nstrategy during the year.\nA responsible business for now and the \nfuture guided by purpose\nWe believe in empowering a sustainable future \nthrough STEM skills, whether that is placing engineers \nto build wind turbines, medical researchers to create \nnew vaccines or cyber specialists to provide financial \nsecurity. This purpose is grounded in our ESG \ncommitments, which are focused around promoting \ngreen jobs, encouraging diversity in STEM and \ncontributing to a renewable future.\nWe set ourselves targets related to ESG which are \naligned to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, \nand we are pleased to have progressed against these \nduring the year, including:\n•\t Having positively impacted 88,741 lives since \nDecember 2019, meaning we are over halfway to \nour goal of 150,000 by 2024.\n•\t Making further strides in our ambition to tackle \nclimate change, with 88% growth in net fees from \nour renewables business since 2019, in line with our \nambition to double our share by 2024 from 2019.\n“\u0007Our focus as a specialist \nstaffing partner in STEM \nand flexible talent means \nwe are uniquely positioned \nto service the structural \ndemand of a changing \nworld, work which we \nsignificantly progressed \nduring the year.” \n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-23\nP-22\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

As we look \nforward, we will continue our policy of highly targeted \nheadcount investments, in the markets and skill \nverticals that provide the best growth opportunities \nand where we can drive the strongest returns. I would \nlike to thank everyone for their dedication and hard \nwork throughout the year.\nOur Position - Leveraging our position at the \ncentre of STEM to deliver sustainable value to \nour candidates and clients\nOur position at the heart of STEM is illustrated through \nthe deep market value of our niche brands, aligned to \nour specialist focused areas across target markets. We \nare proud of the power of our brands which continue \nto have high local recognition.\nA major achievement during the year was the launch \nof a new overarching corporate brand identity, to tie \nour ‘house of brands’ together and leverage the power \nof SThree as a whole. This was an important step in \nuniting the business together as a STEM specialist \ncompany and represents a clear expression of our \nintent to seize the market as a refreshed, energised \nand innovative business.\nIn addition, we made further improvements to how we \nengage with our candidates and clients and further \ncemented our position as a trusted resourcing and \nplacement partner. We undertook a number of digital \nand in-person candidate forums, career support \nprogrammes, and our ‘Breaking the Glass’ programme \nin the US continues to provide a meaningful resource \nfor supporting professional women in technology. This \nwork ensures we retain our enviable, market-leading \nposition as the business the world comes to for flexible \nSTEM talent.\nTechnology improvement \nprogramme scale\nOur technology improvement programme will \nenable us to adopt modern, scalable, and innovative \ntechnologies and processes, driving market leading, \ndata driven insights, greater operational excellence \nand productivity. This programme will enable us to \ndeliver a world-class digital experience differentiating \nSThree and delivering our vision to be the number one \nSTEM talent provider in the best STEM markets.\nThe programme underpins the delivery of a value \nshift in our sales consultants’ productivity by \nenabling them to achieve their best more quickly \nand more consistently. The programme will drive \nstandardisation, simplification and automation \nthough our back-office technologies and processes \nenabling us to operate effectively at greater scale. \n•\t Having reduced our carbon emissions by 44% in \n2022 as compared to the base year 2019, achieving \nour initial target of 20% reduction. In doing so, we \nhave set ourselves a more challenging target going \nforward of a 25% reduction against 2019.\n•\t Progressing our focus on increasing gender \nrepresentation in the business, with 32% of all \nleadership positions occupied by women. \nBuilding a business for sustainable scale \nIn taking up the CEO role a year ago, I spent my first \nmonths, along with the senior leadership team across \nour regions, reviewing, analysing and assessing the \nGroup’s operations and strategy. Working together \nwe agreed our strategic vision and an execution plan \ncentred on an analytical and fact-based approach. We \nhave articulated and collaboratively achieved buy-in \nto this clear vision across the Group, and in doing so, \nevolved our 2024 ambitions to be more relevant to our \naspirations under a new leadership team. The direction \nof travel remains the same and we are unanimously \ncommitted to these ambitions. We are relentlessly \nfocused on building a business of scale with \nsustainable margins, driven by our energised team.\nAs we step into execution mode, we look to advance \nour vision across four main strategic pillars: \nOur Places - to be a leader in the markets we \nchoose to serve\nThe Group’s performance in the year was driven by \nbroad-based, double-digit growth across our four \nmajor regions, which demonstrates that we are already \noperating as a leader in key markets where we know \nwe can win. We spent time assessing and honing our \nmarket approach to understand deeply the specific \ndynamics that enable us to scale, making sure we \nare in exactly the right niches and specific skill areas \nacross the different life cycles of each market. \nThis approach, crystallised during the year into a \n‘market investment model’, meant that we segmented \nour focus into large, proven and scalable markets \nand small-to-medium high-margin markets. A good \nexample of our focus and commercial discipline \nis our approach in the Netherlands, where we set \nappropriate strategic goals aligned to the market \ncontext, delivering 34% growth in net fees during \nthe year. This continuous analytical assessment also \ninformed our decision to restructure our operations \nin Singapore and Ireland. We continue to actively \noptimise and invest in those markets where we can \ngenerate the strongest returns.\nThe programme supports the continuing shift towards \nECM from the historic independent contracting model \nand positions the Group at the forefront of the industry \nas it continues to evolve from a traditional, analogue \nrecruitment model driven primarily by headcount.\nIn 2022, we successfully piloted a CRM module in \nour Houston office. This is enabling us to systematise \nexisting Group best practice, developed over many \nyears, across an integrated platform to empower our \npeople to be their best. We will deliver this through a \nsequenced rollout across the Group, starting with our \nUS and German businesses later in 2023. In 2022, we \nincurred programme costs of £4.1 million. In 2023, we \nexpect to incur programme costs of £15 million-£17 \nmillion, of which £6 million-£7 million will be expensed \nwith the remainder of the £30 million-£35 million \nprogramme costs anticipated to be incurred in 2024, \nof which £5 million-£6 million will be expensed. We \nalso expect to realise the initial financial benefits of \nthis programme from 2024, and a positive return on \ninvestment by the end of 2025. This will support the \ndelivery of a sustainable operating profit conversion \nratio of 21% or greater by 2024 and beyond.\nOutlook underpinned by long-term \nmegatrends\nFollowing 17 years at SThree, and having spent my \nfirst year as CEO, it is clear to me that the Group has \na huge opportunity to build on the foundations and \nsuccess to date to create a differentiated proposition \nwithin the market. We have the team in place to \nexecute our vision and our expert knowledge of our \nchosen markets. Along with a deep insight into our \nclients’ needs and the preferences of our candidate \ncommunities, this means we look ahead with a \nsignificant amount of experience and understanding \nof where our best opportunities lie. With our team \nenergised around a clear strategy, it is time to unleash \nthe power of SThree. \nFollowing an exceptional 2022 performance, trading \nearly in the new financial year continues to track in \nline with full year expectations, and we continue to \nmonitor how the markets are evolving in the short term. \nOur opportunity is large, underpinned by structural \nmegatrends, and the requirement for scarce STEM \ntalent across industries and regions is acute. The work \nwe have done over the year is aligned to building a \nbusiness with long-term sustainable growth potential, \nin line with our 2024 ambitions and beyond. We will \ncontinue to monitor how the markets are evolving in the \nshort term, however our belief in the Group’s medium to \nlong-term prospects remains as strong as ever.\nTimo Lehne\nChief Executive Officer \n27 January 2023\nOur Platform - create a world class operational \nplatform through data, technology and \ninfrastructure\nA focus of the year was ensuring we have in place \nthe structure to deliver best-in-class operational \nexecution and understand where we can make \nimprovements to continue to lead the pack. As part \nof this, we have made good progress with planned \nstrategic investments in our systems through which \nwe are fundamentally re-engineering, simplifying and \nautomating some of our most manual and complex \nprocesses. The majority of the year’s costs were \nrecognised in the second half of the year and, as we \nprogress into the new financial year, phasing and \nbudget remains in line with plans. \nWe believe these improvements, along with \nimplementing and systemising best practice across \nthe Group, has created, and will continue to create, \nan environment where colleagues are happier, \nmore productive and ultimately have an improved \nexperience which will ultimately improve the \nexperience of our candidates. The outputs we aspire to \nare better data-driven insights, improved productivity, \nempowered regions and enhanced operational \nexcellence through secure infrastructure, all \ncontributing to our long-term success and sustainable \nmargin improvement in 2024 and beyond. \nOur People - find, develop and retain \ngreat people\nA key objective in the year, and one that I am \npassionate about, was improving our employee \nvalue proposition to be a destination employer in our \nregions. We are a people business and our colleagues \nare our most valuable asset. A focus for me was \nengaging with our global teams to bring everyone in \nthe business toward one strategic focus. Our objective \nis to enable and excite people to perform at their best \nby creating a high-performance, inclusive culture, \nwhich attracts the best talent, provides the best \ntraining and targets the best markets to support the \nmeaningful work we do every day. \nAs part of this we standardised best talent acquisition \npractices across the Group, implemented a new sales \ncompensation scheme in our key markets, launched a \nnew onboarding programme (Elements) in all regions, \nas well as enhanced our training and development \nprogrammes to provide clear pathways for career \nprogression. An example of this is Identify, our \nprogramme to develop women at SThree to become \nfuture leaders. As a result of these initiatives, I was \nvery pleased to see our eNPS score improve to the \nhighest level we’ve ever achieved, and I believe this  \nis just the beginning. \nChief Executive Officer’s statement continued\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-25\nP-24\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

In the past five years, all \n10,007 participating farmers have reported \nimproved livelihoods and wellbeing. As part of \nthe programme, all farmers have developed and \nlearned skills to adapt to lower rainfall, higher \nwinds and erosion, supporting adaptation to \nclimate change. \nThe Planting Mangroves project in Madagascar \nstarted in 2007 and aims to aid forest restoration \nwhich is a critical issue as the country has lost \nover 90% of its native forest cover to date. \nMangroves is an excellent forest type for \nrestoration; it not only stores more carbon than \ntraditional forests, but it also provides multiple \nbenefits to coastal communities, such as storm \nprotection, water filtration and livelihood \ngeneration.

From software development to \nthe development of systems, Priva takes care of the \nentire chain itself.\nPriva’s ambitious growth plans were stunted due to \nlabour market shortages, resulting in a lack of talent. \nPriva was faced with a challenge: keep vacancies \nopen which is costly or close them, squeezing \ngrowth ambitions.\nMaking strides\nComputer Futures worked closely with Priva to \nfind a solution.

At its peak, Priva \nemployed 51 interim specialists.\n“A big advantage of these specialists is that you \nquickly have the right knowledge in-house, so that you \ncan make huge steps as an organisation,” said Walter \nDoorduin, VP Organization Development at Priva.\nMore than technical skills\n“\tComputer Futures helped \nus find preselected \nspecialists quickly who \nthey’d been working \nwith for some time, so, \nthey knew the quality of \nthese specialists. They \naccurately matched us with \nprofessionals – partly on \nknowledge and skills, but \nmore so on cultural match \nand the match with our \ncore values. That’s why it’s \nimportant that you work, \nas much as possible, with a \npermanent staffing partner.  \n \nWould I recommend CF \nto others? Yes, I would!” \nWalter Doorduin\nVP Organization Development at Priva\nHow SThree’s contributions \nhave helped TIST on the \nground\n“\tOur small-scale \nagricultural projects \nhave been supported \nby cash received from \nTIST periodically; \nthese projects include \ngoat rearing and cattle \nkeeping.

      "text": "Strategic Report\nStrategic progress\nWe set out a five-year strategy at our Capital \nMarkets Day in 2019. Our aim then was to uniquely \nposition SThree as the global leader in STEM talent, \nideally placed to connect STEM specialists with the \nopportunities being generated by a world that needs \ntheir skills. We argued that this demand for STEM \nwould continue to increase as it was driven by several \nmegatrends that were growing in their impact (see \nmarket megatrends in Market overview section on \npage 12). All the evidence since then suggests this \nstill to be the case. As a result, our strategy has not \nsignificantly changed and the focus this year has been \non implementation.\nWe have continued to invest in Marketing to build \nour brands, strengthen our reputation as STEM \nleaders and enable growth. Having scoped the \nneed, and planned the specification, we selected \ntechnology partners and began investment in building \na platform that will raise productivity and scalability. \nWe reviewed how we focus on markets and refined \nhow we categorise opportunity, applying rigorous \ndiscipline so we only allocate resources to markets \nthat fit challenging profiles for return and growth. \nWe also continued to improve our employee value \nproposition (EVP) with a view to making SThree an \neven more appealing place to work so we continue to \nattract and retain talent.\nUpdate and evolution  \nof 2024 ambitions\nDuring the year we announced that we were going \nto redefine the way we measure success. We remain \ncommitted to our ambition to sustainably deliver \nan operating profit conversion ratio of 21% or more. \nHowever, our free cash conversion metric will no \nlonger be reported as a key ambition as it no longer \nreflects our current business model. From 2023 \nonwards, we will shift the focus from measuring \nmarket share on a revenue basis to a net fee basis. \nThis is because our product mix can contribute strong \nmargins on a smaller revenue. We will continue to aim \nto be an employer of choice but, from 2023, we will \nmeasure this through eNPS benchmarking, which will \nallow us to make direct comparisons with best-in-class \norganisations. We retain our societal goals but, from \nnext year, we will link these to our path to net zero \ncarbon emissions. Our new 2024 ambition is to reduce \nscope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 25% compared to 2019.\n“\u0007These investments \nwill transform our \nproductivity, but they’ll \nalso improve our EVP. \nThat will help us compete \nbetter in the search for \ntalent, improve retention \nand further increase our \nemployee satisfaction.” \nTimo Lehne\nSThree CEO\nRedefining how we measure \nsuccess\nOur Places\n38\nOur People\n42\nOur Platform\n40\nOur Position\n48\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-37\nP-36\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

We remain confident \nthese five markets offer the most potential for growth \nand the most opportunities to significantly increase \nthe future profits of the Group. Each market is at a \ndifferent point in its life cycle so we adopt a tailored \napproach for each. \nContinued focus on market share \ngrowth in our key territories\nAll our markets have now recovered from the pandemic \nand show an average growth on 2019 levels of 34% (in \nconstant currency). Our STEM contract order book \ngrew 55% (in constant currency) since 2019. In 2022, \nour operating profit was up 29% on 2019 in reported \ncurrency. This was driven by continuing demand for \ntalent in our core disciplines, as clients dealt with a \nvariety of needs as they sought to make their businesses \nmore resilient, more digital and more agile. \nBased on our in-market performance, we took share from \nSTEM competitors in four out of five of our key territories.\nEstablished a global ‘market \ninvestment’ framework for our Large \nand Proven and our Small and High-\nMargin markets \nWe segmented our markets into Large and Proven \nand Small and High Margin in order to better target \ninvestment. Within each of these categories, markets \nwere further segmented by stage of maturity in order \nto set appropriate strategic goals from the following \noptions: Drive Growth, Scale, Drive Margin and  \nUnder Review.  \nImproved our regional governance \nmodel, by implementing clear \nresponsibilities and conducted a \nrefreshed regulatory and contractual risk \nassessment for all our contractor markets\nOver the course of 2022, we carried out an in-depth \nanalysis of the regulatory and contractual position,  \nand risk profile, of each of SThree’s business models, \nthen analysed them against a standardised set  \nof categories. \nThis work has been integrated into the Group’s \nstrategic plans and also serves as the basis for a \nContracting Improvement Project. \nThe project introduces a new contracting approval \nprocess, establishing a standard approach across all \nregions. It will streamline contracting and reduce time \nto contract execution. \nIt also includes a review of governance around \nSThree’s contractual risk appetite. We began roll \nout in all jurisdictions following the completion of a \nregional pilot.\nIn each of our countries of operation, we have \nprocesses in place that are optimally structured to \ncomply with local legislative requirements.

Our new platform has \nbeen designed to support the continuing shift towards \nECM from the historic independent contracting model. \nThis platform is future-proofed for scalable growth, \nparticularly in the ECM world, which we expect to be \na key driver of the STEM staffing market.\nThe technology improvement programme once fully \nimplemented will:\n•\t Drive sales effectiveness, accelerating the \nproductivity of our sales consultants.\n•\t Standardise, simplify and automate our back-office \ntechnologies and processes enabling us to operate \neffectively at greater scale.\n•\t Digitalise ECM to drive growth in a scalable, lower \ncost to serve way.\n•\t Position the Group at the forefront of the industry, \nas it continues to evolve from the traditional \nrecruitment model driven primarily by headcount.\nOur technology improvement programme is at the \nheart of our drive to deliver a step change in our \nbusiness, enabling us to deliver the future of  \nSTEM staffing through insight, innovation, and \noperational excellence.\nSystemised and sequenced rollout\nWe successfully piloted our new CRM functionality in \nour Houston business in 2022. Our pilot sales teams \nfound the new CRM system enhanced team and \nindividual performance and was intuitive to use. \nWe are refining the system further before a planned \nrollout across the Group from 2023, starting with the \nUSA in 2023, followed by Germany, the Netherlands, \nthe UK and Japan thereafter, and then the rest of  \nthe business.\nDesigning for productivity benefits\nWhen planning refinements to our platform, we sought \nopportunities to deliver productivity benefits. Our \ngoal is to build in the functionality that will enable the \norganisation to scale whilst improving our operating \nprofit conversion ratio. \nLike any talent-based business, we experience a marked \ndifference in productivity between our new hires and \nour most experienced consultants. One of the main \npriorities when designing the platform was therefore \nsystematising best practice from across the Group, then \nprogramming interventions at appropriate moments \nin the sales process. As a result, our sales consultants \nshould become more productive, more quickly. This \nembedding of learning in day-to-day processes should \nalso lift employee satisfaction, improving retention. \nData driven insights\nThe platform will also allow data insights to support \ndecision making and give managers a better \nunderstanding of our candidates and our clients. \nManagement will be able to better interrogate \nperformance by sector, location, team and individual. \nSuch transparency empowers decision making.\nImprove non-sales productivity\nBack-office processes offer opportunities for automation, \nremoving time-consuming manual interventions so we \nfree the organisation to scale. Our goal with back-office \nsystems is to not only achieve best-in-class status for our \nindustry: we aim to become world class by any measure, \ncreating a digital process that is intuitive from candidates' \nand other users’ perspectives.\nEnhancing cyber security through a \nsecure infrastructure\nDuring the year we have migrated our physical, \non-premise data centres to the cloud, improving \nperformance and security. This offers a more flexible \ninfrastructure that is better able to support all \ncompanies in the Group. It also has a host of other \nbenefits: it is more cost effective, it offers a better \nquality of system, and it improves our disaster recovery \nbusiness continuity capabilities. \nOur new end-to-end integrated solution utilises \nworld-leading technology infrastructure providing \nreal-time monitoring and regular and timely updates. \nEnsuring all employees are aware of the importance of \nfollowing data protection protocols is also key so all \nour people receive mandatory training in data security.\nEmpowering our people through enhanced technology and processes using better \nconnected, innovative technology and processes to drive operational excellence. \nWe will increase consultant productivity and enhance our customers’ experience. \nInitiatives and immediate \npriorities for 2023\n•\t Continue to evolve our state-of-the-art CRM \nplatform, rolling out to more teams and two \nkey geographies.\n•\t Begin implementation of an Enterprise \nResource Planning (ERP) system  \nproviding significant business capabilities \nand efficiencies.\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-41\nP-40\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

In \nhigh-growth markets, where sales consultant capacity \nwould otherwise limit profitable growth, we defined a \nhiring plan so we can meet that need, then allocated \nresources to increased headcount, as appropriate.\nImplement a sales compensation scheme in \nour key markets\nTo assess the competitiveness of our compensation \nschemes in each of the markets where we choose \nto operate, we completed a sales compensation \nreview. It focused on ensuring we reward great sales \nperformance with motivating compensation in all our \nkey markets, the USA, Germany, the Netherlands, the \nUK and Japan.

The new group includes managing directors \nfor our regions, as well as corporate function leaders. \nAll ExCo members directly report to the CEO. ExCo \nmakes it much easier to drive change as domain \nresponsibility is better defined and leaders regularly \ncome together, aiding cooperation.\nRetain talent\nDiversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) continues to be \na strategic focus as we need to bring diverse talents \nand views in order to perform effectively in the diverse \ncultures in which we operate. \nEmployee Resource Groups, campaigns  \nand talks\nIn 2022, we grew our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) \nto a total of nine focused, colleague-led communities. \nWe continued to deliver campaigns and awareness days \nfor Women’s History Month and Pride as well as more \nspecific regional awareness days nominated by our \npeople. These attract great support and engagement. \nWe also invited seven external speakers to talk on topics \nsuch as Transgender issues, Intersectionality, Allyship \nand Black History. As part of raising awareness about \nthe lived experience and diversity of our workforce, we \npublished 39 people profiles.\nEmployee Share Plan \nWe believe the more colleagues share in the success \nof the business, the more motivated they will be to \npursue our mission and deliver positive outcomes \nfor all of our stakeholders. So we launched our \nnew Employee Share Plan in November giving \nall employees the option of buying and receiving \nmatching shares.\nBuild a safe, flexible working environment\nHealth and safety (H&S) policy and  \ncompliance activity\n•\t Improved employee involvement and engagement \nwith H&S; we continued to work hard to ensure \nthat our employees feel involved, informed \nand able to contribute to a healthy and safe \nwork environment.\n•\t Increased H&S training programme in SThree \nAcademy, including introducing a full H&S \nAwareness training module for all our employees \nacross all regions.\n•\t Ensured that communication and consultation on \nH&S-related matters is part of the new employee \ninduction programme, in addition to one-to-one H&S \nand monthly regional communication meetings.\n•\t Continued to promote and train fire wardens, \nworkplace first aiders and mental health first aiders \nto support our hybrid way of working.\n•\t Implemented processes for reporting of any \naccidents or incidents involving employees and \nECM contractors.\n•\t Ensured we have monitored behavioural safety, \nsafety performance and risk management \narrangements established in our core governance \nstructure with our monthly KPI dashboard.\nDefine career pathways \nWe have defined sales pathways using the Elements \nonboarding programme as a baseline. All the 118 \ndifferent sales career journeys possible at SThree have \nbeen represented with specific learning pathways. \nAll core function teams also now have 35 individual \npathways built onto the Learning Management System \n(LMS). They have been simplified and standardised in \nreadiness for our enhanced platform.\nGlobal grading\nEvery employee in each business now has a grade \nthat reflects their position in each company. This new \nscheme was launched across the Group allowing us \nto become much more standardised. The benefits \nare greater visibility for management, allowing \nbetter informed and more nuanced interventions to \nachieve goals such as diversity and inclusion. Grading \nalso helps us define reward structures and create \ncommunities around roles.\nEnhance training and talent development\nFor people to perform at their best and understand their \nrole in achieving our growth ambition, it is essential to \nhave access to comprehensive training. This year, we \nintroduced several major programmes and upgrades.\nUpgrading digital learning \nThe priority for the LMS during the year was to drive \nadoption of digital academies. We began by making \nit easier for new joiners and current employees to find \nthe right learning by organising programmes into five \nacademies: Recruitment, Skills, Management, Tech, and \nEthics. All are open to any of our people. We have made all \nLinkedIn learning available through our SThree Academy. \nEvery module can also now be accessed remotely \nby phone. \nThe result has been a significant uptick in usage.  \nIn 2022, our people accessed 36,902 hours of  \nlearning and development, with almost 21,184  \ncourses being completed.\nPlatform enhancements\nAlthough only at pilot stage this year - see Our Platform \nsection on page 40 - new technology will enhance \nthe working experience, acting as a key enabler by \naccelerating learning, improving individual performance \nand removing process frustrations and administrative \nburdens that hold our talent back.\nSenior management development\nOur new leadership framework, Leading with Purpose, \nhas begun increasing capability across our senior \nmanagement community. Its framework is supported \nby a new leadership index where leaders will be \nmeasured on their ability to inspire trust, create \nvision, execute strategy and coach potential. Through \ndeveloping our leaders, we will continue to build a \nstrong organisational culture, improve our eNPS score \nand ultimately positively impact retention. \nFind, develop and retain great women \nIdentify, our talent development programme, finds and \ndevelops women at SThree who have the most potential \nto become future leaders. Building on the success of \na previous Identify programme, 24 women from all \nparts of the organisation spent nine months pursuing \nindividualised learning pathways designed to enhance \ntheir skills and capabilities. We worked with social \nenterprise, Femme Palette, to deliver external mentoring \nfor every participant. Femme Palette then used the fees \nwe gave them to finance scholarships for women beyond \nSThree. We also ran learning events with external \nspeakers which offered guidance and inspiration \nfor participants in how to build their own bespoke \ncareer paths. Participants ended the programme with \nan opportunity to make recommendations to senior \nleaders about how we can continue to build a culture \nwhere women can thrive. Over 90% of women on the \nprogramme felt mentoring improved their skills.\nWellbeing capability pilot\nPilot mental wellbeing training was rolled out from \nMarch to June to cover 100 colleagues and people \nmanagers. The colleague programme focused on \nbuilding personal resilience; the people manager \nprogramme concentrated on how to identify the \nsigns of mental ill-health, start conversations and \nsign-post available resources. Overwhelmingly \npositive feedback from both pilots has informed our \ninvestment and training approach for 2023.\nCompliance learning strategy\nWe introduced four new compliance courses for all \nexisting staff and embedded them into the Elements \nProgramme for new joiners. Sponsored by the CEO, \nthe courses have so far achieved an average of 92% \ncompletion rates.\n“\u0007This year saw the launch of two new ERGs in the \nUK&I region – NOW (No Ordinary Women) and HERO \n(Heritage, Ethnicity, Race & Origin).

It is also an \noptimal way of working, keeping everyone performing \nat their best.\nAdapt our office environments to support hybrid \nworking\nTo optimise employee engagement and productivity \nwe developed and launched our office design \nplaybook. Already deployed in the creation of our new \nTokyo, Hamburg and Berlin offices, it provides more \ncollaborative spaces that offer more opportunities \nfor social interaction, meetings and team gatherings. \nThese significant changes adapt our property portfolio \nto the hybrid working environment, enabling our teams \nto perform at their best in the office, and outside, \nsupported by an integrated Microsoft workspace.\nMeasure progress and provide opportunities \nfor feedback\nAs part of our group listening strategy, in 2022, \nwe introduced quarterly Pulse Surveys to provide \nopportunities for employees to share their feedback \nmore regularly. The surveys were built around topics \nsuch as leadership, strategy, communication, and \nhealth and wellbeing. We saw steady increases in \nparticiaption and satisfaction scores across both pulse \nsurveys. Q2 and Q4 scores put us in the top 25% for \nprofessional services firms in the benchmark provided \nby Peakon Workday, our third-party partner. \nWe also launched Tell Me Anything sessions this \nyear, where Executive Committee members met \nwith a group of colleagues to have an open, candid \nconversation and listen to ideas and suggestions. \nThe outcomes of these sessions were then relayed \nto relevant teams and leaders to influence decision \nmaking and priorities. \nTalent and succession planning framework\nA new Talent Management Toolkit has been created \nthat guides managers through the Talent Management \nLifecycle. A key part of that lifecycle is succession. \nBi-annual ExCo Talent & Succession reviews provide \nExCo with visibility of the potential succession \ncandidates for all our top 100 leader roles. This \nallows them to build the bench-strength of emerging \nsuccessors and fast-track key talent. Our ambition is \nto have a successor ready to take on all Top-100 roles.\nBecome the sector’s employer of choice\nInvestments in our people demonstrate how we are \nbuilding a strong, supportive, training-focused culture. \nThey show we are serious about putting people at the \ncentre of what we do, helping everyone at SThree to \nbe more successful and achieve their full potential. \nThis all enhances our employee value proposition, \nmaking it more attractive to join and stay at SThree. \nGlobal reward analysis by gender\nSince April 2017, we have been reporting our UK \ngender pay data on an annual basis, and this year, for \nthe first time, we used a similar approach to consider \ngender pay data on a global basis.\nOur methodology\nAll employees who were active on 30 November 2021 \nhave been included in the analysis. \nMeasures included are median (the middle value of a \nlist ordered from highest to lowest), mean (adding up \nall the numbers and dividing the result by the total data \npoints), and the proportion of employees who identify \nas women and men in each quarter of the Group from \nhighest to lowest paid.\nAt a global level we have equal numbers of women and \nmen. Our analysis shows that the median hourly pay \nof women is £0.84 for every £1 that men earn, and the \nmean hourly pay is £0.80 for every £1 that men earn.\nThis difference is primarily a result of women being \nunderrepresented in more senior and therefore more \nhighly paid leadership roles, and overrepresented in the \nless senior, lower paid roles. The chart below details \nthe proportion of women and men in each pay quartiles \nfrom highest to lowest.\nCurrently fewer than four in 10 of the highest paid roles \nat SThree and approaching six in 10 of the lowest paid \nroles, are held by women.\nTaking action to address gender parity and pay\nWe are committed to increasing representation of \nwomen in leadership roles and continue to invest in \nseveral areas. These include: \n•\t Ongoing focus on our flagship Identify programme, \na talent accelerator for women.\n•\t Reviewing and refreshing our approach to talent \nattraction. \n•\t Leveraging recently rolled out global grading to \nensure greater pay parity. \n•\t Upskilling managers on talent identification and \nmanagement, career planning, and coaching, to \ndrive a more inclusive approach to helping people \nto thrive. \n•\t Holding our ExCo to account through \nremuneration-linked objectives around gender \nbalance at senior leadership level. \nAs an organisation, our purpose is to bring skilled \npeople together to build the future, and we have an \nobligation to ensure those people are diverse and that \nfuture is inclusive.

With \nover 14 years’ experience as a listed company CFO \nand extensive risk management knowledge the CFO is \nbest placed to assess and monitor the financial impact \nof climate risk.\nIn addition, the Chief Executive Officer has appointed \nan Executive Committee (ExCo) which includes the \nsenior leaders within the business. The purpose of \nthe ExCo is to direct the Group strategy including the \nachievement of performance targets and mitigation \nof risks to the business. The ExCo conducts regular \nbusiness reviews related to strategy, risk management \n(including climate-related risks) and performance \nincluding progress towards ESG targets. The ExCo \nmeets every month, and in the event, further reporting \non any particular matter or risk is required, the Chair \nwill request a paper or verbal update. The ExCo \nreports to the Board and escalates both risk and ESG \nmatters as appropriate. The Board reviews strategy at \nleast twice a year.\nIn addition, ESG topics are regularly discussed at the \nGroup Remuneration Committee and Group Audit & \nRisk Committee. \nDuring the reporting period, the Board agenda \nincluded:\n•\t An update on ESG priorities where the Board \ninfluenced and challenged the KPIs and strategic \nplans including how to engage and influence \ndecision making throughout our leadership levels.\n•\t Agreeing our net zero target. The Board \nacknowledged that although our operations are \nnot carbon intense, as a key supplier to clients \nthere is an expectation to actively limit our \nemissions in order to maintain and grow client \nopportunities. The Board also discussed the risk of \n“green washing” and the need to utilise the robust \nSBTi framework to set a target aligned to best \npractice and climate science. Group carbon targets \nare therefore designed in partnership with SBTi, as \nagreed by the Board.\n•\t TCFD progress updates were provided by the CFO \nto give assurance to the Board that we would meet \nall compliance requirements. This provided an \nopportunity for the Board to question actions and \nprogress, and influence the direction of the TCFD \nSteering Committee as required.\nIn addition, the Board reviews principal risks annually, \nof which some contain climate-related risks and ESG \nmatters as appropriate, with key material changes \nbeing discussed and agreed.\nManagement oversight\nDescribe management’s role in assessing  \nand managing climate-related risks  \nand opportunities.\nTo oversee the governance of risk management, \nincluding climate-related risks, the ExCo has formed \na Group Risk Committee. In addition, to support \nthe management of climate-related matters and \nwider ESG ambitions, the ExCo established an \nESG Committee.\nESG Committee\nSThree’s ESG Committee has representatives from \nthe ExCo, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief \nFinancial Officer, Chief People Officer and Chief \nLegal Officer, as well as individuals from key strategic \nmarkets and departments.\nThe ESG Committee meets quarterly to direct the \nGroup ESG strategy, policies and implementation \nof key changes across the business. This includes \nidentifying climate risks and providing oversight of \nthe assessment and mitigation of these risks. The \nreview of climate-related risks occurred each quarter \nduring 2022. \nIn order to provide the right level of oversight to \nboth climate risk and climate opportunities the ESG \nCommittee has formed two sub-groups which include: \n•\t TCFD Steering Committee, formed in 2022, which \nincludes leaders from across the business with \nexpertise in risk management, financial planning, \nstrategy, ESG and reporting. The TCFD Steering \nCommittee provides recommendations to the ESG \nCommittee on the assessment and management \nof climate risk, processes to ensure climate \nrisk informs financial and strategic planning, \nand the governance of climate risk. During the \nreporting period, the TCFD Steering Committee \nimplemented 26 actions to improve the controls, \ngovernance and strategic response to climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities. \n•\t Global Renewable Energy Network which includes \nenergy sector leaders from across the business \nwho come together to learn, share and collaborate \non actions that improve the performance of \nour renewable energy business, maximising \nthe opportunities identified through scenario \nanalysis and supporting the achievement of \nperformance targets. \nThe ESG Committee provides input to the ExCo and \nalso the Group Risk Committee, escalating strategic \nimpacts and material changes as required.

At the Group level we have identified four broad climate-related transition risks which may cut across \nour short, medium and long-term time horizons. These transition risks are global in nature, so we do not discuss \nspecific geographies here. We also recognise potential for opportunity associated with some of those risks, and, \nwhere appropriate, we refer to specific geographies. Through the process of data gathering, collecting internal \ninsights and analysing market intelligence we identified specific focus areas for climate-related scenario analysis, \nbased on potential material impact on financial and strategic planning. As a result, we have identified the most \nmaterial climate-related risks and opportunities as outlined below.

      "text": "Strategic Report\nRisks \nRisk management framework \nDescribe how processes for identifying, \nassessing, and managing climate-related risks \nare integrated into the organisation’s overall \nrisk management. \nThe Group Risk Committee is a recently formed sub-\ncommittee of the ExCo. Its purpose is to support the \ndevelopment and maintenance of an effective risk \nculture within the organisation, in line with the SThree \nstrategic objectives and risk appetite through the \nmaintenance of the Group Risk Framework. The Group \nRisk Committee is responsible for:\n•\t Evaluating, monitoring and reviewing principal and \nemerging risks including climate related risks.\n•\t Ensuring climate risk is integrated into the Group \nRisk Framework.\n•\t Maintaining oversight of climate risks where they \noccur or impact Group principal risks.\n•\t Reviewing and assessing the strength of controls \nin place for climate risk as part of the oversight of \nprincipal risks and overall review of emerging risks \nfor the Group. This assessment is reported to the \nBoard on a bi-annual basis.\nOn a six-monthly basis the Board receives an update \nfrom the Group Risk Committee which includes \nclimate-related risks. In addition, any material changes \nrelating to ESG matters, climate risk, and targets are \nincluded within the CFO report (executive sponsor of \nclimate risk) which is delivered at each Board meeting. \nIn addition, climate change-related risks, and the \nrelated mitigating actions, are presented to the Audit \n& Risk Committee along with Group principal risks. \nRead about the Group’s risk management framework \non pages 106 to 107.\nIdentifying climate-related risks \nDescribe the organisation’s processes for \nidentifying and assessing climate-related risks.\nOur existing Group risk framework is designed to \nidentify, assess, score and monitor all risks. In addition, \nrisk mitigation plans and timelines are determined by \nthe appetite and tolerance for risks as set by the Board \nand directed by ExCo. \nOur approach to identifying climate-related risks \nincludes utilising market research data, external \npartner insights and internal business reviews. \nOur strategic review process asks senior leaders \nfrom across the business to identify any current or \nemerging risks within their markets, with key questions \naround climate-related market changes, policy and \nthought leadership. These are then discussed at local \nmanagement meetings and escalated to the ESG \nCommittee, who in turn, ensures the right mitigation \nand controls are put in place.\nIn addition, throughout 2022, we continued to utilise \nclimate-related scenarios, first introduced in 2021, to \nidentify and assess the climate risks and opportunities \nto SThree, with these forming a regular agenda point \nwithin our ESG Committee. Climate-related scenario \nanalysis has demonstrated that there are no immediate \nrisks that would impact strategy, performance \nand liquidity of SThree. Therefore, climate change \ncontinues to be an emerging risk to the business. \nHowever, in 2022 we reviewed and assessed the role \nclimate change may play in relation to the Group \nprincipal risks. As a result, in agreement with the Chief \nFinancial Officer who acts as senior sponsor, we have \nintegrated relevant emerging climate-related issues \nwithin our principal risks. See further details below.\nManaging climate risks \nDescribe the organisation’s processes for \nmanaging climate-related risks.\nTo better understand our climate resilience, we assess \nthe potential magnitude and likelihood of specific risks \nand opportunities under the varied parameters and \nassumptions of each scenario, quantifying the financial \nimpact on net fees – the same financial metric used \nacross SThree’s risk management framework.\nOnce assessed, climate-related risks are assigned \na risk owner who is responsible for building and \nimplementing the mitigation controls related to \nthat risk. Each risk and control are then monitored, \nusing key risk indicators (KRI) with metrics being \nreported on a quarterly basis, with any changes being \nescalated, to the ESG Committee. \nResponsible business continued\nIn 2022, we identified that some of the Group principal \nrisks are, to an extent, impacted by climate change \nand as such we have reviewed each with a climate \nrisk lens. As a result, where there is an impact or a \nlink to climate change the principal risk now reflects \nelements of the climate-related risks identified through \nscenario analysis. These risks are regularly reviewed \nby the Group Risk Committee and twice a year by the \nBoard. Further details of these risks can be found in \nour Risks section on pages 108 to 113 and more details \naround risk management governance can be found on \npages 106 to 107.  \nMetrics and Targets – taking action \nto limit climate impact\nMetrics\nDisclose the metrics used by the  \norganisation to assess climate-related risks \nand opportunities in line with its strategy  \nand risk management process.\nBeing an environmental conscious business is part \nof our culture. For over a decade at SThree, we have \nmonitored our scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and \nexpanded scope 3 reporting aligned to best practice. \nWe have been actively implementing measures to \nreduce and avoid carbon emissions since then. \nThroughout 2021 and 2022, we spent time \nunderstanding net zero best practice in order to \nset ambitious yet achievable net zero targets that \nare informed by climate science and align to the \nrequirements of the Paris Agreement. \nIn addition, through climate-related scenario analysis \nwe have identified both climate risks and opportunities \nand metrics to monitor KRI. The KRI used as metrics \nto monitor our climate risks and opportunities are \ndetailed within the risk descriptions outlined in our \nTCFD Strategy section on page 63 to 73. The KRI are \nreviewed quarterly by the ESG Committee with any \nmaterial changes escalated to ExCo for review and \nfurther escalation to the Board if required. \nCarbon reduction\nIn 2021, we conducted a carbon emission materiality \nassessment utilising the GHG Protocol. As a result, we \nhave expanded scope 3 emissions reporting to include \nall 15 categories. We will be reporting against these \nfactors annually to demonstrate progress towards our \nnet zero targets. \nDisclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if appropriate, \nScope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and \nthe related risks.\nStreamline Energy and Carbon \nReporting (SECR) 2022 \nThis year we have calculated our environmental \nimpact across scope 1, 2 and 3 (selected categories) \nfor our global emissions sources. Our emissions are \npresented on both a location and market basis. On \na market basis our emissions are 2,620 tCO2e, an \naverage impact of 0.83 tCO2e per FTE. This represents \na 73% increase in the intensity of our market-based \nemissions since 2021, driven primarily by increases \nin business travel. Our location-based emissions are \n2,705 tCO2e, an increase of 94% from 2021. \nAs restrictions on Covid-19 have lifted, business travel \nhas increased across the business. This is reflected \nin a 477% increase in business travel emissions since \n2021, driven primarily by an increase in air travel. Due \nto the transition to a new travel system, business travel \ndata continues to develop and we expect accuracy to \ncontinue to improve in future years. \nThe cumulative impact of reduced Company vehicle \nusage, reductions in the use of natural gas and no \nrefrigerant top-ups being recorded in 2022, has \nresulted in scope 1 emissions decreasing by 35%.\nEnergy efficiency initiatives\nIn the period covered by the report SThree plc has \nundertaken the following emissions and energy \nreduction initiatives:\n•\t We have continued to transition our fleet away \nfrom petrol and diesel vehicles to hybrid and \nelectric. Although this programme began in 2021, \nthe impact of this change is now being seen in \nour scope 1 emissions as Covid-19 restrictions \nare lifted.\n•\t Efforts have been made to reduce natural gas \nusage in our UK sites. This has led to a 42% \ndecrease in emissions from natural gas in our \nscope 1 footprint.\n•\t We continue to transition our business to \nrenewable energy and saw renewable energy use \ngrow to 39% (+1%).\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-75\nP-74\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

This has been a key priority of the Group \nto ensure we minimise the risk of changing client and \ncandidate preferences and maximise the opportunity \nof being a ‘green’ recruiter. \nIn 2022, we established net zero working groups \nfor each of our high emission sources with the sole \nobjective of developing carbon reduction plans and \nensuring these are embedded within our operating \nplans. These groups include subject matter experts \nalongside business leaders who will shape and drive \nsustainable transformation across the global business. \nAs a result of this work, we have been participating \nin the SBTi net zero validation process and will be in \na position to announce near-term and long-term net \nzero targets alongside our transition plan in 2023. \nWe do however understand that climate change will \nnot wait and we must take action now. This was a key \nmessage at COP27 in Egypt this year. As a result, we \nhave set a carbon reduction target and made steady \nprogress in 2022, as per the below summary.\nTarget\nTo reduce our scope 1, 2 and limited scope 3 emissions by 25% by 2024 (baseline year 2019).\nProgress\n44% reduction in emissions across scope 1, 2 and 3 since 2019. \n2022 actions\nIn 2022, we did see our carbon emissions increase by 94% YoY which was a direct result of Covid-19 \nrestrictions being lifted. As we saw offices reopen, business meetings and business travel resume, we \nhave recorded an increase in emissions YoY. However, the reductions we saw in 2021 were not reflective \nof business as usual. We remained focused in 2022 on delivering the following operational changes to \ntransition to net zero: \n•\t Increased the amount of clean energy procured to 39% (2021: 38%).\n•\t We reduced the use of natural gas across our offices by 42%.\n•\t Reduced the emissions of our car fleet by 78%. \n•\t Continued to improve our office selection criteria to prioritise green properties.\n•\t Delivered 14 environmental awareness events to colleagues alongside weekly sustainability \nconversations in some locations, to promote sustainable behaviours.\n•\t Facilitated over 1,382 hours of volunteering at environmental projects to raise awareness and educate \nour colleagues. \n•\t Completed a single use plastic audit in the USA and began to implement plans to remove single use \nplastic from the business.\nThrough climate-related scenario analysis, we identified more opportunities than risks, in particular the \nopportunities that arise from the role STEM skills will play in decarbonisation. Our scenario analysis highlighted \na particular opportunity in the clean energy sector which has resulted in SThree setting a target and strategy to \nmaximise this opportunity. \nTarget\nTo double the size of our clean energy business by 2024 (baseline year 2019).\nProgress\n88% growth in net fees since 2019.\n2022 actions\nIn 2022, our clean energy business grew by 29% YoY. To support the realisation of our clean energy target we:\n•\t Delivered green careers upskilling events to 86 STEM professionals.\n•\t Collaborated with a client to deliver green skills awareness events to 240 high school students.\n•\t Partnered with Women of Renewable Industries and Sustainable Energy (WRISE) on partnered events.\nOur climate targets have been established to mitigate climate risk and maximise climate opportunities. KRI are in \nplace as measures to monitor climate risks, these KRI are metrics which contribute to our overarching targets. As \nan example our KRI to reduce the carbon emissions of car fleet is a sub-target and metric within our overarching \ncarbon reduction target.\nFurthermore, our focus on ESG matters is reflected through our remuneration policy with the weighting of \nperformance measures adjusted to accommodate related targets.

When presented on a constant currency basis, \nthe net fees increased by 19% YoY; the strengthening \nof our two main trading currencies, the US Dollar and \nthe Euro, against Sterling during the year, increased \nthe total net fees by £8.1 million.\nNet fee growth has been strong throughout the year, \ndriven by continued high demand from clients for \ncandidates with STEM skills.

      "text": "Strategic Report\nStrategic Report\nPermanent net fee income was up 6% which was \ndriven by DACH, our largest Permanent market \ndelivering net fee growth of 6%. EMEA excluding \nDACH also reported growth of 6%, with USA down 8% \nfollowing our strategic focus on Contract and strong \nprior year comparatives. APAC was up by 45%. This \nwas reflected in growth in Technology up 10% and \nEngineering up 24%. Life Sciences was down 14% \nYoY reflecting very strong prior year comparators. \nGroup Permanent net fees as a percentage of salary \nincreased marginally to 25.3% (2021: 25.0%).\nOperating expenses increased by 20% YoY on a \nreported basis, amounting to £353.1 million (2021: \n£294.7 million), mainly attributable to higher personnel \ncosts due to investments in headcount across the \nbusiness, higher average salaries and bonuses and \nincreased share-based payment charges. Other \noperating expenses included spend on technology \nand improved systems, as well as a loss on disposal \nof legacy development costs capitalised in previous \nyears. In addition, following the Board approval of \nthe plan to restructure two businesses in Ireland and \nSingapore, and to close the Hong Kong business, due \nto continued underperformance, the Group incurred \n£2.4 million in personnel termination costs (see further \ndetails in the Investment section below or note 7 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements).\nThe reported operating profit was £77.6 million (2021: \n£61.0 million), up 23% YoY in constant currency, driven \nby strong performance in Contract net fees. The \nnet currency movements versus Sterling provided \na moderate net tailwind to the operating profit, \nproviding a £2.8 million benefit.\nThe Group operating profit conversion ratio6 increased \nto 18.0% (2021: 17.1%), which reflects the positive \nmomentum in net fee growth and operational leverage \npartially offset by the impact of the technology and \npeople investments and costs associated with the \nrestructuring activities undertaken in Ireland and \nAPAC in the second half of the year. \nNet finance costs\nNet finance costs, which predominantly related to \nlease interest, decreased to £0.5 million (2021: £0.8 \nmillion) in line with the reduction in lease liabilities. \nIncome tax\nThe total tax charge for the year on the Group’s profit \nbefore tax was £22.8 million (2021: £17.9 million), \nrepresenting a full year effective tax rate (ETR) on \ncontinuing operations of 29.6%, broadly in line with \nthe prior year reported ETR on continuing operations \nof 29.8%.\nThe Group’s ETR varies depending on the mix of taxable \nprofits by territory, non-deductibility of the accounting \ncharge for LTIPs and other one-off tax items.\nOverall, the reported profit before tax was £77.0 \nmillion, up 23% YoY in constant currency and up 28% \non a reported basis (2021: reported £60.2 million \nand adjusted £60.0 million, both excluding the \ndiscontinued operations).\nThe reported profit after tax was £54.2 million, up 24% \nYoY in constant currency and up 28% on a reported \nbasis (2021: reported £42.3 million and adjusted £42.1 \nmillion, both excluding the discontinued operations).\nForeign exchange exposure\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates \nremain a material sensitivity to the Group’s reported \nresults. By way of illustration, each 1% movement \nin annual exchange rates of the Euro and US Dollar \nagainst Sterling impacts the Group’s net fees by \n£2.4 million and £1.1 million respectively per annum, \nand operating profit by £0.8 million and £0.4 million \nrespectively per annum. Our foreign exchange risk \nmanagement strategy involves using certain derivative \nfinancial instruments to minimise the transactional \nexposure arising from currency fluctuations.\nEarnings per share (EPS)\nThe reported and adjusted EPS was 41.0 pence (2021: \nreported 31.9 pence and adjusted 31.8 pence). The \nYoY growth reflects the exceptionally strong trading \nperformance, largely stable Group ETR, and the \nweighted average number of shares reducing by 0.1 \nmillion YoY. \nThe reported diluted EPS was 39.9 pence (2021: 30.9 \npence excluding discontinued operations). Share \ndilution mainly results from various share options \nin place and expected future settlement of certain \ntracker shares. The dilutive effect on EPS from tracker \nshares will vary in future periods, depending on the \nprofitability of the underlying tracker businesses and \nthe settlement of vested arrangements.\nDividends\nThe Board monitors the appropriate level of dividend, \ntaking into account achieved and expected trading of \nthe Group, together with its balance sheet position. \nThe Board aims to offer shareholders long-term \nordinary dividend growth within a targeted dividend \ncover6 range of 2.5x to 3.0x through the cycle.\nChief Financial Officer’s statement continued\nThe Board has proposed to pay a final dividend at 11.0 \npence (2021: 8.0 pence) per share. Taken together with \nthe interim dividend of 5.0 pence (2021: 3.0 pence)  \nper share, it gives the total dividend for the year of  \n16.0 pence (2021: 11.0 pence) per share. \nThe final dividend, which amounts to approximately \n£14.8 million, will be subject to shareholder approval  \nat the 2023 Annual General Meeting. It will be paid on \n9 June 2023 to shareholders on the register on  \n12 May 2023.\nBalance sheet\nTotal Group net assets increased to £200.4 million \n(2021: £158.2 million), driven by the excess of net profit \nover the dividend payments, and favourable foreign \ncurrency movements, partially offset by share buy-\nbacks. Net working capital, including contract assets, \nincreased by £45.1 million on the prior year, driven \nmainly by the accelerated growth in revenue and a \nstrong contractor order book increasing our working \ncapital. Our days sales outstanding increased slightly \nto 45 days (2021: 44 days) due to the challenging \neconomic environment experiences in various \ncountries we operate in.\nOur business model remains highly cash generative, \nand we have no undue concentration of repayment \nobligations in respect of trade payables or borrowings.\nInvestments\nIn March 2022, SThree's Board approved the Group-\nwide infrastructure investment programme which \nwill help us achieve our 2024 ambitions and deliver \nsustainable returns over the longer term. This business \ntransformation programme aims to modernise our \ncore systems within sales and supporting functions \ndelivering enhanced sales effectiveness as well as \nscalable and automated end-to-end processes for the \nflexible talent models we provide. The programme \nstarted in June this year and will last until the end \nof 2024. For the year ended 30 November 2022, \nthe Group spent £4.1 million primarily on the initial \nresearch-related stages of the programme. These \ncosts did not meet the capitalisation criteria. The \nentire amount was therefore immediately expensed in \nthe Group income statement.\nInvestments in subsidiaries\nThe subsidiary undertakings principally affecting  \nthe profits and net assets of the Group are listed in  \nnote 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \nDuring the year, the Group’s businesses delivered a \nvery strong financial performance, ahead of market  \nand management’s expectations. No significant  \nindicators of impairment were identified when  \nreviewing recoverable amounts of the Company’s  \nkey trading subsidiaries.\nHowever, the commencement of restructuring \nactivities undertaken in Ireland and Singapore in Q4 \n2022, and the Board decision to close the Hong Kong \nbusiness, acted as a trigger to the impairment charge \nwhich was recognised in the Company’s separate \nbooks (for the total amount of £0.9 million) in 2022. \nAll three businesses underperformed in the past few \nyears, with Hong Kong in particular remaining at \nsub-optimal level. The Group’s presence in the APAC \nregion was already subject to the review in 2017, when \nthe Board significantly downsized operations in Hong \nKong, reducing it to a satellite office. Most recently, it \nbecame clear that our continued trading in Hong Kong \nwas no longer a viable investment option.\nThis impairment charge did not impact the Group \nconsolidated results.\nIn the prior year, no impairment loss was recognised \nby the Company.\nTracker shares\nThe Group settled certain vested and unvested tracker \nshares during the year for a total consideration of £6.0 \nmillion which was determined using a formula set out \nin the Articles of Association underpinning the tracker \nshare businesses. The consideration was settled in \nSThree plc shares; 623,219 new shares were issued \nand 983,637 of shares held by the EBT were utilised. \nThe arrangement is deemed to be an equity-settled \nshare-based payment arrangement under IFRS 2 \nShare-based payments. There was no charge to the \nincome statement as initially the tracker shareholders \nsubscribed to the tracker shares at their fair value. \n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-87\nP-86\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

The year was characterised by a very strong \nmarket environment in the first half of the year and a \nsecond half that was overshadowed by geo-political \nchallenges, the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, supply chain \nbottlenecks, sharply rising inflation and the associated \nrise in interest rates. Despite these uncertainties, public \nsector investment increased due to efforts to stimulate \nthe economy and address key goals including energy \ninfrastructure and digitalisation projects. This had a \npositive impact on STEM skills demand across most \ndisciplines. However, job opportunities decreased \nin Life Sciences as Covid-19 research ramped down \nwhilst interest rate increases, inflation and supply chain \nblockages put a brake on the Construction sector.\nOverall, our clear strategic positioning in this region \nhelped the business deliver a resilient performance in \nthe year.\nImpact of megatrends/Opportunities\nDigitalisation: the drive for energy efficiency \nand automation to reduce production costs and \nresource consumption lifted demand for STEM skills, \nparticularly in Technology, with higher demand for \nroles within Infrastructure, Cyber Security, Open-\nSource Software Development, and Engineering, with \nstrong demand for Construction roles. \nDecarbonisation: sustainability targets, and a \nswitch from nuclear energy, led to strong growth in \nsustainability and renewable energy skills placements.\nDemographic changes: new working models and \nageing populations are leading to skill shortages \nparticularly in STEM.\nReasons for confidence \nThe war for talent continued as skilled workers retired \nfaster than they could be replaced while demand for \nSTEM talent increased. As a result, there were over \n300,000 STEM vacancies in Germany. In response,  \nwe became the first German recruitment company  \nto open a partnership with Bosch. \nOur people\nSThree was named ‘Top Employer’ in Germany \nfor the ninth year in a row.

We \nsaw an increased demand for STEM talent across most \nof the markets. This was driven by the ‘great transition’ \nto sustainability which led to a shift towards power and \nrenewables in the energy sector in the Netherlands;  \nwhilst Healthcare, Engineering and IT were the most \nattractive segments in the UK, with Life Sciences having \nthe highest proportion of temporary workers.\nImpact of megatrends/Opportunities\nDigitalisation: strong demand for delivery of digital \ntransformation projects led to an increase in roles \nwithin IT Leadership and Strategy, Project Managers, \nSoftware Development and Testing.\nDecarbonisation: renewable initiatives, that are \nalready funded, are presenting opportunities in our \nenergy business.\nResearch-led healthcare: healthcare tech demand \nis constant while the development of medicines and \ndevices is driving demand for talent in Life Sciences.\nDemographic changes: baby boomers taking their \nskills into retirement, plus new working models are \nboth impacting almost every sector. Generational shift \nhas led to high demand for senior IT roles and a push \non diversity.\nReasons for confidence\nOngoing skills shortages in niche STEM roles will \ndrive demand for our niche-specialist consultants. \nThe strength of our long-term relationships with \nclients - especially those which lead the market in \ntechnological change - as well as our candidates also \npoints to continued growth. Our strong Contract offer \nmeans we are well positioned to benefit from the rise in \nflexible working. The Most Attractive Staffing Markets \nGlobally 2022 report found that the best performing \nEuropean countries are typically located in the northern \nand central regions of the continent, are large, have \nfavourable legislative environments, and are recovering \nfrom the pandemic relatively well. Our weighting in the \nNetherlands, the UK and France fits this success profile \nand suggests we are well placed for future growth.\nOur people\nWe have invested heavily in personal development with the \ncreation of the SThree Academy online platform offering \nover 21,000 training courses and a collaboration with \nNyenrode Business University. The French business has \ndeveloped an online candidate community for contractors.\n2022 performance highlights\nThe segment saw net fees grow by 24% YoY like-for-like \nwith growth in both our Contract and Permanent divisions.\nThe Netherlands, our largest country in the region, \nsaw very strong net fee growth of 34%, due to solid \nperformance in Technology, up 36%, which was driven \nby demand for Project Managers, ERP Consultants \nand Business Intelligence and Data Science roles. \nEngineering was up 34% YoY, mainly due to demand \nfor Process Engineers, Electrical Engineers and Health \nand Safety Advisers.\nNet fees in the UK were up 23% YoY driven by \nTechnology up 30% as demand increased for roles within \nIT Leadership and Strategy, Software Development and \nTesting, Cloud and Data & Business Intelligence. \nWe also saw net fee growth of 10% in Belgium driven by \nTechnology, and 32% in Dubai driven by Engineering.\nOutlook\nOverall, the region has set strong foundations to \ncontinue its growth and momentum in 2023. Whilst \nwe understand that both geopolitical and economic \nuncertainty will remain, STEM talent is critical and is \nin short supply.

Research-led \nhealthcare and digitalisation were both significant \ndrivers of top-line growth as was decarbonisation \ndriving demand from our utilities clients who are \nadapting their businesses towards clean energy.\nImpact of megatrends/Opportunities  \nDigitalisation: considerable capital and resources \nare being focused on digitalisation driven by the \naverage return on investment increasing by 81% in \n2022. Next-phase digitalisation, linked to step change \ndevelopments such as 5G, web3 and the metaverse \nshould drive future growth.\nDecarbonisation: most Fortune 500 and beyond \ncorporations are setting ESG goals in their strategies, \nand their corporate charters. Many institutional \ninvestors are also deploying capital based not only \non raw financial metrics but also on ESG progress. \nOur utilities clients are focused on adapting their \nbusinesses so clean energy is an area of investment.\nResearch-led healthcare: the number of Life Sciences \nprofessionals grew by 79% between 2001-2021 \ncompared with an 8% growth for all USA occupations. \nThis talent base had the second-lowest unemployment \nrate of all USA occupations in April 2022 at 0.6%. \nWith increased supply and demand, the space is only \nexpected to grow.\nDemographic changes: experienced hires are retiring \nfaster than they can be replaced. This, combined with Gen \nZ’s desire for career flexibility, a greater work-life balance \nand interesting projects, is driving demand for STEM skills \nand contract hire, which is our strategic focus.\nReasons for confidence\nThe USA has entered a new age. There is a shift away \nfrom manufacturing, bricks and mortar retail and \nother legacy sectors towards being predominantly \na producer of automation and intelligent-design \nproducts and solutions. \nGovernment investment and legislation is driving \ndemand for future-fit products and infrastructure. \nOur people\nWe have continued to invest in our people. Our managers \nare now given empathy training so they can better support \ncolleagues during times of stress or other emotional \nchallenges. An improved Velocity scheme offers \nincreased opportunities and rewards, and we have made \nenhancements to the US region’s hybrid working model.\nThere has been industry recognition through a range \nof awards for women and leadership. SThree’s US \nPresident Sunny Ackerman is one of the leaders on \nthe Staffing 100 list, published by Staffing Industry \nAnalyst, that recognises executives for progress in a \ncompany’s workforce solution’s ecosystem.\n2022 performance highlights\nThe segment saw net fee growth of 13% YoY like-for-like. \nThere was strong growth in Contract of 19%. Permanent \nwas down 8% following our strategic shift towards \nContract and very strong prior year comparatives, when \nLife Sciences was the standout performer with high \ndemand from Covid-19-related activity.\nTechnology was up 18% with a particular focus on \nroles within Adobe, Software Developers, Mobile \nApplications and Salesforce.\nEngineering was up 32%, driven by demand for roles \nwithin Electrical Engineering and Project Management.\nOutlook\nWe will continue to invest strategically in the region \nas we align our resources with the best long-term \nopportunities. The focus in 2023 will be to capture \nmarket share through continued growth within our \ncore vertical markets of Technology, Engineering \nand Life Sciences.

Its strong Technology sector continues to \ndrive demand for IT skills which we meet through our \ncommunities of tech experts in various disciplines, \nmany of which are in hard-to-fill niches.\nReasons for confidence\nDemand for contract recruitment is growing due \nto client desire to accelerate business at a quicker \nrate than is possible with permanent hires.

Our new integrated technology \nis expected to increase our operational leverage thereby \ncontributing to faster growth in net fees per head. Ultimately, \nit will unlock the path to our Capital Markets Day ambition of \nan operating conversion at or above 21%. \nCreate Employee Value Proposition (EVP) and culture that enable our people to be at their best. \nEnhance the employee experience, win their loyalty and help them become more successful, more quickly.\nHow the Board had regard to the feedback in its decision making, including stakeholder  \ngroups affected\nBackground and considerations made\nThe Board recognises enhancing the EVP is key to the ongoing \nsuccess of the Group. The Board defined EVP as the Group-\nwide commitment to make SThree an attractive place to \nwork, combined with appealing compensation, great career \nopportunities and corporate culture.  As part of it, the Board \napproved investments in developing a range of differentiated \nofferings to attract and retain the best talent, including \nenhanced compensation and benefit schemes, onboarding, \ncareer management and learning programmes, better \nworkplace/lifestyle balance and the right modern tools for our \nemployees to be successful in delivering their service. We aim \nto develop our employees’ trust and ongoing commitment to \nSThree’s values and ambitions, helping them better execute \nour strategy and, in the longer term, generate more lifetime \nvalue to our business and other stakeholders. \nThe likely consequences of the decision in the \nlong term \nBesides enhancing our employee benefits, the EVP also \nincorporates plans to build on the skills of our leadership \nteam who, by giving the right strategic direction, will unleash \nour people’s potential to deliver SThree’s vision of becoming \nthe number one STEM talent provider. \nShareholders: longer-term Group financial plans, regional \nstrategies and long-term ambitions will be linked to an \nengaging reward structure.

However, when the pandemic \nhit our ways of working were significantly reshaped. Having \ntemporarily closed our offices, imposed travel restrictions, \nand invested in new technology and training to support \nremote work, we managed to reduce our carbon footprint, \nexceeding our original target for 2024. Since then, the \nBoard has committed to set a new net zero target using the \nScience-Based Target initiative’s (SBTi) Net Zero Standard. \nThis led to the development and Board sign-off of well-\nconsidered, data-led transition plans for each high-emitting \nbusiness area, implementation of transparent Scope 3 \nemission reporting, and establishment of a carbon removal \ninvestment plan that will introduce nature-based solutions. \nThese outcomes have been validated by a robust SBTi review \nprocess and our new net zero target will be announced \nin 2023. \nThe likely consequences of the decision in the \nlong term \nOur new net zero target will be aligned to climate science \nand SBTi standards, which have been widely accepted by \nmarket investors as best practice. Our new target will also \nprovide greater transparency to all our stakeholders, on our \ncommitment to tackling climate change and the methodology \nused to define net zero. We will continue to disclose data to \nSBTi, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and other external \nnet zero partners, all of which are external organisations who \nwill give SThree credibility in our actions.\nWe will utilise external benchmarking and partner \ntestimonials, to strengthen our value proposition for our \nclients who increasingly, as part of their own net zero targets, \nput pressure on their supply chains to set similar targets.\nWe also want to be seen as an attractive employer for our \nexisting and potential employees, who want to work for \ncompanies which have clear plans and commitments to help \nshape the future and fight the environmental damage caused \nby climate change.  \nExpected outcome for shareholders: we understand \nthe investment communities need to decarbonise their \ninvestment portfolio and, as such, our net zero target \nand roadmap will ensure our investors have the data and \nefficiencies needed to meet their reporting and targets.\nNew parent brand identity. \nUpgrading our visual identity and reflecting it in a new corporate website.\nHow the Board had regard to the feedback in its decision making, including stakeholder  \ngroups affected\nBackground and considerations made\nA new marketing strategy was approved by the Board in \n2022, which was accompanied by the launch of an updated \nparent brand identity and website, and a coherent ‘House of \nBrands’ framework in April 2022. \nThe likely consequences of the decision in the \nlong term \nClients and candidates: the initiative will strengthen the \nSThree corporate identity.\nThe Board expects that our stakeholder confidence in the \nSThree brand will increase. A future-minded brand with a \nclear identity is primed for future growth which is reassuring \nfor both investors and our people. \nStakeholder engagement continued\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-105\nP-104\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

However, when brought into our \nday-to-day activities, successful risk management \nhelps us to maximise our competitive advantage and \nsuccessfully deliver on our strategy. Whilst the ultimate \nresponsibility for risk management rests with the \nBoard, the effective day-to-day management of risk is \ndelegated to our leaders across the business, seeking \nat all times to maintain a prudent balance between \nmitigating risks and taking advantage of opportunities.\nUkraine \nThe war in Ukraine created macro-economic \nuncertainty and concerns for our people, candidates \nand clients. The Group Crisis Management Team (CMT) \nwas engaged to review risks for all stakeholders and \nthe Group, in order to formulate next steps. Measures \ntaken included a new internal process, with sanctions \nscreening checks across all suppliers and clients.  \nWhilst not considered a principal risk in its own right \nthe ongoing war in Ukraine impacts existing principal \nrisks and continues to be monitored.\nRisk management approach\nOur Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework \nand processes help us to describe, analyse, report and \nmonitor risks and controls at all levels in the Group. \nWe believe that the effective management of risk is \nbased on a ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ approach, \nwhich includes:\n•\t Our strategy setting process.\n•\t The quality of our people and culture.\n•\t Established internal controls with assurance via \nself-verification on the strength of controls.\n•\t Processes for reviewing, escalating and  \ncontrolling risks.\n•\t Independent assurance by internal audit and \nexternal audit.\n•\t Regular oversight by the relevant Committees.\n•\t Reacting quickly to market conditions and the cycle.\nPrincipal and key operational risks are considered and \ndiscussed as part of the strategic planning process. \nThis year, our principal risk statements were expanded \nto include key risk indicators and risk tolerance \nmeasures, as well as assessments of current controls \nand risk appetite. These statements are reviewed \ntwice a year by the Board, following discussion and \nchallenge at the Executive Committee and as part of \nrelevant function or regional updates to the Board.\nWhat we review when assessing our principal \nand key risks:\n•\t Risk ownership: each risk has a named owner. \nIn addition, each principal risk is sponsored by \na member of the Executive Committee, who \ndrives progress.\n•\t Likelihood and impact: globally applied five-by-\nfive scoring matrix.\n•\t Gross risk: before mitigating controls.\n•\t Net risk: after mitigating controls are applied.\n•\t Risk appetite: defined at principal risk level and \ncategorised into five levels.\n•\t Risk tolerance: in data format, showing the amount \nof deviation from the risk appetite.\n•\t Key risk indicators: quantitative measures that \nprovide early signals of a change in the risk.  \n•\t Actions: key controls in place and activities \nrequired for further mitigation if required.\n•\t Impact on the Group’s strategic pillars and \ninterdependencies between principal risks.\n•\t Climate change: where the principal risk is \nimpacted by or could impact climate change.\nAll principal risks are detailed in a standardised \nstatement. This ensures effective review, \nunderstanding and monitoring throughout the Group, \ntogether with consistency, both in terminology and \nthe underlying assessment itself. As part of the top-\ndown process, an updated assessment was completed \nfor each principal risk by the relevant risk owner, \nworking with the Executive Committee risk sponsor \nand the risk function. The statements are challenged \nand reviewed in detail by the Group Risk Committee, \nExecutive Committee and by the Board twice a year. \nIn addition, deep dive reviews are conducted by the \nGroup Risk Committee throughout the year, with \nupdates on effectiveness and progress of mitigating \nactions and reporting to the Audit & Risk Committee \nto provide insight into controls and assurance \nas required.\nEmerging risks\nAs part of our ongoing risk management process, \nemerging risks are reviewed yearly. An emerging risk is \ndefined as a risk that materialises over a period of time, \nrather than at once, meaning the likely impact of the \nrisk is difficult to evaluate at the time of assessment of \nthe risk.\nEmerging risks are identified during:\n•\t Twice-yearly principal risk reviews.\n•\t The strategic review process with each region and \nfunction. \n•\t Horizon scanning undertaken by the Group Legal \nFunction.\n•\t Bi-monthly financial reviews of country \nperformance and macro-economic trends.\nClimate change risk, as reported in the 2021 Annual \nReport, continues to be an emerging risk for the \nGroup.

As a result, \nthe ten principal risks remain the same ones identified \nin 2021, with positive movement in net risk, other than \nwhere there has been an external impact.\nWe support the recommendation of the TCFD. We \nconsider climate, as well as broader environmental, \nsocial and governance risks as part of the review \nprocess for our principal risks, as well as in our half-\nyearly business strategy reviews.

SThree \noperates in a sector that is highly cyclical and sensitive to the economy and business sentiment. Mixed economic signals can \ndelay identification of changes in market conditions and business decisions to respond, both on the upside and downside. \nThe growth in the ECM models globally and fixed central support costs impact on the flexible cost base so may exacerbate \nany time lag between financial performance impact and ability to cut costs and therefore impacts the ability to scale when \nthe economy recovers quicker than anticipated.\nLink to climate change and sustainability: SThree may be affected, primarily through its work with the Engineering sector, \nto changes in government policy related to climate change, including in the renewable energy space, which may present \npositive business opportunities for the Company and fluctuations in the oil price. Geopolitical events, including energy price \nshocks and other energy security risks can have an impact on economies, and in turn SThree's markets and profits.\nMitigations \n•\t The annual strategic planning and budgeting process incorporates \nreviews of the broader market conditions along with monthly business \nperformance monitoring and twice-yearly reviews as part of the \nstrategy cycle to help inform any changes that are required to react to \nchanges in the economy.\n•\t The Group is a strategically diversified business, geographically, by \nsector and by product, with a focus on STEM markets which are less \nsensitive to economic cycles.\n•\t Strategic focus on Contract market which is more resilient in \nless certain economic conditions than Permanent and provides \na counter cyclical cash hedge working capital release with each \ncontract finisher.\n•\t The Group has a flexible cost base that enables the business to quickly \ncut costs to react swiftly to changes in market activity.\n•\t The Group has a strong balance sheet with low levels of net debt \nthrough the year and committed debt facilities to support the business.\nChange from 2021\nIncreased due to softening of the wider \nmacro-economic conditions, which is largely \ncontrolled through the Group’s well-diversified \nbusiness and ability to respond quickly to \nchanges in the market conditions.\nExecutive Committee sponsor: \nAndrew Beach\nChief Financial Officer\nLink to Strategic Pillar: \n1.

      "text": "Strategic Report\nStrategic Report\nGoing concern statement\nThe Directors have reviewed the Group’s cash flow forecasts, including the \nassumptions contained in the budget, and considered associated principal \nrisks which may impact the Group’s performance in the 12 months from \nthe date of approval of this year’s financial statements and in the period \nimmediately thereafter.\nViability statement\nIn accordance with provision 31 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018, the \nDirectors have assessed the prospects of the Group over the five-year period, based on \nmanagement’s reasonable expectations of the financial position and performance of the \nGroup, internal budgets, planning timeframes, medium-term targets and the potential \nimpact of the principal risks as documented on pages 106 to 113 of the Annual Report.\nAt 30 November 2022, the Group had no debt except \nfor IFRS 16 lease liabilities of £33.7 million and a small \nbank overdraft of £0.4 million. Credit facilities relevant \nto the review period comprise a committed £50.0 \nmillion RCF (a recently refinanced facility expiring in \nMay 2025, with extension options to 2027) and an \nuncommitted £30.0 million accordion facility, both \njointly provided by HSBC and Citibank. These facilities \nremained undrawn on 30 November 2022. A further \nuncommitted £5.0 million bank overdraft facility is \nalso held with HSBC of which £0.4 million was used at \nthe year end. (Refer to note 17 for further details on the \nnew credit facility which replaced the existing RCF as \nmentioned here.)\nIn addition, the Group has £65.4 million of cash \nand cash equivalents available to fund its short-\nterm needs, as well as a substantial working capital \nposition, reflecting net cash due to SThree for \nplacements already undertaken.\nThe RCF is subject to covenants that are measured \nbiannually in May and November, on a trailing \n12-month basis, being (i) net debt to EBITDA of a \nmaximum of 3.0x and (ii) interest cover of a minimum \nof 4.0x. The ratio of net debt to EBITDA at 30 \nNovember 2022 was nil, as no debt was drawn at the \nyear end, and interest cover was 125 times, and hence \nthe going concern assessment was primarily focused \non available liquidity during the assessment period.\nThe Directors considered the current and possible \nfuture impact from the macro-economic environment \non new placement activity and in turn on the Group’s \nnet fees performance. The Directors also considered \nexpected cash outflows attributable to investments \nin people, talent acquisition and infrastructure in \nresponse to identified market opportunities and \nemerging risks. \nThe base case forecasts were sensitised to reflect \na severe but plausible downside scenario on Group \nperformance. The key assumptions subject to the \nsensitivity analysis were a decline in net fees, with \na flat cost base, resulting in reduced margins and \noperating profit. \nIn the severe but plausible downside scenario, the \nGroup has sufficient liquidity headroom through \nthe whole period covered. This stress test also did \nnot incorporate potential mitigating actions at the \nBoard’s disposal to improve the position identified \nby the analysis, e.g. deferrals of capital expenditure, \ncash preservation initiatives, suspension of dividends \npayment and/or share buyback programme, and a \nnumber of further reductions in operating expenditure \nacross the Group primarily related to workforce \ncost reductions.\nFollowing this assessment, the Directors have formed \na judgement, at the time of approving the SThree \nGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2022, that \nthere are no material uncertainties that cast doubt \non the Group’s going concern status and that it is a \nreasonable expectation that the Group has adequate \nresources to continue in operational existence for at \nleast the next 12 months from the date of approval \nof this Annual Report. For this reason, the Group \ncontinues to adopt the going concern basis in \npreparing the Consolidated Financial Statements for \nthe year ended 30 November 2022.\nAssessment of prospects\nThe Group’s strategy is to deliver a sustainable and \nprofitable growth by focusing on four strategic \npillars and building on the favourable megatrends \nthat influence all markets and sectors we operate in. \nThe Group has a clear framework for investments in \nselective strategic initiatives and operational decisions \nmade to continue strengthening the Group’s market \nposition into the future. Our performance against our \nstrategic objectives is discussed in more detail on \npages 34-35. \nThe review period covers five years from 2023 to \n2027, which comprise the next financial year plan used \nin the going concern assessment and projections for \nthe subsequent four financial years. The Directors \nbelieve that the five years to November 2027 is an \nappropriate period over which a reasonable evaluation \nof the potential impact of future risk events on the \nGroup can be made. In coming to this view, the \nDirectors have considered sustainability and resilience \nof the Group’s business model over the long term \n(including strategic factors detailed in our investor \nproposition on page 18, as well as longer-term market \ntrends in areas such as digitalisation and climate \nchange). Furthermore, the viability period aligns to: \n•\t The impairment review process, where \ninvestments in subsidiaries are tested based on \nfive-year forecasts.\n•\t The period over which the capital investment \ndecisions are appraised.\n•\t The period over which the Group’s major strategic \npriorities and plans have historically been \nconsidered (in line with the long-term ambitions \nannounced at the Capital Markets Day in 2019).\nGiven our principal risks, the Directors believe that \nthe ability to assess the Group’s longer-term viability \nbeyond this period becomes increasingly reduced.\nThe Directors have reviewed the Group’s current \nfinancial position, progress against the Group’s \nstrategic targets and plans for the next five years, \nalongside an evaluation of the long-term opportunities \nand risks in the market in which the Group operates. \nThe financial projections were based on the following \nkey assumptions:\n•\t Key macro-economic data that could impact \nrecruitment activity and demand for our services \nand consequently our revenues and net fees.\n•\t Expected headcount retention rates and our ability \nto dynamically change hiring decisions and other \noperational spend in the light of trading conditions.\n•\t Expected productivity of the sales teams (relating \nto placements per sales consultant).\n•\t Changes in the Group’s working capital levels.\n•\t Movements in foreign currency rates, tax rates and \ninterest rates.\n•\t Impact of climate change risk and opportunities.\n•\t Dividend per share.\nThe viability assessment focused mainly on the \nexpected future solvency of the Group in the face \nof the macro-economic environment cyclicality in \nwhich the Group operates, being a key principal risk. \nHowever, also considered were the potential impact \nof other key principal risks, especially those related to \ncustomer risk and cyber security.\nCompliance information\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-115\nP-114\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

In addition, the Directors have \nconsidered the fact that the Group operates in stable markets and has the robust financial position of the Group, \nincluding the ability to sell assets, raise capital and suspend or reduce the payment of dividends.\nViability statement\nFollowing this assessment, the Board can confirm that it has a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue \nin operation and meet its liabilities, as they fall due, over a viability horizon of five years for the period ending 30 \nNovember 2027. In making this statement, it is recognised that not all future events or conditions can be predicted, \nand future assessments are subject to a level of uncertainty that increases with time.\nSubsequently, the key assumptions in the Group’s five-year 2023-2027 plan were stress-tested against severe but \nplausible downside scenarios linked to certain principal risks, as summarised in the table below.\nSThree non-financial and sustainability information statement \nThe Group has complied with the requirements of sections 414CA and 414CB of the Companies Act 2006 by integrating \nthe required non-financial and sustainability information disclosures throughout the Strategic and Governance reports. \nThe following table outlines key areas of disclosure together with references where the key content can be found.\nRelevant policies and standards1\nInformation related to policies, due diligence \nprocess, and the outcome (a-e)\nRequirement – A.

This is managed by ensuring \nthat the Group and the Board are acting in the best \ninterests of our various stakeholders and making \nsure that the Board discharges its responsibilities \nappropriately. This includes creating the right Board \ndynamic and ensuring that all important matters, in \nparticular strategic decisions, receive adequate time \nand attention at Board meetings. \nThere have been a number of changes to the Board \nsince my last Governance Report. Timo Lehne, \nwho was appointed interim CEO in December \n2021 following the departure of Mark Dorman, was \nappointed CEO on a permanent basis in April 2022. \nHis appointment followed an extensive search \nprocess, reviewing both internal and external \ncandidates. Also in April, Anne Fahy stood down \nas a Non-Executive Director and Chair of the Audit \nCommittee, having served as a Director since 2015.  \nI would like to thank Anne for her valued contribution \nto SThree during a period of significant growth \nand expansion. \nDuring the year, we were delighted to announce the \nappointment of two new Non-Executive Directors: Elaine \nO’Donnell, who joined the Board on 1 October 2022, and \nImogen Joss, who joined on 1 December 2022. They are \nboth accomplished, highly experienced individuals who \nbring a wealth of experience to the Board.\nSThree has always been driven by core business \nprinciples, led by a desire to add value as a recruitment \npartner and play a positive role in society. Our purpose \nand culture demonstrate a commitment to driving \nperformance for the Group’s long-term success and to \ntreating all clients, candidates, employees, suppliers \nand communities with respect as key stakeholders and \npartners in our business. Our approach to stakeholder \nengagement during the year is set out in this report.\nI was particularly pleased that we continued to \nencourage employee share ownership with the launch \nof a global share plan during the year. Under this \nplan, all eligible employees were able to receive the \nequivalent of £100 of free shares and join a monthly \nshare purchase scheme. Some 36% of our eligible \nemployees have signed up to the monthly share \npurchase plan, under which the Company will match \nshares purchased each month up to a maximum of \n£50. It is good to see so many employees now have an \nequity stake in our business.\nI have also been pleased that the Board has been able \nto meet in person this year, with all Board meetings \nheld face to face. In September, the Board travelled \nto our Berlin office. This provided an excellent \nopportunity to spend time with our German senior \nmanagement, those based in the Berlin office and for \nthe Board to engage with one of our most important \nstakeholder groups: our candidates. \nAs Chair I have also had the pleasure of visiting our \nAmsterdam, New York, Houston and Dubai offices this \nyear, spending time with both local management in \nthose locations and our broader employee population. \nAdditionally, in mid-October, a global leadership \nconference was held. Both myself and Elaine \nO’Donnell had the pleasure of attending this event \nand spending time connecting with around 75 of our \nmost senior leaders, as we reflected on the Company’s \nstrategy, vision and ambitions.\nThe Board continues to shape and develop our culture \nwith a renewed focus on diversity and inclusion and \nwe have maintained oversight of the Group’s initiatives \nin this important area. Further information on diversity \nand gender pay can be found in the Strategic \nprogress section.\nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all \nof our stakeholders for their support during this year. \nI, along with the Board, am available to respond to any \nquestions on this report or any of our activities both \nnow and at the 2023 Annual General Meeting.\nJames Bilefield\nChair\n  Read my introduction to strategy on page 20\nKey governance and oversight  \nactivities during the year:\n•\t The appointment of Timo Lehne as  \nChief Executive Officer\n•\t The continued refreshing of the Board, announcing \nthe appointment of two new Non-Executive \nDirectors and enhancing our gender diversity\n•\t Continued focus on strategic prioritisation, \ncommencing a multi-year Business  \nTransformation Programme\n•\t Receiving updates from management of key \nmarkets, including DACH, the Netherlands, the US, \nthe UK and Japan\n•\t Approving the update of the Capital Markets Day \nambitions for 2024\n•\t Continued monitoring of our talent acquisition \nstrategy and DE&I metrics and activities\n•\t Direct engagement through investor calls and \nmeetings and feedback following investor meetings. \nEngagement with significant shareholders in the \nlead up to the AGM and following voting\n•\t Reviewing audit tendering considerations \n•\t Reviewing Brand Strategy\n•\t Approving our ‘Market Clustering’ approach  \nto our markets\n•\t Considering regulatory and contractual risk across \nour core business models and markets\n•\t Considering an update on the Group’s property \nportfolio in light of new ways of working post Covid\n•\t The adoption of a new Corporate  \nGovernance Framework\n•\t Progressing the actions from the externally \nfacilitated Board effectiveness review and \nconducting an internal Board effectiveness review\n•\t Reviewing and approving the Group’s Impact \nReport, including the commitment to set a net zero \ntarget using the robust Science Based  \nTarget initiatives\nCompliance with the UK \nCorporate Governance  \nCode 2018\nThe Board applied all the main principles and \nprovisions of the Code throughout the year \nended 30 November 2022.\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-121\nP-120\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

A culture of mutual \nrespect, openness, debate and constructive \nchallenge is vital to this. The Chair \nencourages open communication and \nconstructive working relations between  \nthe Executive and Non-Executive Directors. \nHe also seeks to ensure that the Executive \nDirectors are responsive to constructive \nchallenge on their proposals by the Non-\nExecutive Directors. \nThe Chair ensures that SThree maintains \neffective communications with our \nshareholders, communicating the views \nof shareholders to the Board so that all \nDirectors develop an understanding of the \nviews of the major investors in the Group. In \naddition, he also ensures the Board listens to \nthe views of the workforce, customers and \nother stakeholders, especially in the context \nof principal decisions. \nWith the assistance of the Company \nSecretary, the Chair sets the Board’s \nagenda, ensuring adequate time is available \nto discuss all agenda items. To facilitate \nconstructive Board discussion, the Chair \nensures there is a timely flow of high-quality, \naccurate, clear information.  \nChief Executive \nOur Chief Executive has day-to-day \nmanagement responsibility for running \nthe Group’s operations, for implementing \nthe Group’s strategy as approved by the \nBoard, for applying Group policies and \nfor promoting the Company’s culture and \nstandards, including those on governance. \nHe has the broad authority from the Board \nto run the Company and he is accountable \nfor, and reports to the Board on, how it is \nperforming. Our Chief Executive also has \na key role in the process for the setting \nand review of strategy. In addition, he \nensures that the Executive Directors’ views \non business issues and views from the \nworkforce on relevant issues are shared \nwith the Board in a balanced way.\nThere is a clear division between the Chair’s \nresponsibilities for running the Board and \nthe Chief Executive’s role for the running of \nthe business. This division of responsibilities \nis established in a written statement.\nChief Financial Officer\nThe CFO is responsible for the management \nof the Finance function. He leads the \nGroup’s finance activities, finance risks \nand controls, Group funding arrangements \nand the Investor Relations function. As a \nDirector, the CFO’s responsibilities extend \nbeyond the Finance function to include \nthe whole of the Group’s operations and \nactivities, supporting the CEO in the \ndelivery of the corporate strategy.\nSenior Independent Director \nThe Senior Independent Director’s role is \nto provide a sounding board for the Chair, \nto act, if necessary, as a focal point and \nintermediary for the other Non-Executive \nDirectors and to ensure that any key issues \nthat are not being addressed by the Chair \nor the executive management are taken up. \nThe Senior Independent Director and the \nChair maintain a regular dialogue regarding \ncurrent issues. The Board recognises that, \nshould any significant issues arise which \nthreaten the stability of SThree or its Board, \nthe Senior Independent Director may be \nrequired to work with the Chair or others or \nto intervene to resolve them. \nThe Senior Independent Director is available \nto shareholders should they have concerns \nwhich have not been resolved from \ncontact through the normal channels of the \nChair, Chief Executive or other executive \ndirectors or if the normal channels may \nbe inappropriate. The Senior Independent \nDirector is also available to attend meetings \nwith major shareholders to listen to their \nviews in order to help develop a balanced \nunderstanding of their issues and concerns.\nThe Senior Independent Director is \nresponsible for leading the annual appraisal \nof the Chair’s performance and plays an \nimportant role by ensuring there is an \norderly process for succession to the role of \nChair of SThree. \nNon-Executive Directors \nThe role of our Non-Executive Directors is \nto scrutinise management’s performance in \nmeeting agreed goals and objectives and to \nmonitor how that performance is reported. \nThey must also be satisfied with the integrity \nof the Group’s financial information on the \neffectiveness of financial controls and risk \nmanagement systems. \nAs members of the Board, the Non-Executive \nDirectors bring independent judgement \nand a range of experience to the Board and \ntherefore have a key role in constructively \nchallenging in all areas. This is vital to the \nindependence and objectivity of the Board’s \ndeliberations and decision making and is \nparticularly important in helping develop \nproposals on strategy. The Chief Executive \nand the other Executive Directors welcome, \nand are responsive to, constructive challenge \nby the Non-Executive Directors on their \nproposals. The Non-Executive Directors’ role \nis to support the decisions that have been \ntaken and to support the executive team \nin their delivery. Non-Executive Directors \nalso play an important part in supporting \nthe Chair and the Executive Directors in \nembracing and representing the Company’s \nculture, values and standards within the \nBoard and throughout SThree. \nThe Non-Executive Directors are responsible \nfor determining appropriate levels of \nremuneration for the Executive Directors and \nhave a prime role in appointing and, where \nnecessary, removing Executive Directors, \nand in succession planning. \nCompany Secretary \nThe Company Secretary reports to our Chair \non Board governance matters and together \nthey keep the efficacy of the Company’s \nand the Board’s governance processes \nunder review. The Company Secretary is \nresponsible for advising and keeping the \nBoard up to date on all legislative, regulatory \nand governance matters and developments. \nThe Company Secretary’s responsibilities \nalso include ensuring good information \nflows within the Board and its committees \nand between senior management and \nNon-Executive Directors. The Company \nSecretary facilitates Board inductions and \nassists with professional development as \nrequired. The Company Secretary’s advice, \nservices and support are available to \neach Director.\nOur Board \nBoard and Committee composition  \nand attendance\nThe Board has established various Committees, each \nwith clearly defined Terms of Reference, procedures \nand powers. The Terms of Reference for the Audit & \nRisk, Remuneration and Nomination Committees are \nreviewed regularly and are aligned closely with the UK \nCorporate Governance Code. They are available at \nsthree.com.\nIn addition to the scheduled Board meetings held \nduring the year, the Board met for a dedicated \nstrategy session. The number of scheduled Board \nmeetings held, and attendance at each, is set \nout in the table below. All Directors attended the \nAnnual General Meeting. Attendance at each of the \nCommittee meetings can be found in the Audit & Risk, \nRemuneration and Nomination Committee reports.\nShould Directors be unable to attend meetings due \nto unavoidable commitments, full Board packs are \ndistributed and separate dialogue held with the Chair \non all matters of relevance.

The \nNon-Executive Directors fulfil a vital role in corporate \naccountability and have a particular responsibility \nto ensure that the strategies proposed by the \nExecutive Directors are fully discussed and critically \nexamined, not only in the best long-term interests of \nshareholders, but to also take account of the interests \nof customers, employees and other stakeholders. \nThe Non-Executive Directors are all experienced \nand influential individuals and through their mix \nof skills and business experience, they contribute \nsignificantly to the effective functioning of the Board \nand its Committees. This ensures that matters are fully \ndebated and that no one individual or small group \ndominates the decision-making process.\nDirectors have a wide range of experience of various \nindustry sectors relevant to the Group’s business \nand each member brings independent judgement \nto bear in the interests of the Company on issues \nof strategy, performance, resources and standards \nof conduct. The Board is of sufficient size to match \nbusiness needs and members have an appropriate \nand varied range of skills, vital to the success of the \nGroup. The composition and performance of the Board \nand each Committee is evaluated at least annually \nto ensure the appropriate balance of skills, expected \ntime commitment, knowledge and experience, and \nthe Directors can therefore ensure that the balance \nreflects the changing needs of the Group’s business \nand is refreshed if necessary. Board members feel a \nstrong cultural affinity with the Group, engaging fully \nas a committed team and in a wide variety of activities \nwith our employees around the globe, whether it \nbe an office visit, or presentation by management. \nThe Nomination Committee report gives further \ninformation on activity in this regard, including \nchanges in Board composition, succession planning \nand diversity and inclusion activity.\nExcluding the Chair, the other Non-Executive \nDirectors have been determined by the Board \nthroughout the year as being independent in character \nand judgement with no relationships or circumstances \nwhich are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, \neach Director’s judgement.\nThe Board has a Non-Executive Chair, who is not \nclassed as independent because of his position but \nwho met the independence criteria set out in the Code \non appointment. At least half the Board is comprised \nof Non-Executive Directors determined by the Board \nto be independent, as required by the Code.\nThe role of the Board\nOur Board’s role is to provide leadership of the \nCompany and direction for management.

The Board also ensures that plans  \nare in place for orderly succession for appointments  \nto the Board and to senior management, so as \nto maintain an appropriate balance of skills and \nexperience within the Company and on the Board. \nIn order to carry out its work, the Board, which \nusually meets formally eight times a year, agrees an \nannual agenda plan to ensure all necessary matters \nare covered and to allow sufficient time for debate \nand challenge. In particular, the Board has sought \nto ensure there is sufficient time to discuss strategy \nso that the Non-Executive Directors have a good \nopportunity to challenge and help develop strategy \nproposals. The Board also takes time to review past \ndecisions where necessary. \nAt Board meetings, the Board receives and considers \npapers and presentations from management on \nrelevant topics. Effective review and decision \nmaking are supported by providing the Board with \nhigh-quality, accurate, clear and timely information \nincluding input from experts and independent advisers \nwhere necessary.

These are \nset out in a schedule of matters reserved for the Board, \nwhich is reviewed on a regular basis.\nThe schedule outlines all matters requiring specific \nconsent of the Board, which include the approval of \nGroup strategy, operating plans, annual budget, the \nAnnual Report, the Interim Report, trading updates, \nmajor divestments and capital expenditure, meaningful \nacquisitions and disposals, the recommendation of \ndividends and the approval of treasury, tax and risk \nmanagement policies.\nThe schedule therefore facilitates structured \ndelegation, subject to certain financial limits and \nprovides a practical framework for executive \nmanagement and reporting, which seeks to achieve \nthe objectives of maintaining effective financial and \noperational controls, whilst allowing appropriate \nflexibility to manage the business.

Board and Committee meeting attendees \nare reminded of these duties at the start of each \nmeeting, including considering the long-term impact \nof decisions, whilst aiming to uphold the highest \nstandards of governance.\nThe issues, factors and stakeholders that the Board \nconsiders relevant to complying with Section 172 are \nset out in the Section 172 statement.\nEngagement with shareholders and \nconstructive use of our AGM\nAs a listed plc, engagement with shareholders is given \na high priority as part of a comprehensive Investor \nRelations programme. The Company produces \nAnnual and Interim Reports for shareholders and the \nCompany’s website contains up-to-date information \non the Group’s activities, investor presentations and \npublished financial results.\nShareholders can also subscribe for email alerts of \nimportant announcements made. There are regular \nmeetings with institutional shareholders and analysts \nfollowing key trading updates and throughout the \nyear on an ad hoc basis, whilst ensuring that price-\nsensitive information is released consistently and at \nthe same time to all, in accordance with best practice \nmarket rules.\nThere is also dialogue on specific issues, which this \nyear included audit tendering, the application of the \nremuneration policy and general governance matters. \nIn between trading updates, there is continued \ndialogue with the investor community by meeting key \ninvestor representatives, holding investor roadshows \nand participating in conferences. Investor sentiment \nis regularly relayed to the Board, whilst meetings \nbetween management and debt providers, principally \nthe Company’s banks, also take place periodically.\nThe Chair, Senior Independent Director and other \nNon-Executive Directors are available to discuss \ngovernance, strategy or other issues, or should there \nbe matters of concern that have not been, or cannot \nbe, addressed through the Executive Directors.

      "text": "Governance\nOur Board continued\nUpdate on 2022 AGM voting results\nAll resolutions put to the AGM held on 20 April 2022 \nwere passed with the requisite majority of votes. \nHowever, we acknowledge the votes received against \nthe 2021 Directors’ remuneration report and the \nresolution to re-elect PwC as auditors. The Chair and \nChair of the Remuneration Committee undertook an \nextensive consultation with investors prior to the AGM \nto understand concerns. In respect of the Directors’ \nremuneration report, votes against were caused by \nthe departing CFO receiving a higher contractual \npayment, due to a misalignment between the date \nof the announcement of the Company serving 12 \nmonths’ notice (25 January 2021) and the date of \nnotice in the Settlement Agreement (16 April 2021). \nThe explanation for this ‘Notice of Notice’ scenario \nwas detailed in last years’ annual report. Subsequent \nto the AGM, our Remuneration Committee Chair \nhas again engaged with significant shareholders to \nconfirm steps that have been put in place to prevent \nrecurrence of a similar situation. This includes a new \nstep-by-step process for all future senior executive \nleavers, covering Committee oversight, management \nsupervision, internal Legal and HR interaction and \ntouchpoints with external advisers. In respect of votes \nagainst the resolution to re-elect PwC, this was caused \nby their tenure. Our Executive Directors have engaged \nwith significant shareholders to explain why the \nBoard continues to believe it is appropriate for PwC \nto remain in office for the time being. As described \nmore fully in our Audit & Risk Committee Report, we \nwill begin an audit tender process during the 2023 \nfinancial year with a view to having new auditors in \nplace for our 2024 interim results. The Company will \ncontinue to monitor the objectivity, independence and \nperformance of PwC and, if there are any concerns, \nthe audit tendering process will be accelerated. \nEngagement with employees and \nstakeholder influence in decision \nmaking\nThe Board is committed to engaging with employees \nto better understand the Company’s culture, \nchallenges and issues. Across the year, the Board has \nmet collectively with employee groups from a number \nof our key markets, including Japan, Germany and \nthe US. These meetings are designed to coordinate \nwith Board reviews for the relevant region, to enable a \nholistic understanding of the experience of our people \nin the workplace, in addition to the strategic and \noperational perspective of regional management. \nDenise Collis was appointed in December 2018 \nas the designated NED responsible for employee \nengagement, to gather views from employees and \nensure that these are brought into the boardroom. In \ncarrying out this role, Denise has met with a diverse \nrange of employees, at all levels of seniority, whilst \nalso engaging with Group and local HR teams. See the \nseparate Employee engagement section for details \non Denise’s engagement with employees across the \nSThree Group during the course of 2022.\nTo ensure the continuing success of the Group in \nsetting strategy, making decisions and addressing \nprincipal risks, key stakeholders are considered as part \nof the business model and value chain.\nThe Board’s annual programme, reviewed each year, \nis designed to ensure the voice of each stakeholder \ngroup is heard, either directly, (e.g. by inviting \ncustomers to meet Board Directors) or indirectly, (e.g. \nthrough independent surveys or management reports).\nThe Board oversees and challenges the executive on \nstakeholder engagement and its influence on strategy \nby including appropriate direct or independent \nassessments, (e.g. investor or client/customer survey \nfeedback), it also ensures appropriate stakeholder \nmanagement processes are in place, (e.g. by \nfacilitating escalation procedures and complaints/\ngrievance mechanisms, (such as whistleblowing) \nwhich are also appropriately reviewed or audited, \nas needed.\nEmployee engagement\nFour meetings were held over the year, two by \nvideoconference in March and June, and two \nin person, in Berlin in September and London in \nOctober. Participants, attending remotely through \nvideo conferencing came from America, UK, France, \nNetherlands, Dubai, Belgium and Germany. \nWhilst the meeting in Berlin was with a range of \nemployees across different grades and a range of \nspecialisms, it was decided this year to have three \ngroups that focused on a specific demographic. \nImproving retention is a key business imperative and \nI was keen to meet with those at the early stages of \ntheir career to try and develop a better understanding \nof what had attracted them to SThree, what the \nexperience had been like and what action we could \ntake to encourage our talented people to build a \nlonger-term career with us. One cohort focused on \nthose in their first 12 months and another on those \nbetween 12 and 24 months. The business is going \nthrough a major transformation programme so I also \nmet with a group of individuals from our core functions \nwho are playing a key role in the programme’s \nimplementation. Adopting such a focused approach \nproved very insightful and provided rich output that is \nreflected in the following pages.\nI have continued to be encouraged by the directness \nand positivity of those attending engagement \nfocus groups. My strong impression is that we have \nestablished an atmosphere of trust where participants \ncan frankly share opinions in an open and generally \nconstructive way. Nothing is off-limits and my only ask \nis that people speak with good intent. \nThe level of engagement is further reflected in those \nwho take the initiative to contact me following a \nmeeting to share additional thoughts on the topics \ndiscussed. Indeed, over my time as the Employee \nEngagement NED I have been able to build a \nrelationship with many who have contributed and have \nbeen heartened that they have wanted to continue \na dialogue.\nThere is a strong correlation between the opinions \nraised and the findings of the deep-dive, annual \nemployee survey. In 2022, we have been able to \nmonitor this correlation even more accurately as \nthe Group has conducted quarterly pulse surveys of \nemployee engagement prior to the full annual survey \nin October. \nAll Non-Executive Directors and the Chair have an \nopen invitation to attend the focus group sessions to \ngain insights into how our people think which will add \nto those they already gain from their own touchpoints \nwith the business. \nAs in recent years, we have \nestablished a programme of \nemployee engagement focus \ngroups where people from \nacross SThree’s network, \nat different levels in the \norganisation, have come \ntogether to share their views \nabout the business.\nDenise Collis \nSenior Independent  \nNon-Executive Director\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-131\nP-130\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

The gathering \nof views and insights across the business is essential \nand it’s important that everyone, at any level of the \norganisation, has an opportunity to speak out, grow in \ntheir leadership and make a difference. \nI would like to thank the Board for their continued \nunstinting support. My role can only be effective if \nthe most senior leadership of the business are serious \nabout employee engagement. I believe this Board is, \nand I look forward to reporting on further progress \nnext year.\n“\u0007The chance to share \nexperiences, thoughts and \nto discuss with colleagues \nof all regions really adds \nvalue to me personally and \n- I hope - to all of us across \nthe SThree globe. To create \na platform like the focus \ngroups is very purposeful \nfor our development as an \norganisation in common. I feel \nthat feedback is appreciated \nand sharing different \nperspectives is a key to \nimprove ourselves.”\nChristina, DACH\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-133\nP-132\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

Top 100 \ncalls, where the senior managers come together, are now conducted \non a regular basis. We created and launched a strategic narrative at a \nglobal leadership event in October which was attended by most of our \ntop 100 senior leaders. This was followed with a planned cascade, via \na programme of local engagement events, for all employees, rolled out \ntowards the end of 2022 and into 2023.\nProvide greater clarity around  \nthe employee proposition.\nWe developed a new People Promise. It provides a clear commitment \nabout the experience we want to create for everyone who works at \nSThree. This was launched, and embedding commenced, during 2022. \nWe also enhanced our employer value proposition (EVP), adjusting it to \nreflect different cultural nuances across our regions. This new EVP was \ncreated and launched in line with the brand refresh. A new careers site \nwas launched, reinforcing the enhanced proposition. Looking forward \nto 2023, we will be developing new interventions reflecting the differing \nneeds of those in sales and the core functions.\nContinue to invest in L&D, \nparticularly onboarding, manager \neffectiveness and leadership \ndevelopment.\nOur onboarding learning programme, Elements, which was shortlisted \nfor Best Digital Induction and Best Use of Blended Learning awards at \nthe Learning Technologies Awards, continues to grow with the course \nbeing accessed over 270,000 times since launch. A new Leading with \nPurpose programme was launched in H2 2022, combining a two-day \nprogramme with leadership assessments and coaching. It commenced \nwith ExCo participation and then cascaded down to the Top 100. There \nwill be quarterly follow up sessions in 2023.\nFurther work on career paths, \nprogression and market-\ncompetitive rewards for both \nsales and core functions.\nFollowing the completion of the Global Grading project, all roles across \nthe organisation are now aligned to the new framework. Our focus \nhas turned to action planning to address inconsistencies and drive \nequity of career opportunity as well as the achievement of market \ncompetitive pay for all. Early initiatives included further investment in \nsales consultant base salaries in the USA, Germany, the Netherlands and \nthe UK. We improved reward communications to colleagues in several \nmarkets, including a total reward statement in the USA, and uprated \nemployee benefits communications in the UK. A share incentive plan \nfor everyone at SThree was launched to promote a culture of collective \nownership. Further activity, including a focus on career paths and \nopportunities for core functions, is being developed for 2023.\nProvide greater openness around \nplanned improvements to IT  \nand operational infrastructure.\nThe strategic investment in systems, that began in 2022, is delivering to \nplan. We established a communications stream to keep people briefed. \nA key priority in 2023 will be to ensure that we engage with teams \nas they are directly impacted. We will complement this with broader \ncommunication that will allow people to understand the big picture as \nwell as how and when changes will arrive locally.\nEmployee engagement continued\n2021/2022 Feedback\nAction taken during 2022 or planned for 2023\nContinue to enhance support \nfor mental health fallout post \nCovid-19 and address any signs of \nburnout due to the weight of the \norganisational change agenda.\nInvestment in our Health and Wellbeing support programmes continued. \nMental wellbeing was the focus for 2022 and we rolled out pilot training \nprogrammes for our colleagues and people managers. The outputs \nshaped our ongoing strategy and resulted in significant budget being \napproved for continued investment in training in the coming year. Key \nhighlights include:\n•\t Mind Strength, an online modular programme for all colleagues \n(complemented with virtual drop-in clinics), aimed at building \npersonal resilience.\n•\t At Ease with Mental Wellbeing, an online and workshop-based \nprogramme (with personalised follow-up) for people managers, \ndesigned to help them spot warning signs, start conversations and \ndirect them to resources. \n•\t Volunteers came forward to actively support both programmes \nwith over 40 participating in the colleague programme and over 50 \ncompleting the people manager programme.\nWe ran workshops with active participants to capture feedback. \nRecommendations will be included in the development of the future \nMental Wellbeing strategy for 2023 and beyond.\nContinue to focus on Diversity & \nInclusion, with visible declarations \nof intent.\nThe investment in diversity of 2021 continued into 2022.

The report provides underlying \ndetail on the Committee and its activities during \nthe year, in compliance with the UK Corporate \nGovernance Code (the Code).\nSThree’s purpose is to bring skilled people together \nto build the future. That future-focus and long-\nterm thinking also applies to how our Nomination \nCommittee keeps our Board’s composition under \nreview and ensures we have robust succession plans \nin place, to safeguard the delivery of our strategy and \nensure the long-term success of the Company.\nSince my last report we have seen a number of \nchanges to the composition of the Board. At the \nstart of the year we announced that Mark Dorman \nwould be stepping down from the Board and as CEO \nof the Group on 31 December 2021. Timo Lehne \nwas appointed interim CEO of the Group and the \nCommittee commenced a search for a permanent \nCEO. Having completed an extensive search process, \nreviewing both internal and external candidates, \nthe Committee recommended Timo for the role \nas permanent CEO, with his appointment being \nconfirmed on 28 April 2022. \nThe Board understands and fully supports the \nrecommendations of the Parker Review. However, \nfollowing the very recent appointments, we plan to \nallow a period of bedding in and Board stability for \nour two new Non-Executive Directors and for the \nBoard overall. We believe that this is also sensible \nforward planning in terms of board succession and \nrotation. Therefore we intend to look for an additional \nNon-Executive Director, preferably from a non-\nwhite minority ethic background, at some point in \n2024 in order to meet the Parker Review target by \nDecember 2024.\nSummary of Terms of Reference\nThe Committee’s Terms of Reference are, broadly, to \nregularly review the structure, size and composition \n(including the skills, knowledge, experience and \ndiversity) of the Board, make recommendations with \nregard to any changes and to review and prepare \nrelevant job descriptions for new appointees, as \nwell as ensuring the continuing development of, and \nadequate pipeline into, the Executive Committee for \nsuccession and bench strength purposes.\nSummary of core Committee activities \ncarried out during the year:\n•\t Oversaw the Board and senior management \nsuccession plans.\n•\t Oversaw the composition and effectiveness  \nof the Board and Committees, with diversity  \na key criteria.\n•\t Oversaw the search for a new Chief  \nExecutive Officer. \n•\t Oversaw the search for, and recommended the \nappointment of, two new independent Non-\nExecutive Directors, including the Chair of the \nAudit & Risk Committee.\nSuccession planning and diversity\nAs discussed above, Mark Dorman stepped down as \nCEO in December 2021. The Committee oversaw an \ninternal and external search for a new CEO, leading to \nthe appointment of Timo Lehne, first as interim CEO \nand subsequently as permanent CEO. Following the \nresignation of Anne Fahy as a Non-Executive Director \nin April this year the Committee accelerated its search \nfor new Directors, leading to the appointment of Elaine \nO’Donnell and Imogen Joss.\nDenise Collis continues to act as the designated \nNED responsible for employee engagement and to \nunderstand and represent the views of employees at \nBoard level. Denise has attended a number of focus \ngroups with a wide range of employees during the year, \ntogether with other Board members. These focus groups \nhave discussed subjects such as executive remuneration, \ndiversity and inclusion, and health and wellbeing.\nThe Committee also periodically reviews Board \ncomposition to ensure that the Code provisions \nregarding diversity, over-boarding, Chair tenure and \nRemuneration Committee Chair experience are all \ncomplied with. In November 2022 the Committee \nconsidered Board membership and the need to \ncontinually refresh the composition of the Board on a \ngradual basis, taking into account the length of service \nof current Board members.\nLast year we reported that the Committee had agreed \nplans to achieve a Board, by 2024, with a minimum of \n40% female representation and at least one individual \nfrom a non-white minority ethnic background. I am \ndelighted to report that we now have in excess of 40% \nfemale representation on the Board, in accordance \nwith the FCA’s Board diversity targets. Denise Collis \nwho is our Senior Independent Director, is considered \nto hold a senior Board position. \nIt remains the Committee’s intention to add one \nadditional Non-Executive Director, preferably from \na non-white minority ethnic background, before \nDecember 2024. The Committee acknowledges the \nimportance of diversity in its broadest sense in the \nboardroom. In filling this position, consideration will be \ngiven to the combination of demographics, experience, \nskills, race, age, gender, education and professional \nbackground and other personal objectives needed \nto support good decision making. The Committee \nis mindful of the need to devote time to thoroughly \nembedding each new Non-Executive Director and to \ncreating a cohesive Board. The timing of onboarding \nof a new Non-Executive Director will therefore be \ncarefully assessed. \nSelection and appointment of a \nnew Chief Executive Officer\nFollowing the announcement of the departure \nof Mark Dorman as Chief Executive Officer, \nTimo Lehne was, on the recommendation of \nthe Nomination Committee, appointed as \nan Executive Director and interim CEO. An \nextensive and thorough search process then \ncommenced. Russell Reynolds Associates, a \nleading executive search firm, was engaged \nto facilitate the process, which involved a \ndiverse longlist of potential candidates, drawn \nfrom a range of backgrounds and including \nboth internal and external candidates. Russell \nReynolds Associates has no other connection \nwith the Company or its individual Directors \naside from the provision of recruitment services. \nFollowing interviews with and full evaluation \nof selected candidates, the Nomination \nCommittee endorsed the appointment of \nTimo Lehne as the permanent Chief Executive \nOfficer. Having previously been SThree’s \nmost experienced Managing Director from \nour largest region, Timo had demonstrated \nstrategic thinking, drive, commerciality and \npeople-leadership skills both in that role and \nas Interim CEO and was well placed to lead \nthe Group. Timo then received a tailored \ninduction programme, which given his in-\ndepth knowledge of the Group and the market, \nconcentrated on the legal framework governing \nthe duties of a director of a listed company, and \ncontinuing obligations. \n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-137\nP-136\t\nSThree plc\n\t\nsthree.com"

No significant failings or weaknesses were \nidentified by the Committee from this review.\nSignificant progress was made towards reaching a \nfully integrated system of SThree internal controls, \nrisk management and policies. Areas were identified \nthat could be strengthened to drive a future-proof, \nappropriately resourced and fully compliant system \nof internal control and corporate governance policies. \nManagement established a process for regular self- \nassessment style attestation by risk relating to internal \ncontrols over financial reporting and their owners.\nThe Committee works closely with the Chief Financial \nOfficer, Chief Legal Officer & Company Secretary, \nHead of Risk, IA team and external auditors to ensure \nthat any potential material misstatement risks are \nidentified and targeted in terms of the overall audit \nstrategy and that audit resources and the efforts of the \nengagement team are correctly allocated. This helps \nto ensure the effective planning and performance of \nthe external and IA teams, focused on risk, and has \nresulted in a continued improvement in processes and \ncontrols over recent years.\nExternal auditors\nResponsibilities in relation to  \nexternal auditors\nDuring the year, the Committee carried out each  \nof the following:\n•\t Recommended the re-appointment of PwC as \nexternal auditors, for subsequent ratification of \ntheir remuneration and terms of engagement  \nby shareholders.\n•\t Reviewed and monitored the external auditors’ \nindependence and objectivity and the \neffectiveness of the audit process, taking into \nconsideration relevant UK professional and \nregulatory requirements.\n•\t Reviewed the policy on the engagement of the \nexternal auditors and supply of non-audit services. \nThis policy sets out a ‘whitelist’ of permitted \nnon-audit services, lists examples of prohibited \nservices, sets out typical audit-related services, \ntheir award and approval, explains the cap on non-\naudit services which can be billed, and sets out \nreporting and independence provisions.\nAppointment, objectivity and \nindependence \nFollowing the conclusion of the last formal audit \ntender in early 2017, both the Committee and the \nexternal auditors have safeguards in place to ensure \nthat objectivity and independence are maintained.\nThe Committee also considers independence taking \ninto consideration relevant UK professional and \nregulatory requirements. Non-audit services relate \nto the half-year agreed upon procedures and PwC \nViewpoint (regulatory updates) subscription, whilst \nnet fees generated to the Group through recruitment \nservices provided to PwC as a client are not material.\nThe external auditors are required to rotate audit \npartners responsible for the Group audit every five \nyears and the current lead audit partner, Kenneth \nWilson, was appointed in 2019, following appropriate \ntransition. This also reflected the focus of the audit \nteam’s activities moving to Glasgow.\nPerformance and tendering\nDuring the year, the Committee reviewed performance \nand fees and met with the external auditors, PwC, \nregularly, without management present. Prior to their \nmost recent re-appointment, following a robust tender \nprocess, PwC originally replaced BDO as auditors \nin 1999 and became auditors of the public company \nin 2005.\nIn light of feedback from a small number of large \nshareholders regarding the tenure of PwC as external \nauditors, at its meeting in November 2021, the \nCommittee carefully considered whether it would \nbe appropriate to conduct a tender process for the \nappointment of new external auditors.\nUnder current rules SThree is subject to EU PIE Audit \nregulations, but not the UK CMA Order, and are not \nrequired to change auditors until after the audit of \nthe 2026 financial year report and accounts, with \nnew auditors needing to be in place for the 2027 \nfinancial year.\nIn response to the significant votes against the \nre-election of PwC as auditors at the 2022 Annual \nGeneral Meeting, where 78% of the votes cast were \nin favour of the re-election of PwC, at its meeting in \nJuly the Board gave careful thought as to the timing of \nan audit tender. Following careful consideration and \ndiscussions with certain significant shareholders, the \nBoard concluded that it was, for the time being and \nsubject to satisfactory performance, appropriate for \nPwC to remain in office, a decision supported by the \nAudit & Risk Committee.\nThe rationale for this included the period of \nsignificant change during the finance and non-finance \ntransformation across the Group, the current market \nfor retendering, the existing non-audit work carried \nout by other audit firms and resources needed to carry \nout a successful tender.\nWe will begin an audit tender process during the 2023 \nfinancial year with a view to having new auditors in \nplace for our 2024 interim results. The Company will \ncontinue to monitor the objectivity, independence and \nperformance of PwC and if there are any concerns the \naudit tendering process will be accelerated. \nIn reaching that decision the Board noted that PwC \nwere still considered to be fully independent, with \nthe audit moving from PwC’s London team to a \ncompletely new auditing team based in Glasgow \nfollowing the opening of SThree’s Centre of Excellence \nin Glasgow in 2018, and a new audit partner in the \n2019 financial year.\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-143\nP-142\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

      "text": "Governance\nAudit & Risk Committee continued\nFramework used by the Committee to \nassess effectiveness of the external \naudit process\nThe Committee has adopted a broad framework to \nreview the effectiveness of the Group’s external audit \nprocess and audit quality which includes: assessment \nof the audit partner and team with particular focus \non the lead audit engagement partner; planning \nand scope of the audit, including a dedicated audit \nplanning afternoon, with identification of particular \nareas of audit risk; the planned approach and \nexecution of the audit; management of an effective \naudit process; communications by the auditors with \nthe Committee; how the auditors support the work of \nthe Committee; how the audit contributes insights and \nadds value; a review of independence and objectivity \nof the audit firm; and the quality of the formal audit \nreport to shareholders.\nFeedback is provided to both the external auditors \nand management by the Committee and its attendees, \nbased on the above, with any actions reviewed by \nthe Committee.\nThe effectiveness of management in the external audit \nprocess is assessed principally in relation to the timely \nidentification and resolution of areas of accounting \njudgement, the quality and timeliness of papers, \nanalysing those judgements, management’s approach \nto the support of independent audit and the booking \nof any audit adjustments arising, as well as the timely \nprovision of documents for review by the auditors and \nthe Committee.\nPolicy on non-audit work\nThe Committee sets clear guidelines on non-audit \nwork, which is only permitted where it does not impair \nindependence or objectivity and where the Committee \nbelieves that it is in the Group’s best interests to \nmake use of built-up knowledge or experience. \nSuch work has included services required due to \nlegislation and assurance work or other specialist \nservices. The Committee continuously monitors the \nquality and volume of this work, fees incurred, as well \nas independent safeguards established, in order to \nconsider whether to use other firms and continues \nto use such firms to provide general tax advice or for \nother projects.\nThe policy aligns with regulations to prohibit a number \nof non-audit services, whilst also meeting APB Ethical \nStandards and FRC guidance, to clearly set out:\n•\t which types of non-audit work are allowed/\nprohibited;\n•\t the types of work for which external auditors \ncan be engaged without Audit & Risk Committee \nreferral, provided such services fall below £25,000 \nand are not specifically prohibited; and\n•\t for which types of work Committee Chair referral \nis needed, i.e. which are above £25,000.\nFees paid to external auditors for  \nnon-audit work\nAudit fees for the year were £925,000 (2021: \n£782,000). The YoY increase in audit fees reflects the \n10% inflation rate applied to the cost of audit services \nand two additional subsidiaries falling under the audit \nscope due to growth in trading.\nThe Committee reviews all non-audit work against \npolicy to ensure it is appropriate and the fees are \njustified. Non-audit fees reduced compared to the \nprior year, being £13,000 in 2022 (2021: £15,700). Last \nyear non-audit fees included a non-recurring fee for \nthe review of Switzerland’s gender equal-pay analysis.\nAreas of key significance in the \npreparation of the financial statements\nThe Committee considered each of the following \nitems of key significance in the preparation of the \nConsolidated Financial Statements in 2022 and \nbased on discussions with management found the \naccounting treatment and presentation thereof \ncomplete and accurate. These items were also \ndiscussed with the external auditors during the \nplanning stage and on completion of the audit.  \nThe key considerations were:\n•\t Revenue recognition including the constraint of \nvariable consideration - significant estimation is \nrequired in determining a portion of the Group \nrevenue recognised in exchange for provided \nservice for which no timesheets have been \nreceived on or before the reporting date. The key \nestimation uncertainty arises from determining the \nhistorical shrinkage rate which is used to constrain \nthe variable part of revenue.  \nThe Committee evaluated the key assumptions \napplied in the calculation methodology and the use \nof the shrinkage rate by comparing them with prior \nyears and considering business developments, \nin particular continued growth of our contract \nbusiness, in 2022; and satisfied itself that the \nassumptions and the changes to those assumptions \nwere appropriate.\n•\t The impairment trigger assessment of SThree \nplc’s investments – the Group has operations in \na number of countries across the globe. These \noperations are subsidiaries of the parent company, \nSThree plc. As set out in the accounting policies, \nevery year management performs an assessment \nwhether there are any indicators of impairment of \nSThree plc’s investments in its subsidiaries. The \nCommittee considered key areas of judgement \napplied by management in this assessment and \ncompared them with the Group’s budget, medium-\nterm forecasts, and the current macro-economic \nenvironment in which subsidiaries operate. \nThe Committee agreed with the management’s \nconclusion that there were no material impairment \ntriggers and no detailed impairment review was \ntherefore required in 2022. \n•\t Adopting the going concern basis of preparation \nof the financial statements - the Committee \nreviewed and challenged the assumptions \nunderlying the forecast models underpinning the \ngoing concern and viability statements including \nthe appropriateness and relevance of the severe \nbut plausible stress tests to ensure adequate \nliquidity and covenant compliance throughout the \nrelevant periods. The Committee also reviewed \nthe management’s work in conducting a robust \nassessment of the risks facing the Group, their \npotential impact, how they were being managed, \ntogether with a discussion as to the appropriate \nperiod for the assessment. The Committee deemed \nappropriate that the Group continues to apply \nthe going concern basis for the preparation of the \nfinancial statements and recommended to the \nBoard to approve the viability statement.\nThe above key accounting judgements and estimates \nare also set out in the note Basis of preparation and \nconsolidation on pages 198 to 201.\nOn a quarterly basis the Committee also considered \nand addressed key judgements applied by \nmanagement in accounting for certain other \ntransactions which occurred during the year. In the \nyear under review this included:\n•\t Onerous leases contracts - following the review of \noffice utilisation in our main locations management \ndetermined to early terminate lease contracts \nassociated with five offices in Europe. The \nCommittee reviewed the appropriateness of this \ndecision and evaluated if the accounting treatment \nwas in line with IFRS 16 Leases standard. \n•\t Restructuring of SThree’s subsidiaries - significant \nactivities undertaken by the Group to restructure \nbusinesses in Ireland, Singapore and to close the \nHong Kong business resulted in a recognition of \na £2.4 million restructuring provision, covering \nmainly personnel termination costs. The \nCommittee evaluated, and satisfied itself, that \nmanagement correctly applied the recognition \ncriteria for the provision under the accounting \nstandard IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities \nand Contingent Assets.\n•\t Discontinued operations - the Committee also \nconsidered whether the closure of the Hong \nKong business required additional disclosures \nas discontinued operations in the financial \nstatements. The Committee agreed with the \nmanagement’s interpretation of the accounting \nstandard IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale \nand Discontinued Operations and conclusion \nthat as the Hong Kong business was not a major \nline of the Group’s operations, the definition of \ndiscontinued operations was not met, and separate \npresentation of discontinued operations was \ntherefore not necessary.\n•\t Capitalisation of internally generated assets - \nfollowing the commencement of the Group-wide \ntransformation programme management assessed \nall categories of costs to be incurred to develop \nintangible assets as part of the programme and \nwhether they should be capitalised or expensed. \nThe Committee discussed with management \nkey judgements applied to cost treatment and \nsatisfied itself that the key requirements of the \naccounting standard IAS 38 Intangible Assets, and \nfurther IFRS guidance issued on accounting for \ncloud computing arrangements, were applied and \ninterpreted correctly.\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-145\nP-144\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

      "text": "Governance\n•\t Exceptional items - the Committee evaluated \nwhether management correctly applied the \naccounting policy for presentation of exceptional \nitems. In particular, it reviewed whether costs \nassociated with business restructuring and the \ntransformation programme should be presented as \nexceptional items due to their non-recurring nature \nand material quantum. After further consultation \nwith the external auditors and having considered \nmarket constituents’ practice to limit the use of \nexceptional items, the Committee agreed with the \nmanagement’s conclusion that none of the current \ntransactions should be presented as exceptional.\nInternal Audit (IA)\nIA plays an integral role in the Group’s governance and \nrisk management processes and provides independent \nassurance to the Committee on compliance with \nits policies and procedures. The function carries \nout a wide variety of audits including operational \nas well as ad hoc and project-based reviews and \nfraud investigation.\nThe Committee oversees and monitors the work of IA, \nwhich carries out risk-based reviews of key controls \nand processes throughout the Group on a rolling \ncycle, including resources, scope and alignment with \nprincipal risks and effectiveness of the function.\nThe Head of IA has direct access to the Committee \nand meets regularly with both the Committee and its \nChair without management present to consider the IA \nwork programme, which is approved in advance by \nthe Committee.\nFor 2022, whilst the programme was again focused on \naddressing both financial and overall risk management \nobjectives across the Group, with reviews carried out, \nfindings reported to the Committee, recommendations \ntracked and their closure monitored.\nNo significant weaknesses were identified from \nthe risk management or internal control reviews \nundertaken by IA during the reporting period and \nthroughout the financial year. The IA team, working \nwith the Group’s risk and compliance function, \nhas continued to enhance the risk management \nframework and work with managers across the globe \nto further develop and embed the risk framework and \nmethodology at a local level, whilst also ensuring that \nthe IA plan is closely aligned to risk. \nSenior management are invited to present to the \nCommittee, from time to time, to report back on \nprogress against agreed IA actions and other risks in \ntheir area of responsibility.\nThe Committee ensures that the Group’s IA function \nremains at an appropriate size and skill mix for the \nbusiness, and firmly believes that this function remains \neffective and continues to add significant value. The \nIA activity conforms with the International Standards \nfor the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing as \nsupported by the results of both an external evaluation \nof the IA function which was conducted during 2019 \nthat concluded the IA function was highly effective, \nand yearly internal assessments of the quality \nassurance and improvement programme.

The output of \nthese discussions is reported back to the Group Risk \nCommittee. The Group Risk Committee meetings \nconsider a range of risks identified, their materiality \nand the progress of mitigating actions/projects in \nterms of their successful implementation and their \nlikely effectiveness in reducing risk in line with Group \nappetite, on a regular basis, and reports in to both the \nExecutive Committee and the Audit & Risk Committee \non these. Notable activities this year include oversight \nof the development of risk tolerance statements for \neach of the principal risks, and the building out of \nkey risk indicators (KRIs) against which the Company \nwill monitor the principal risks, to ensure appropriate \naction can be taken where these KRIs highlight a \nchange in risk profile. \nFraud and cyber risks\nThe Committee reviews the procedures for the \nprevention and detection of fraud in the Group and \nhas also closely monitored improvements to cyber \nsecurity protection in the light of increasing risks in \nthis area, having particular regard to data breaches \nthat the Group may face and the processes and \ncontrols in place to tackle any security threats. A \ncyber-breach crisis management exercise was carried \nout with a specialist third party in September 2022, \nattended by the Executive Committee and Head of \nRisk, with the results and recommendations reviewed \nby the Committee. \nSuspected cases of fraud must be reported to \nsenior management and are investigated by IA, \nwith the outcome of any investigation reported to \nthe Committee.\nAnti-bribery and corruption, and \nbusiness ethics\nThe Group maintains a zero-tolerance approach \nagainst corruption.

      "text": "Governance\nDirectors’ remuneration  \nreport\nThe Committee has sought to make \nappropriate remuneration decisions \nin a year that delivered excellent \nbusiness performance, building upon \nour growth in 2021. Looking forward, \nthe Committee has set appropriate \nincentive plans to focus management \non continued strong performance, \nfurther enhancing shareholder value.\nCommittee meetings held\n4\nDenise Collis (Chair)\n4/4\nJames Bilefield\n4/4\nBarrie Brien\n4/4\nElaine O’Donnell*\n1/1\nAnne Fahy*\n1/1\n \n*Attended all meetings whilst a Director. \nImogen Joss joined the Committee subsequent to year end.\nDear Shareholder\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present this \nDirectors’ remuneration report for the period ended \n30 November 2022. At the 2022 AGM shareholders \napproved the continued operation of the current \nremuneration policy, which has now reached the \nend of its three-year term. The support received \nreinforces our view that our reward policy has \nreflected our business strategy, with remuneration \npayments that are strongly linked to performance.\nThe Annual report on remuneration describes how this \npolicy was implemented in 2022 and how we intend \nto operate in 2023. Given the support for our current \npolicy, and following on from consultation with our \nmajor shareholders, we are proposing only minor \nupdates to the new policy, which are set out in more \ndetail below. The updated policy will be subject to a \nbinding shareholder vote at the 2023 AGM.\nOverall, fixed elements of the remuneration packages \nare set so that they reflect the calibre and experience \nof our people and the complexity of their roles. The \nannual bonus measures are based on specific areas \nthat require immediate focus, whereas our Long-\nTerm Incentive Plan (LTIP), looks to drive sustainable \nimprovements at a more macro level over the longer \nterm. Culturally, the setting of both financial and \nbroader non-financial measures serves to focus \nscheme participants on a holistic view of business \nsuccess and hence serves to drive performance on a \nbroad, sustainable basis.\nAn important highlight of 2022 was the wellbeing \nsupport we were able to offer colleagues around \nthe globe. We continued our practice from 2021 of \noffering everyone a ‘wellbeing day’, and in addition \nmade a one-off financial payment to those colleagues \nwho we believed would be most impacted by the \ncost-of-living increases being experienced around \nthe world. More broadly, we have been focused on \nensuring that our reward systems are aligned with \nattracting and retaining talent, and have made a \nnumber of adjustments where appropriate.\nAppointment of new Chief Executive \nOfficer (CEO)\nFollowing a comprehensive search process, we were \npleased to appoint Timo Lehne as our permanent CEO \non 28 April 2022. As noted in last year’s Directors’ \nremuneration report, Timo was appointed Interim \nCEO in January 2022 having previously been the \nSenior Managing Director of our largest region, DACH \n(Germany, Austria and Switzerland). Timo brings a \nwealth of relevant experience in STEM recruitment, \na deep understanding of our business, and focused, \ndynamic leadership, all vital qualities as the Group \ncontinues to execute its growth strategy.\nTimo was appointed on a base salary of £483,900, \nwhich was the same level as the previous CEO, and \nhis variable reward was aligned with the remuneration \npolicy. Full remuneration details are set out in detail in \nthis report. \nRemuneration payable for performance \nin 2022\nThe Group delivered a strong performance, both \noverall and in comparison with sector peers, \nparticularly in its key markets.\nThis strong performance is reflected in the outcome \nof the annual bonus plan, against a backdrop of \nstretch targets having been set. Half of the bonus is \ndetermined by adjusted operating profit achievement \nand the outcome was above the maximum of the \ntarget range resulting in a 100% pay-out of this part \nof the award. Similarly, the performance against \nthe targets for net fees, and revenue exceeded \nthe maximum target, resulting in full pay-out of \nthese elements.\nOur performance in the areas of customer and \nemployee net promoter scores was between threshold \nand maximum resulting in a partial pay-out. We did not \nreach the threshold of our free cash flow conversion \nratio target or DE&I gender representation target \nresulting in no pay-out for these elements of the plan. \nOverall this results in 75.5% of the maximum bonus \nbeing payable, not including the personal objectives \nassessment, which represents up to a further 7.5% for \neach Executive Director.\nThe 2020 LTIP award, based on our performance \nover the three financial years to the end of 2022, was \nsubject to a mix of Earnings Per Share (EPS), Total \nShareholder Return (TSR) and a strategic performance \nmeasure. Despite these targets being set prior to \nthe impacts of Covid-19, achievement against the \nstretching EPS target was positive, although our \nperformance against the strategic target remained \nnegatively impacted by the pandemic. TSR, measured \nagainst our sector peers, was strong over the period.\nFor the 50% of the award based on the EPS \nperformance condition, this required adjusted EPS \nfor 2022 to be between 38.6 pence and 46.9 pence. \nActual adjusted EPS performance for 2022 was 41.0 \npence, resulting in 46.7% vesting of the EPS part of  \nthe award.\nFor the 30% of the award based on our TSR \nperformance, our TSR was required to be between \nmedian and upper quartile performance against a peer \ngroup. Actual TSR was at the 72nd percentile resulting \nin 91.6% pay-out of this part of the award.\nThe final 20% of the award was subject to the long-\nterm strategic measure of operating profit conversion \nratio. We did not reach the threshold for the operating \nprofit conversion ratio target, and therefore, there was \nno vesting of this element of the award.\nThe overall performance vesting of the 2020-22 LTIP \nwas therefore 50.8% of maximum. The Committee \nhas reviewed the share price at which this LTIP grant \nwas made in 2020 (375 pence per share), and the \ncurrent price, and are satisfied that participants \nhave not benefitted from any Covid-19-related share \nprice windfall.\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-149\nP-148\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

      "text": "Governance\nThe Committee has considered whether the \nformula-driven pay-outs under the incentive plans \nand resultant total remuneration for Directors is \nappropriate, looking at the broader context within \nwhich the performance has been delivered. The \nCommittee is comfortable that there has been a robust \nlink between remuneration and performance, and the \npolicy has operated as intended. We have not adjusted \nthe performance measures for any of the plans and \nthere has not been a need to use discretion to adjust \nthe level of remuneration payable. The outcomes \nalso reflect broader reward outcomes across other \nincentive plans within the Group. \nFull details of the LTIP measures, performance against \nthem and resultant payments are set out in the Annual \nreport on remuneration.\nPolicy for 2023 to 2025\nOur current policy has lasted the full three years \nand supported the business strategy well, providing \na strong link between pay and performance. It \nhas proved appropriately robust and flexible and \nhas accommodated our restrained approach to \nremuneration through the Covid-19 pandemic, as well \nas the changes to our leadership during this period.\nWe believe that current remuneration levels, incentive \nopportunities and structure are appropriately \npositioned to support our growth ambitions and no \nmaterial changes are required. We have, however, \nbrought the policy up to date, for instance in relation \nto the wording on pension provision and made it \nexplicit that any notice period must start on the date \nof an announcement of an executive’s departure, \nrecognising our recent experience in this area.\nIn summary, the changes we are proposing to the \npolicy, are as follows:\nPension: the policy now makes it clear that the pension \ncontribution for all Executive Directors must be \naligned to the rate (as a percentage of salary) applying \nto the majority of the UK workforce (currently 5% \nof salary). Both of our recently appointed Executive \nDirectors receive this pension rate.\nLeaver provisions: within the terms of the existing \npolicy, we have tightened the wording around leaver \nprovisions to make it explicit that ‘notice’ starts on the \ndate of an announcement of a departing executive.\nPolicy implementation for 2023\nThe Committee increased the salary of both the CEO \nand CFO by 3.5%, which is below the budgeted 5% \nincrease for UK employees more broadly. \nWe have adjusted the overall mix of financial and \nnon-financial measures for the annual bonus scheme \nfrom 80%-20% to 70%-30%. This reflects the focus on \nimportant customer and employee measures, which \nrepresent 15% in total, with a further 15% allocated to \nthe achievement of stretch personal objectives. Within \nthe financial measures we have removed revenue \nbecause net fees is the most important income metric \nfor our business. We have also replaced our Group \ncashflow measure as it is counter to our working \ncapital cycle of growing contractors, with Days Sales \nOutstanding, which is a more appropriate measure \nand is more familiar to employees and can therefore \nbe rolled out and communicated more effectively.\nThe LTIP will continue to be based on performance \nover three years and subject to a two-year holding \nperiod post-vesting. For 2023, we intend that the grant \nlevel will be unchanged at 150% of base salary, in line \nwith the Remuneration Policy.\nThe weighting of LTIP performance measures \nwill remain unchanged at 50% EPS, 20% TSR, \n20% strategic and 10% ESG. The ESG target will \nbe simplified for this cycle, focusing solely on a \nquantitative SBTi reduction in carbon outputs.\nThe Committee has set stretching targets, recognising \nthe need to build forward momentum towards our \nlong-term ambitions.\nThe Committee retains discretion to ensure that \nannual bonus payments and vested awards under the \nLTIP can be adjusted if the formula-driven outturn \ndoes not reflect the broader overall performance of \nthe business.\nFull details of the annual bonus measures and the \nmeasures and targets for the 2023-2025 LTIP awards \nare set out in the Annual report on remuneration.\nChair and NED fees\nFees for the Chair and NEDs were last increased \non 1 December 2021, taking account of market \nbenchmarks, and the increased responsibilities and \nresultant time commitment required to fulfil the roles. \nThe fees and approach were further reviewed this \nyear and an increase in line with that awarded to the \nExecutive Directors of 3.5% has been made.\nDirectors’ remuneration report continued\nShareholder and employee engagement, \nand specific focus on Executive \nremuneration in broader context\nDuring 2022 we engaged our major shareholders and \nother key stakeholders in relation to the high vote against \nthe remuneration report at the 2022 AGM, and the new \npolicy that we will be bringing to our 2023 AGM. \nIn relation to the high vote against the remuneration \nreport resolution, the Chair and Chair of the \nRemuneration Committee undertook an extensive \nconsultation with investors prior to the AGM to \nunderstand concerns. This was caused by the \ndeparting CFO receiving a higher contractual \npayment, due to the date of the announcement of \nthe Company serving 12 months’ notice (25 January \n2021) not being aligned to the date of notice in the \nSettlement Agreement (16 April 2021). \nThe explanation for this ‘Notice of Notice’ scenario \nwas detailed in my annual statement last year. \nSubsequent to the AGM I further engaged with \nsignificant shareholders to confirm steps that have \nbeen put in place to stop the risk of a ‘Notice of \nNotice’ situation arising again. This includes a new \nstep-by-step process for all future senior executive \nleavers, including the Executive Directors, covering \nCommittee oversight, management supervision, \ninternal Legal and HR interaction and touchpoints \nwith external advisers. We have also made the \nremuneration policy explicit that a notice period starts \non the date of announcement of an executive director \nstepping down.\nIn relation to the engagement on the new \nremuneration policy, and recognising the very modest \nchanges we were proposing, the feedback was \nsupportive and there were no specific points for the \nCommittee to consider nor changes required to the \nproposals. We appreciate the level of engagement and \nsupport offered.\nWe have built upon the rolling programme of \nengagement with employees around reward, utilising \na combination of in-person and virtual meetings. I \nhave personally engaged with many employees across \na number of our offices around the world, as part of \nmy role as designated NED responsible for employee \nengagement, during which reward has emerged as \nan area of discussion. In addition, I recently held a \nvery interactive and productive session with a diverse \ngroup, drawn from across the business, to answer \nquestions about our corporate governance and \nremuneration processes and how our reward policy \ncascades throughout the Company, accompanied by \nthe Director of Reward. \nAt the July Committee meeting we continued to \nfocus on the ‘fair pay’ agenda discussing progress \non specific initiatives from last year, which included \nmeaningful investment in entry-level base salaries \nin our sales function and progressing with the \nimplementation of an all-employee share plan. I was \npleased to see the employee share plan launch in \nNovember 2022 giving all colleagues around the \nglobe the opportunity to participate and benefit from \nmatching shares. \nWe intend to maintain the momentum in this area and \nwill continue to discuss the ‘fair pay’ agenda in 2023.\nConclusion\nThe Committee appreciates the support received from \nshareholders to date on its executive remuneration \nand governance approach and looks forward to this \ncontinued support at the AGM in April 2023.\nDenise Collis\nChair of the Remuneration Committee \n27 January 2023\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-151\nP-150\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

The Committee \nalso takes into account views from management and advisers who provide the Committee with updates on \ncorporate governance developments, market practice and technical assistance. In addition, the Committee also \ncarefully considers the remuneration arrangements, policies and practices of the workforce and the cascade of \nremuneration throughout the business to ensure that Executive Director pay is considered in the round. \nWhere changes are being made to the remuneration policy or significant changes are proposed in the way we \noperate our policy, major shareholders will be consulted, and their views taken into account. \nTo manage any potential conflicts of interest, no individual is involved in discussions regarding their own \nremuneration arrangements and the Committee designs the Policy such that remuneration is fully aligned to, and \nsupports, the strategy. \nImplementation of the Policy is considered annually for the year ahead in light of the strategy and market outlook \nand incentive targets are appropriately stretching.\nFactors considered in reviewing and operating the policy\nThe table below describes how the factors of Provision 40 listed in the UK Corporate Governance Code are \naddressed in the Remuneration Policy and its application.\nClarity\nThe policy and its implementation is straightforward, in line with market norms and clearly disclosed in the \nDirectors’ remuneration report. The Remuneration Committee Chair consults with shareholders to explain \nany changes that are being made to the remuneration policy or where there is a significant change in \noperation of policy. \nSimplicity\nThe policy is simple and clear and in line with market practice. The performance conditions chosen are aligned \nto the business strategy and the operation of our policy shows a strong and clear link to performance.\nRisk\nThe design of our remuneration policy ensures that excessive risk taking will not be rewarded by the balance \nof incentive plans in favour of long-term performance and equity, significant shareholding requirements, \ndiscretion to override formula-driven incentive payments, and malus and clawback provisions. \nTo avoid conflict of interest no individual is present when their remuneration is being reviewed.\nPredictability\nThe incentive plans are subject to maximum caps, and the scenario charts illustrate the potential rewards \nreceivable, taking into consideration performance and share price growth, for the Executive Directors. \nProportionality\nOverall, there is an appropriate balance between fixed and performance-based pay (weighted in favour \nof the latter) and short and long-term incentives (also weighted in favour of the latter). Performance \ntargets are stretching, delivering incrementally higher performance pay at higher performance levels. This \ndelivers a market competitive remuneration package which is strongly linked to both short and long-term \nperformance.\nAlignment to  \nculture\nThe Remuneration Committee designs and operates the policy to support and drive behaviours in line with \nthe Company culture. The Committee actively considers the pay reward structures across the Group in this \nprocess to ensure that a consistent approach to reward is adopted that is in line with our values. \n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-153\nP-152\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

      "text": "Governance\nRole of the Committee in overseeing broader employee pay and differences in \nremuneration policy for Executive Directors compared to other employees\nThe Committee actively considers the pay structures across the wider Group when setting policy for Executive \nDirectors to ensure that a consistent approach to reward is adopted that is in line with our values. There is a \nparticular focus in relation to any base salary review.\nOverall, compared to most employees, the remuneration policy for Executive Directors is weighted more to \nlong-term share-based incentives and stringent deferral and shareholding requirements. This is to ensure that the \nrelatively higher pay levels are justifiable internally and externally to shareholders as a clear link between the long-\nterm value created for shareholders and the remuneration received by Executives.\nConsideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group\nWhen setting the Executive Directors’ remuneration policy, the Committee takes into account the pay and \nconditions of employees more generally and, at least once a year, is given full details of the remuneration policy \nacross the Group, with any changes highlighted. As mentioned earlier, the Committee Chair also has responsibility \nto engage on employee pay.\nDuring the year Denise Collis, Remuneration Committee Chair, met with employees from across the organisation \nto explain how executive pay aligns to that of the workforce. Virtual meetings were held with regional \nmanagement, employees and HR representatives, as well as a number of in-office meetings. At the July meeting \nthe Remuneration Committee continued to focus on the ‘fair pay’ agenda discussing progress on specific \ninitiatives from last year, which included meaningful investment in entry-level base salaries in our Sales function \nand progressing with the implementation of an all-employee share plan. The employee share plan launched in \nNovember 2022 giving all colleagues around the globe the opportunity to participate and benefit from matching \nshares. The Committee intends to maintain the momentum in this area and review further progress at the \nJuly 2023 meeting.\nConsideration of shareholders’ views in determining the remuneration policy\nThe Committee actively consults with shareholders on executive remuneration policy changes. Feedback is taken \non board and any proposals are adjusted, as appropriate, given the objective of ensuring that shareholders are \nsupportive of the policy and its implementation. In addition, the Group follows shareholder sentiment on executive \npay and takes it into account in considering the application of policy in the years between the development of a \nnew policy. The last exercise was undertaken in 2022, as described in the Chair’s statement.\nRemuneration policy for recruitment and promotion\nThe remuneration package for a new Executive Director would take into account the skills and experience of \nthe individual, the market rate for a candidate of that experience and the individual’s remuneration package in \ntheir previous role if considered appropriate. The Committee will not pay more than necessary to facilitate the \nrecruitment of an individual.\nBase salary levels will be set in line with the policy taking account of their skills and experience and market data at \ncomparable companies. Benefits and pension will be in line with the policy. Additionally, there is flexibility to make \npayments to cover relocation and other related expenses.\nAnnual bonus opportunity will be in line with the policy and there is flexibility to set different performance \nconditions measurable over a part-year for Executives in the first year of appointment.\nLTIP award levels will be in line with the policy. \nFor internal promotions, outstanding incentive payments may continue and vest on their original terms. For \nexternal recruits there may be a need to buy out unvested incentive awards at a previous employer. The Committee \nconfirms that any such buy-out arrangements would only be used if necessary, would take a similar form to that \nsurrendered (e.g. cash or shares and timeframe), would take account of performance conditions, vesting periods \nand quantum, and would be no greater than that which the individual has forfeited on appointment.\nRemuneration policy continued\nPolicy on Directors’ service contracts and payments for loss of office\nThe Executive Directors have rolling service contracts subject to a maximum of 12-months’ notice by the Group or \nExecutive. For the avoidance of doubt, an individual’s notice period will start on the date of the announcement of \ntheir departure. At the Group’s discretion, on termination a payment may be made in lieu of notice equivalent to \n12 months’ salary, which may be paid in monthly instalments and offset against future earnings. For new hires the \npolicy is to provide a 12-month notice period.\nService contracts are available for inspection by appointment at 75 King William Street, London EC4N 7BE.\nDepending on the circumstances the Committee may consider payments in respect of statutory entitlements, \noutplacement support and legal fees. Mitigation would be applied to reduce any payments associated with loss \nof office.\n‘Good leavers’ (e.g. redundancy or retirement) as determined by the Committee may generally retain any earned \nbonus (pro-rata if active employment ceases part way through the year and normally paid at the usual time) or \nshare-based awards, with LTIP awards scaled back on a pro-rata basis for the portion of the vesting period elapsed \non cessation of active employment, subject to still achieving any relevant performance criteria.\nAwards would vest at the normal time and any deferral or holding periods would continue to apply for the  \nnormal duration. Only in exceptional circumstances would awards vest or shares be released early, such as  \nserious ill-health.\n‘Bad leavers’, such as a resignation, will lose any entitlement to participate in the current bonus scheme and any \nLTIP awards will normally lapse on cessation of employment. \nDeferred bonus shares are beneficially owned, but must be held for a minimum of two years.\nExternal appointments\nExecutive Directors are encouraged to undertake one external appointment, where they are able to combine this \nwith their existing role. This helps to broaden experience and capability, which can benefit the Group. Currently,  \nno external appointments are held by any Executive Directors.\nTerms of appointment and remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors (NEDs)\nNEDs are appointed for an initial three-year term, subject to satisfactory performance and re-election at each \nAGM, with an expectation that they would serve for at least six years, to provide a mix of independence, balance \nand continuity of experience. In practice NEDs may be requested to serve up to nine years, subject to rigorous \nreview. The dates of appointment and current terms of the NEDs who served during the year are set out in the \nbelow table.\nNon-Executive Director\nDate of appointment\nExpiry date of current term\nJames Bilefield\nOctober 2017\n30 September 2023\nDenise Collis\nJuly 2016\n30 June 2025\nAnne Fahy\nOctober 2015\nN/A\nBarrie Brien\nSeptember 2017\n10 September 2023\nElaine O’Donnell\nOctober 2022\n1 October 2025\nImogen Joss\nDecember 2022\n1 December 2025\nNotes: Anne Fahy stepped down as a Non-Executive Director on 19 April 2022. Elaine O’Donnell replaced Anne Fahy as a Non-Executive Director and Chair of the Audit \nand Risk Committee on 1 October 2022.\nThe appointment may be terminated by either the Group or the NED giving three months’ notice. Upon termination \nor resignation, NEDs are not entitled to compensation and, except for the three months’ notice, no fee is payable in \nrespect of any unexpired portion of the three-year term of appointment.\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-159\nP-158\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

This methodology \nwas selected as the Committee believes this provides a more accurate and consistent calculation based on the \ninformation available at this time. \nThe following table sets out the CEO pay ratio at the median, 25th and 75th percentile.\nFinancial year\nMethod\n25th percentile  \npay ratio\nMedian\n75th percentile  \npay ratio\n2022\nOption B\n40:1\n22:1\n14:1\n2021\nOption B\n59:1\n35:1\n23:1\n2020\nOption B\n22:1\n19:1\n10:1\n2019\nOption B\n34:1\n26:1\n16:1\n2018\nOption B\n39:1\n24:1\n20:1\nThe three employees used for the 2022 ratio are shown below:\nEmployees’  \nsalary  \n(£)\nEmployees’  \ntotal remuneration  \n(£)\n% change  \n2022 to 2021\nQ 25 pay\n23,000\n23,281\n-10.9%\nQ 50 pay\n37,544\n42,104\n-2.9%\nQ 75 pay\n62,244\n68,558\n2.2%\nRatios have decreased year on year due to a number of factors; CEO pay has decreased largely driven by a \nreduction in bonus paid and the long term incentive vesting being lower year on year. The decrease at the 25th and \nmedian employee is due to the roles being more junior compared to prior year. \nThe Committee is satisfied the median pay ratio is consistent with the pay, reward and progression policies for \nthe Company’s employees. Workforce pay and reward policies across the Group are actively considered by the \nCommittee when determining the Executive Director Remuneration Policy and its implementation each year to \nensure that our approach to reward across the Group is aligned with our values.\n3.7 Relative importance of spend on all employees’ pay compared to dividend payments\nThe table below sets out the change to the total employee remuneration costs compared with the change in \ndividends for 2022 compared to 2021.

During the year, \nthe Committee comprised only independent NEDs, being Denise Collis (Chair), James Bilefield, Barrie Brien, \nAnne Fahy and Elaine O’Donnell. The Committee therefore meets Code requirements to comprise at least three \nindependent NEDs.\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the most senior HR representative attend meetings by \ninvitation, excluding matters related to their own remuneration. The Committee met four times during the year for \nroutine business, in addition to unscheduled meetings for specific items and no member of the Committee has any \npersonal financial interest (other than as a shareholder) in the matters decided.\nThe Committee appointed Korn Ferry as its independent remuneration adviser in 2016, following a \ncomprehensive review.\nFees paid to Korn Ferry for advice in relation to remuneration matters during the year were £68,594.89 (2021: \n£63,559), both excluding VAT. A representative from Korn Ferry attends each Remuneration Committee meeting \nand provides input into the papers. Korn Ferry are members of the Remuneration Consultants Group (RCG) and \ncomply with the RCG Code of Conduct. Korn Ferry has no other relationship with the Company and the Committee \nis satisfied that their advice was and is objective and independent.\n4.2 Statements of voting at most recent AGMs\nAt the AGMs held in April 2020 and April 2022, the following votes were cast in relation to the binding vote on the \nremuneration policy and the advisory vote on the Annual report on remuneration.\nResolution\nFor\n%\nAgainst\n%\nWithheld\nDirectors’ remuneration policy (2020 AGM)*\n94,753,657\n95.46\n4,505,467\n4.54\n50,380\nDirectors’ remuneration report (2022 AGM)*\n55,874,397\n54.42\n46,806,243\n45.58\n1,986,904\n* Votes withheld are not counted in the % shown above.\nAt the 2022 AGM, the Directors’ remuneration report resolution received 45.6% votes against. This vote against \nwas as a result of ‘notice of notice’ scenario in respect of the departing CFO. The explanation was detailed in the \nChair’s statement and remuneration report last year. Shareholders were consulted prior to the AGM on this issue. \nFollowing the AGM our Remuneration Committee Chair engaged with significant shareholders to confirm steps \nthat have been put in place to stop the risk of a ‘Notice of Notice’ situation arising again.

Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the \nfinancial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and \nappropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nIndependence\nWe remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit \nof the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public \ninterest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical \nStandard were not provided.\nOther than those disclosed in note 3 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the \ncompany or its controlled undertakings in the period under audit.\nOur audit approach\nOverview\nAudit scope\n•\t The whole group was audited by one UK audit team, as the SThree centralised support function teams \nresponsible for processing the transactions of the whole group are based in London and Glasgow. Our audit \nwas therefore conducted solely from the UK.\n•\t We conducted full scope audits on four components and the audit of specified balances for six components. \nThe remaining components were subject to analytical reviews.\n•\t The four components where we performed full scope audits account for 76% of group revenue and 72% of \ngroup profit before income tax.\n•\t We also performed a full scope audit of the parent company.\nKey audit matters\n•\t Accrued income cut off (group)\n•\t Impairment of investments in subsidiaries (Company)\nMateriality\n•\t Overall group materiality: £3.85 million (2021: £2.99 million) based on 5% of profit before income tax  \n(2021: profit before income tax and exceptional items).\n•\t Overall company materiality: £1.90 million (2021: £1.21 million) based on 1% of net assets.\n•\t Performance materiality: £2.89 million (2021: £2.25 million) (group) and £1.42 million  \n(2021: £0.91 million) (company).\nThe scope of our audit\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the \nfinancial statements.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the \naudit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material \nmisstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect \non: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement \nteam. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in \nthe context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not \nprovide a separate opinion on these matters.\nThis is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP–183\nP–182\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

      "text": "The key audit matters below are consistent with last year.\nKey audit matter\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\nAccrued income cut off (group)\nThe group’s accounting process means that there is a \nmaterial amount of accrued rather than billed contractor \nrevenue at each period end within contract assets \n(‘accrued income’).\nAt year end the accrued income, disclosed as contract \nassets, was £91.68 million (2021: £82.08 million). This \nestimate is a system-generated amount calculated by \nusing standard contractor rates and estimated hours \nfor placed contractors and reduced by a manually \ncalculated historic ‘shrinkage’ calculation. Contract \nrevenue represented 94% (2021: 93%) of the group’s \nrevenue during the year.\nWe focused on this area due to the material quantum \nof accrued income, the estimation uncertainty and the \npotential for variances arising from applying the historic \n‘shrinkage’ percentage to the full potential value of \nunsubmitted timesheets.\nRefer to Trade and other receivables (note 13 of the \nfinancial statements), Operating Segments (note 2 of \nthe financial statements) and ‘Audit Committee report’.\nFor Contract revenue, including accrued income, we:\nTested the business process controls supporting the \naccuracy of rates and hours input into the system;\nTested a sample of accrued revenue and performed \na recalculation of the accrual based on timesheets \nsubmitted and contract rates;\nWe performed detailed testing over the 12 month \nrolling average historical shrinkage rate calculation \nand performed detailed testing over the inputs into \nthe calculation. In addition, we have recalculated the \n2022 shrinkage adjustment posted by management and \nperformed sensitivities and look back procedures; and\nWe verified that accrued income was not older than \n3 months in age in accordance with group policy and \nexamined the ageing profile of the balance, concluding \nthat management were following their accounting \npolicies in this area. We have not identified any \nevidence of fraud or error in the recognition of revenue. \nBased on our audit work, we found estimates related \nto accrued income to be acceptable. We also consider \nthe disclosures made in the financial statements to \nbe appropriate.\nKey audit matter\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\nImpairment of investments in subsidiaries \n(Company)\nThe Company holds investments in a number of \nUK and overseas subsidiaries with a total carrying \namount of £215.22 million at 30 November 2022 (2021: \n£206.05 million). In previous years the UK business has \nexperienced challenging economic conditions. In the \nperiod 2016 to 2020 impairment of £156.01 million has \nbeen recognised.\nIn the current year the UK market has experienced a \nhigher than anticipated growth rate. The actual growth \nachieved was 19% year on year compared to 8% growth \nin the previous year. However, the Company recognised \nan impairment charge of £0.94 million relating to \noperations in 3 locations as a result of a restructuring \nexercise. The entire net carrying value of investments \nin respect of these 3 locations were written off to \nnil. Management performed an assessment of the \nimpairment trigger indicators as set out in IAS 36 as at \nyear end date and concluded other than an impairment \nprovision for 3 locations, there were no indicators \npresent hence an assessment of impairment was not \nrequired for any other subsidiaries.\nWe focused on this area due to the material quantum \nof the carrying value of the investments in subsidiaries. \nJudgement is required to determine whether \nimpairment indicators exist which would require an \nimpairment test to be performed.\nRefer to Critical accounting judgement (note 12 of the \nfinancial statements).\nWe obtained management’s assessment of impairment \ntrigger indicators, as set out in IAS 36, for subsidiaries \nalong with details of year to date results and compared \nthem to the prior year which demonstrated significant \ngrowth across the Company’s subsidiaries; and\nWe considered the view of management and the \nperformance of the group as a whole (including \nindividual subsidiaries) and concluded that \nmanagement’s trigger assessment is fair and there are \nno indicators of further impairment, except for those \nthree entities where a decision has been taken by the \nboard to either restructure or close the operations of \nthe entities (Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong).\nWe also consider the disclosures made in the financial \nstatements to be appropriate.\nFinancial Statements\nIndependent auditors’ report \nto the members of SThree plc continued\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP–185\nP–184\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

      "text": "How we tailored the audit scope\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the \nfinancial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the company, the accounting \nprocesses and controls, and the industry in which they operate.\nThe group’s components vary significantly in size and we identified four financially significant components that, in \nour view, required an audit of their complete financial information due to their relative size or risk characteristics. In \naddition, we performed testing over specific material balances across a further six components. Together these full \nand specific scope component audits gave appropriate coverage of all material balances at a group level. We also \naudited consolidation adjustments to get sufficient coverage over final balances. The remaining components were \nsubject to analytical reviews.\nAlthough certain components are based overseas, the audit procedures have been performed by the group \nengagement team in the UK as this reflects the centralised shared service structure for finance across the group.\nMateriality\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for \nmateriality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the \nnature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures \nand in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements  \nas a whole.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\nFinancial statements - group\nFinancial statements - company\nOverall \nmateriality\n£3.85 million (2021: £2.99 million).\n£1.90 million (2021: £1.21 million).\nHow we \ndetermined it\n5% of profit before income tax (2021: profit \nbefore income tax and exceptional items)\n1% of net assets\nRationale for \nbenchmark \napplied\nWe believe that profit before tax provides \nus with a consistent year-on-year basis for \ndetermining materiality and is a generally \naccepted auditing benchmark. In the prior \nyear, profit before tax and exceptional items \nwas adopted to eliminate the disproportionate \nimpact of the exceptional items on the \nnormalised results. There are no exceptional \nitems in the current year.\nWe believe that net assets is the primary \nmeasure used by shareholders in \nassessing the position of the non-trading \nholding company, and is an accepted \nauditing benchmark.\nFor each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group \nmateriality. The range of materiality allocated across components was £1.30 million and £3.40 million. Certain \ncomponents were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.\nWe use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of \nuncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance \nmateriality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, \nclasses of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality \nwas 75% (2021: 75%) of overall materiality, amounting to £2.89 million (2021: £2.25 million) for the group financial \nstatements and £1.42 million (2021: £0.91 million) for the company financial statements.\nIn determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk \nassessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount in the middle of \nour normal range was appropriate.\nWe agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our \naudit above £0.38 million (group audit) (2021: £0.29 million) and £0.19 million (company audit) (2021: £0.12 million) \nas well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\nConclusions relating to going concern\nOur evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group’s and the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going \nconcern basis of accounting included:\n•\t Reviewing management’s going concern assessment (which includes a Base Case, a Downside Scenario and a \nSevere but Plausible Scenario) for reasonableness and consistency with our audit work;\n•\t Obtaining an understanding and challenging the forecasted cash flows for the twelve month period from the \ndate of authorisation of these financial statements and agreeing these to supporting documentation;\n•\t Testing of management’s cashflow forecast model which includes challenging the key assumptions within the \nmodel as well as the mathematical accuracy and its integrity;\n•\t Assessing historic growth and management forecasting accuracy;\n•\t Reviewing available banking facilities, including consideration of covenant requirements; and\n•\t Reviewing management’s going concern disclosures.\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or \nconditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group’s and the company’s ability \nto continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are \nauthorised for issue.\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of \naccounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\nHowever, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the \ngroup’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn relation to the directors’ reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have \nnothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in the financial statements about \nwhether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the \nrelevant sections of this report.\nFinancial Statements\nIndependent auditors’ report \nto the members of SThree plc continued\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP–187\nP–186\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

The directors are also responsible for such \ninternal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from \nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s \nability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the \ngoing concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to \ncease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from \nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. \nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance \nwith ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud \nor error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to \ninfluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in \nline with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including \nfraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.\nBased on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance \nwith laws and regulations related to employment laws and indirect taxes impacting the different territories in which \nthe group operates, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the \nfinancial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial \nstatements such as the Companies Act 2006 and Listing Rules. We evaluated management’s incentives and \nopportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), \nand determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to achieve desired \nfinancial results and management bias in accounting estimates. Audit procedures performed by the engagement \nteam included:\n•\t enquiries with management, internal audit, the Audit and Risk committee and the group’s internal legal \ncounsel, including consideration of known or suspected instances of fraud and non-compliance with laws \nand regulations and performed testing where a provision has been made in respect of these by examining \nsupporting calculations;\n•\t understanding and evaluating the design and implementation of management’s controls designed to prevent \nand detect irregularities;\n•\t challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates, in \nparticular in relation to accrued income cut-off, assessment of impairment for investments in subsidiaries; and\n•\t identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal entries posted with unusual account \ncombinations and postings by unusual users.\nThere are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of \ninstances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions \nreflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher \nthan the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for \nexample, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.\nOur audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using \ndata auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than \ntesting complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk \ncharacteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population \nfrom which the sample is selected.\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website \nat: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.\nUse of this report\nThis report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in \naccordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving \nthese opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is \nshown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.\nOther required reporting\nCompanies Act 2006 exception reporting\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:\n•\t we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or\n•\t adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not \nbeen received from branches not visited by us; or\n•\t certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n•\t the company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in \nagreement with the accounting records and returns.\nWe have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.\nAppointment\nFollowing the recommendation of the Audit and Risk Committee, we were appointed by the members in 1999 to \naudit the financial statements for the year ended 30 November 1999 and subsequent financial periods. The period \nof total uninterrupted engagement is 24 years, covering the years ended 30 November 1999 to 30 November 2022.\nOther matter\nIn due course, as required by the Financial Conduct Authority Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 4.1.14R, \nthese financial statements will form part of the ESEF-prepared annual financial report filed on the National Storage \nMechanism of the Financial Conduct Authority in accordance with the ESEF Regulatory Technical Standard (‘ESEF \nRTS’). This auditors’ report provides no assurance over whether the annual financial report will be prepared using \nthe single electronic format specified in the ESEF RTS.\nKenneth Wilson (Senior Statutory Auditor)\nfor and on behalf of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nChartered Accountants and Statutory Auditors \nGlasgow\n27 January 2023\nFinancial Statements\nIndependent auditors’ report \nto the members of SThree plc continued\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP–191\nP–190\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

Its registered office is 1st Floor, \n75 King William Street, London, EC4N 7BE.\nThe business model, activities, locations of SThree plc (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together the Group) are \nset out further in the Strategic Report of this Annual Report.\nBasis of preparation\nThe Consolidated and Company-only Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with UK‑adopted \nInternational Accounting Standards and in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 \nas applicable to companies reporting under those standards, including interpretations issued by the IFRS \nInterpretations Committee.\nOn 31 December 2020, International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU) at that \ndate were brought into UK law and became UK-adopted International Accounting Standards, with future changes \nbeing subject to endorsement by the UK Endorsement Board. The Group transitioned to UK-adopted International \nAccounting Standards in its Consolidated Financial Statements on 1 December 2021. However, there was no impact \non recognition, measurement or disclosures, as well as no changes in the accounting policies from the transition. \nThe Group’s key accounting policies are set out across the following notes to the accounts and were applied \nconsistently throughout the year and preceding year.\nThe Consolidated and Company-only Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis of \naccounting, as modified by financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss or held at fair value through other \ncomprehensive income. The Company has elected to take the exemption under Section 408 of the Companies Act \n2006 not to present an income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the parent Company. The \nprofit after tax for the parent Company for the year was £91.3 million (2021: loss after tax of £4.0 million).\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Sterling, the functional currency of SThree plc.\nGoing concern\nThe Consolidated and Company-only Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The \nDirectors have reviewed the Group’s cash flow forecasts, considered the assumptions contained in the budget, and \nconsidered associated principal risks which may impact the Group’s performance in the 12 months from the date of \napproval of this year’s financial statements and in the period immediately thereafter.\nAt 30 November 2022, the Group had no debt except for IFRS 16 lease liabilities of £33.7 million and a small bank \noverdraft. Credit facilities relevant to the review period comprise a committed £50.0 million RCF (a recently \nrefinanced facility expiring in May 2025, with extension options to 2027) and an uncommitted £30.0 million \naccordion facility, both jointly provided by HSBC and Citibank. These facilities remained undrawn on 30 November \n2022. A further uncommitted £5.0 million bank overdraft facility is also held with HSBC of which £0.4 million was \nused at the year end.  (Refer to note 17 Other financial liabilities for further details on the new credit facility which \nreplaced the existing RCF as mentioned here.)\nIn addition, the Group has £65.4 million of cash and cash equivalents available to fund its short-term needs, as well \nas a substantial working capital position, reflecting net cash due to SThree for placements already undertaken.\nThe assessment of going concern is further described in the Strategic Report as part of the Compliance information \nunder the heading ‘Going concern’ on page 114 which is incorporated by reference into these financial statements. \nBased on this evaluation, the Directors have formed a judgement that the Group has adequate resources to \ncontinue in operational existence for at least the next 12 months from the date of approval of the Group’s \nConsolidated Financial Statements, and considered it appropriate to prepare them on the going concern basis.\nNotes to the financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 November 2022\nClimate change consideration\nClimate change is a significant issue for the world and the transition to a low-carbon economy will create both risks \nand opportunities for the Group. The management team has considered the impact of climate change in preparing \nthe Consolidated Financial Statements, particularly in the context of the risks identified in the TCFD report on \npages 60 to 77. These considerations, which are integral to the Group’s strategy, are not considered to be key areas \nof judgements or sources of estimation uncertainty in the current financial year.\nThe management team considered the impact from climate change on the following areas:\n•\t The going concern and viability of the Group over the next five years, including the potential impact of \nclimate-related risks, such as SThree’s offices impacted by heightened physical risks affecting our operational \nability to place contractors and service the existing contracts, resulting in lower revenue and income. This is \nsubject to the ongoing assessment by the management team performed using three climate-related scenarios \nfor 2022-2040. The assessment helps to continually test SThree’s strategic resilience and its flexibility to \nadapt operations to ever-changing risks and opportunities as a consequence of climate change to drive \ncontinued growth. \n•\t Useful lives of fixed assets: the impact of climate change is not considered to be material on our existing asset \nbase including on factors like residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods which determine the \ncarrying value of non-current assets. Although, the Group has plans to invest in low-carbon technology as \npart of its net zero commitment, there is no immediate risk of material adjustment to the carrying values of the \nexisting assets in the next financial year’s results. Over the course of our net zero path, the existing fixed assets \nare expected to be fully depreciated within the next five to seven years.\n•\t Recoverability of trade receivables and contract assets: the impact of climate-related matters could have an \nimpact on the Group’s clients in the future, especially, clients whose businesses/operations could be negatively \naffected by the introduction of emission-reduction legislation, energy transition plans or by extreme weather \nand other physical conditions, which could lead to increase in manufacturing costs, dilapidation of their asset \nbase and their ability to pay debts. No material climate-related issues have arisen during the current year \nthat have impacted our assessment of the recoverability of receivables. The Group’s expected credit losses \nallowance uses credit ratings which inherently include the market’s assessment of the climate change impact \non credit risk of our clients. Given the short-term maturity of trade receivables including contract assets, \nclimate change is unlikely to materially increase our credit risk. \n•\t Share-based payments: some performance conditions of the Long-Term Incentive Plan for members of the \nExecutive Committee are linked and measured against ESG metrics from the 2022 financial year. This could \nimpact the future amount of the recognition of the share-based payment expense in the Group income \nstatement. However, as the ESG-related performance condition constitutes only 10% of each grant, the impact \nis considered immaterial.\n•\t Segmental reporting: in our response to climate change and transition to a net zero target, there has been yet \nno change to the management information provided to, and reviewed by, the chief operating decision maker \neach month. \nWhilst there is currently no material medium-term impact expected from climate change, the management team \nis aware of the ever-changing risks and will continue to regularly monitor these risks against judgements and \nestimates made in preparation of the Group’s financial statements.\nAccounting policies\nThe accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are consistent with \nthose applied in the previous financial year, except for the adoption of new and amended standards effective as of \n1 December 2021 as set out below.\nNew and amended standards effective in 2022 and adopted by the Group\nThe following amendments to the accounting standards, issued by the IASB and endorsed by the UK and EU, have \nbeen adopted by the Group and became applicable as of 1 December 2021. The Group did not have to change its \naccounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these amended standards. \n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-199\nP-198\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

Where floating interest-bearing receivables and payables exist (currently based on IBORs) the \nGroup applied suitable replacement benchmark rates and accounts for the instruments in accordance with the \namendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments published in 2019 (Phase 1) and 2020 (Phase 2). The adoption of these \namendments and the transition to ARRs had an immaterial financial impact. The implications on the trading results \nof our segments of IBOR reform were also assessed and the expected impact was found to be immaterial. \nNew and amended standards that are applicable to the Group but not yet effective\nAs at the date of authorisation of this Annual Report, the following amendments to existing standards were in issue \nbut not yet effective. Where already endorsed by the UK, these changes will be adopted on the effective dates \nnoted. Where not yet endorsed by the UK, the adoption date is less certain. These amendments are not expected to \nhave a material impact on the Group in the current or future periods.\n•\t Reference to the Conceptual Framework (amendments to IFRS 3).\n•\t Property, plant and equipment – proceeds before intended use (amendments to IAS 16).\n•\t Onerous contracts – cost of fulfilling a contract (amendments to IAS 37).\n•\t Annual improvements to IFRS 2018-2020 (amendments to the following standards: IFRS 1, IFRS 9, IFRS 16 and \nIAS 41).\nThe Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not \nyet effective.\nThe Group’s significant accounting policies relating to specific financial statement items are set out under the \nrelevant notes. Accounting policies that affect the financial statements as a whole and a description of the \naccounting estimates and judgements are set out below.\nBasis of consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group include the financial statements of the Company and all its \nsubsidiaries. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control. The Group has control \nwhen it has rights to variable returns from its involvement in the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through \nits power over the entity. The subsidiaries are deconsolidated from the date on which that control ceases. \nWhen the Group disposes of a subsidiary, the gain or loss on disposal represents: (i) the aggregate of the fair \nvalue of the consideration received or receivable; (ii) the carrying amount of the subsidiary’s net assets (including \ngoodwill) at the date of disposal; and (iii) any directly attributable disposal costs. Amounts previously recognised \nin other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are removed from equity and recognised in the \nConsolidated Income Statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\nUniform accounting policies are adopted across the Group. All intra-group balances and transactions, including \nunrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated on consolidation. \nForeign currencies and translation\nFunctional and presentation currency\nItems included in the financial statements of each Group subsidiary are measured using the currency of the primary \neconomic environment in which that subsidiary operates (its functional currency). \nTransactions and balances\nForeign currency transactions are translated using exchange rates at the date of the transactions. Any exchange \ngain or loss from settlement of these transactions or translation at the period end are recognised in the \nincome statement.\nConsolidation\nOn consolidation, the subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into \nSterling at the rates ruling at the reporting date. The results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into Sterling \nat average rates of exchange for the period and the exchange differences arising on translation are recognised \nin Other Comprehensive Income. Any exchange differences which have arisen from an entity’s investment in a \nforeign subsidiary, including long-term loans, are recognised as a separate component of equity and are included \nin the Group’s currency translation reserve (CTR). When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are \nreclassified from CTR to the Consolidated Income Statement to form part of the gain or loss on disposal.\nCritical accounting judgements and estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates \nand judgements. It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Company’s \naccounting policies. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and \nother factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nCritical accounting judgements\nDetails of critical accounting judgements which could have a significant impact upon the financial statements are \nset out in the related notes as follows:\n(i)\t Tracker shares arrangements (refer to note 12 Investments);\n(ii)\t Exceptional items (refer to note 3 Administrative expenses).\n(iii) Indicators of impairment of investments in subsidiaries (Company only) (refer to note 12 Investments).\nCritical accounting estimates\nThe assumptions and estimates at the end of the current reporting period that have a significant risk of resulting in \na material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are set out in \nthe related note as follows:\n(i)\t Revenue recognition (refer to note 2 Operating segments).\n2\t Operating segments\nAccounting policy\nRevenue\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised when or as the Group satisfies a performance obligation \nby transferring service to a client. For Permanent placements, the Group principally satisfies its performance \nobligations at a point in time; for Contract placements, the Group satisfies its performance obligations over time. \nRevenue is shown net of value added tax and other sales-related taxes, credit notes, rebates and discounts and \nafter elimination of sales within the Group. \nContract revenue for the supply of professional services, which is mainly based on the number of hours worked by \na contractor, is recognised when the service has been provided. Revenue from Permanent placements is typically \nbased on a fixed percentage of the candidate’s remuneration package and is recognised when the candidate \ncommences employment. Revenue earned but not invoiced at year end is accrued and included in ‘Accrued \nincome’ (it represents the variable consideration of revenue). The management team applies a constraint in the form \nof the historical shrinkage rate to Contract accrued income, aimed at preventing the over-recognition of revenue. \nRevenue from retained assignments is recognised on completion of certain pre-agreed stages of the service. \nFees received for the service are non-refundable. \nA bad debt provision is established for non-fulfilment of Permanent placement and Contract revenue obligations, \nwhich is netted off against the gross trade receivables on the face of the statement of financial position.\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-201\nP-200\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

This includes an \nassessment of professional services received by the client for services provided by contractors between the \ndate of the last received timesheet and the year end. \nRevenue is accrued (known as accrued income) for contracts which are valid in the period, but where no timesheet \nhas been received or approved, and therefore billing and payments to contractors have not taken place. The value \nof unsubmitted/unapproved timesheets for each individual contractor is system generated and the number of \nhours worked by each contractor is adjusted for expected holidays and the historical shrinkage rate.\nThe key estimation uncertainty arises from determining the historical shrinkage rate which is used to constrain \nthe variable part of revenue, i.e. accrued income, at the reporting date. The historical shrinkage rate represents a \nfull-year (12-month rolling) average pattern in which income accrued for expected timesheets is reduced versus \nthe actual timesheets received and approved each month.\nIn 2022, the average shrinkage rate was approximately 14.6% across the Group (2021: 13.6%).\nA 10% increase in this key assumption could have an impact of approximately £0.3 million on the amount \nof Contract net fees (£1.5 million on revenue less £1.2 million on costs of sales) in the Consolidated Income \nStatement in the next financial year.\nThe Group’s operating segments are established on the basis of those components of the Group that are regularly \nreviewed by the Group’s chief operating decision making body, in deciding how to allocate resources and in \nassessing performance. The Group’s business is considered primarily from a geographical perspective.\nThe Directors have determined the chief operating decision maker to be the Executive Committee made up of the \nChief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Technology and Information Officer, the Chief People \nOfficer, Chief Legal Officer and Senior Managing Directors.\nThe Group segments the business into the following reportable regions: DACH, EMEA excluding DACH, USA and \nAPAC, as well as presents an analysis of net fees by its five key markets: Germany, the Netherlands, the USA, the \nUK and Japan. The DACH region comprises Germany, Switzerland and Austria. The ‘EMEA excluding DACH’ region \ncomprises primarily Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Ireland, and Dubai. All these sub-regions were \naggregated into two separate reportable segments based on the possession of similar economic characteristics. \nCountries aggregated into DACH and separately into ‘EMEA excluding DACH’ generate a similar average net fees \nmargin and long-term growth rates, and are similar in each of the following areas:\n•\t the nature of the services (recruitment/candidate placement);\n•\t the methods used in which they provide services to clients (independent contractors, employed contractors, \nand permanent candidates); and\n•\t the class of candidates (candidates, who we place with our clients, represent skillsets in Science, Technology, \nEngineering and Mathematics disciplines).\nNotes to the financial statements continued\nfor the year ended 30 November 2022\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-203\nP-202\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

The pension costs charged to the income statement \nrepresent the contributions payable by the Group to the funds during each period.\nShare-based payments\nThe Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based arrangements, under which it receives services \nfrom employees in return for equity instruments of the Group. The cost of equity-settled transactions with \nemployees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date when equity instruments are granted and is \nrecognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become fully \nentitled to the award. Fair value is determined by using an appropriate valuation model.\nNo expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest. For the awards with non-vesting conditions \n(awards that do not have an explicit or implicit service requirement), the full cost of the award is recognised on \nthe grant date, i.e. they are treated as fully vested irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied.\nAt the end of the reporting period, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the \nvesting period has expired and the best estimate of the achievement of non-market conditions and the number \nof equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous year end \nis recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding credit recognised in equity.\nWhere an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any \ncost not yet recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately.

Taxable profit differs from profit before income \ntax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable \nor deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s \nliability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the \nreporting date.\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the reporting date arising \nbetween the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred \ntax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the \ndeferred tax liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted \nby the reporting date.\nDeferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will \nbe available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.

If the goodwill balance \nis material, it is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

      "text": "Financial Statements\n12\t Investments\nAccounting policy\nEquity investments\nThe Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n•\t those measured subsequently at fair value (either through OCI or through profit or loss); and\n•\t those measured at amortised cost.\nClassification depends on the Group’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual \nterms of the cash flows. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will be recorded in either profit or \nloss or OCI. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the \nGroup has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at \nFVOCI. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether \ntheir cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest.\nSubsidiaries\nInvestments in shares in subsidiary companies are stated at cost less impairment loss to the extent that the \ncarrying value exceeds the recoverable amount; the investment is impaired to its recoverable amount with the \nimpairment charged to the Company’s income statement. An investment is deemed to be impaired when it has \nbeen determined that its carrying value will not be recovered either through actual cash flows or operating profit \ngeneration or selling it. If circumstances arise that indicate that investments might be impaired, the recoverable \namount of the investment is estimated. The recoverable amount is the higher of the entity’s fair value less costs \nto sell or its value in use. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, the investment is \nimpaired to its recoverable amount.\nWhere share-based payments are granted to the employees of subsidiary undertakings by the Company, \nthey are treated as a capital contribution to the subsidiary and the Company’s investment in the subsidiary is \nincreased accordingly.\nThe investments in shares in the undertakings outside of the Group, in particular where the Group does not have \nsignificant influence or control, are classified as financial assets held at fair value through other comprehensive \nincome. At initial recognition, such shareholdings are measured at cost and on subsequent measurement dates \nthey are fair valued on the basis of current prices generated for similar transactions or using an enterprise value \nto sales multiple valuation method.\nTracker share arrangements\nOver the past years, until 2020, the Group invited selected senior individuals to invest in the businesses they \nmanage, sharing in both the risk and reward. These individuals were offered equity (‘tracker shares’) in those \nbusinesses in return for making an investment. The amount of equity offered varied in different circumstances \nbut was never over 25% of the overall equity of the business in question. The equity stake tracks the performance \nof the underlying business and the individuals receive dividends (if declared) by the ‘tracked’ business. \nIf an individual remains a holder of the tracker shares for a pre-agreed period, typically three to five years \ndepending on the vesting period applied to the tracker shares, they may then offer their vested tracker shares \nfor sale to the Group, but there is no obligation on the Group to settle the arrangement. SThree will undertake a \nformal due diligence process to establish whether there is a sound business case for settling a tracker share and \nmake an arm’s length judgement.

      "text": "Financial Statements\nTracker shares can be repurchased from holders with either cash or SThree plc shares at the Company’s discretion. \nHistorically, the Company’s policy and intention has been to settle tracker shares using SThree plc shares. \nTherefore, the judgement of the Directors is that this scheme is treated as equity-settled. \nIndicators of impairment of investments in subsidiaries (Company only)\nAt each reporting date, the Company assesses whether there are any indications of impairment of its investments in \nsubsidiaries. The Company uses both external and internal sources of information to make this assessment, including \nthose in relation to significant adverse changes in the market or economic environment in which subsidiaries operate, \ninformation about the carrying amount of subsidiaries’ net assets versus market value, or internal management reports \nthat indicate that the financial performance of subsidiaries will be worse than budgeted.   \nOnly when an indication of impairment is identified, the Company performs a detail impairment review including \ncalculations of recoverable amounts of the investments. \nGroup\nThe Group holds a minority shareholding (less than 1% of the total share capital issued) in RoboRecruiter, a \ncompany which invests in automated recruitment solutions. The investment is a financial asset classified as \nmeasured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Due to limited information about the current \nperformance and prospects of this company, management made a decision to fully write off the investment of \nc.£1k. In previous years, the investment was considered a level 1 valuation under the fair value hierarchy.\nCompany\nCost\n£’000\nAt 1 December 2020\n356,213\nAdditions\n\t\n– Settlement of vested tracker shares \n4,610\n\t\n– Settlement of unvested tracker shares \n217\n\t\n– Capital contribution relating to share-based payments\n1,077\nAt 30 November 2021\n362,117\nAdditions\n\t\n– Settlement of vested tracker shares \n3,862\n\t\n– Settlement of unvested tracker shares \n2,122\n\t\n– Capital contribution relating to share-based payments\n4,127\nAt 30 November 2022\n372,228\nProvision for impairment\n \nAt 1 December 2020 and 30 November 2021\n156,070\nProvision made during the year\n940\nAt 30 November 2022\n157,010\nNet carrying value\nAt 30 November 2022\n215,218\nAt 30 November 2021\n206,047\nDuring the year, the Company settled a number of vested and unvested tracker shares by awarding SThree plc \nshares (note 20(b)). This resulted in an increase in the Company’s investment of £6.0 million (2021: £4.8 million) in \nrelevant subsidiary businesses.\n12\t Investments continued\nIndividuals paid the fair value for the tracker shares at the time of the initial subscription, as determined by an \nindependent third-party valuer in accordance with IFRS 2 and taking into account the particular rights attached \nto the shares as described in the relevant businesses’ Articles. The initial valuation always took into consideration \nfactors such as the size and trading record of the underlying business, expected dividends, future projections, \nas well as the external market, sector and country characteristics. The external valuer was supplied with detailed \nfinancial information, including net fees and EBITDA of the relevant businesses. Using this information, an \nindependent calculation of the initial Equity Value (EV) was prepared. This EV was then discounted to arrive \nat a valuation to take into account the relevant characteristics of the shareholding in the tracked business, for \nexample the absence of voting rights. \nThe methodology for calculating the EV was applied consistently, although the data used varied depending on \nthe size and history of the business.\nIn 2021 the Directors decided to close the tracker share scheme for any new entrants/investments.\nIf an individual leaves the Group before the pre-agreed period, they are entitled to receive the lower of the initial \nsubscription amount they contributed or the tracker share fair value on the date of departure as set out under \nthe Articles. To reflect this, a provision in relation to tracker shares is recognised to reflect the consideration for \ntracker shares received from individuals (note 18 Provisions).\nUp until 2014 certain individuals received loans from the Group to pay part of the initial subscription for \ntheir tracker shares, on which interest is charged at or above the HMRC beneficial loan rate. These loans are \nrepayable by the individuals either at the time of settlement of their tracker shares, or via tracker share dividend, \nor when they leave the Group. These loans are included within other receivables (note 13 Trade and other \nreceivables).\nDuring the vesting period, no share-based payment charge is recognised in the income statement on the basis \nthat the initial subscription by the individual at the grant date equated to the fair value at that date. Dividends \ndeclared by the tracked businesses, which were factored into the grant date fair value determination of the \ntracker shares, are recorded in equity as ‘distributions to tracker shareholders’.\nWhen the Company issues new shares to settle the tracker share arrangements, the nominal value of the shares \nis credited to share capital and the difference between the fair value of the tracker shares and the nominal value \nis credited to share premium. If the Company uses treasury shares to settle the arrangements, the difference \nbetween the fair value of the tracker shares and the weighted average value of the treasury shares is accounted \nfor in the retained earnings.\nCritical accounting judgements\nTracker shares arrangements\nThe tracker shares arrangements give the Group the choice to settle tracker shares in either cash or SThree \nplc shares. There are significant accounting differences between an equity-settled and cash-settled scheme. \nJudgement is therefore required as to whether this is a cash or equity-settled share-based payment scheme. \nBased on the Directors’ judgement, the tracker share arrangements are accounted for as an equity-settled \nshare-based payment scheme under IFRS 2 as the Group’s policy is to settle its obligations under the \narrangements in SThree plc shares. The Company settles tracker shares through either treasury shares or the \nissue of new shares in SThree plc. The Companies Act 2006 does not specify whether the issue of treasury \nshares to settle share-based payments should be accounted for in share premium or elsewhere. The Company \nhas taken legal advice which confirms this is judgemental and therefore the approach taken by the Company \nis to include differences between the fair value of the tracker shares settled and the weighted average cost of \ntreasury shares in retained earnings.\nNotes to the financial statements continued\nfor the year ended 30 November 2022\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-219\nP-218\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

In 2022, the Company \nrecognised a net increase in investments in its subsidiaries of £4.1 million (2021: £1.1 million) relating to share \noptions and awards including those under the Long-Term Incentive Plan and Save-As-You-Earn schemes.\nAssessment of investment indications\nDuring the year, the Company performed an assessment of impairment indications within its portfolio of investments \nin subsidiaries. Overall, SThree businesses delivered a very strong financial performance, ahead of market and \nmanagement expectations, in 2022. The Group’s Contract net fees increased by 19% and Permanent net fees \nincreased by 6%, both on a like-for-like basis. With ongoing strong demand for candidates with STEM skills, our \ncontractor order book grew by 19% YoY across the Group. No significant indicators of impairment were noted.\nHowever, following the Board’s decision to significantly restructure our businesses in Ireland and Singapore, and to close \nthe Hong Kong business, an impairment charge of £0.9 million was recognised in the Company’s income statement in \n2022. The net book values of these investments were written off in full. Further details can be found in note 7 and in the \nChief Financial Officer’s statement on page 87. \nFor comparison, no impairment charge was recognised in the prior year. \nA full list of the Company’s subsidiaries that existed as at 30 November 2022 is provided in note 26.\n13 Trade and other receivables\nAccounting policy\nTrade receivables including Contract assets are amounts due from customers for services performed in the \nordinary course of business. They are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised \ncost using the effective interest rate method. The normal credit terms are between 14-30 days upon service \nprovision, with 30 days becoming a more prevalent payment term.\nThe Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach for trade and other receivables and follows an expected credit \nlosses (ECLs) approach for measuring the allowance of its trade receivables. The Group recognises a loss allowance \nbased on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. For invoices reviewed on a portfolio basis (i.e. not individually \nreviewed), the loss allowance for ECLs is provided at differing percentages determined based on historical collection \nexperience, adjusted for forward-looking market factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. \nCertain exposures within trade receivables are individually assessed for which the Directors make judgement on a \nclient-by-client basis as to their ability to collect outstanding receivables. When reviewing significant outstanding \ninvoices, the Directors consider qualitative factors that are available without undue cost or effort, such as a decrease \nin the debtor’s creditworthiness, changes in external or internal credit ratings, macro-economic conditions, actual or \nexpected deterioration in business performance of any particular debtor, and other known issues.\nDerecognition of trade and other receivables\nTrade and other receivables are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from these assets have \nexpired or have been transferred. On derecognition, any difference between the carrying amount of an asset \nand the consideration received is recognised in the profit or loss.\nFor critical accounting estimates regarding contract assets, refer to note 2 Operating segments.\nNotes to the financial statements continued\nfor the year ended 30 November 2022\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-221\nP-220\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are \ninitially measured on a net present value basis and are recognised as part of ‘Property, plant and equipment’, \n‘Non-current lease liabilities’ and ‘Current lease liabilities’ in the statement of financial position.\nLease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\na) \t fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable;\nb) \t variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;\nc) \t amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees, if any;\nd) \t the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain it will exercise that option; and\ne) \t payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease (if that rate can be determined),  \nor the incremental borrowing rate (IBR), being the rate the Group would have to pay to borrow the funds \nnecessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and \nconditions. In determining the IBR to be used, the Group applies judgement to establish the suitable reference \nrate and credit spread.\nEach lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance costs, within finance costs in the \nincome statement.\nLease payments are presented as follows in the Group statement of cash flows:\n•\t payments for the interest element of recognised lease liabilities are included in ‘interest paid’ within cash \nflows from financing activities; and\n•\t payments for the principal element of recognised lease liabilities are presented within cash flows from \nfinancing activities.\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\na) \t the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;\nb) \t any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentive received;\nc) \t any initial direct costs; and\nd) \t any restoration costs.\nThe right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the assets’ useful life and the lease term on a \nstraight-line basis.\nThe Group does not apply the recognition exemption to short-term leases or leases of low-value assets, as \npermitted by the standard.\nIn determining the lease terms, the management team consider all facts and circumstances that create an \neconomic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options \n(or periods after a termination option) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to \nbe extended (or not terminated). The assessment is reviewed if a significant event or change in circumstances \noccurs which affects this assessment and that is within the control of the lessee.\n14\t Cash and cash equivalents\nAccounting policy\nCash and cash equivalents include cash-in-hand, deposits held with banks, and other short-term highly liquid \ninvestments with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are classified as short-term \nborrowings unless they form part of a cash pooling arrangement where there is an intention to settle on a net \nbasis, in which case they are reported net of related cash balances.\nGroup\nCompany\n£'000\n30 November\n2022\n30 November\n2021\n30 November\n2022\n30 November\n2021\nCash at bank\n65,809\n57,526\n121\n4,646\nBank overdraft\n(423)\n(24)\n–\n–\nNet cash and cash equivalents\n65,386\n57,502\n121\n4,646\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months \nor less, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or \noptions are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.\nThe Group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are classified as ‘treasury reserve’. The consideration paid, \nincluding any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from the equity attributable to the owners of \nthe Company until the shares are cancelled or reissued. No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on \nthe purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own equity shares.\nEmployee Benefit Trust (EBT)\nThe EBT is funded entirely by the Company. The assets and liabilities of the EBT are recognised in the Group’s \nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nThe shares in the EBT are held to satisfy awards and grants under certain employee share schemes. For \naccounting purposes, shares held in the EBT are treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, \ntherefore, included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as treasury reserve. Consideration, if any, received \nfor the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and \nthe original cost being taken to retained earnings. No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the \npurchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares held by the EBT.\nIn the separate financial statements of the Company, the EBT is treated as an agent acting on behalf of the \nCompany. Funding provided by the Company to the EBT is accounted for as the issue of treasury shares.\nFor accounting policy regarding tracker share awards in subsidiary companies, refer to note 12 Investments.\n19 Deferred tax continued\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so and when the \ndeferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.

In assessing whether to \nrecognise deferred tax assets, the Group considered both current and the forecast trading performance in these \nterritories and the expectations regarding the levels of profitability that can be achieved.\nAt the reporting date, the Group had unused tax losses of £30.3 million (2021: £34.1 million) available for offset \nagainst future profits. No deferred tax asset was recognised in respect of the £30.3 million (2021: £34.1 million) \nlosses. The reduction in losses arises from expiration, recognition, exchange differences and utilisation.\nIncluded in unrecognised tax losses are losses of £0.8 million (2021: £0.8 million) which are subject to expiry. Of \nthis amount, £nil expires over the course of the next five years; and the remaining balance of £0.8 million will expire \nby 2042.

On 8 June 2022, the General \nCourt of the European Union dismissed the applications for annulment from both the UK Government and \none of the British broadcast television network companies.

The role of the Group’s corporate treasury \nfunction is to manage and monitor external and internal funding requirements and financial risks in support of \ncorporate objectives. Treasury activities are governed by policies and procedures approved by the Board. A \ntreasury management committee, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, meets on a monthly basis to review \ntreasury activities and its members receive management information relating to treasury activities. The Group’s \ninternal auditors periodically review the treasury internal control environment and compliance with policies \nand procedures.\nEach year, the Board reviews the Group’s currency hedging strategy to ensure it is appropriate. The Group does not \nhold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and its treasury policies specifically prohibit \nsuch activity. All transactions in financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying \nbusiness activities, not for speculation.\nThe Group corporate treasury function enters into a limited number of derivative transactions, principally currency \nswaps and forward currency contracts, with the purpose of managing the currency risks arising from operations \nand financing of subsidiaries.\nAt the year end, the Group had net foreign exchange swaps of: \nCurrency\n2022\nLCCY'000\n2022\n£'000\n2021\nLCCY'000\n2021\n£'000\nUnited Arab Emirates Dirham (AED)\n2,218\n501\n7,314\n1,497\nCanadian Dollar (CAD)\n(486)\n(300)\n(199)\n(117)\nSwiss Franc (CHF)\n(759)\n(666)\n(4,650)\n(3,806)\nEuro (EUR)\n(15,106)\n(13,041)\n2,974\n2,535\nHong Kong Dollar (HKD)\n5,559\n590\n7,664\n739\nJapanese Yen (JPY)\n(606,417)\n(3,645)\n(221,633)\n(1,472)\nSingapore Dollar (SGD)\n(8,142)\n(4,961)\n(5,412)\n(2,982)\nUS Dollar (USD)\n(30,569)\n(25,355)\n(17,936)\n(13,483)\n(46,877)\n(17,089)\nThe contracts were mainly taken out close to the year-end date for a period of 30 to 32 days (2021: 31 to 37 days), \nand they had an immaterial net positive fair value (2021: £0.1 million) at the year end.\nThe Group is exposed to a number of different financial risks including capital management, foreign currency rates, \nliquidity, credit and interest rates risks, which were not materially changed from the previous year.

The maximum exposure to a single banking group for deposits and funds held on account at the year end \nwas £40.6 million (2021: £43.5 million). The Group will not accept any counterparty bank for its deposits unless it \nhas been awarded a minimum recognised credit rating of A3/Prime-2 (Moody’s). Some local banks in emerging \nmarkets may have lower ratings but the funds at risk will be small. The Group will permit exposures with individual \ncounterparty banks and exposure types up to pre-defined limits as part of the Group treasury policy. Exposure to \nall transaction limits is monitored daily.\nThe Group mitigates its credit risk from trade receivables by using a credit rating agency to assess new clients and \npayment history to consider further credit extensions to existing clients. In addition, the spread of the client base \n(over 8,200 clients) helps to mitigate the risk of individual client failure having a material impact on the Group.\nThe Group does not typically renegotiate the terms of trade receivables; hence the outstanding balance is included \nin the analysis based on the original payment terms. There were no significant renegotiated balances outstanding \nat the year end.\nThe Group’s credit risk from loans given to certain tracker shareholders (note 13) is immaterial. In 2022, five loans \nwere repaid in full, and only three remain outstanding (2021: eight outstanding tracker share loans) for the total \namount of £0.1 million. Exposure to loans from individuals is regularly monitored and the individuals are asked \nto settle all or a portion of their outstanding balances when their tracker shares are settled, when they receive \ndividends or if they leave the business.\nClimate-related matters\nIn the current year, the management team continued to monitor and mitigate any potential deterioration in clients’ \ncredit risk, in particular for a small proportion of the Group’s clients which are exposed to physical and transition \nrisks associated with climate change. No material financial impact or deterioration in our clients’ ability to settle \ntheir debt obligations was identified.\nIn the near future, in line with the Group’s climate change strategy, the management team has plans to establish \ncredit rating/scoring matrix which will help us to assess how our clients address ESG matters within their \norganisations, and whether their policies meet our standards and risk appetite.\n24 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued\nThe capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to owners of the parent of £200.4 million \n(2021: £158.2 million), comprising share capital, share premium, other reserves and retained earnings as disclosed \nin the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and net cash of £65.4 million (2021: £57.5 million), comprising \ncash and cash equivalents less bank overdraft (note 14).\nExcept for compliance with certain bank covenants (note 24(c)), the Group is not subject to any externally imposed \ncapital requirements.\n(b) Foreign currency exchange risk management \nThe Group uses Sterling as its presentation currency. It undertakes transactions in a number of foreign currencies. \nConsequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations do arise. Such exchange rate movements affect the \nGroup’s transactional revenues, cost of sales, the translation of earnings and the net assets/liabilities of its \noverseas operations.\nThe Group is also exposed to foreign currency risks from the value of net investments outside the United Kingdom. \nThe intercompany loans which are treated as net investments in foreign operations are not planned to be settled in \nthe foreseeable future as they are deemed to be a part of the investment. Therefore, exchange differences arising \nfrom the translation of the net investment loans are taken into equity.\nThe Group’s businesses generally raise invoices and incur expenses in their local currencies. Local currency cash \ngenerated is remitted via intercompany transfers to the United Kingdom. The Group generally converts foreign \ncurrency balances into Sterling to manage its cash flows.\nForeign currency sensitivity analysis\nThe Group is mainly exposed to the Euro and the US Dollar. If the Euro or the US Dollar strengthened against \nSterling by a movement of 10%, the anticipated impact on the Group’s results in terms of translational exposure \nwould be an increase in profit before income tax of £6.9 million and £3.4 million (2021: £7.0 million and £3.1 million) \nrespectively, with a similar decrease if the Euro or the US Dollar weakened against Sterling by 10%. \n(c) Liquidity risk management\nThe Group’s treasury function centrally coordinates relationships with banks, manages borrowing requirements, \nforeign exchange needs and cash management. The Group has access to a committed RCF of £50.0 million along \nwith an uncommitted £30.0 million accordion facility in place with HSBC and Citibank, giving the Group an option \nto increase its total borrowings under the facility to £80.0 million. At the year end, £nil (2021: £nil) was drawn down \non these facilities. The Group also has an uncommitted £5.0 million overdraft facility with HSBC of which £0.4 \nmillion was used at the year end.\nThe RCF is subject to certain covenants requiring the Group to maintain financial ratios over interest cover, leverage \nand guarantor cover. The Group complied with these covenants throughout the year.\n(i)\t \u0007Interest cover: interest cover shall not be less than the ratio of 4:1 at any time;\n(ii)\t \u0007Leverage: the ratio of total net debt on the last day of a period to the adjusted EBITDA in respect of that period \nshall not exceed the ratio of 3:1; and\n(iii)\t\u0007Guarantor cover: the aggregate adjusted EBITDA and gross assets of all the guarantor subsidiaries must at all \ntimes represent at least 80% of the adjusted EBITDA and gross assets of the Group as a whole.\nNotes to the financial statements continued\nfor the year ended 30 November 2022\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-237\nP-236\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"

The Group finances its operations \nthrough a mixture of retained profit and the RCF.\nThe Group does not hedge the exposure to variations in interest rates.\nTaking into consideration all variable rate borrowings and bank balances at 30 November 2022, if the interest rate \npayable or receivable moved by 100 basis points in either direction, the effect to the Group would be minimal. 100 \nbasis points was used on the assumption that applicable interest rates are not likely to move by more than this basis \ngiven the pattern of interest rate movements in recent years.\n(f) Interest rate profile of financial assets and liabilities\nAt the reporting date, the Group and the Company did not have any significant financial liabilities exposed to \ninterest rate risk. The only financial assets which accrued interest were cash and cash equivalents (note 14) with \nmaturity of less than a year and were subject to floating interest income.\nInterest Rate Benchmark Reform\nLIBOR was discontinued as a benchmark rate from 31 December 2021 and replaced with Alternative Reference \nRates (ARRs). The adoption of these amendments and the transition to ARRs had an immaterial financial impact on \nSThree’s ability to manage interest rate risk. The implications on the trading results of our segments of IBOR reform \nhave also been assessed and the expected impact is immaterial. \n24 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued\n(ii) Credit rating\nThe Group uses the following categories of internal credit risk rating for financial assets which are subject to \nECLs under the three-stage general approach. These categories reflect the respective credit risk and how the loss \nprovision is determined for each of those categories.\nCategory of internal credit rating\nDefinition of category\nBasis of recognition of ECLs\nPerforming\nClients have a low risk of default and a strong capacity  \nto meet contractual cash flows\n12-month ECLs\nUnderperforming/non-performing\nClients negotiating for new credit terms, default in \nrepayment and other relevant indicators that showed \ncustomers’ deteriorating financial condition\nLifetime ECLs\nNon-performing\nInterest and/or principal payment are 90 days past due\nLifetime ECLs\nWrite-off\nClients with no reasonable expectation of recovery\nAsset is written off\n(iii) Impairment of financial assets\nThe Group applies the simplified approach by using the provision matrix to measure the lifetime ECLs for trade \nreceivables and contract assets.\nAt 30 November 2022, cash and cash equivalents, other receivables and refundable deposits are rated with a \n‘performing’ internal credit rating. The credit risks on bank balances, other receivables and deposits are low as \nthese balances are placed with reputable financial institutions or companies with good collection track records \nwith the Group.\nTo measure the ECLs, the Group considers historical payment patterns and credit characteristics of each client \nand adjusts for forward-looking information such as future prospects of the clients’ core operating industries, the \npolitical and economic environment in which the Group’s clients operate, and other information and factors on the \nclients’ financial condition.\nNotwithstanding the above, the Group evaluates the ECLs on clients in financial difficulties and who have defaulted \non payments separately. These receivables are not secured by any collateral or credit enhancements.\nTrade and other receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a \ndebtor failing to engage in a repayment plan with the Group. Where receivables have been written off, the Group \ncontinues to engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivables due. Where recoveries are made, \nthese are recognised in profit or loss.\nNotes to the financial statements continued\nfor the year ended 30 November 2022\n\t\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022\t\nP-239\nP-238\t\nSThree plc\t\nsthree.com"
