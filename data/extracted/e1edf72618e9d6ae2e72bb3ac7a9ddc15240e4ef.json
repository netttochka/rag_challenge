      "text": "PART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview \nWe are a dermatology therapeutics company developing medications for skin diseases requiring medical intervention. We are primarily \nfocused on developing clinician administered therapies in areas of high unmet need.  Our current product pipeline consists of three product \ncandidates: (i) VP-102, a propriety drug-device combination that contains a GMP-controlled formulation of cantharidin which is being developed \nfor potential use in treating molluscum contagiosum, external genital warts and common warts, (ii) VP-315, an oncolytic peptide-based injectable \ntherapy for the potential treatment of dermatology oncologic conditions, including basal cell carcinoma, and (iii) VP-103, a second cantharidin \nbased drug device combination for the potential treatment of plantar warts.\nOur lead product candidate, VP-102, is initially being developed for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum, or molluscum, a highly \ncontagious and primarily pediatric viral skin disease. There are currently no products approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, \nnor is there an established standard of care for any of these diseases, resulting in significant undertreated populations. Molluscum and common \nwarts are two of the largest unmet needs in dermatology. VP-102 has the potential to be the first FDA-approved product for molluscum and for its \nactive pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, to be characterized as a new chemical entity, or NCE, with the five years of non-patent regulatory \nexclusivity associated with that designation.  We also believe VP-102 has the potential to qualify for pediatric exclusivity in common warts, which \nwould provide for an additional six months of non-patent exclusivity.  In addition, our granted patents and pending patent applications include \nclaims drawn to our cantharidin formulations, applicator devices and related accessories, dosing regimens, methods of preparation including \nmethods of synthesis, and methods of use.\nVP-102 - Treatment of Molluscum\nMolluscum is a highly contagious common skin disease caused by a pox virus that produces multiple raised flesh-colored papules, or skin \nlesions. Molluscum typically presents with 10 to 30 lesions and can present with over 100 lesions. If left untreated, molluscum lesions persist for an \naverage of 13 months, with some cases remaining unresolved for more than two years. The symptoms of molluscum tend to cause considerable \nanxiety, and parents frequently seek treatment due to its highly contagious nature and physical appearance.\nWe estimate approximately 6 million people in the United States have molluscum. Of the 6 million people with molluscum, we estimate that \napproximately 1 million are diagnosed annually.  Molluscum has a 5% to 11% prevalence rate in children with the greatest incidence in individuals \naged one to 14 years old. Accordingly, we estimate this represents a total addressable U.S. market of over $1 billion. We believe that the molluscum \nprevalence rate in the European Union and Asia is at least as high as in the United States.\nCompounded cantharidin has been used for many years by dermatologists to treat molluscum, but it has many limitations. Those limitations \ninclude that it is not FDA-approved, could have highly variable purity, is not readily available and is often not produced in accordance with good \nmanufacturing practices, or GMP. In addition, the formulation and administration of compounded cantharidin is not standardized and is poorly \ncontrolled. Other existing therapies, such as cryotherapy, curettage and laser surgery are also used, but are often painful and may lead to scarring. \nThe potential for scarring and pain makes many of these treatments particularly unsuitable for children. As a result, a significant need exists for a \nclinically proven and FDA-approved treatment for molluscum.\nWe have designed VP-102 to address the significant limitations of current compounded cantharidin formulations, including with respect to \nsafety, purity, efficacy, stability and ease of administration. VP-102 contains the first GMP-controlled formulation of cantharidin with a defined \npharmaceutical batch process and an API that is greater than 99% pure. We believe VP-102 addresses the shortcomings associated with current \ntherapies, including pain and discomfort, potential scarring and inconsistent outcomes, and has the potential to be the first FDA-approved product \nfor the treatment of molluscum.\n4"

      "text": "In January 2019, we reported positive top-line results from our Phase 3 CAMP-1 and CAMP-2 pivotal trials with VP-102 for the treatment of \nmolluscum. Based on the results from these trials, we submitted a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA for VP-102 for the treatment of \nmolluscum in September 2019.  In November 2019, we received notice that the FDA accepted the NDA for filing, with a Prescription Drug User \nFee Act, or PDUFA, goal date of July 13, 2020. In July 2020, we received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA for our NDA. We \nresubmitted our NDA for VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum in December 2020.  In February 2021, we received notice that the FDA accepted \nthe resubmitted NDA for filing, with a PDUFA goal date of June 23, 2021. On May 28, 2021, the FDA extended the PDUFA date to September 23, \n2021 to allow the Agency additional time to review information submitted by Verrica in response to comments from the agency regarding our \nhuman factors study.\nOn September 17, 2021, the FDA issued a CRL regarding our NDA for VP-102.  According to the CRL, the FDA identified deficiencies at a \nfacility of Sterling Pharmaceutical Services, or Sterling, a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, which were unrelated to the manufacturing \nof VP-102 but instead raised general quality issues at the facility, predominately on the septic, or sterile side, of the facility. The FDA did not \nidentify any clinical, safety or product specific CMC deficiencies related to VP-102.  Following the CRL, on September 22, 2021, we received a \nGeneral Advice Letter from the FDA with recommendations to improve VP-102’s user interface. On November 5, 2021, we were notified that the \ninspection of Sterling that had been classified as “voluntary action indicated”, or VAI, was closed and that the VAI classification would not directly \nnegatively impact FDA’s assessment of our NDA regarding Sterling. With the satisfactory resolution of the facility inspection, we resubmitted the \nNDA for the approval of VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum on November 29, 2021.  The resubmission was limited to those sections and \nelements of the NDA that were identified as deficiencies in the CRL issued by the FDA in September 2021. The resubmission addressed the \nsuccessful resolution of inspection deficiencies identified at Sterling in the CRL, as well as the recommendations included in the General Advice \nLetter received from the FDA that relate to VP-102’s user interface.  On December 15, 2021 the FDA accepted our NDA resubmission for VP-102 \nand assigned a PDUFA goal date of May 24, 2022.\nOn May 24, 2022, we announced that we received a CRL regarding our NDA for VP-102 from the FDA. The only deficiency listed in the \nCRL was related to the deficiencies identified at a general reinspection at a facility of Sterling that manufactured the bulk solution used in VP-102.  \nSterling received notice from the FDA on May 19, 2022 that as a result of the inspection, it is on \"official action indicated\", or OAI, status.  This \nclassification resulted from a week-long reinspection of Sterling conducted by the FDA in February 2022 but none of the issues identified by the \nFDA during the reinspection were specific to the manufacture of VP-102.  We were also informed by the FDA that it had completed its review of \nour NDA and product label, there were no open questions on the NDA review, and the VP-102 label was ready to be communicated.  On June 27, \n2022 we held a Type A meeting with the FDA regarding the path forward for the resubmission and potential approval of the NDA for VP-102. \nDuring the Type A meeting the FDA indicated that it could not accept our NDA resubmission with Sterling listed as the primary manufacturer of the \nbulk solution for VP-102 if Sterling was on OAI status at the time of resubmission.  Following the FDA’s commentary, we selected a new CMO \npartner to produce the bulk solution, Piramal Pharma Solutions, and the technology transfer process was completed in January 2023.  On January 23, \n2023 we resubmitted the NDA for VP-102 to the FDA. The FDA accepted our NDA resubmission on February 27, 2023 and assigned a PDUFA \ngoal date of July 23, 2023.\nVP-102 - Treatment of External Genital Warts\nIn addition, we are also developing VP-102 for the treatment of external genital warts, or EGW. EGW is a viral skin disease caused by the \nhuman papilloma virus, or HPV, which forms lesions on the surface of the skin.  An estimated 17% of the approximately 4.1 million patient visits \nfor all types of warts are for the treatment of EGW.  We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the optimal dose regimen, efficacy, safety and \ntolerability of VP-102 in patients with EGW in June 2019.  In November 2020, we announced positive topline results from our Phase 2 clinical trial \nof VP-102 for the treatment of EGW.  An end of Phase 2 meeting was held with the FDA in May 2021.  We intend to initiate a Phase 3 trial of VP-\n102 for the treatment of EGW and to dose the first patient in the second half of 2024.\n5"

      "text": "VP-102 - Treatment of Common Warts\nWe are also developing VP-102 for the treatment of common warts. Common warts typically result in two to five lesions. We estimate \napproximately 22 million people in the United States have common warts and the total addressable U.S. market to be over $1 billion with an \nestimated 2 million patient visits for common warts each year. In the United States, approximately 50% of the patients who seek treatment for \ncommon warts are children, and approximately 25% of common warts patients are treated by pediatricians. We believe that the common wart patient \nopportunity in the European Union and Asia is at least as large as that in the United States. There are currently no FDA-approved products indicated \nfor the treatment of common warts. While common warts can be treated with slow acting, over-the-counter products, the warts tend to be highly \nrefractory and a cause for multiple consultations. We believe that cantharidin’s role as a widely recognized and effective blistering agent for the \ntreatment of skin lesions, coupled with VP-102’s safety and efficacy data in clinical trials for the treatment of molluscum and convenient ease of \nadministration, will allow VP-102 to address many of the shortcomings associated with current therapies. In June 2019, we announced positive \ntopline results from our COVE-1 Phase 2 open label clinical trial of VP-102 for the treatment of common warts. COVE-1 included two cohorts that \nevaluated the safety and efficacy of VP-102 in subjects with up to six warts. \n Based on feedback from the FDA regarding our Phase 3 program in common warts, we are currently evaluating the benefits of conducting \nan additional Phase 2 clinical trial that would be designed to further evaluate the treatment indication, application time, or regimen and long-term \nsustainability. \nVP-315 - Treatment of Dermatological Oncology\nWe are also developing VP-315 for the treatment of dermatological oncology indications. We obtained an exclusive worldwide license from \nLytix BioPharma AS, or Lytix, to develop and commercialize VP-315 for dermatologic oncology indications, including non-metastatic melanoma \nand non-metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, and we intend to focus initially on basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas as the lead indications for \ndevelopment. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of cancer in the U.S., and incidence is rising worldwide. There are approximately 3-4 \nmillion diagnoses of basal cell carcinomas in the U.S. each year, with a high unmet need for new treatment options.  \nThe FDA accepted our IND in November 2021. We dosed the first patient in a Phase 2 trial of VP-315 in Basal Cell Carcinoma, in April \n2022. The Phase 2 trial is a three-part, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, proof-of-concept trial of VP-315 when administered intratumorally \nto adults with biopsy-proven basal cell carcinoma. Part 1 of the trial is designed to evaluate VP-315’s safety profile when administered in escalating \ndoses to individual subjects.  Part 2 is designed to confirm the exploratory dose from Part 1 and identify the recommended dose for Part 3.  Part 3 is \ndesigned to evaluate the efficacy profile of the two selected doses of VP-315 and determine the optimal therapeutic dose.  We enrolled 10 patients in \nPart 1 of the trial.  In Part 1, VP-315 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile with no reported serious adverse events.  We expect to \ninitiate Part 2 of the trial in the second quarter of 2023 and Part 3 of the trial in the second half of 2023.\nVP-103 - Treatment of Plantar Warts\nWe are developing our second cantharidin-based product candidate, VP-103, for the treatment of plantar warts. An estimated one-third of the \napproximately 4.1 million annual patient visits for all types of warts are for the treatment of plantar warts, which are warts located on the bottom of \nthe foot. \nWe are conducting necessary drug development activities for VP-103 and are evaluating when to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial for the \ntreatment of plantar warts. \nWe believe we have the opportunity to expand our proprietary cantharidin formulations for the treatment of additional dermatological \nconditions with high unmet needs.\n6"

      "text": "Phase 3 Clinical Trials—CAMP-1 and CAMP-2\nIn January 2019, we announced positive topline results from our Phase 3 CAMP-1 and CAMP-2 pivotal trials with VP-102 for the treatment of \nmolluscum. The two trials, identical in design, were randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trials of VP-102 for the treatment of \nmolluscum. CAMP-1 was conducted under a SPA with the FDA. The primary objective of the trials was to evaluate the efficacy of dermal application of \nVP-102 relative to placebo in subjects 2 years of age and older with molluscum, when treated once every 21 days for up to four applications, by assessing \nthe proportion of subjects achieving complete clearance of all treatable molluscum lesions at Day 84 (Week 12/End of Study visit). Secondary endpoints \nincluded the proportion of subjects with complete clearance at study visits on Days 21 (Week 3), 42 (Week 6) and 63 (Week 9).\nCAMP-1 and CAMP-2 enrolled 528 subjects in total and were conducted at 31 centers in the United States. Results from CAMP-1 and CAMP-2 \nshowed 46% and 54% of subjects treated with VP-102, respectively, achieved complete clearance of all treatable molluscum lesions at Day 84 versus 18% \nand 13% of subjects in the placebo groups (p<0.0001).  By Day 84, VP-102 treated subjects had a 69% and 83% mean reduction in the number of \nmolluscum lesions, a pre-specified endpoint, in CAMP-1 and CAMP-2, respectively, compared to a 20% increase and a 19% reduction for subjects on \nplacebo.\nConsistent with the results from the Phase 2 clinical trials, VP-102 was also well-tolerated in the Phase 3 trials, with side effects that were primarily \nmild to moderate. The most frequently reported adverse events were application site reactions that are well-known, reversible side effects related to the \nmechanism of action of cantharidin, a blistering agent, which is the active ingredient in VP-102. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events \nreported in CAMP-1 or CAMP-2.\nBased on the results of these trials, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum in September 2019. In November \n2019, we received notice that the FDA accepted the NDA for filing, with a PDUFA goal date of July 13, 2020. In July 2020, we received a CRL, from the \nFDA for our NDA. We resubmitted our NDA for VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum in December 2020.  In February 2021, we received notice that the \nFDA accepted the resubmitted NDA for filing, with a PDUFA goal date of June 23, 2021. On May 28, 2021 the FDA extended the PDUFA date to \nSeptember 23, 2021 to allow the Agency additional time to review information submitted by Verrica in response to comments from the agency regarding \nour human factors study.\nOn September 17, 2021, the FDA issued a CRL regarding our NDA for VP-102.  According to the CRL, the FDA identified deficiencies at a facility \nof Sterling, which were unrelated to the manufacturing of VP-102 but instead raised general quality issues at the facility. The FDA did not identify any \nclinical, safety or product specific CMC deficiencies related to VP-102.  Following the CRL, on September 22, 2021 we received a General Advice Letter \nfrom the FDA with recommendations to improve VP-102’s user interface. On November 5, 2021, we were notified that the inspection of Sterling that had \nbeen classified as “voluntary action indicated”, or VAI, was closed and that the VAI classification would not directly negatively impact FDA’s assessment \nof our NDA regarding Sterling. With the satisfactory resolution of the facility inspection, we resubmitted the NDA for the approval of VP-102 for the \ntreatment of molluscum on November 29, 2021.  The resubmission was limited to those sections and elements of the NDA that were identified as \ndeficiencies in the CRL issued by the FDA in September 2021. The resubmission addressed the successful resolution of inspection deficiencies identified at \nSterling in the CRL, as well as the recommendations included in the General Advice Letter received from the FDA that relate to VP-102’s user interface.  \nOn December 15, 2021 the FDA accepted our NDA resubmission for VP-102 and assigned a PDUFA goal date of May 24, 2022.\nOn May 24, 2022, we announced that we received a CRL regarding our NDA for VP-102 from the FDA. The only deficiency listed in the CRL was \nrelated to the deficiencies identified at a general reinspection at a facility of Sterling that manufactured the bulk solution used in VP-102.  Sterling received \nnotice from the FDA on May 19, 2022 that as a result of the inspection, it was on \"official action indicated\", or OAI, status.  This classification resulted \nfrom a week-long reinspection of Sterling conducted by the FDA in February 2022 but none of the issues identified by the FDA during the reinspection \nwere specific to the manufacture of VP-102.  We were also informed by the FDA that it had completed its review of our NDA and product label, there were \nno open questions on the NDA review, and the VP-102 label was ready to be communicated.  On June 27, 2022 we held a Type A meeting \n10"

During the Type A meeting the FDA \nindicated that it could not accept our NDA resubmission with Sterling listed as the primary manufacturer of the bulk solution for VP-102 if Sterling was on \nOAI status at the time of resubmission.  Following the FDA’s commentary, we selected a new CMO partner to produce the bulk solution, Piramal Pharma \nSolutions, and the technology transfer process was completed in January 2023.  We resubmitted the NDA on January 23, 2023. The FDA accepted our \nNDA resubmission on February 27, 2023 and assigned a PDUFA goal date of July 23, 2023.\nVP-102 for the Treatment of External Genital Warts\nWe are also developing VP-102 for the treatment of EGW. EGW is a viral skin disease caused by HPV which forms lesions on the surface of the \nskin. An estimated 17% of the approximately 4.1 million patient visits for all types of warts are for the treatment of EGW. We believe VP-102 may have the \npotential to offer a safe and effective treatment for EGW because of the shared characteristics with molluscum. We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial \nevaluating the optimal dose regimen, efficacy, safety and tolerability of VP-102 in patients with EGW in June 2019, as summarized in the table below. In \nNovember 2020, we announced positive results from our Phase 2 clinical trial of VP-102 for the treatment of EGW. \nThe Phase 2 trial was comprised of two parts. The primary objective for Part A was to evaluate three regimens of application of VP-102 (2-hour, 6-\nhour, 24-hour duration of skin exposure) in subjects with EGW and identify the two best regimens by assessing safety and tolerability of VP-102 when \nadministered topically after subjects completed a 48-hour assessment. The primary objective for Part B was to evaluate two regimens of application of VP-\n102 in subjects with EGW and identify the regimen with the best risk benefit profile when administered topically once every 21 days for up to 4 \napplications.\nFor the Part A and B intent-to-treat, or ITT, population, statistically significant complete clearance of EGW was observed for both VP-102 treatment \ngroups versus their respective placebo treatment groups by treatment visit 4 and was maintained through Day 84 end of treatment, or EOT. Complete \nclearance of EGW was observed for subjects treated with VP-102 through the Follow-up Study Day 112 and the Day 147, end of study visit, or EOS, but \nthe differences were not statistically significant versus subjects treated with placebo. For all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints analyzed, VP-102 \nwas effective in reducing the number and size of EGW in this subject population, demonstrating statistical significance versus placebo. Efficacy results \nwere comparable between the VP-102 6-hour and VP-102 24-hour treatment groups at Day 84 EOT. However, results of secondary and exploratory \nefficacy analyses demonstrated trends suggesting earlier response and sustained response of the VP-102 24-hour treatment group. Both the VP-102 6-hour \nand VP-102 24-hour treatment groups presented comparable and favorable safety profiles, with most adverse events being local skin responses related to \nthe mechanism of action of cantharidin. The adverse event profile and efficacy demonstrated in this trial support the conclusion that the 24-hour exposure \nregimen represents an acceptable risk benefit profile and the conduct of a larger placebo-controlled Phase 3 study is warranted. \n \n11"

We intend to initiate the Phase 3 trial of \nVP-102 for the treatment of EGW in the second half of 2024. The Phase 3 program (CARE-2) will consist of two identical trials as well as a \npharmacokinetics, or PK study, as required for registration. The trials are designed to be double-blind, randomized and vehicle-controlled to evaluate the \nefficacy and safety of VP-102 in subjects with EGW. The trials utilize a treatment interval of 21 days with a maximum of up to four treatments, which is \nconsistent with the previous Phase 2 trial. We expect approximately 25 sites will be utilized for each of the two trials. We expect approximately 410 \nsubjects will be enrolled in each trial with the goal to have an aggregate of approximately 532 subjects complete the trials.\nWe are designing the PK study to determine any potential systemic exposure to cantharidin from a single 24-hour topical application of VP-102 \nusing Gas Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS).\n VP-102 for the Treatment of Common Warts\nWe are also developing VP-102 for the treatment of common warts. Published studies and clinical use provide support for cantharidin as a safe and \neffective treatment for common warts. We believe that VP-102 has the potential to address many of the shortcomings associated with current therapies, \nincluding pain and discomfort, scarring, and lack of effectiveness. In addition, we believe VP-102’s convenient ease of administration will differentiate it \nfrom existing alternative unapproved therapies.\nWe conducted an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial (COVE-1) to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of VP-102 in subjects with up to six \ncommon warts. In this study, there were two cohorts. Cohort 1 was conducted at a single site with 21 subjects age 2 years and older receiving up to 4 \ntreatments with VP-102 at least 14 days between treatments with longer treatment intervals allowed at the discretion of the investigator depending on a \nspecific subject’s clinical response.  Cohort 2 was conducted at four sites with 35 subjects age 12 years and older receiving up to 4 treatments with VP-102 \nevery 21 days.  Paring of warts, a technique commonly used by dermatologists to prepare the wart for treatment, was allowed in Cohort 2 to remove any \nadherent thick scale from a wart prior to application of VP-102. The primary objective of both cohorts was to evaluate the efficacy of up to 4 dermal \napplications of VP-102 when applied to common warts by assessing the proportion of subjects achieving complete clearance of all treatable warts at Day \n84. Complete clearance of warts at Day 84 for Cohort 1 was observed in 19.0% of subjects, and for Cohort 2 complete clearance was observed in 51.4% of \nsubjects. By Day 84, there was a mean decrease from baseline in the number of warts of 31.2% for Cohort 1 subjects and 53.8% for Cohort 2 subjects. In \nboth cohorts, the most frequently reported adverse events were anticipated application site skin reactions that were primarily mild or moderate in intensity, \nincluding vesicles, pain, erythema, pruritus, scabbing, dryness, edema, and post-inflammatory pigmentation changes. There were no deaths or serious \nadverse events reported, and there were no adverse events leading to trial drug discontinuation.\n \n12"

The FDA accepted our IND in \nNovember 2021.  We dosed the first patient in a Phase 2 trial of VP-315 in Basal Cell Carcinoma in April 2022. The Phase 2 trial is a three-part, open-\nlabel, multicenter, dose-escalation, proof-of-concept trial of VP-315 when administered intratumorally to adults with biopsy-proven basal cell carcinoma. \nPart 1 of the trial is designed to evaluate VP-315’s safety profile when administered in escalating doses to individual subjects.  Part 2 is designed to confirm \nthe exploratory dose from Part 1 and identify the recommended dose for Part 3.  Part 3 is designed to evaluate the efficacy profile of the two selected doses \nof VP-315 and determine the optimal therapeutic dose.  We enrolled 10 patients in Part 1 of the trial.  In Part 1, VP-315 demonstrated a favorable safety \nand tolerability profile with no reported serious adverse events.  We expect to initiate Part 2 of the trial in the second quarter of 2023 and Part 3 of the trial \nin the second half of 2023.\nIn total, the trial is expected to enroll approximately 66 adult subjects with a histological diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma in at least one eligible \ntarget lesion. Both clinical and histological clearance of treated lesion(s) at excision will be assessed\nVP-103 for the Treatment of Plantar Warts\nWe are also developing our second cantharidin-based product candidate, VP-103, for the treatment of plantar warts, which are warts located on the \nbottom of the foot. An estimated one-third of the approximately 4.1 million patient visits for all types of warts are for the treatment of plantar warts. To \ndate, plantar warts have been difficult to treat, as they are refractory and available treatments often lead to both pain and scarring. We are conducting \nnecessary drug development activities for VP-103 and are evaluating when to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of plantar warts.\nManufacturing\nWe do not have any manufacturing facilities. We have been relying on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical \nstudies and clinical trials and will continue to rely on these third parties in the near term for the commercial manufacture of our drug products if they are \napproved during the initial commercial phase. Manufacturing of the API for our product candidates requires a raw material that is derived from a natural \nsource.\n13"

      "text": "To date, we have obtained naturally-sourced cantharidin directly or indirectly from our supplier based in the People’s Republic of China. On July 16, \n2018, we entered into a Supply Agreement, or the Supply Agreement, with Funing County Development Brucea Javanica Professional Cooperatives, or the \nSupplier, pursuant to which the Supplier has agreed to supply naturally-sourced cantharidin to us for a specified fixed price. Pursuant to the Supply \nAgreement, the Supplier has agreed that it will not supply cantharidin, any beetles or other raw material from which cantharidin is derived to any other \ncustomer in North America, subject to specified minimum annual purchase orders and forecasts. \nPursuant to the Supply Agreement, we have provided the Supplier with purchase orders in 2018, 2019, 2021 and 2022 and may submit additional \npurchase orders from time to time, so long as the purchase orders are at least six months prior to the proposed delivery date. As of January 31, 2023, we \nheld inventories of approximately 120,000 finished drug product applicators in various stages of completion and possessed total inventories in a \ncombination of raw cantharidin and converted API adequate to produce over 17 million additional finished drug product applicators in the United States, \nwith additional raw cantharidin already manufactured awaiting shipment. \nThe term of the Supply Agreement is five years and thereafter will be renewed automatically for 12-month periods, unless terminated by either party \nat least 12 months prior to the end of the applicable term. In addition, either party has the right to terminate the Supply Agreement under certain \ncircumstances, including (i) upon a material breach of the Supply Agreement if the breaching party has failed to remedy the breach within 45 days or if the \nbreach is not capable of remedy within 45 days or (ii) the other party becomes insolvent or goes into liquidation. \nOur contract manufacturers and primary packaging vendor are FDA-registered establishments and have a history of supplying products to the \npharmaceutical industry.\nWe have demonstrated capability to successfully manufacture the API the bulk drug intermediate, filled ampules and assembled applicators at our \nproposed commercial batch sizes. Validation activities for the commercial manufacturing and assembly processes have been completed.  Given the nature \nof both the API as well as several of the excipients, special handling will be required to minimize risks to personnel during processing. Analytical testing \nmethods for both the API as well as the finished drug product have been developed and qualified. It is expected that these existing methods will prove \nappropriate for release of commercial product. \nOur proprietary individual applicator and its parts are fabricated using common methods and materials and we currently plan to have our applicators \nbuilt using semi-custom equipment performing well established automated assembly techniques. This equipment has successfully undergone initial \nengineering feasibility evaluations. As part of the proposed resolution to FDA comments in the CRL regarding the human factors validation, we have \ndesigned and developed an accessory to facilitate the preparation of the applicator assembly by the healthcare professional.  The proposed commercial \napplicator assembly and this accessory have successfully undergone both engineering testing as well as evaluation in a simulated clinical setting.\nCommercialization\nWe intend to commercialize VP-102, or any other product candidates that we may successfully develop, in the United States by building a \nspecialized sales organization focused on pediatric dermatologists, dermatologists and select pediatricians. We believe a scientifically oriented, customer-\nfocused team of approximately 50 to 60 sales representatives would allow us to reach the approximately 400 pediatric dermatologists and 9,000 \ndermatologists in the United States with the highest potential for using VP-102. In the future, we may develop and commercialize VP-102 for additional \ngeographic regions, independently or with a strategic partner. For instance, on March 17, 2021, we entered into the Torii Agreement, pursuant to which we \ngranted Torii an exclusive license to develop and commercialize our product candidates that contain a topical formulation of cantharidin for the treatment \nof molluscum contagiosum and common warts in Japan, including VP-102.  Additionally, we granted Torii a right of first negotiation with respect to \nadditional indications for the licensed products and certain additional products for use in the licensed field, in each case in Japan.  \nWe intend to seek drug product reimbursement for VP-102. Based on a survey of 40 physicians that we commissioned, 87% of physicians reported \nthey would use VP-102 if the cost of the drug were covered. Furthermore, we have commissioned market research and met with payor organizations \nrepresenting over 205 million lives. The surveyed payors recognized that there is a significant unmet need for molluscum and a current lack of an effective \ntreatment. Given the unmet need and the results of clinical trials of VP-102 to date, the surveyed payors anticipate the majority of patients would have \naccess to VP-102, if approved, with minimal to no restrictions. \n14"

      "text": "We believe dermatologists tend to be particularly focused on the safety of pharmaceutical products because, while skin diseases can have profound effects \non patients’ quality of life, few are life-threatening. As a result, we believe that dermatologists, as well as their patients, often prefer to use topical \ntreatments when possible to limit the risk of systemic side effects. Dermatologists also tend to place a high level of emphasis on products that are easy to \nuse because they often manage high volumes of patients. We believe this also contributes to a general preference for topical treatments. Finally, in our \nexperience, dermatologists tend to engage with sales and medical affairs personnel from the pharmaceutical industry regarding the scientific evidence \nsupporting dermatology products and the challenges experienced by physicians and patients in the use of these products. Dermatologists often rely on \ntrusted relationships with scientifically oriented, customer-focused sales representatives who can provide them with the necessary information to support \ntheir use of appropriate treatments.\nCompetition\nThe pharmaceutical industry is subject to rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We \nface potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, \ncompounding facilities, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we \nsuccessfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatments and new treatments that may become available in the future.\nThe key competitive factors affecting the success of VP-102, if approved, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, convenience, pricing and stability. With \nrespect to VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum, we will be primarily competing with therapies such as other topical products, curettage, cryotherapy, \nlaser surgery, natural oils, off-label drugs, natural remedies and compounded unstandardized cantharidin. Under Section 503A of the FDCA, if VP-102 is \napproved, compounded topical cantharidin products with the same, similar or an easily substitutable dosage strength would be considered essentially copies \nof VP-102 and may not be compounded regularly or in inordinate amounts, subject to certain limited individual exceptions. These exceptions include if \nthere is a difference between the compounded product and VP-102 that is made for an individual patient, and a prescribing practitioner determines \nproduces a significant difference for that patient. In addition, pursuant to Section 503B of the FDCA, once VP-102 is approved, compounding facilities \nregistered as outsourcing facilities would not be able to compound cantharidin products, unless there is a difference from VP-102 that produces a clinical \ndifference for an individual patient, as determined by a prescribing practitioner. With respect to VP-102 for EGW, we will be competing with cryosurgery, \nlaser surgery, and topical destructive therapies such as trichloroacetic acid. There are also several FDA-approved prescription pharmaceutical therapies for \nEGW including imiquimod, podofilox, and sinecatechins. In addition, EGW are caused by HPV and may be prevented or treated by HPV vaccines that are \nFDA-approved. With respect to VP-102 for common warts and VP-103 for plantar warts, we will primarily be competing with over-the-counter products, \ncryotherapy, curettage, laser surgery, or other off-label therapies. There are currently no FDA-approved prescription pharmaceutical therapies for the \ntreatment of molluscum, common warts, or plantar warts.\nWe are aware of several other product candidates in development as potential treatments for the indications we intend to target.  Novan has \nsubmitted a NDA to the FDA seeking marketing approval for the topical treatment of molluscum contagiosum. There are a number of other companies \ndeveloping products for common warts. In addition, other drugs have been used off label as treatments for molluscum and common warts.  \nA number of other companies are in various stages of developing treatments for basal cell carcinoma. Although surgery is historically the most \ncommon treatment for superficial basal cell carcinoma, several companies are working on non-surgical alternative treatments due to the risk of \ndisfigurement, infection and scarring seen from more invasive treatments. At least three companies are currently conducting trials for superficial basal cell \ncarcinoma and several companies who already have FDA approval to treat more advanced and metastatic cancers, are conducting trials to expand their \nindications to include locally advanced and metastatic basal cell carcinoma. \nIntellectual Property\nIn addition to our five year regulatory exclusivity, the extent of our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain \nproprietary protection for VP-102, including our proprietary cantharidin formulation and applicator and any of our future product candidates, medical \ndevices, synthetic methodologies, novel \n15"

Additionally, we have granted design patents in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, \nSouth Korea and United Kingdom, as well as allowed design patent applications in the United States and Mexico, covering the design of our proprietary \nampule crush tool for use with our VP-102 applicator.\nIn addition, we currently have two United States patents covering methods of preparing and purifying cantharidin. We also have granted patents in \nAustralia, Brazil, China, India, Japan, and Mexico, as well as an allowed patent application in Israel, covering methods of preparing cantharidin. \nAdditionally, we have a granted patent in Japan covering methods of purifying cantharidin.\nAs of February 2, 2023, we have nationalized six international PCT patent applications for utility patents, five of which have been nationalized in \nthe United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, and Mexico, and one of which has been nationalized in the \nUnited States, Europe, and Japan. Five of these European patent applications have been registered in Hong Kong. These patent applications relate to VP-\n102, including our proprietary cantharidin formulation and applicator, and other inventions related to VP-102. Our patent applications related to VP-102 \ninclude proposed claims relating to (i) methods for the synthesis of cantharidin, (ii) our specific formulations and preparations of VP-102, (iii) methods for \npurifying cantharidin, (iv) methods for detecting impurities in cantharidin, (v) the design of our proprietary applicator, including both the general design \nand specific design elements, (vi) claims related to safety features included in the VP-102 formulation, including colorants and bittering agents, and (vii) \nmethods of administration of VP-102 for the treatment of skin lesions. In addition to the foregoing, we currently have one pending international PCT patent \napplication covering our proprietary ampule crush tool for use with our VP-102 applicator. We have also filed a United States design patent covering the \ndesign of our VP-102 applicator, and design patent applications covering the design of the ampule crush tool in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, \nUnited Kingdom, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and the United States. Excluding any patent term adjustment and patent term \nextension, any additional utility patents to issue from these patent applications are projected to expire between 2034 and 2041. Any additional design \npatents to issue from our pending design patent applications will each expire fifteen years from the date of issuance. We cannot provide any assurance as to \nwhether any additional patents will issue from these patent applications or, if any patents do issue, the scope of the claims that will be allowed.\n16"

      "text": "Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal \nterm of patents in the countries, in which they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued from applications in the United States are granted for a term of \n20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent’s term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of the \nUnited States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in examining and issuing the patent, and extended to recapture a portion of the patent \nterm effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period of the drug covered by the patent. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration \nperiod cannot be longer than five years, the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval of the drug, \nand the extension may only apply to one patent that covers the approved drug (and to only those patent claims covering the approved drug or a method for \nusing it). There can be no assurance that any such patent term adjustment or extension will be obtained. The duration of foreign patents varies in \naccordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. However, the actual \nprotection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, \nthe scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and \nenforceability of the patent.\nFurthermore, we rely upon trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We \nseek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and \nconsultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements and/or invention assignment agreements \nwith our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the \ninvention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may \nbe breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently \ndiscovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others \nin their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nLytix License Agreement\nOn August 7, 2020, we entered into the Lytix Agreement, pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-bearing license, with the \nright to sublicense, for certain technology of Lytix to research, develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale, import and \notherwise commercialize VP-315 for use in all malignant and pre-malignant dermatological indications, other than metastatic melanoma and metastatic \nMerkel cell carcinoma. Our right to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient is limited to certain instances, and Lytix is obligated to manufacture \nand supply our clinical and commercial needs for such active pharmaceutical ingredient. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to \ndevelop and to commercialize the product, which development and commercialization will be overseen by a joint steering committee. Lytix has agreed not \nto pursue any products in the field of dermatology other than VP-315 for use in metastatic melanoma and metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. Lytix has \ngranted us an exclusive option to negotiate for an exclusive license for use of the active ingredient in VP-315 in additional dermatological indications.\nIn connection with entering the Lytix Agreement, we made initial payment of $250,000. We made additional payments of $2.25 million in February \n2021 and $1.0 million in May 2022 upon the achievement by Lytix of a regulatory milestone.  Additionally, we are obligated to pay up to $111.0 million \ncontingent on achievement of specified development, regulatory, and sales milestones, and tiered royalties based on worldwide annual net sales ranging in \nthe low double digits to the mid-teens, subject to certain customary reductions. Our obligation to pay royalties expires on a country-by-country and \nproduct-by-product basis on the later of the expiration or abandonment of the last to expire licensed patent covering the active ingredient of VP-315 \nanywhere in the world and expiration of regulatory exclusivity for VP-315 in such country. Additionally, all upfront fees and milestone-based payments \nreceived by us from a sublicensee will be treated as net sales and will be subject to the royalty payment obligations under the Lytix Agreement, and all \nroyalties received by us from a sublicensee shall be shared with Lytix at a rate that is initially 50% but decreases based on the stage of development of VP-\n315 at the time such sublicense is granted.\n17"

Torii paid us $0.5 million to secure the \nexclusive option.  The $0.5 million is included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2020 in the balance sheet.  \nOn March 2, 2021, Torii exercised the exclusive option in the Option Agreement.  On March 17, 2021, we entered into the Torii Agreement with \nTorii, pursuant to which we granted Torii an exclusive license to develop and commercialize our product candidates that contain a topical formulation of \ncantharidin for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum and common warts in Japan, including VP-102.

We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various \nchemistry, manufacturing and controls, preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in \nwhich we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in \nforeign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial \nresources.\nUnited States Government Regulation\nIn the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and \nthe subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and \nfinancial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process or \nafter approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending new drug \napplications, or NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, \ntotal or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal \npenalties.\nThe process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:\n•\ncompletion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or \nGLP, regulations;\n•\nsubmission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;\n•\napproval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;\n•\nperformance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the \nsafety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;\n•\nsubmission to the FDA of an NDA together with payment of the applicable user fee;\n•\nsatisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;\n•\nsatisfactory completion of chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing, an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at \nwhich the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are \nadequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;\n•\nsatisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data; \nand\n•\nFDA review and approval of the NDA.\nVP-102 is designed to be administered to patients via a proprietary applicator by a healthcare professional. In the United States, products composed \nof components that would normally be regulated by different centers at the FDA are known as combination products. Typically, the FDA’s Office of \nCombination Products assigns a combination product to a specific agency center as the lead reviewer. The FDA determines which center will lead a \nproduct’s review based upon the product’s primary mode of action. Depending on the type of combination product, its approval, clearance or licensure may \nusually be obtained through the submission of a single marketing application. VP-102 will be regulated as a drug device combination product, and the FDA \nhas permitted a single regulatory submission seeking approval of VP-102 with the applicator in each indication for which we seek approval.

An applicant will also need to discuss with the agency how to apply certain premarket requirements and \npost-marketing regulatory requirements, including conduct of clinical trials, adverse event reporting and good manufacturing practices, to their combination \nproduct.\nPreclinical Studies\nPreclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety \nand efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available \nclinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An \nIND automatically becomes effective and a clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA \nraises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor \nand the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA \nallowing clinical trials to commence.\nClinical Trials\nClinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in \naccordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their \nparticipation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be \nused in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be \nsubmitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any \nclinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about \ncertain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their \nClinicalTrials.gov website.\nHuman clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially \nintroduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, \ndistribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient \npopulation to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to \ndetermine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically \ndispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the safety and efficacy of the product for \napproval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.\nIn some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials \nafter NDA approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials post approval to gain more information about the drug. \nSuch post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.\nProgress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted, at least annually, to the FDA, and more frequently if serious adverse \nevents occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or \nthe sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an \nunacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in \naccordance with the IRB’s requirements, or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.\n20"

      "text": "Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the \nchemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with \ncGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other \nthings, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging \nmust be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration \nover its shelf life.\nMarketing Approval\nAssuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed \ninformation relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls data and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of \nan NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial \napplication user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from \nthe date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the \ndate the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has sixty days from receipt to make a decision as to whether the application has been accepted for \nfiling.\nIn addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 as amended and reauthored, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain \ndata that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support \ndosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request \nof the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers \nfrom the pediatric data requirements.\nThe FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh \nits risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as \nrestricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools.\nThe FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine \nwhether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In \nthis event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA \naccepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, \namong other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets \nstandards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.\nThe FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including \nclinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under \nwhat conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making \ndecisions.\nBefore approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an \napplication unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure \nconsistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more \nclinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.\nThe testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. \nData obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or \nprevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all.\n21"

      "text": "After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding \nthe manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response \nletter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional \nchemistry, manufacturing and controls documentation, clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with \nsubmission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and \nwhen those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial \nmarketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.\nEven if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or \nprecautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s \nsafety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including \ndistribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of \nthe product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After \napproval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are \nsubject to further testing requirements, post approval submission, and FDA review and approval.\nSpecial Protocol Assessment\nA sponsor may request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial \nprotocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. A SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all \nopen issues must be resolved before the trial begins for a SPA to be approved. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented in a SPA letter or the \nminutes of a meeting between the sponsor and the FDA and made part of the administrative record.\nEven if the FDA agrees to the design, execution and analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under the SPA process, the FDA may revoke or alter \nits agreement under the following circumstances:\n•\npublic health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, or the director of the review division \ndetermines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy has been identified after testing has begun;\n•\na sponsor fails to follow a protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA; or\n•\nthe relevant data, assumptions, or information provided by the sponsor in a request for SPA change, are found to be false statements or \nmisstatements, or are found to omit relevant facts.\nA documented SPA may be modified, and such modification will be deemed binding by the FDA review division, except under the circumstances \ndescribed above, if the FDA and the sponsor agree in writing to modify the protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study. A SPA, \nhowever, does not guarantee that a trial will be successful.\nOrange Book Listing\nIn seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s \nproduct. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with \nTherapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, known as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, seeking \napproval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify, \nfor each patent listed in the Orange Book for the referenced drug, to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the \napplication has been submitted to the FDA, (2) such patent has expired, (3) the date on which such patent expires or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be \ninfringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. The fourth certification described above is known \nas a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification \nand to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement \n22"

This section viii statement does not require notice to the patent holder or NDA owner. There might also be no relevant patent certification.\nIf the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the \nreceipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the \nparagraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. Even if \nthe 45 days expire, a patent infringement lawsuit can be brought and could delay market entry, but it would not extend the FDA-related 30-month stay of \napproval.\nThe ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded \nreference drug has expired. Specifically, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the \nFDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of \nnon-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a New Chemical Entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved \nby FDA in any other NDA. An “active moiety” is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance’s physiological or pharmacologic \naction. During the five-year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any \n505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA’s findings regarding that drug, except that FDA may accept an application for filing \nafter four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification. This exclusivity period may be extended by an additional six months if \ncertain requirements are met to qualify the product for pediatric exclusivity, including the receipt of a written request from the FDA that we conduct certain \npediatric studies, the submission of study reports from such studies to the FDA after receipt of the written request and satisfaction of the conditions \nspecified in the written request.\nPost-Approval Requirements\nDrugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among \nother things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of \nadverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or \nother labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing annual program fee \nrequirements for any marketed products.\nEven if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or \nprecautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be \nconducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or \nimpose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential \nmarket and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or \nsurveillance programs.\nIn addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their \nestablishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance \nwith cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. \nFDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the \nsponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort \nin the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.\n23"

Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, \nincluding adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may \nresult in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new \nsafety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential FDA enforcement actions include, among other \nthings:\n•\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;\n•\nfines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;\n•\nrefusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;\n•\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or\n•\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications \nand in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for \nunapproved indications. Companies may also share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the labeling. The FDA and \nother agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly \npromoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. However, physicians may, in their independent medical judgement, prescribe legally \navailable products for off-label uses.  The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments but the FDA does restrict \nmanufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.  Promotional materials distributed by companies must be submitted to the \nFDA on the date of first use. \nIn addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and state laws that limit the \ndistribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.\nRegulation of Compounding Pharmacies\nCompounding is a practice in which a licensed pharmacist, a licensed physician, or in the case of an outsourcing facility, a person under the \nsupervision of a licensed pharmacist, combines, mixes, or alters ingredients of a drug to create a medication tailored to the needs of an individual patient. \nAlthough we are not engaged in compounding, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our product candidate VP-102 has historically been used in the \ncompounding of topical pharmaceutical products, and we could be subject to competition by compounders upon approval of VP-102, subject to the \nrequirements set forth in Sections 503A and 503B of the FDCA.\nSection 503A of the FDCA exempts licensed pharmacists or licensed physicians who compound products for identified, individual patients, based \non the receipt of a valid prescription order, from the FDCA’s new drug approval requirements, cGMP requirements, and the requirement to label products \nwith adequate directions for use, provided certain conditions are met. These conditions include that the pharmacist or physician does not compound \nregularly or in inordinate amounts any drug product that is essentially a copy of a commercially available drug product, unless there is a difference between \nthe compounded product and the commercially available product that is made for an individual patient, and which the prescribing practitioner determines \nproduces a significant difference for that patient. The FDA has interpreted this prohibition to mean that the compounding of a product with the same active \npharmaceutical ingredient as a commercially available drug, that has the same, similar, or an easily substitutable dosage strength as the commercially \navailable drug, and that can be used by the same route of administration as the commercially available drug, cannot be conducted under Section 503A \nusually, very often, or at regular times or intervals, or more frequently or in larger quantities than needed to address unanticipated emergency circumstance, \nunless the limited exception described above applies.\n24"

      "text": "In addition, compounding under Section 503A may only use bulk drug substances that appear on a list issued by FDA through regulations, and/or \nthat comply with certain other conditions specified in the statute.\nUnlike Section 503A, Section 503B of the FDCA allows certain entities to compound drugs that are not necessarily prepared in response to \nprescriptions for identified, individual patients. Such facilities must register with the FDA as outsourcing facilities, and once registered (including payment \nof a fee), the outsourcing facility must meet certain conditions in order to be exempt from the FDCA’s approval requirements and the requirement to label \nproducts with adequate directions for use. Under Section 503B, a drug must be compounded in compliance with cGMP, by or under the direct supervision \nof a licensed pharmacist in order to be so exempt. The outsourcing facility must also report specific information about the products that it compounds, \nincluding a list of all of the products it compounded during the previous six months, and information about the compounded products, such as the source of \nthe active ingredients used to compound pursuant to Section 503B(b)(2). If the outsourcing facility compounds using bulk drug substances, the bulk drug \nsubstances must either appear on a list established by the FDA of bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need or be used to compound drugs that \nappear on a list established by the FDA of drugs for which there is a shortage. Although the FDA has not yet established a list of bulk drug substances for \nwhich there is a clinical need, the FDA has announced an interim policy pursuant to which bulk drug substances may be nominated for inclusion on such \nlist and, provided certain conditions are met, outsourcing facilities may compound with such bulk drug substances pending evaluation of the substances for \ninclusion on the FDA’s list of bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need. Cantharidin is currently listed among those nominated substances for \nwhich bulk drug substance may be used in compounding by outsourcing facilities pending FDA’s evaluation. In March 2019, the FDA issued Guidance for \nIndustry addressing the criteria by which the FDA intends to evaluate whether there exists a clinical need for compounding with a bulk drug substance, \nincluding, in the case of a bulk drug substance that is a component of an FDA-approved drug, an evaluation of whether there exists an attribute of the \napproved drug that makes it medically unsuitable to treat certain patients; whether the drug product proposed to be compounded is intended to address that \nattribute; and whether the drug product proposed to be compounded must be compounded from a bulk drug substance rather than from the finished, FDA-\napproved drug product. As FDA has implemented these criteria as in the final Guidance for Industry, and if VP-102 is approved, an outsourcing facility \nwould need to satisfy these criteria before being permitted to compound a cantharidin product using bulk cantharidin.\nIn addition, an outsourcing facility must meet other conditions described in Section 503B, including reporting adverse events and labeling \ncompounded products with certain information. Registered outsourcing facilities are prohibited from selling compounded drugs through a wholesale \ndistributor, or from compounding drugs that are essentially copies of FDA-approved drugs. A drug is “essentially a copy of an approved drug” if it is \nidentical or nearly identical to an approved drug, which the FDA has interpreted to mean that it has the same active ingredient(s), route of administration, \ndosage form, dosage strength and excipients as the approved drug, or if it has the same active ingredient as an approved drug and there is not a change from \nthe approved drug that produces a clinical difference for an individual patient, as determined by the prescribing practitioner. Registered outsourcing \nfacilities are subject to FDA inspection, and FDA conducts inspections on a risk-based frequency under Section 503B(b)(4) of the FDCA.\nFederal and State Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations\nIn addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices \nin the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our current and future business operations, including our clinical research \nactivities, and proposed sales, marketing and education programs and constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare \nproviders and other parties through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. These laws include anti-\nkickback and false claims laws and regulations, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those laws \ndescribed below.\n25"

The \nterm “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to \narrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and other individuals and entities on \nthe other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the \nexceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance to offer protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to \nbe intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.\nIn addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a \nviolation. Further, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute \nconstitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act and the civil monetary penalties statute.\nThe federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from \nknowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made \nor used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money \nor property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly \nproviding free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been \nprosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among \nother things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party \npayors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in \nconnection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

HITECH also created new tiers of civil \nmonetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new \nauthority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing \nfederal civil actions.\nThe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is \navailable under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, \noptometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), teaching hospitals, and other health care professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), as \nwell as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.\n26"

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible \nthat some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude \nthat our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare \nlaws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may \nbe subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participating in \ngovernment funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a \ncorporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm and \nthe curtailment or restructuring of our operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign \nlaws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and \nimplementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.\nCoverage and Reimbursement\nMarket acceptance and sales of any drug products depend in part on coverage and the extent to which adequate reimbursement for drug products \nwill be available from third-party payors, including government health administration authorities, managed care organizations and other private health \ninsurers. Coverage and reimbursement for our product also depends on coverage and adequate reimbursement for the procedures using VP-102 for the \ntreatment of molluscum, external genital warts, and/or common warts. Obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products may be \nparticularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. Separate reimbursement for \nthe product itself or the treatment or procedure in which our product is used may not be available. Even if the procedure using our product is covered, third-\nparty payors may package the cost of the drug into the procedure payment and not separately reimburse the physician for the costs associated with our \nproduct. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover or separately reimburse for our products could reduce physician utilization of our products once \napproved. Additionally, in the United States, there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement among third-party payors. Third-party payors often \nrely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the \nextent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided is made on a payor-by-payor basis. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a \ndrug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement.\nThird-party payors determine which medical procedures they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Even if a third-party payor covers a \nparticular procedure, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate. Patients who are treated in-office for a medical condition generally \nrely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with the procedure and may be unwilling to undergo such procedures for the \ntreatment of molluscum, external genital warts, and/or common warts in the absence of such coverage and adequate reimbursement.\nReimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that a procedure is \nsafe, effective, and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; supported by peer-reviewed medical journals; included in \nclinical practice guidelines; and neither cosmetic, experimental, nor investigational.\n27"

      "text": "Further, from time to time, typically on an annual basis, payment rates are updated and revised by third-party payors. Such updates could impact the \ndemand for our product candidates, to the extent that customers who are prescribed our product candidates, if approved, are not separately reimbursed for \nthe cost of the product candidates. An example of payment updates is the Medicare program updates to physician payments, which is done on an annual \nbasis. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nImpact of Healthcare Reform on our Business\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed \nchanges regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of drug product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval \nactivities, and affect the profitable sale of drug product candidates. \nAmong policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with \nthe stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a \nparticular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, was passed, which substantially changed \nthe way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among \nother things: (i) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate \nprogram to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; (ii) established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or \nimports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some \ngovernment healthcare programs; (iii) expanded the availability of lower pricing under the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the \nprogram; (iv) increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13% of the \naverage manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the \nAverage Manufacturer Price, or AMP; (v) expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid \ncoverage to additional individuals, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability; (vi) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes \nResearch Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and (vii) \nestablished a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and \nMedicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. \nThere have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court \ndismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by \nCongress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, there have been a number of health reform initiatives by the Biden \nadministration that have impacted the ACA. For example, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into \nlaw, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year \n2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum \nout-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in \nthe future.  It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare \npayments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013, and due to subsequent legislative \namendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect until 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, \nthe actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, \nPresident Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a \ndrug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024.

      "text": "2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the \nstatute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional \nreductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have an adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, \naccordingly, our financial operations.\nAdditionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of \nprescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders and proposed and \nenacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing \nand manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, for example, in July \n2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at \nprescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS released a \nComprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies \nthat Congress could pursue to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (1) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-\nsource drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (2) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that \noutpace inflation. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. These \nprovisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. . It is currently unclear how the IRA \nwill be effectuated but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional \nexecutive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report within 90 days on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be \nfurther leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly \npassing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient \nreimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, \ndesigned to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. \nEmployees and Human Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 22 full-time employees. All of our employees are located in the United States. None of our employees is \nrepresented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product \ncandidates, obtaining regulatory approval, and manufacturing, marketing and selling any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval, \nas well as discovering and developing additional product candidates. We are only in the preliminary stages of most of these activities. We may never \nsucceed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenue that is significant enough to achieve profitability.\nIn cases where we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval to market one or more of our product candidates, our revenue will be dependent, \nin part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval, the accepted price for the product, the ability to obtain \ncoverage and reimbursement, and whether we own the commercial rights for that territory. If the number of our addressable patients is not as significant as \nwe estimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect, or the treatment population is narrowed by competition, \nphysician choice or treatment guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of such products, even if approved.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of \nexpenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. If we are required by regulatory authorities to perform studies in addition to those expected, \nor if there are any delays in the initiation and completion of our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates, our expenses could \nincrease.\nEven if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and \nremain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our development \nefforts, obtain product approvals, diversify our offerings or continue our operations.\n33"

VP-102 is our only product candidate for which we have completed clinical trials.

In addition to developing VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum, we are also developing VP-102 as a treatment for external \ngenital warts and common warts. We also plan to develop VP-315 for the treatment of dermatological oncology indications, including basal cell carcinoma \nand squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, we plan to develop our second cantharidin-based product candidate, VP-103, for the treatment of plantar warts. \nWe have not completed the development and regulatory approval process of any product candidates and we may never be able to develop marketable \nproducts. We have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our cantharidin formula and VP-102 for the \ntreatment of molluscum, external genital warts and common warts. Our ability to generate revenue from our product candidates, will depend heavily on \ntheir successful development, regulatory approval and eventual commercialization of these product candidates. The success of VP-102, VP-315 and VP-\n103 or any other product candidates that we develop or otherwise may acquire will depend on several factors, including:\n•\ntimely and successful completion of preclinical studies and our clinical trials;\n•\nsuccessful development of, or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers for, our commercial manufacturing processes for any of \nour product candidates that receive regulatory approval;\n•\nreceipt of timely marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n•\nlaunching commercial sales of products, if approved;\n•\nacceptance of our products, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors, for their approved indications;\n•\nour success in educating physicians and patients about the benefits, administration and use of VP-102 or any other product candidates, if \napproved;\n•\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse events experienced with VP-102 or our other product candidates;\n•\nthe availability, perceived advantages, cost, safety and efficacy of alternative treatments for molluscum, external genital warts and/or \ncommon warts or any other indications which we may pursue for VP-102 or any other product candidates;\n•\nour ability to produce VP-102 or any other product candidates on a commercial scale;\n•\nobtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates and otherwise \nprotecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n•\nmaintaining compliance with regulatory requirements, including current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs;\n•\ncompeting effectively with other procedures; and\n•\nmaintaining a continued acceptable safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of the products following approval.\nWhether regulatory approval will be granted is unpredictable and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the \nregulatory authorities. Our product candidates’ success in clinical trials is not guaranteed, and even if clinical trials are successful, it will not guarantee \nregulatory approval. Following submission of an NDA, it may not be accepted for substantive review, or even if it is accepted for substantive review, the \nFDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require that we conduct additional studies or clinical trials, provide additional data, take \nadditional manufacturing steps, or require other conditions before they will reconsider or approve our application. If the FDA or other comparable foreign \nregulatory authorities require additional studies, clinical trials or data, we would incur increased costs and delays in the marketing approval process, which \nmay require us to expend more resources than we have available.

If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or \nat all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, which would harm our business.\nClinical product development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs or experience delays \nin completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nThe risk of failure for product candidates is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in \nhumans or will receive regulatory approval. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must \ncomplete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. \nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is inherently uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one \nor more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing or at any time during the trial process. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials \nmay not be predictive of the results of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical \nand clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed \nsatisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.\nWe cannot assure you that any clinical trial that we have conducted, are currently conducting, or may conduct in the future, will demonstrate \nconsistent or adequate efficacy and safety to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates.\nWe may experience delays in ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates, and we do not know whether future clinical trials, if any, will begin \non time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. For example, following the initiation of \nour Phase 2 trial of VP-102 for the treatment of common warts, we discovered the need to amend the treatment regimen of the protocol in order to \nintroduce greater flexibility of the treatment interval. We amended the trial protocol in order to add a second cohort to the trial with the desired treatment \nfrequency. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during or as a result of clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive \nmarketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n•\nregulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a \nprospective trial site;\n•\nwe may experience delays in reaching, or failing to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with \nprospective trial sites or prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and \nmay vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n•\nclinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, including failure to demonstrate statistical significance, \nand we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n•\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials \nmay be slower than we anticipate, or participants may drop out of these clinical trials or fail to return for post-treatment follow-up at a higher \nrate than we anticipate;\n•\nour product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators or \ninstitutional review boards to suspend or terminate the trials;\n•\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or \nat all;\n37"

Such authorities may impose such a \nsuspension or termination due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our \nclinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical \nhold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product, changes in governmental regulations or \nadministrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. If we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical \ntrial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any \nof these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product \ncandidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may \nharm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or \ncompletion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are required to conduct additional \nclinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials \nof our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not favorable or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n•\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n•\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n•\nobtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n•\nobtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n•\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n•\nhave the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any of our \npreclinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical \nstudy or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow \nour competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize, or receive approval for, our product \ncandidates. For example, if a competitor obtained FDA approval for a product containing cantharidin before we are able to obtain approval for our product, \nthis could result in the approval of our product being delayed until the expiration of any NCE exclusivity or other regulatory exclusivity received by such \ncompetitor.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment and/or maintenance of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals \ncould be delayed or prevented.\nSuccessful and timely completion of clinical trials will require that we enroll a sufficient number of patients. Patient enrollment, a significant factor \nin the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population.

For example, parents may be reluctant to enroll their children in our clinical trials that have a relatively high risk of \ntheir child being assigned to placebo when in the alternative, they could decline participation, and receive compounded cantharidin outside of the clinical \ntrial, if available, or pursue other alternative therapies. Enrollment delays in these clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product \ncandidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Furthermore, we rely on and expect \nto continue to rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and we will have limited influence over \ntheir performance.\nFurthermore, even if we are able to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials, we may have difficulty maintaining patients in our \nclinical trials.\nSuccess in preclinical studies or earlier clinical trials may not be indicative of results in future clinical trials.\nSuccess in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate the same results or otherwise provide \nadequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a product candidate. Preclinical tests and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials are primarily designed \nto test safety, to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and to understand the side effects of product candidates at various doses and schedules. \nSuccess in preclinical or animal studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later large-scale efficacy trials will be successful, nor does it predict \nfinal results.

The FDA or an institutional review board may also require that we suspend, discontinue, or limit our clinical trials based on \nsafety information, or that we conduct additional animal or human studies regarding the safety and efficacy of our product candidates which we have not \nplanned or anticipated. Such findings could further result in regulatory authorities failing to provide marketing authorization for our product candidates or \nlimiting the scope of the approved indication, if approved.

We may not be able to identify or \ndevelop product candidates that are safe, tolerable and effective. Even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, the potential product \ncandidates that we identify, in-license or acquire may not be suitable for clinical development, including as a result of being shown to have harmful side \neffects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance.\n41"

As such, we are currently primarily focused on the development, and potential future commercialization, of VP-102 for the treatment \nof molluscum, as well as the development of VP-315 for the potential treatment of basal cell carcinoma.  As a result, we may forego pursuit of \nopportunities with other product candidates, or we may delay the development of other indications for VP-102 and for VP-103 that may later prove to have \ngreater commercial potential.  Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market \nopportunities. Our spending on current and future development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially \nviable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable \nrights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for \nus to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. If we are \nnot able to obtain required regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval or other marketing authorizations by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically \ntakes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory \nauthorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a \nproduct candidate’s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have not obtained regulatory approval for VP-102 or any product \ncandidate and it is possible that neither VP-102 nor any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. \nNeither we nor any future collaborator is permitted to market VP-102 or any future drug product candidates in the United States until we receive regulatory \napproval of an NDA from the FDA. To date, we have not met or discussed with the European Medicines Agency or any other comparable foreign authority \nregarding regulatory approval for VP-102 or any other product candidate outside of the United States.\nPrior to obtaining approval to commercialize VP-102 and any other drug product candidate in the United States or abroad, we must demonstrate \nwith substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, that such product candidates \nare safe and effective for their intended uses. Results from nonclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the \nnonclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory \nauthorities. The FDA may also require us to conduct additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates either prior to or after \napproval, or it may object to elements of our clinical development program.\nOf the large number of products in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or foreign regulatory approval processes \nand are commercialized. The lengthy approval or marketing authorization process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in \nour failing to obtain regulatory approval or marketing authorization to market our product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, \nfinancial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our time and financial resources in the development of VP-102. Our business is dependent on our ability to \nsuccessfully complete preclinical and clinical development of, obtain regulatory approval for, and, if approved, successfully commercialize VP-102 and \nany future product candidates in a timely manner.\n42"

The FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency also may approve or authorize for \nmarketing a product candidate for a more limited indication or patient population that we originally request, and the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory \nagency may not approve or authorize the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of a product candidate. Any \ndelay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval or other marketing authorization would delay or prevent commercialization of that \nproduct candidate and would materially adversely impact our business and prospects.\nIn addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities may change their policies, issue additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take \nother actions, which may prevent or delay approval of our future products under development on a timely basis. Such policy or regulatory changes could \nimpose additional requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain approvals, increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain \nany marketing authorizations we may have obtained.\nFurthermore, even if we obtain regulatory approval for VP-102 and any future product candidates, we will still need to develop a commercial \norganization, establish a commercially viable pricing structure and obtain approval for adequate reimbursement from third-party and government payors. If \nwe are unable to successfully commercialize VP-102 and any future product candidates, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our \nbusiness.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nIn light of our receipt of a CRL from the FDA regarding our NDA for VP-102, the timing for VP-102 approval is uncertain, and we may never obtain \nregulatory approval in the United States.\nIn November 2021, we resubmitted an NDA to the FDA for VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum. On May 24, 2022, we announced that we \nreceived a CRL from the FDA as a direct result of deficiencies identified by the FDA during a general reinspection of our CMO, Sterling. As a result, the \napproval of our NDA for VP-102 has been delayed and may never occur.\nOn June 27, 2022, we held a Type A meeting with the FDA to discuss the resubmission and potential approval of the NDA. During the Type A \nmeeting the FDA indicated that it could not accept our NDA resubmission with Sterling listed as the primary manufacturer of the bulk solution for VP-102 \nif Sterling was on OAI status at the time of resubmission. Following the FDA’s commentary, we selected a new CMO partner to produce the bulk solution, \nPiramal Pharma Solutions, and the technology transfer process was completed in January 2023. On January 23, 2023 we resubmitted the NDA for VP-102 \nto the FDA. The FDA accepted our NDA resubmission on February 27, 2023 and assigned a PDUFA goal date of July 23, 2023.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of any interactions with the FDA. Nor can we guarantee when, or if, we will be successful in receiving regulatory \napproval for VP-102. If we do not obtain approval for VP-102 or are delayed in obtaining such approval, it would have a material adverse effect on our \noperations and financial condition.\nEven if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, it may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-\nparty payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nIf any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, it may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, \nthird-party payors and others in the medical community. If our product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate \nsignificant revenue and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will \ndepend on a number of factors, including:\n•\nthe efficacy, safety and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments, including for VP-102, compared to compounded cantharidin;\n•\nour ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices;\n43"

To achieve commercial success for VP-102 and any other product candidate for which we may \nobtain marketing approval, we will need to establish a sales and marketing organization. In the future, we expect to build a focused sales and marketing \ninfrastructure to market or co-promote some of our product candidates in the United States, if and when they are approved. There are risks involved with \nestablishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and \ncould delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is \ndelayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses.

In \naddition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute our product candidates or may be unable to \ndo so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources \nand attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own \nor in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\n44"

      "text": "We face substantial competition, including from compounded cantharidin products that may compete with VP-102 and any other product candidates, \nwhich may result in a smaller than expected commercial opportunity and/or others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more \nsuccessfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates \nand will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from many different sources, \nincluding major pharmaceutical and specialty pharmaceutical companies, compounding facilities, academic institutions and governmental agencies and \npublic and private research institutions.\nWe are aware of several other product candidates in earlier stages of development as potential treatments for the indications we intend to target. \nNovan has submitted a NDA to the FDA seeking marketing approval for the topical treatment of molluscum contagiosum. There are a number of other \ncompanies developing products for common warts. In addition, other drugs have been and may continue to be used off label as treatment for molluscum, \nexternal genital warts, common warts, and plantar warts, and there are other existing alternative therapies such as curettage or cryotherapy.\nCurrently some of the market demand for cantharidin may be satisfied by compounding pharmacies and registered outsourcing facilities regulated \nunder Sections 503A and 503B of the FDCA. If we receive approval for VP-102, any compounding by licensed pharmacists or licensed physicians under \nSection 503A would not be legally permitted to include, regularly or in inordinate amounts, the compounding of any drug that is essentially a copy of VP-\n102. The FDA has announced that it intends to consider a compounded drug product to be essentially a copy of a commercially available drug under \nSection 503A if it has the same API, has the same, similar, or an easily substitutable dosage strength, and can be used by the same route of administration. \nHowever, a compounded product would not be considered essentially a copy of VP-102, and could be compounded under Section 503A, if there were a \ndifference between the compounded product and VP-102 that was made for an individual patient, and which the prescribing practitioner determines \nproduces a significant difference for that patient. Similarly, any compounding by outsourcing facilities under Section 503B would not be legally permitted \nto include the compounding of a drug that is essentially a copy of VP-102, if approved, where the compounded drug would be considered essentially a copy \nif it were identical or nearly identical to VP-102 (which the FDA has interpreted to mean that it has the same active ingredient(s), route of administration, \ndosage form, dosage strength and excipients as the approved drug), or if it contains the active ingredient in VP-102 (cantharidin), unless there is a change \nfrom the approved drug that produces a clinical difference for an individual patient as determined by the prescribing practitioner.\nCompounding pharmacies and registered outsourcing facilities may therefore be permitted to compound cantharidin drug products, even if we \nreceive approval for VP-102, if a prescribing practitioner determines that a compounded product prescribed for a specific patient features a change from \nVP-102 that produces a significant difference for the patient (under Section 503A), or if a prescribing practitioner determines that a compounded \ncantharidin product features a change from VP-102 that produces a clinical difference for the patient (under Section 503B). Physicians may determine that \nsuch differences exist for some or all of their patients and may choose to prescribe compounded cantharidin products for such patients. Moreover, under \nSection 503B, outsourcing facilities are not limited to compounding in response to prescriptions for identified, individual patients, and could compound \nusing bulk cantharidin provided cantharidin appears on a list established by the FDA of bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need or satisfies \ncertain other limited conditions. Although the FDA has not yet established a list of bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need, the FDA has \nannounced an interim policy pursuant to which bulk drug substances may be nominated for inclusion on such list and, provided certain conditions are met, \noutsourcing facilities may compound with such bulk drug substances pending evaluation of the substances for inclusion on the FDA’s list of bulk drug \nsubstances for which there is a clinical need. Cantharidin is currently listed among those nominated substances for which bulk drug substance may be used \nin compounding by outsourcing facilities pending FDA’s evaluation.\nIn March 2019, the FDA issued Guidance for Industry addressing the criteria by which the FDA intends to evaluate whether there exists a clinical \nneed for compounding with a bulk drug substance, including, in the case of a bulk drug substance that is a component of an FDA-approved drug, an \nevaluation of whether there exists an attribute of the approved drug that makes it medically unsuitable to treat certain patients; whether the drug product \nproposed to be compounded is intended to address that attribute; and whether the drug product proposed to be compounded \n45"

If the FDA implements these criteria as in the \nGuidance for Industry, and if VP-102 is approved, an outsourcing facility may be permitted to compound a cantharidin product using bulk cantharidin \nnotwithstanding our approval provided it satisfies these and other criteria set forth in the FDA’s guidance.\nIn addition, the FDA may, in its enforcement discretion, not prioritize enforcement of the restrictions under Sections 503A and 503B on \ncompounding drugs that are essentially copies of VP-102, if approved, in which case compounded drug product that is essentially a copy of VP-102 could \nbe made available to physicians and their patients. In the event compounders are authorized to continue to compound cantharidin products following \napproval of VP-102, if approved, we could be subject to significant competition.\nIn addition, our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more \neffective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than VP-102 or any other product that we may develop. Our \ncompetitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our product, which could \nresult in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or, if a competitor obtained FDA approval for a \nproduct containing cantharidin before we are able to obtain approval for our product, could result in the approval of our product being delayed until the \nexpiration of any NCE exclusivity or other regulatory exclusivity received by such competitor.\nMany of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial \nresources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and \nmarketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources \nbeing concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly \nthrough collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified \nscientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies \ncomplementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.\nWe intend to seek NCE exclusivity and/or pediatric exclusivity for VP-102 and future product candidates, and we may be unsuccessful.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to seek NCE exclusivity for VP-102 or future product candidates. In the United States, a pharmaceutical \nmanufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of an NCE which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not \nbeen approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An “active moiety” is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance’s physiological or \npharmacologic action. During the five-year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that \ndrug or any 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA’s findings regarding that drug, except that FDA may accept an \napplication for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification. This exclusivity period may be extended by an \nadditional six months if certain requirements are met to qualify the product for pediatric exclusivity, including the receipt of a written request from the FDA \nthat we conduct certain pediatric studies, the submission of study reports from such studies to the FDA after receipt of the written request and satisfaction \nof the conditions specified in the written request. We believe that cantharidin constitutes an NCE, such that VP-102 should, if approved, be eligible for \nNCE exclusivity and that our planned clinical trials will qualify VP-102 for pediatric exclusivity if a written request from the FDA is received. However, \nthere can be no guarantee that we will successfully obtain such exclusivity, and if any of our competitors obtains FDA approval of an NDA for a \ncantharidin drug product before we do, they, and not us, may be eligible for NCE exclusivity. If we do not obtain NCE exclusivity for VP-102, or if a \ncompetitor obtains NCE exclusivity for a cantharidin product before we receive approval of an NDA for VP-102, our ability to commence sales and \ngenerate revenue would be adversely affected.\nMoreover, even if we obtain NCE exclusivity and/or pediatric exclusivity for VP-102, such exclusivity would not block the sale of compounded \ncantharidin products in those situations where compounding would be permitted under Sections 503A or 503B of the FDCA.\n46"

      "text": "The success of VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum, external genital warts and common warts will depend significantly on coverage and adequate \nreimbursement or the willingness of patients to pay for these procedures.\nWe believe our success depends on continued coverage and adequate reimbursement for procedures using VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum, \nexternal genital warts and/or common warts or, in the absence of coverage and adequate reimbursement, on the extent to which patients will be willing to \npay out of pocket for such procedures. Obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher \nprices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. Separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or \nprocedure in which our product is used may not be available. Even if the procedure using our product is covered, third-party payors may package the cost \nof the drug into the procedure payment and not separately reimburse the physician for the costs associated with our product. A decision by a third-party \npayor not to cover or separately reimburse for our products could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved. Additionally, in the United \nStates, there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement among third-party payors. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy \nand payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of \nreimbursement to be provided is made on a payor-by-payor basis. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that \nother payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement.\nThird-party payors determine which medical procedures they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Even if a third-party payor covers a \nparticular procedure, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate. Patients who are treated in-office for a medical condition generally \nrely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with the procedure and may be unwilling to undergo such procedures for the \ntreatment of molluscum, external genital warts and/or common warts in the absence of such coverage and adequate reimbursement. Physicians may be \nunlikely to offer procedures for such treatment if they are not covered by insurance and may be unlikely to purchase and use our product candidates, if \napproved, for molluscum, external genital warts and/or common warts unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate.\nReimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that a procedure is \nsafe, effective and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; supported by peer-reviewed medical journals; included in \nclinical practice guidelines; and neither cosmetic, experimental, nor investigational.\nFurther, from time to time, typically on an annual basis, payment rates are updated and revised by third-party payors. Such updates could impact the \ndemand for our product candidates, to the extent that patients who are prescribed our product candidates, if approved, are not separately reimbursed for the \ncost of the product candidates. An example of payment updates is the Medicare program updates to physician payments, which is done on an annual basis. \nIn the past, when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions. The Medicare \nAccess and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, ended the use of the statutory formula and also referred to as the Sustainable Growth Rate, for \ncertain payment and established a quality payment incentive program, also referred to as the Quality Payment Program. This program provides clinicians \nwith two ways to participate, including through the Advanced Alternative Payment Models, or APMs and the Merit-based Incentive Payment System, or \nMIPS. In November 2019, CMS issued a final rule finalizing the changes to the Quality Payment Program. At this time, it is unclear how the introduction \nof the Quality Payment Program will impact overall physician reimbursement under the Medicare program. Any resulting decrease in payment under the \nmerit-based reimbursement system may adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. In addition, the Medicare physician fee schedule has been \nadapted by some private payors into their plan-specific physician payment schedule. We cannot predict how pending and future healthcare legislation will \nimpact our business, and any changes in coverage and reimbursement that further restricts coverage of our product candidates or lowers reimbursement for \nprocedures using our products could harm our business.\nForeign governments also have their own healthcare reimbursement systems, which vary significantly by country and region, and we cannot be sure \nthat coverage and adequate reimbursement will be made available with respect to the treatments in which our products are used under any foreign \nreimbursement system.\nThere can be no assurance that VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum, external genital warts and/or common warts, if approved for sale in the \nUnited States or in other countries, will be considered medically reasonable and \n47"

If VP-102 is approved for any of these indications, individuals may continue to decline treatment for molluscum, \nexternal genital warts and/or common warts as, if left untreated, these skin diseases will eventually be resolved by the body’s immune system.\nIn addition, our estimates of the potential market opportunity for VP-102 and any other product candidates include several key assumptions based on\nour industry knowledge, industry publications, third-party research reports and surveys of dermatologists commissioned by us. These assumptions include \nthe prevalence of molluscum, external genital warts, common warts and other skin diseases as well as the estimated reimbursement levels for VP-102, if \napproved. However, there can be no assurance that any of these assumptions are, or will remain, accurate. Furthermore, even if our estimates relating to the \nprevalence of molluscum, external genital warts, common warts and other skin diseases as well as the estimated reimbursement levels for VP-102, if \napproved, are accurate, the degree of market acceptance by the medical community and those infected by such skin diseases following regulatory approval, \nif any, could impact our assumptions and reduce the market size for VP-102 in molluscum, external genital warts, common warts or any other indication. \nFor example, if VP-102 is approved for molluscum, external genital warts or common warts, there can be no assurance that the medical community will \nprescribe VP-102 for patients over current forms of available alternative therapies. Furthermore, the market research study we commissioned surveying \npayor organizations has no bearing on the payors, and any assumptions or interpretations based on the results of this study, may ultimately be inaccurate. If \nthe actual market for VP-102 in molluscum, external genital warts, common warts or any other indication we may pursue for VP-102 or for any other \nproduct candidate we may develop is smaller than we expect, our revenues, if any, may be limited and it may be more difficult for us to achieve or maintain \nprofitability.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even \ngreater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product \ncandidates or drugs caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n•\ndecreased demand for any product candidates or drugs that we may develop;\n•\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n•\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n•\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n•\nsubstantial monetary awards paid to trial participants or patients;\n•\nloss of revenue;\n•\nreduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n•\nthe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe currently hold $10 million in product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate, with a per incident limit of $10 million, which may not be \nadequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We may need to increase our insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials or if we commence \ncommercialization of our product candidates. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a \nreasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\n48"

If any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be \nable to timely enter into arrangements with alternative third parties or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, any third parties \nconducting our clinical trials will not be our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot \ncontrol whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical programs. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their \ncontractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is \ncompromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed \nor terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. Consequently, our results of \noperations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase substantially and our ability to generate \nrevenue could be delayed significantly.\nSwitching or adding CROs involves substantial cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a \nnew CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though \nwe intend to carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or \nthat these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and generally do not control their activities. Our reliance on these \nthird parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, \nwe will remain responsible for \n49"

Moreover, the FDA \nrequires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of \nclinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are \nprotected. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, \nClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. If we or any of our \nCROs or other third parties, including trial sites, fails to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed \nunreliable and the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our \nmarketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our \nclinical trials complies with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP conditions. Our failure \nto comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nIn addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive \ncompensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA. The \nFDA may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation \nof the trial. The FDA may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself \nmay be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA and may ultimately lead to the denial \nof marketing approval of VP-102 and any other product candidates.\nWe also expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute product supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our \ndistributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional \nlosses and depriving us of potential revenue.\nWe currently rely on a third party to supply our raw material used in VP-102, and if we encounter any extended difficulties in procuring, or creating an \nalternative for, our raw material in VP-102 or any of our other product candidates we may develop, our business operations would be impaired.\nTo date, we have obtained naturally-sourced cantharidin, which is the raw material used to manufacture the API for VP-102 and is obtained from \nblister beetles, directly or indirectly from suppliers based in the People’s Republic of China, or the PRC. We are exposed to a number of environmental \nrisks, including:\n•\nrisk of contamination being introduced in the beetle population through environmental factors that we cannot control, which would result in \nunexpected anomalies or new impurities in the cantharidin;\n•\nloss of the beetle’s habitat and other similar environmental risks to the beetle population whether due to climate change, over-development, \nor otherwise; and\n•\nrisk of disease in the beetles.\nIn addition, any business, public health or economic challenges our existing supplier faces, whether in the ordinary course or not, could impair its \nability to meet our cantharidin supply needs. Accordingly, there is a risk that supplies of our product may be significantly delayed by or may become \nunavailable for an extended period of time as a result of any issues affecting our supplier’s supply and production of naturally-sourced cantharidin.\nFurthermore, our supplier’s operations may be curtailed or delayed in the event the regulators in the PRC determine that our supplier is not acting in \naccordance with laws or under appropriate permits or licenses. We may also face additional supply chain risks due to the regulatory and political structure \nof the PRC, or as a result of the international relationship between the PRC and the United States or any of the other countries in which our products are \nmarketed. For example, any deterioration in the trade relationship between the U.S. and China, which imposes any restrictions, tariffs or limitations on the \nexport of cantharidin from China would impact our ability to meet our raw material needs. We are also exposed to foreign exchange risks, and fluctuations \nin exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Renminbi could negatively impact the commercial viability of importing cantharidin from the PRC.\n50"

Intermediate compounds in this proposed synthetic process have been successfully \nsynthesized to a pilot scale.  If we are unable to scale the developed process for manufacturing cantharidin synthetically to a satisfactory commercial scale, \nwe may be forced to continue to rely on naturally sourced cantharidin. \nAny extended difficulties we face in maintaining our supply of cantharidin, or limitations we face in increasing our supply to meet commercial \nneeds for VP-102 or any of our other product candidates, whether such cantharidin is naturally sourced or synthetically derived, would impair our business \noperations.\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture of VP-102 for preclinical and clinical testing and expect to continue to do so for commercialization. \nThis reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of VP-102 or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which \ncould delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of \nVP-102, or any other product candidates which we may pursue, for preclinical and clinical testing as well as for commercial manufacture if VP-102 or any \nother product candidate which we may pursue receives marketing approval. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient \nquantities of VP-102 or be able to obtain quantities at an acceptable cost or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our ability to timely conduct our \nclinical trials or our other development or commercialization efforts.\nWe also expect to rely on third-party manufacturers or third-party collaborators for the manufacture of commercial supply of VP-102 or any other \nproduct candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. The facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must \nbe approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities pursuant to inspections that will be conducted prior to approval of our NDA, if at all, and in the \nfuture of additional NDAs or comparable marketing application to the FDA or other regulatory authority. We do not have control over a supplier’s or \nmanufacturer’s compliance with laws, regulations and applicable cGMP standards and other laws and regulations, such as those related to environmental \nhealth and safety matters. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict \nregulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure and maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. For \nexample, on May 24, 2022, we announced that we received a CRL regarding our NDA for VP-102 from the FDA. The only deficiency listed in the CRL \nwas related to the deficiencies identified at a general reinspection at a facility of Sterling that manufactures VP-102. In addition, we have no control over \nthe ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable \nforeign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the \nfuture, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or \nmarket our product candidates, if approved.\nWe may be unable to establish any agreements with future third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish \nagreements with third-party manufacturers, qualifying and validating such manufacturers may take a significant period of time and reliance on third-party \nmanufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n•\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n•\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n•\nthe possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how;\n•\nthe possible increase in costs for the applicator components, raw materials or API in VP-102; and\n•\nthe possible termination or nonrenewal of any agreement by any third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\n51"

There are no assurances we would be able to enter into similar commercial arrangements with other manufacturers that operate under cGMP \nregulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us.

If \nthose collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nOn March 17, 2021, we entered into the Torii Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Torii an exclusive license to develop and commercialize our \nproduct candidates that contain a topical formulation of cantharidin for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum and common warts in Japan, including \nVP-102.

Such agreements may provide us limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators \ndedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. For instance, Torii is responsible for all development activities and specified \ncosts in support of obtaining regulatory approval of the licensed products in Japan, provided that Torii’s activities will be overseen by a joint steering \ncommittee. \nOur ability to generate revenue from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators’ abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to \nthem in these arrangements.\nCollaborations involving our product candidates would pose the following risks to us:\n•\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n•\ncollaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n•\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect \nnot to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators’ strategic \nfocus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n52"

The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to \ncollaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. Collaborations are complex and \ntime- consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical \ncompanies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators.\nWe may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the \ndevelopment of such product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential \ncommercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization \nactivities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to \nobtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further \ndevelop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate revenue.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to any of our product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in \nour market.\nWe plan to rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to \nour product candidates. The issuance, scope, validity, enforceability, strength, and commercial value of patents in the pharmaceutical field involves \ncomplex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain.  Although we currently have several issued United States and foreign patents, other patent \napplications that we own may fail to result in other issued patents with claims that cover the product candidates in the United States or in foreign \njurisdictions. If this were to occur, early generic competition could be expected against our product candidates in development in certain jurisdictions. \nThere may be relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications which could invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing based on a \npending patent application. In particular, because the API in many of our product candidates has been available and used for many years, it is possible that \nthese products have previously been used in such a manner that such prior usage would affect our ability to obtain patents based on our patent applications. \nMoreover, because numerous parties have developed and/or commercialized, or are developing, a wide variety of applicator devices for use with topical \ndermatological medications, it is possible that prior art related to applicator devices could affect our ability to obtain patent protection for our planned \nproduct applicator device or that disputes may arise related to whether third-party applicator devices infringe patents we have applied for.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming. We may not be able to prepare, file, and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent \napplications for a commercially reasonable cost or in a timely manner or in all jurisdictions. It is also possible that we may fail to identify patentable \naspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. \nMoreover, depending on the terms of any future in-licenses to which we may become a party, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing, \nand prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology in-licensed from third parties. Therefore, these patents and patent \napplications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nIn addition to the protection we hope to receive from patents we have applied for, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements \nto protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our drug development \nand reformulation processes that involve proprietary know-how, information, or technology that is not covered by patents. Although we generally require \nall of our employees to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors, and any third parties who have access to our \nproprietary know-how, information, or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have \nbeen duly executed, or that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed. Moreover, our competitors may \nindependently develop knowledge, methods and know-how equivalent to our trade secrets. Competitors could purchase our products and replicate some or \nall of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts for technologies on which we do not have patent protection. If any of our trade \nsecrets were to \n54"

If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our \ncompetitive position would be harmed.\nWe also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical \nand electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or \nsecurity measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Also, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are \ndeemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret. In addition, others may independently \ndiscover our trade secrets and proprietary information. The FDA has recently made changes to its rules that may make it harder for the FDA to withhold \ninformation from the public and may require the FDA to make certain information publicly accessible, and it is not clear how these new rules will be \ninterpreted. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is \nno guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our \nmarket, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may enjoy only limited geographical protection with respect to certain patents and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights \nthroughout the world.\nFiling and prosecuting patent applications and defending patents covering our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be \nprohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products \nand, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement rights are not as strong as that in the \nUnited States or Europe. These products may compete with our product candidates, and our current and future patents or other intellectual property rights \nmay not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nIn addition, we may decide to abandon national and regional patent applications before grant. The examination of each national or regional patent \napplication is an independent proceeding. As a result, patent applications in the same family may issue as patents in some jurisdictions, such as in the \nUnited States, but may issue as patents with claims of different scope or may even be refused in other jurisdictions. It is also quite common that depending \non the country, the scope of patent protection may vary for the same product candidate or technology.\nWhile we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in our expected significant markets, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or \nmaintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our product candidates. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual \nproperty rights in such countries may be inadequate, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates \nin all of our expected significant foreign markets. If we encounter difficulties in protecting, or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting, the \nintellectual property rights important for our business in such jurisdictions, the value of these rights may be diminished, and we may face additional \ncompetition from others in those jurisdictions.\nThe laws of some jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws or rules and regulations in the United States \nand Europe, and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in such jurisdictions. The legal systems \nof certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, \nwhich could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights \ngenerally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in other jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts \nand attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk \nof not issuing as patents, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or \nother remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world \nmay be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nSome countries also have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties.

If \nwe are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement \nor defense of our patents.\nOur ability to obtain patents is highly uncertain because, to date, some legal principles remain unresolved, there has not been a consistent policy \nregarding the breadth or interpretation of claims allowed in patents in the United States and the specific content of patents and patent applications that are \nnecessary to support and interpret patent claims is highly uncertain due to the complex nature of the relevant legal, scientific, and factual issues. Changes in \neither patent laws or interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the \nscope of our patent protection.\nFor example, on September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act \nincludes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted \nand may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, has developed new and untested regulations and \nprocedures to govern the full implementation of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith \nAct, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective in March 2013. The Leahy-Smith Act has also introduced procedures making it \neasier for third parties to challenge issued patents, as well as to intervene in the prosecution of patent applications. Finally, the Leahy-Smith Act contains \nnew statutory provisions that require the USPTO to issue new regulations for their implementation, and it may take the courts years to interpret the \nprovisions of the new statute. It is too early to tell what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business and the protection \nand enforcement of our intellectual property. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding \nthe prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our patents. Further, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases \nin recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain \nsituations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty \nwith respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations \ngoverning patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we have owned or \nlicensed or that we might obtain in the future. An inability to obtain, enforce, and defend patents covering our proprietary technologies would materially \nand adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition.\nSimilarly, changes in patent laws and regulations in other countries or jurisdictions or changes in the governmental bodies that enforce them or \nchanges in how the relevant governmental authority enforces patent laws or regulations may weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents \nthat we may obtain in the future. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as \nthe laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United \nStates and abroad. For example, if the issuance to us, in a given country, of a patent covering an invention is not followed by the issuance, in other \ncountries, of patents covering the same invention, or if any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability, or scope of the claims, or the written \ndescription or enablement, in a patent issued in one country is not similar to the interpretation given to the corresponding patent issued in another country, \nour ability to protect our intellectual property in those countries may be limited. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the \nUnited States and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other \nrequirements imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these \nrequirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, and various other government fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the \nUSPTO and various government patent agencies outside of the United States over the lifetime of our patents and/or applications and any patent rights we \nmay obtain in the future. We rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees. The USPTO and various non-U.S. government patent agencies require \ncompliance with several procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar provisions during the patent \n56"

In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by \npayment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. There are situations, however, in which non-compliance can result in \nabandonment or lapse of the patents or patent applications, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, \npotential competitors might be able to enter the market, and this circumstance could harm our business.\nThe patent applications that we have covering our product candidates are limited to specific formulations, preparations and devices, and methods of \nuse and manufacturing processes, and our market opportunity for our product candidates may be limited by the lack of patent protection for the active \ningredient itself and by competition from other formulations and manufacturing processes, as well as administration methods that may be developed by \ncompetitors.\nCantharidin is a naturally occurring compound found in many species of blister beetles and has been used since ancient times for medicinal \npurposes. Therefore, the composition of matter for the chemical structure of cantharidin itself, which is the API used in our product candidates, is not \neligible for patent protection. We seek to obtain patent protection for our manufacturing technology, drug administering technology, and our product \ncandidates, including specific formulations, preparations and devices, and methods of use and manufacturing processes. Although the protection afforded \nby our patents and patent applications may be significant with respect to VP-102, when looking at the ability of the patents and patent applications to block \ncompetition, the protection offered by the patents and patents applications may be, to some extent, more limited than the protection provided by a patent \nclaiming the composition of matter of an entirely new chemical entity previously unknown. As a result, generic products that do not infringe the claims of \nour patents covering formulations, preparations, devices, methods of use, and manufacturing processes may be available while we are marketing our \nproducts. In general, method of use patents are more difficult to enforce than composition of matter patents because, for example, of the risks that the FDA \nmay approve alternative uses of the subject compound not covered by method of use patents, and others may engage in off-label sale or use of the subject \ncompound. Physicians are permitted to prescribe an approved product for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling. Although off-label \nprescriptions may infringe the method of use patents we have applied for, the practice is common across medical specialties and such infringement is \ndifficult to prevent or prosecute. In addition, competitors who obtain the requisite regulatory approval will be able to commercialize products with the same \nactive ingredient as our product candidates so long as the competitors do not infringe any process, use, formulation, preparation or device patents issued to \nus, protect our product candidates, subject to any regulatory exclusivity we may be able to obtain for our product candidates.\nPatent applications covering products containing the same active ingredient as our product candidates indicates that competitors have sought to \ndevelop and may seek to commercialize competing formulations that may not be covered by our patents and patent applications. The commercial \nopportunity for our product candidates could be significantly harmed if competitors are able to develop and commercialize alternative formulations of our \nproduct candidates that are different from ours and do not infringe our issued patents covering our product candidates, our device, our manufacturing \nprocesses or uses of our product candidates.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe the patents we have been granted. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement \nclaims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. If we initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product \ncandidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product or product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation \nin the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are common, and there are numerous grounds upon which a third \nparty can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. In an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is \nunenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in \nquestion. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such \nmechanisms include re-examination, post grant review, inter partes review (IPR), and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition \nproceedings). Such proceedings could result in revocation of or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates. \nThe outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable.

If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and \nperhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our \npatents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could have a material adverse impact \non our business.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our \npatent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing \nparty. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or \ninterference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may not be \nable to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the \nUnited States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of \nour confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of \nhearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain.\nAs our current and future product candidates progress toward commercialization, the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us increases. \nThere can be no assurance that our current and future product candidates do not infringe other parties’ patents or other proprietary rights, and competitors \nor other parties may assert that we infringe their proprietary rights in any event. We may become party to, or threatened with, adversarial proceedings or \nlitigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our current and future product candidates, including interference or derivation proceedings \nbefore the USPTO. Even if we believe such claims are without merit, a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid, \nenforceable, and infringed, which could have a negative impact on our ability to commercialize VP-102 and any future product candidates. In order to \nsuccessfully challenge the validity of any such U.S. patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. As this burden is a high \none requiring us to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such U.S. patent claim, there is no assurance that a court of competent \njurisdiction would invalidate the claims of any such U.S. patent. Moreover, given the vast number of patents in our field of technology, we cannot be \ncertain that we do not infringe existing patents, or that we will not infringe patents that may be granted in the future. Because numerous parties have \ndeveloped and/or commercialized, or are developing, a wide variety of applicator devices for use with topical dermatological medications, it is possible that \nthird parties may assert that our applicator device infringes patents they own or have applied for. While we may decide to initiate proceedings to challenge \nthe validity of these or other patents in the future, we may be unsuccessful, and courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad could uphold the \nvalidity of any such patent. Furthermore, because patent applications can take many years to issue and may be confidential for 18 months or more after \nfiling, and because pending patent claims can be revised before issuance, there may be applications now pending which may later result in issued patents \nthat may be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of our product candidates. Regardless of when filed, we may fail to identify relevant third-party \npatents or patent applications, or we may incorrectly conclude that a third-party patent is invalid or not infringed by our product candidates or activities. If a \npatent holder believes our drug or product candidate infringes its patent, the patent holder may sue us even if we have received patent protection for our \ntechnology. Moreover, we may face patent infringement claims from non-practicing entities that have no relevant drug revenue and against whom our own \npatent portfolio may thus have no deterrent effect. If a patent infringement suit were threatened or brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay \nresearch, development, manufacturing, or sales of the drug or product candidate that is the subject of the actual or threatened suit.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue \ncommercializing our product candidates.

Alternatively, we may need to redesign our infringing products, which \nmay be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Under certain circumstances, we could be forced, including by court orders, to \ncease commercializing our product candidates. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for substantial monetary damages, \npotentially including treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed. A finding of infringement could prevent us from \ncommercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could harm our business. Any claims by third parties \nthat we have misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nThe cost to us in defending or initiating any litigation or other proceeding relating to patent or other proprietary rights, even if resolved in our favor, \ncould be substantial, and litigation would divert our management’s attention. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent \nlitigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources.

We may also be subject to claims that former employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in our \npatents. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.

We may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting \nobligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Although it is our policy to require our employees and \ncontractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, \nwe may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our \nown, and we cannot be certain that our agreements with such parties will be upheld in the face of a potential challenge, or that they will not be breached, for \nwhich we may not have an adequate remedy. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment agreements may \nbe breached, and litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any \nsuch claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, \nvaluable intellectual property.

We may also conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to share trade secrets under the \nterms of our research and development partnerships or similar agreements. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into \nconfidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting agreements, or other similar agreements with our advisors, \nemployees, third-party contractors, and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the \nrights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when \nworking with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our \ncompetitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our \nproprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor’s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or \ndisclosure could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, these agreements typically restrict the ability of our advisors, employees, third-party contractors, and consultants to publish data \npotentially relating to our trade secrets. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of \nour technical know-how or other trade secrets by the parties to these agreements.

Moreover, if confidential \ninformation that is licensed or disclosed to us by our partners, collaborators, or others is inadvertently disclosed or subject to a breach or violation, we may \nbe exposed to liability to the owner of that confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a third-party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets, \nlike patent litigation, is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less \nwilling to protect trade secrets.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may \nnot adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage.

If we are unable to comply, or \nhave not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nHealthcare providers, including physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation \nand prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, \nprincipal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors may subject us to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws and other healthcare \nlaws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and the law commonly referred to as \nthe Physician Payments Sunshine Act and regulations. These laws will impact, among other things, our clinical research, proposed sales, marketing and \neducational programs, and other interactions with healthcare professionals. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy laws by both the federal \ngovernment and the states in which we conduct or may conduct our business. The laws that will affect our operations include, but are not limited to:\n•\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, \nreceiving, offering or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for the purchase, \nrecommendation, leasing or furnishing of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of \nstatutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are \ndrawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be \nintended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe \nharbor. A person does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. \nIn addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or \ncollectively, the ACA, provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the \nfederal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act and the civil monetary penalties \nstatute;\n•\nthe federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws which \nprohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval \nfrom Medicare, Medicaid or other government payors that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an \nobligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. \ngovernment. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free \nproduct to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been \nprosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved or off-label, and thus \nnon-reimbursable, uses;\n•\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes which \nprohibit, among other things, a person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare \nbenefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or \nmaking any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or \nservices. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific \nintent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; \n•\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing \nregulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the \n61"

HITECH also created new tiers of \ncivil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state \nattorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees \nand costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;\n•\nthe federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, \ndevices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance \nProgram, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to: (i) \npayments or other “transfers of value’’ made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), \nother health care professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals; and (ii) ownership and \ninvestment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n•\nstate and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws; state laws that require manufacturers to report information related to \npayments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that require \npharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance \nguidance promulgated by the federal government, or that otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws \nthat require the reporting of information related to drug prices; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales \nrepresentatives; and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which \ndiffer from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\n•\nU.S. data privacy regulations, such as the CCPA, which creates new individual privacy rights for consumers and places increased privacy and \nsecurity obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households.  The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new \ndisclosures to California consumers, provides such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allows for a \nnew cause of action for data breaches;\n•\nnew U.S. data privacy regulations, such as the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), effective January 1, 2023, which will \nexpand the CCPA.  For example, the CPRA establishes a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the CPRA.  In \naddition, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which differ from the \nCPRA and become effective in 2023.  If we become subject to new data privacy laws, at the state level, the risk of enforcement action against \nus could increase because we may become subject to additional obligations, and the number of individuals or entities that can initiate actions \nagainst us may increase (including individuals, via a private right of action, and state actors).;\n•\nforeign data privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679), or GDPR, which went into effect on May 25, \n2018 and applies to identified or identifiable personal data in electronic or paper form.  Under the GDPR, fines of up to €20.0 million or up to \n4% of the annual global turnover of the infringer, whichever is greater, could be imposed for significant non-compliance. The GDPR includes \nmore stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data and creates additional rights for data subjects, \nincluding a private right of action. Other such foreign data privacy obligations include the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom \n(“UK”) law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK GDPR”); and\n•\ndata localization and cross-border laws and regulations, such as the GDPR, which generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries \noutside of the EEA, such as the United States, which the European Commission does not consider to provide an adequate level of data \nprivacy and security.

The Standard Contractual Clauses, however, require parties \nthat rely upon that legal mechanism to comply with additional obligations, such as conducting transfer impact assessments to determine \nwhether additional security measures are necessary to protect the at-issue personal data.  Moreover, due to potential legal challenges, there \nexists some uncertainty regarding whether the Standard Contractual Clauses will remain a valid mechanism for transfers of personal data out \nof the EEA.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of \nour business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our \nbusiness practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and \nregulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be \nsubject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participating in government \nfunded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity \nagreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm and the curtailment or \nrestructuring of our operations.\nThe risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory \nauthorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will \ncomply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we \nsuccessfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. \nThe shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with \ndifferent compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.\nIf VP-102 or other product candidates that we may identify are approved and we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses of those \nproducts, we may become subject to significant liability. The FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made \nabout prescription products, such as our product candidates, if approved. In particular, generally, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not \napproved by the FDA or such other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product’s approved labeling. However, physicians may, in their independent \nmedical judgment, prescribe legally available products for off-label uses. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of \ntreatments but the FDA does restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. If we are found to have promoted \nsuch off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for \nalleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also required that \ncompanies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. If we cannot \nsuccessfully manage the promotion of our product candidates, if approved, we could become subject to significant liability, which would materially \nadversely affect our business and financial condition.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for VP-102 or any future product candidates, they will remain subject to ongoing regulatory oversight.\nEven if we obtain any regulatory approval for VP-102 or any future product candidates, such product candidates, once approved, will be subject to \nongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promoting, sampling, record-keeping and submitting of \nsafety and other post-market information among other things. Any regulatory approvals that we receive for VP-102 or any future product candidates may \nalso be subject to a REMS, limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain \nrequirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 trials, and surveillance to monitor the quality, safety and efficacy of the drug. \nAn unsuccessful \n63"

We will further be required to immediately \nreport any serious and unexpected adverse events and certain quality or production problems with our products to regulatory authorities along with other \nperiodic reports.\nAny new legislation addressing drug safety issues could result in delays in product development or commercialization, or increased costs to assure \ncompliance. We will also have to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. Promotional communications with \nrespect to prescription drug products are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product’s \napproved label. As such, we will not be allowed to promote our products for indications or uses for which they do not have approval. The holder of an \napproved NDA must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain prior approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or \nmanufacturing process.\nIn addition, drug manufacturers and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and \nother regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP requirements and adherence to commitments made in the NDA or foreign marketing application. If \nwe, or a regulatory authority, discover previously unknown problems with a drug, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or \nproblems with the facility where the drug is manufactured or if a regulatory authority disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of that drug, a \nregulatory authority may impose restrictions relative to that drug, the manufacturing facility or us, including requesting a recall or requiring withdrawal of \nthe drug from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of VP-102 or any future product candidates, a regulatory authority \nmay:\n•\nissue an untitled letter or warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n•\nseek an injunction or impose administrative, civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n•\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n•\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n•\nrefuse to approve a pending NDA or comparable foreign marketing application (or any supplements thereto) submitted by us or our strategic \npartners;\n•\nrestrict the marketing or manufacturing of the drug;\n•\nseize or detain the drug or otherwise require the withdrawal of the drug from the market;\n•\nrefuse to permit the import or export of product candidates; or\n•\nrefuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate \nnegative publicity.

In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a \nparticular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was passed, \nwhich substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and \n64"

The ACA, among other things: (i) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers \nunder the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; (ii) established \nan annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned \namong these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs; (iii) expanded the availability of lower pricing under the \n340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; (iv) increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the \nMedicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the \ntotal rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP; (v) expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs \nby, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for \nindividuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability; (vi) created \na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with \nfunding for such research; and (vii) established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery \nmodels to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.\nThere have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. While Congress has not passed \ncomprehensive repeal legislation, bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \nof 2017, or Tax Act includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain \nindividuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. In addition, \nthe 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminates, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored \nhealth coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the \nBBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as \nthe “donut hole.” In December 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health \nplans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the \nmethod CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued \nthe Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Further, there have been a number \nof health reform measures by the Biden administration that have impacted the ACA. For example, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation \nReduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in \nACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by \nsignificantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the ACA will be \nsubject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden \nadministration will impact the ACA and our business.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare \npayments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013, and due to subsequent legislative \namendments to the statute, will remain in effect until 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in \nMedicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden \nsigned the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average \nmanufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among \nother things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of \nlimitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in \nMedicare and other healthcare funding, which could have an adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our \nfinancial operations.\nAdditionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of \nprescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation \ndesigned to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, \nand reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an \nexecutive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with \n65"

      "text": "multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the Department of Health and Human \nServices, or HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of \npotential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (1) directs HHS to negotiate \nthe price of certain single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (2) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to \npenalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to \nlegal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, \nthe Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report within 90 days on how the Center \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. It is \nunclear how these developments could affect covered hospitals who might purchase our future products and affect the rates we may charge such facilities \nfor our approved products in the future, if any. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to \ncontrol pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product \naccess and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk \npurchasing. \nWe expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in \nadditional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved drug. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government \nprograms may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms \nmay prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drugs.\nIn addition, FDA regulations and guidance may be revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our \nproducts. The Trump administration undertook several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose \nsignificant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA’s ability to engage in routine oversight activities such as implementing statutes through \nrulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. It is difficult to predict how these requirements will be interpreted \nand implemented and the extent to which they will impact the FDA’s ability to exercise its regulatory authority, particularly in light of the new Biden \nadministration. If these executive actions impose restrictions on the FDA’s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal \ncourse, our business may be negatively impacted. Any new regulations or guidance, including implementation of or new guidance regarding the \nframeworks for compounding under Sections 503A and 503B of the FDCA, or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations or guidance, may \nimpose additional costs or lengthen FDA review times for VP-102 or any future product candidates. We cannot determine how changes in regulations, \nstatutes, policies, or interpretations when and if issued, enacted or adopted, may affect our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, \nrequire:\n•\nadditional clinical trials to be conducted prior to obtaining approval;\n•\nchanges to manufacturing methods;\n•\nrecalls, replacements, or discontinuance of one or more of our products; and\n•\nadditional recordkeeping.\nSuch changes would likely require substantial time and impose significant costs, or could reduce the potential commercial value of VP-102 or other \nproduct candidates by authorizing competition in the form of compounded cantharidin products, and could materially harm our business and our financial \nresults. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for any other products would harm our business, financial \ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur business activities may be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.\nOur business activities may be subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which \nwe operate.

Our business is heavily regulated and \ntherefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments.

The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our development \nand commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy.

Competition to hire from this limited \npool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous \npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel.

To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and \nimprove our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel.

In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public \ndisclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market, may increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some \nactivities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice \nmay evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, \nregulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and \nattention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, we \nfail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain some types of insurance, including director and officer liability \ninsurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. \nThe impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on committees \nof our board of directors or as members of senior management.\n72"

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will \nbe the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, subject to and contingent upon a final \nadjudication in the State of Delaware of the enforceability of such exclusive forum provision. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s \nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage \nsuch lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. For example, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery could \nface additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near the State of Delaware. The Court of Chancery and \nfederal district courts may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action \nmay be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Some \ncompanies that adopted a similar federal district court forum selection provision are currently subject to a suit in the Chancery Court of Delaware by \nstockholders who assert that the provision is not enforceable. If a court were to find either choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated \ncertificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other \njurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. For example, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware recently \ndetermined that the exclusive forum provision of federal district courts of the United States of America for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of \naction arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. However, this decision has been appealed and may be reviewed and ultimately overturned by the \nDelaware Supreme Court. If this ultimate adjudication were to occur, we would enforce the federal district court exclusive forum provision in our amended \nand restated certificate of incorporation.\n \nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks or a deficiency in our cyber-security, including but \nnot limited to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of \nrevenue or profits; and other adverse consequences.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to \ndamage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over \nthe Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. Cyberattacks, malicious \ninternet-based activity, and online and offline fraud are prevalent and continue to increase.  These threats are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. \nThese threats come from a variety of sources. In addition to traditional computer “hackers,” threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or misuse), \nsophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors now engage in attacks.  We and the third parties upon which we rely may be subject to a \nvariety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social-engineering attacks (including through phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and \nworms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks (such as credential stuffing), personnel \nmisconduct or error, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other \ninformation technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other similar threats. \nAny of the foregoing could result in a material disruption of our clinical and product development activities and business operations, in addition to \npossibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. For example, the loss or compromise of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing \nclinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data.

      "text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial \nstatements and the related notes to those statements included later in this Annual Report. In addition to historical financial information, the following \ndiscussion contains forward‑looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, beliefs and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual \nresults and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward‑looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to \nthese differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and “Special Note Regarding \nForward‑Looking Statements.” \nOverview\nWe are a dermatology therapeutics company developing medications for skin diseases requiring medical intervention. We are primarily focused on \ndeveloping clinician administered therapies in areas of high unmet need.  Our current product pipeline consists of three product candidates: (i) VP-102, a \npropriety drug-device combination that contains a GMP-controlled formulation of cantharidin which is being developed for potential use in treating \nmolluscum contagiosum, external genital warts and common warts, (ii) VP-315, an oncolytic peptide-based injectable therapy for the potential treatment of \ndermatology oncologic conditions, including basal cell carcinoma, and (iii) VP-103, a second cantharidin based drug device combination for the potential \ntreatment of plantar warts.\n Our lead product candidate, VP-102, is initially being developed for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum, or molluscum, a highly contagious \nand primarily pediatric viral skin disease. There are currently no products approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, nor is there an \nestablished standard of care for any of these diseases, resulting in significant undertreated populations. Molluscum and common warts are two of the largest \nunmet needs in dermatology. VP-102 has the potential to be the first FDA-approved product for molluscum and for its active pharmaceutical ingredient, or \nAPI, to be characterized as a new chemical entity, or NCE, with the five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity associated with that designation. We \nalso believe VP-102 has the potential to qualify for pediatric exclusivity in common warts, which would provide for an additional six months of non-patent \nexclusivity. In addition, our granted patents and pending patent applications include claims drawn to our cantharidin formulations, applicator devices and \nrelated accessories, dosing regimens, methods of preparation including methods of synthesis, and methods of use.\nIn January 2019, we reported positive top-line results from our Phase 3 CAMP-1 and CAMP-2 pivotal trials with VP-102 for the treatment of \nmolluscum. Both clinical trials evaluated the safety and efficacy of VP-102 compared to placebo. In each trial, we observed that a clinically and statistically \nsignificant proportion of subjects treated with VP-102 achieved complete clearance of all treatable molluscum lesions compared to subjects treated with \nplacebo. VP-102 was well-tolerated in both trials, with no serious adverse events reported in VP-102 treated subjects. CAMP-1 was conducted under a \nspecial protocol assessment, or SPA, agreement with the FDA. Based on the results from these trials, we submitted a new drug application, or NDA, to the \nFDA for VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum in September 2019.  In November 2019, we received notice that the FDA accepted the NDA for filing, \nwith a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date of July 13, 2020. In July 2020, we received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the \nFDA for our NDA. We resubmitted our NDA for VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum in December 2020.  In February 2021, we received notice that the \nFDA accepted the resubmitted NDA for filing, with a PDUFA goal date of June 23, 2021 which was subsequently extended to September 23, 2021. \nOn September 17, 2021, the FDA issued a CRL regarding our NDA for VP-102.  According to the CRL, the FDA identified deficiencies at a facility \nof Sterling Pharmaceutical Services, or Sterling, a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, which were unrelated to the manufacturing of VP-102 but \ninstead raise general quality issues at the facility. The FDA did not identify any clinical, safety or product specific CMC deficiencies related to VP-102.  \nFollowing the CRL, on September 22, 2021 we received a General Advice Letter from the FDA with recommendations to improve VP-102’s user interface. \nOn November 5, 2021, we were notified that the inspection of Sterling has been classified as “voluntary action indicated”, or VAI, was closed and that the \nVAI classification will not directly negatively impact FDA’s assessment of our NDA regarding Sterling. With the satisfactory resolution of the facility \ninspection, we resubmitted the NDA for the approval of VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum.  The resubmission was limited to those sections and \nelements of the NDA that were identified as deficiencies in the CRL \n78"

In December 2021 the FDA acknowledged our resubmission of the NDA and assigned a PDUFA goal date of May \n24, 2022.\nOn May 24, 2022, we announced that we received a CRL regarding our NDA for VP-102 from the FDA. The only deficiency listed in the CRL was \nrelated to the deficiencies identified at a general reinspection at a facility of Sterling that manufactured VP-102.  Sterling received notice from the FDA on \nMay 19, 2022 that as a result of the inspection, it is on \"official action indicated\", or OAI, status.  This classification resulted from a week-long reinspection \nof Sterling conducted by the FDA in February 2022 but none of the issues identified by the FDA during the reinspection were specific to the manufacture \nof VP-102.  We were also informed by the FDA that it had completed its review of our NDA and product label, there were no open questions on the NDA \nreview, and the VP-102 label was ready to be communicated.  On June 27, 2022 we held a Type A meeting with the FDA regarding the path forward for the \nresubmission and potential approval of the NDA for VP-102. During the Type A meeting the FDA indicated that it could not accept our NDA resubmission \nwith Sterling listed as the primary manufacturer of the bulk solution for VP-102 if Sterling was on OAI status at the time of resubmission.  Following the \nFDA’s commentary, we selected a new CMO partner to produce the bulk solution, Piramal Pharma Solutions, and the technology transfer process was \ncompleted in January 2023.  On January 23, 2023 we resubmitted the NDA for VP-102 to the FDA. The FDA accepted our NDA resubmission on February \n27, 2023 and assigned a PDUFA goal date of July 23, 2023.\n In addition, we are also developing VP-102 for the treatment of external genital warts. We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the optimal \ndose regimen, efficacy, safety and tolerability of VP-102 in patients with external genital warts in June 2019.  In November 2020, we announced positive \ntopline results from our Phase 2 clinical trial of VP-102 for the treatment of external genital warts.  Based on the results of the Phase 2 trial, we intend to \ninitiate a Phase 3 trial of VP-102 for the treatment of external genital warts and to dose the first patient in the second half of 2024. \nWe also intend to develop our product candidate, VP-315, for the treatment of dermatological oncology indications. The FDA accepted our IND in \nNovember 2021.  We dosed the first patient in a Phase 2 trial of VP-315 in Basal Cell Carcinoma in April 2022. The Phase 2 trial is a three-part, open-\nlabel, multicenter, dose-escalation, proof-of-concept study with a safety run-in designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of VP-315 \nwhen administered intratumorally to adults with biopsy-proven basal cell carcinoma. In Part 1 of the trial, VP-315 demonstrated a favorable safety and \ntolerability profile with no reported serious adverse events.  We expect to initiate Part 2 of the trial in the second quarter of 2023 and Part 3 of the trial in \nthe second half of 2023.\nIn addition, we are conducting necessary drug development activities for VP-103, our second cantharidin-based product candidate, and are \nevaluating when to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of plantar warts.\nIn June 2019, we announced positive topline results from our COVE-1 Phase 2 open label clinical trial of VP-102 for the treatment of verruca \nvulgaris, or common warts. Based on feedback from the FDA regarding a potential Phase 3 trial protocol, we are currently evaluating conducting an \nadditional Phase 2 clinical trial of VP-102 for the treatment of common warts that would be designed to further evaluate the treatment indication, \napplication time, or regimen and long term sustainability.\nOn March 17, 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the Torii Agreement, with Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Torii, \npursuant to which we granted Torii an exclusive license to develop and commercialize our product candidates that contain a topical formulation of \ncantharidin for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum and common warts in Japan, including VP-102.  Additionally, we granted Torii a right of first \nnegotiation with respect to additional indications for the licensed products and certain additional products for use in the licensed field, in each case in \nJapan. Pursuant to the Torii Agreement, we are entitled to receive an up-front payment from Torii of $11.5 million.  On July 25, 2022 Torii dosed the first \npatient in its Phase 3 trial of VP-102 (referred to as TO-208 in Japan) for molluscum contagiosum in Japan, triggering an $8.0 million milestone payment \nrecognized as collaboration revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, we are entitled to receive from Torii an additional $50.0 million in \naggregate payments contingent on achievement of specified development, regulatory, and sales milestones, in addition to tiered transfer price payments for \nsupply of product in the percentage range of the mid-30s to the mid-40s of net sales.

We recognized billed and unbilled collaboration revenue of $0.9 million and $0.1 \nmillion, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2022, related to supplies and development activity pursuant to this agreement.\nIn August 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Lytix Biopharma AS, or Lytix, pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide, \nlicense for certain technology of Lytix to develop VP-315 for use in all malignant and pre-malignant dermatological indications, other than metastatic \nmelanoma and metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma.     \t\nOur strategy is to advance VP-102 through regulatory approval and self-commercialize in the United States for the treatment of several skin \ndiseases. We intend to build a specialized sales organization in the United States focused on pediatric dermatologists, dermatologists, and select \npediatricians. In the future, we also intend to develop VP-102 for commercialization in additional geographic regions, either alone or together with a \nstrategic partner.\nSince our inception in 2013, our operations have focused on developing VP-102, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising \ncapital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and conducting clinical trials. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not \ngenerated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity and equity-linked securities and through \nborrowing under our loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB.\nOn June 19, 2018, we completed an IPO of common stock, which resulted in the issuance and sale of 5,750,000 shares of common stock at a public \noffering price of $15.00 per share, generating net proceeds of $78.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs. We completed \na follow-on public offering of our common stock in March 2021, generating net proceeds of $28.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts and other \noffering costs. In July 2022, we closed a second follow-on public offering in which we sold 13,575,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price \nof $2.10 per share, resulting in total net proceeds of $26.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering expenses. In \nFebruary 2023, we closed an underwritten offering of 750,000 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase 4,064,814 shares of \ncommon stock. The shares of common stock were sold at a price of $6.75 per share and the pre-funded warrants were sold at a price of $6.7499 per pre-\nfunded warrant, resulting in total net proceeds of $30.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering expenses.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022, plus the net proceeds from the February 2023 offering of common \nstock and pre-funded warrants of $30.1 million will be sufficient to support our planned operations into the first quarter of 2024.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses.

If, however, economic uncertainty increases or the global economy worsens, our business, financial condition and results of \noperations may be harmed. For further discussion of the potential impacts of macroeconomic events on our business, financial condition, and operating \nresults, see the section titled “Risk Factors.”\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities \nand the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the \nreported periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the \nresults of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources. Actual \nresults may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nA summary of our significant accounting policies appears in the notes to our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 \nincluded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, we believe that the following accounting estimate is important to understanding and evaluating \nour reported financial results, and we have accordingly included it in this discussion.\nResearch and Development Costs\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and to provide services, including manufacturing of product in \nconnection with the clinical trials. At the end of each reporting period, we compare payments made to third-party service providers to the estimated \nprogress toward completion of the applicable research or development objectives. Such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes \navailable. Depending on the timing of payments to the service providers and the progress that we estimate has been made as a result of the service \nprovided, we may record net prepaid or accrued expense relating to these costs. As of December 31, 2022, we did not make any material adjustments to our \nprior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\n81"

      "text": "JOBS Act\nIn April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \n“emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with \nnew or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards \nwould otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will \nadopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\nSubject to certain conditions, as an emerging growth company, we may rely on certain exemptions, including exemptions from (i) providing an \nauditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) \ncomplying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a \nsupplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and \nanalysis. We will remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2023.\nComponents of Operating Results\nCollaboration Revenue\nWe have not received any revenue from product sales since our inception. Collaboration revenue represents revenue from the Torii Agreement \npursuant to which we granted Torii an exclusive license to develop and commercialize our product candidates that contain a topical formulation of \ncantharidin for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum and common warts in Japan including VP-102.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. We \nexpense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include:\n•\nexpenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct \nour clinical trials and preclinical studies;\n•\nmanufacturing and supply scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial supply and commercial \nsupply, including manufacturing validation batches;\n•\noutsourced professional scientific development services;\n•\nemployee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation;\n•\nexpenses relating to regulatory activities; and\n•\nlaboratory materials and supplies used to support our research activities.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have \nhigher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. \nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase over the next several years as we increase personnel costs, including stock-based \ncompensation, initiate and conduct clinical trials of VP-102 in patients with external genital warts, VP-102 in patients with common warts, VP-315 for \ndermatological oncology indications,VP-103 in patients with plantar warts,  and conduct other clinical trials and prepare regulatory filings for our product \ncandidates.\n82"

      "text": "The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing \nand costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of, or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence \nfrom our product candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials, which \nvary significantly over the life of a project as a result of many factors, including:\n•\nthe number of clinical sites included in the trials;\n•\nthe length of time required to enroll suitable patients;\n•\nthe number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials;\n•\nthe number of doses patients receive;\n•\nthe duration of patient follow-up; and\n•\nthe results of our clinical trials.\nOur expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties, including the manufacturing process for our product candidates, the terms and timing of \nregulatory approvals, and the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights. We may never \nsucceed in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to \ndiscontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of our product candidates. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of \na product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the \nFDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, or if we experience significant \ndelays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of \nclinical development. \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive and administrative functions, \nincluding stock-based compensation, travel expenses and recruiting expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include market research costs, \ninsurance costs, and professional fees for audit, tax and legal services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses, including payroll and related expenses, will increase in the future as we continue to \nincrease our headcount to support the expected growth in our business, expand our operations and organizational capabilities, and prepare for potential \ncommercialization of VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum, if successfully developed and approved. We also anticipate increased expenses associated \nwith general operations, including costs related to audit, tax and legal services, director and officer insurance premiums, and investor relations costs.\nCost of Collaboration Revenue\nThe costs of collaboration revenue consists of  payments for manufacturing supply to support development and testing services pursuant to the Torii \nClinical Supply Agreement.\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception in 2013, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year due \nto our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December 31, 2022, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of \napproximately $118.1 million and $120.7 million, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforwards included in the foregoing totals that were \ngenerated prior to 2018 (federal of approximately $6.9 million) will begin to expire, if not utilized, by 2033. Utilization of the net operating loss \ncarryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation according to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar provisions.\n83"

In February 2023, we closed an underwritten offering of 750,000 \nshares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase 4,064,814 shares of common stock. The shares of common stock were sold at a price of \n$6.75 per share and the pre-funded warrants were sold at a price of $6.7499 per pre-funded warrant, resulting in total net proceeds of $30.1 million, after \ndeducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $34.3 million. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance \nwith our investment policy, primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation.\n In addition, we have an operating lease for office space in West Chester with obligations through September 1, 2027 of $1.8 million including \nimputed interest. \nIndebtedness\n85"

In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product \ncandidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Furthermore, we expect \nto incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we may need to obtain additional funding in connection with our \ncontinuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research \nand development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022, plus the net proceeds from the February 2023 offering of common \nstock and pre-funded warrants of $30.1 million will be sufficient to support our planned operations into the first quarter of 2024.

In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of \na product candidate that we do not expect to be commercially available in the near term, if at all.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly \nbecause our investments, including cash equivalents, are in the form of U.S. Treasury securities, asset-backed securities, and commercial paper. Our \nmarketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. However, due to the short-term nature and low-\nrisk profile of our investment portfolio, we do not expect that an immediate 100 basis point change in market interest rates would have a material effect on \nthe fair market value of our investment portfolio. We have the ability to hold our marketable securities until maturity, and therefore we would not expect \nour operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments.  \nWe are also exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We contract with vendors that are located outside of the \nUnited States, including in China, and certain invoices are denominated in foreign currencies. We are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates in \nconnection with these arrangements. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. As of December 31, 2022, we had minimal or no \nliabilities denominated in foreign currencies.\nInflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and clinical trial costs.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related \nstatements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively, the \nfinancial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December \n31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting \nprinciples.\n \nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to \nthe financial statements, the Company has incurred substantial operating losses since inception that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a \ngoing concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that \nmight result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n \nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial \nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) \n(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and \nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain \nreasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required \nto have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an \nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal \ncontrol over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and \nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in \nthe financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as \nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n \n/s/ KPMG LLP \n  \n \n  \n  \n \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2017.\n \nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nMarch 6, 2023\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n91"

(the “Company”) was formed on July 3, 2013 and is incorporated in the State of Delaware. The Company is a \ndermatology therapeutics company developing medications for skin diseases requiring medical intervention.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company has incurred substantial operating losses since inception and expects to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future \nand may never become profitable. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $163.5 million.  On March 17, 2021, the \nCompany entered into the Torii Agreement (as defined in Note 13), pursuant to which the Company received an upfront payment from Torii \nPharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (\"Torii\") of $11.5 million in April 2021 and an $8.0 million milestone payment in August 2022. On March 25, 2021, the Company \nclosed a follow-on public offering in which it sold 2,033,899 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $14.75 per share, resulting in net \nproceeds of $28.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering expenses. In July 2022, the Company sold 13,575,000 \nshares of common stock at a public offering price of $2.10 per share, resulting in cumulative net proceeds of $26.9 million after deducting underwriting \ndiscounts and commissions, and offering expenses.  On February 23, 2023 the Company sold 750,000 shares of its common stock and pre-funded warrants \nto purchase 4,064,814 shares of common stock. The shares of common stock were sold at a price of $6.75 per share and the pre-funded warrants were sold \nat a price of $6.7499 per pre-funded warrant resulting in net proceeds of $30.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and \noffering expenses of approximately $2.3 million (see Note 14).\nIn March 2020, the Company entered into a mezzanine loan and security agreement (the “Mezzanine Loan Agreement”), with Silicon Valley Bank, \nas administrative agent and collateral agent (the “Agent”), and Silicon Valley Bank and West River Innovation Lending Fund VIII, L.P., as lenders, (the \n“Mezzanine Lenders”), pursuant to which the Company borrowed (i) $35.0 million in March 2020 and (ii) $5.0 million on March 1, 2021.  On July 11, \n2022, the Company voluntarily repaid in full the debt outstanding under the Mezzanine Loan Agreement (see Note 11). \n The Company believes its cash, and cash equivalents of $34.3 million as of December 31, 2022 plus the net proceeds from the February 2023 \noffering of common stock and pre-funded warrants of $30.1 million will be sufficient to support the Company’s planned operations into the first quarter of \n2024. Substantial additional financing will be needed by the Company to fund its operations. The Company's financial statements have been prepared on a \ngoing concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do \nnot include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that \nmight result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company anticipates incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that it can obtain marketing \napproval to sell, and then generate significant sales of VP-102. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going \nconcern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. The Company plans to secure additional capital in the future through equity or \ndebt financings, partnerships, or other sources to carry out the Company’s planned development activities. If the Company is unable to raise capital when \nneeded or on attractive terms, the Company would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its research and development programs or future \ncommercialization efforts.\n \nNote 2—Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of \nAmerica (“GAAP”). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative United States generally accepted accounting \nprinciples as found in the \n96"

      "text": "Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). The \nCompany’s functional currency is the U.S. dollar.\nThe Company has been actively monitoring the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and its impact globally. Management believes the \nfinancial results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were not significantly impacted by COVID-19. In addition, management believes the \nremote working arrangements, travel restrictions and any other regulations imposed by various governmental jurisdictions have had limited impact on the \nCompany’s ability to maintain internal operations during the year. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact the \nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including as a result of \nnew information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain it or treat COVID-19. \nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported \namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of \nexpenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience as well as other pertinent industry \nand regulatory authority information, including the potential future effects of COVID-19, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about \nthe carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ \nmaterially and adversely from these estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and actual results, the Company’s future \nresults of operations will be affected.\nSegments\nOperating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by \nthe chief operating decision-maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. The Company views its operations and \nmanages its business in one operating segment.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of 90 days or less at acquisition to be cash equivalents. \nCash and cash equivalents include cash held in banks and money market mutual funds.\nThe Company classifies its marketable securities as “available-for-sale”, pursuant to ASC 320, Investments—Debt and Equity Securities, carries \nthem at fair market value and classifies them as current assets on its balance sheets. There were no marketable securities as of December 31, 2022.  \nUnrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss included \nin stockholders’ equity. \n \nConcentrations of Credit Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Risk\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk. The \nCompany’s deposits are in accounts at large financial institutions, and amounts may exceed federally insured limits. The Company believes it is not \nexposed to significant credit risk due to the financial strength of the depository institutions in which the funds are held. The Company has no financial \ninstruments with off-balance sheet risk of loss.\n97"

      "text": "Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight line method \nover the expected useful life of the asset, after the assets are placed in service. \n  \nExpenditures associated with upgrades and enhancements that improve, add functionality, or otherwise extend the life of property and equipment are \ncapitalized, while expenditures that do not, such as repairs and maintenance, are expensed as incurred.\n \nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances \nindicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use \nof the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds \nits fair value. Fair value is generally determined using discounted cash flows. No impairment losses have been recorded during the years ended December \n31, 2022 or 2021. The Company generally uses the following depreciable lives for its major classifications of property and equipment:\n \nDescription\n \nUseful lives\nMachinery and equipment\n \n3 - 5 years\nOffice furniture and fixtures and equipment\n \n3 years\nLeasehold improvements\n \nLease Term\nAutomobiles\n \n3 years\nRevenue\nIn accordance with FASB’s ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), the Company recognizes revenue when its customer \nobtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods \nor services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, it performs the following \nfive steps:  \n(i)\nidentify the contract(s) with a customer; \n(ii)\nidentify the performance obligations in the contract; \n(iii)\ndetermine the transaction price;  \n(iv)\nallocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and \n(v)\nrecognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nThe Company applies the five-step model to contracts when it determines that it is probable it will collect the consideration it is entitled to in \nexchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the \nCompany assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations and assesses whether each \npromised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective \nperformance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. \nCollaboration Revenues\nThe Company’s revenues have been solely generated through its licensing and collaboration arrangements. The terms of the arrangements typically \ninclude payments to the Company of one or more of the following: nonrefundable, up-front license fees: regulatory and commercial milestone payments; \npayments for manufacturing supply services; materials shipped to support development; and royalties on net sales of licensed products.  \nIn determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, the Company performs \nthe following steps:  \n98"

For licenses that are bundled with other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined \nperformance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the \nappropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees. The Company evaluates the measure of \nprogress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nMilestone Payments: At the inception of an agreement that includes regulatory or commercial milestone payments, the Company evaluates whether \neach milestone is considered probable of being achieved and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount \nmethod. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone \npayments that are not within the control of the Company or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until \nthose approvals are received. At each reporting period, the Company assesses the probability of achievement of each milestone under its current \nagreements.\nRoyalties: If the Company is entitled to receive sales-based royalties from its collaborator, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, \nand the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales \noccur, provided the reported sales are reliably measurable, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated \nhas been satisfied (or partially satisfied).\nManufacturing Supply and Research Services: Arrangements that include a promise for supply of drug substance or drug product for either clinical \ndevelopment or commercial supply at the licensee’s discretion are generally considered as options. The Company assesses if these options provide a \nmaterial right to the licensee and if so, they are accounted for as separate performance obligations. If not, the supply services are recognized as \ncollaboration revenue as the Company provides the services. \nThe Company receives payments from its licensees based on schedules established in each contract. Amounts are recorded as accounts receivable \nwhen the Company’s right to consideration is unconditional. The Company does not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the \nexpectation at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the licensees and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the \nlicensees will be one year or less.  See Note 13 for a full discussion of the Company’s collaboration arrangements.\nResearch and Development Costs\nThe Company’s research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the Company’s clinical trials, salaries, payroll taxes, \nemployee benefits, and equity-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in ongoing research and development efforts. Research and \ndevelopment costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are \nexpensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.\n99"

      "text": "Fair Value Measurement\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, provides guidance on the development and disclosure of fair value measurements. Under this accounting \nguidance, fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly \ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on \nassumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.\nThe accounting guidance classifies fair value measurements in one of the following three categories for disclosure purposes:\nLevel 1:\t Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2:\t Inputs other than Level 1 prices for similar assets or liabilities that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.\nLevel 3:\t Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and values determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow \nmethodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.\nComprehensive Loss \nComprehensive loss is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions, and other events and circumstances \nfrom non-owner sources. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, comprehensive loss includes net loss and unrealized gain (loss) on marketable \nsecurities. \nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation –Stock Compensation. The Company \nuses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value its stock option awards. For stock-based awards granted to employees, non-employees and to \nmembers of the board of directors for their services, the Company estimates the grant date fair value of each option award and recognizes compensation \nexpense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. \nThe use of the Black‑Scholes option-pricing model requires management to make assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option, the \nexpected volatility of the common stock consistent with the expected life of the option, risk‑free interest rates, and, for grants prior to the Company’s IPO, \nthe value of the common stock. The expected life of stock options was estimated using the “simplified method,” as the Company has limited historical \ninformation to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior for its stock options \ngrants. The simplified method is based on the average of the vesting tranches and the contractual life of each grant. The Company historically has been a \nprivate company and lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the \nhistorical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies in addition to the volatility of the Company's stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on \nU.S. Treasury notes with a term approximating the expected life of the option. Expected dividend yield is zero based on the fact that the Company has \nnever paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. \nThe fair value of restricted stock awards are based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date.\n100"

      "text": "Income Taxes\nIncome taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The \nCompany recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial \nstatements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets \nand liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided, if based \nupon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company \nrecognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit would more likely than not be realized assuming examination by the taxing \nauthority. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well \nas consideration of the available facts and circumstances.\nNet Loss Per Share\nNet loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares \nof common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss per share excludes the potential impact of common stock options and unvested shares of \nrestricted stock because their effect would be anti-dilutive due to the Company’s net loss. Since the Company had a net loss in each of the periods \npresented, basic and dilutive net loss per common share are the same.\nThe table below provides potential shares outstanding that were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per common share, as the \ninclusion of these securities would have been anti-dilutive:\n \n \n \nAs of December 31,\n \n \n \n2022\n   \n2021\n \nShares issuable upon exercise of stock options\n   \n3,932,779     \n3,443,817 \nNon-vested shares under restricted stock grants\n   \n425,000     \n425,000 \nTotal\n   \n4,357,779     \n3,868,817 \n \nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale \nRestrictions. This standard clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity \nsecurity and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. This standard becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2024, and is not expected \nto have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments \n(Topic 326). The standard amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach based on expected losses to estimate \ncredit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren’t measured at fair value through net income. For available-for-sale debt \nsecurities, entities will be required to recognize an allowance for credit losses rather than a reduction in carrying value of the asset. Entities will no longer \nbe permitted to consider the length of time that fair value has been less than amortized cost when evaluating when credit losses should be recognized. This \nnew guidance is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2023 and will not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements and related \ndisclosures.\n101"

Pursuant to the terms of the SA, which had an initial \nterm of twelve months (and was automatically renewable for successive monthly periods), PBM rendered advisory and consulting services to the Company. \nServices provided under the SA included certain business development, operations, technical, contract, accounting and back office support services. In \nconsideration for these services, the Company was obligated to pay PBM a monthly management fee. On October 1, 2019, the SA was amended to reduce \nthe monthly management fee to $5,000 as a result of a reduction in services provided by PBM.\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred expenses under the SA of $60,000, of which $36,000 were \nincluded in general and administrative expenses, and $24,000 were included in research and development expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no payables due to PBM and its affiliates. \nOn September 8, 2022, the Company entered into a clinical service agreement with Clinical Enrollment LLC which is controlled by Bryan Manning, \nthe son of Paul B.

The supply agreement has an initial five-year term, \nwhich is subject to automatic renewal absent termination by either party in accordance with the terms of the supply agreement. Each party also has the right \nto terminate the supply agreement for other customary reasons such as material breach or bankruptcy.   \nDuring 2022 and 2021, the Company executed a purchase order pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase $0.7 million and $0.8 million, \nrespectively of crude cantharidin material and made prepayments of $0.7 million and $0.8 million in each year against the purchase orders.

Each \nshare of common stock is entitled to one vote. Common stock owners are entitled to dividends when funds are legally available and declared by the Board. \nOn March 25, 2021, the Company closed a follow-on public offering in which it sold 2,033,899 shares of common stock at a public offering price of \n$14.75 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $28.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering expenses.

Prior to the effectiveness of the 2018 Plan, the 2013 Plan \nprovided for the grant of share-based awards to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. As a result of the effectiveness of the 2018 Plan, no \nfurther grants may be made under the 2013 Plan.\nThe 2018 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees, and for the grant of nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation \nrights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance-based stock awards and other forms of stock awards to employees, including \nofficers, consultants and directors. The 2018 Plan also provides for the grant of performance-based cash awards to employees, including officers, \nconsultants and directors. The Company initially reserved 3,738,199 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2018 Plan, which is the sum of (1) \n2,198,198 new shares, plus (2) the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2013 Plan at the time the 2018 Plan became effective, plus (3) any \nshares subject to outstanding stock options or other stock awards that would have otherwise returned to the 2013 Plan (such as upon the expiration or \ntermination of a stock award prior to exercise). The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan will automatically \nincrease on January 1 each year, for a period of ten years, from January 1, 2019 through January 1, 2028, by 4% of the total number of shares of the \nCompany’s common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or a lesser number of shares as may be determined by the Board. \nAs of December 31, 2022, 3,108,393 shares were available for grant under the 2018 Plan.\nStock Options\nThe Company’s employee and non-employee stock options generally vest as follows: 25% after 12 months of continuous services and the remaining \n75% on a ratable basis over a 36-month period from 12 months after the grant date.

Upon entering into the Loan Agreements, the Company borrowed $35.0 million in term \nloans from the Mezzanine Lenders (the “Term A Loan”). The Company entered into amendments to the Loan Agreements in October 2020 under which the \nCompany borrowed an additional $5.0 million in term loans (the “Term B1 Loan”), on March 1, 2021.

The Company has not done an analysis to determine whether or not ownership changes have occurred since inception.  \nThe Company will recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2022 and \n2021, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions and no amounts have been recognized in the Company’s statement\nof operations.

In addition, in May 2022 and February 2021, the \nCompany paid Lytix a one-time $1.0 million and $2.3 million payment, respectively upon the achievement by Lytix of a regulatory milestone. The $1.0 and \n$2.3 million payments were recognized in research and development expense in the statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and \n2021, respectively.   The Company is also obligated to pay up to $111.0 million contingent on achievement of specified development, regulatory, and sales \nmilestones, as well as tiered royalties based on worldwide annual net sales ranging in the low double digits to the mid-teens, subject to certain customary \nreductions. The Company’s obligation to pay royalties expires on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis on the later of the expiration or \nabandonment of the last to expire licensed patent covering VP-315 anywhere in the world and expiration of regulatory exclusivity for VP-315 in such \ncountry. Additionally, all upfront fees and milestone based payments received by the Company from a sublicensee will be treated as net sales and will be \nsubject to the royalty payment obligations under the Lytix Agreement, and all royalties received by the Company from a sublicensee shall be shared with \nLytix at a rate that is initially 50% but decreases based on the stage of development of VP-315 at the time such sublicense is granted.\nNote 14–Subsequent Event\nOn February 23, 2023, the Company closed an underwritten offering of 750,000 shares of its common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase \n4,064,814 shares of common stock.

Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no \nmatter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its \njudgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief \nFinancial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and \n15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. \nOur internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting \nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent \nlimitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future \nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or \nprocedures may deteriorate.\nManagement utilized the criteria established in the Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring \nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. \nBased on the assessment, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022 to \nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance \nwith U.S. GAAP.\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial \nreporting pursuant to Section 404(c) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Because we qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, \nmanagement's report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\t\nThere has been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and \n15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially \naffect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.
