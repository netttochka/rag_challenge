In February 2022 the Company applied for three incremental exploration licences which are \nprospective for graphite mineralisation and materially enhance the Mahenge Liandu \nProject's exploration potential. \n2. In March, the Company, pursuant to environmental compliance requirements of the mining license, \nsuccessfully completed the installation of a weather station and has commenced the monthly \ncollection of data. The station records data at 5 second intervals and covers all weather parameters \nincluding temperature, pressure, wind, moon phase, humidity, solar radiation and rainfall. All data \nis automatically uploaded to the cloud. This data is critical to establishing the base line information \nrequired to assist with the planning of the mining operations on the Project. \n3. In addition, the Company has also installed a total of 7 stream gauges and one barotroll in the water \nstreams located at the mine site in March 2022 which will be used for the hydrological studies which \nwill assist in the location and design of infrastructure for the operations. The devices record 3 \nparameters which are temperature, pressure and depth at 5 second intervals. The data from all \ndevices are being manually downloaded at a frequency rate of once per month. \n4. As Part of the ongoing FEED study, the Company cleared pads for geotech drilling at the proposed \nplant Site and tailing dam location. 10 pads were cleared at the tailing storage facility area and 6 \npads were cleared at the plant site area as a part of geotechnical studies and the Company is now \npreparing for Diamond Drilling in the proposed areas \n5. A test pit program has been completed at the proposed plant site, tailing storage facility and the \naccess road areas. A total of 41 test pits with 3 meters depth have been excavated, DCP tested, \nstrata logged, sampled and backfilled. 11 pits have been excavated at plant site, 25 pits excavated \nat tailing storage facility and 5 pits excavated at the access road to the mine site. \n6. The Company was granted the prospecting license PL 119961/ 2022 by the ministry of minerals on \n28 June 2022, for the exploration of graphite minerals. The license area comprises of 19.99 square \nkilometres, located at Isongo and Liandu villages of Ulanga District, in Morogoro Region. \n7. Through the year, the Company’s primary focus was on securing project development funding for \nthe Mahenge Liandu Graphite project while advancing the permitting and local community \nengagement.  \n8. The Company has received an encouraging level of interest in funding the Mahenge Liandu Graphite \nproject and has advanced its discussions with a number of potential finance partners with respect \nto securing project development funding."

The Company continues to collect environmental baseline data as is required for the compliance of \nthe mining lease and to assist in the design and planning of the proposed mining operations. In \naddition, the base line data for temperature, pressure, wind, moon phase, humidity, solar radiation, \nrainfall and stream flow data assists the local community to have access to regional weather data \nfor local planning requirements in the Mahenge region. \n10. Planning underway for Geotech drilling, with the sites now prepared for the drill rig. The information \nfrom the proposed drilling program will enable the detailed design of the plant and tails storage \narea. This information will enhance the data from the test pits that were completed last year. \n11. Logistics routes for the product continue to be assessed to determine the optimum methods to \nensure the final product will enter the market at the desired price level. \n12. Discussions are ongoing with the Government of Tanzania regarding the framework for the 16% \nownership, with draft Shareholder agreements, Articles of Association and Joint Financial model \nbeing submitted to both parties for review. \n13. Ongoing review of quoted portfolio, where the Directors believe there are opportunities for capital \ngains  \n14. Continue to actively review other exciting investment opportunities.  \nDuring the year under review, Armadale continued to operate as a diversified investing group focused \non natural resource projects in Africa. To this end, its portfolio is divided into two groups:  \n \n• \nactively managed investments where the Company has majority ownership of the investment; \nand  \n• \npassively managed investments where the Company has a minority investment, typically in a \nquoted company, and does not have management control.  \n \nCurrently, the Company’s key actively managed investment is the Mahenge Liandu Graphite Project in \nTanzania.  At present, the Company is actively marketing the Project to potential industry partners and \nend users (offtakers) of graphite products.  The Company is also pursuing a range of potential options \nrelating to development finance for the project \n \nPASSIVELY MANAGED INVESTMENTS  \n \nMantengu Mining Limited (formerly Mine Restoration Investments Limited) South Africa  \n \nThe Company’s holding of shares in Mantengu Mining Limited (“MML”) (formerly Mine Restoration \nInvestments Limited), which were fully written off when MML entered administration, have been \nreinstated at their fair value of £105,000 following a reverse takeover by MML and a relisting of its \nshares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange."

      "text": "Armadale Capital Plc \n \n \nPage | 6\nStrategic Report (Continued) \nFor the year ended 31 December 2022 \nQuoted Portfolio  \nThe Company has a portfolio of quoted investments, valued at £1,245,000 on 4 May 2023, principally in \nresource companies where the Directors believe there are opportunities for capital gain. The Company \ncontinues to keep its portfolio under review. The Company’s strategy with its quoted portfolio is to gain \nexposure in projects that have the potential to create short to medium term returns for the Company \nas well as diversify the Company’s exposure to a broader range of commodities while being able to enter \nand exit the position with minimal cost and time.  \nSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT \nThe Company is committed to sustainable development and conducting its business ethically. Given that \nthe Company invests in the mining industry, one of its key focuses is on maintaining a high level of health \nand safety, environmental responsibility, and support for the communities close to its investments. \nCORPORATE INFORMATION \nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties \nThere are known risks associated with the mineral industry, especially in Africa. The Board regularly \nreviews the risks to which the Group is exposed and endeavours to minimise them as far as possible. \nThe following summary, which is not exhaustive, outlines some of the risks and uncertainties currently \nfacing the Group: \n \n• \nAlthough reducing throughout the year under review, COVID-19 continues to have risks for the \nGroup in terms of its ability to travel to and from its projects and ability for key personnel to \naccess its projects.  As previously reported, the impact of COVID-19 on the project is so far \nminimal as the Company’s site activities were substantially completed in 2019. \n• \nThrough the Mahenge Liandu Graphite Project the Group is very exposed to graphite. Graphite \nis a relatively new commodity whose market is being driven by demand in renewable energy. \nThe Company believes it is thus vulnerable to changing global energy policies. \n• \nThe impact of Brexit on companies operating in the UK is still being monitored. Thus far Brexit \nhas not impacted the Group’s ability to raise funds. \n• \nThe exploration for and development of mineral resources involves technical risks, \ninfrastructure risks and logistical challenges, which even a combination of careful evaluation \nand knowledge may not eliminate. \n• \nThere can be no assurance that the Group’s project will be fully developed in accordance with \ncurrent plans. \n• \nFuture development work and subsequent financial returns arising may be adversely affected \nby factors outside the control of the Group. \n• \nThe availability and access to future funding within the global economic environment. \n• \nThe Group operates in multiple national jurisdictions and is therefore vulnerable to changes in \ngovernment policies which are outside its control. The mining regulation changes \nin Tanzania are still being evaluated, however they seem to have minimal impact on investment \nin graphite mining. The Group continues to monitor the implementation of the changes to \nevaluate and mitigate sovereign risks."

The Group’s potential future royalty stream will be affected by fluctuations in \nthe prevailing market price of gold and to variations of the US dollar in which gold sales will be \ndenominated. \n \nSome of the mitigation strategies the Group applies in its present stage of development include, among \nothers: \n \n• \nProactive management to reducing fixed costs. \n• \nRationalisation of all capital expenditures. \n• \nMaintaining strong relationships with government (employing local staff and partial \ngovernment ownership), which improves the Group’s position as a preferred small mining \npartner. \n• \nEngagement with local communities to ensure our activities provide value to the communities \nwhere we operate. \n• \nAlternative and continued funding activities with a number of options to secure future funding \nto continue as a going concern. \n \nThe Directors regularly monitor such risks and will take actions as appropriate to mitigate them. The \nGroup manages its risks by seeking to ensure that it complies with the terms of its agreements, and \nthrough the application of appropriate policies and procedures, and via the recruitment and retention \nof a team of skilled and experienced professionals. \n \nKey Performance Indicators \n \nThe Group’s current key performance indicators (‘KPIs’) are the performance of its underlying \ninvestments, measured in terms of the development of the specific projects they relate to, the increase \nin capital value since investment and the earnings generated for the Group from the investment. The \nDirectors consider that it is still too early in the investment cycle of any of the investments held, for \nmeaningful KPIs to be given. \n \nSuccess is also measured through the identification and investment in suitable additional opportunities \nthat fit the Group’s investment objectives. \n \nSection 172 Statement \nSection 172(1): A director of a company must act in the way he considers, in good faith, would be most \nlikely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole, and in doing so \nhave regard (amongst other matters) to —"

Our opinion is not modified in respect \nof this matter. \nWe considered going concern to be a key audit matter based on our assessment of the risk and the \neffect on our audit."

We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material \nmisstatement in the financial statements.  In particular, we looked at where the directors made \nsubjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making \nassumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.  As in all our audits we also \naddressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there is \nevidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. \n \nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an \nopinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account our understanding of the Group and \nits environment, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.  \nWe planned our work to include sufficient work in respect of the parent company and the subsidiaries \nto enable us to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. \n \nThe risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of \nour resources and effort, are identified in the Key audit matters section below.  We have also set out \nhow we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial \nstatements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in \nthis context.  This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit."

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the \nfinancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate \nopinion on these matters.  \nGoing concern \nSee relevant section above. \n \nCarrying value of exploration and evaluation assets \nThe exploration and evaluation assets of the Group represent the key assets on the Group’s statement \nof financial position.  \nThere are a number of estimates and judgements used by management in assessing the Exploration and \nEvaluation assets for indicators of impairment under accounting standards. These estimates and \njudgements are set out in note 2.10, note 2.13 and note 3 to the financial statements and the \nsubjectivity of these estimates along with the material carrying value of the assets make this a key audit \narea.  \nHow the scope of our audit responded to the risk: \nWe considered the indicators of impairment applicable to the Mahenge Liandu exploration asset, \nincluding those indicators identified in IFRS 6: ‘Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’ and \nreviewed management’s assessment of these indicators. The following work was undertaken:  \n• \nWe discussed the progress of the project and the progress of the relevant licence applications \nwith management and the directors \n• \nWe reviewed relevant documentation pertaining to the above \n• \nWe reviewed the appropriateness of the costs capitalised in accordance with IFRS 6: \n‘Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’. \n• \nWe made specific enquires of management and reviewed market announcements which \nconfirmed the plan to continue investment in the Mahenge Liandu project subject to sufficient \nfunding being available, as disclosed in note 2.2 \n• \nWe have reviewed the adequacy of disclosures provided within the financial statements in \nrelation to the impairment assessment against the requirements of the accounting standards.  \nKey observations:  \n \nBased on our work we concur with management’s conclusion that no impairment was required and \nconsider the disclosures included in the financial statements to be appropriate."

We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results \nof our work.  \n \nBased on our professional judgement we determined materiality for the consolidated financial \nstatements as a whole to be £150,000 and for the parent company financial statements to be £140,000 \nbased upon 2% of net assets. \n \nWe consider net assets to be the financial metric of the most interest to shareholders and other users \nof the financial statements, given the Group’s status as an entity in natural resources development and \ninvestment, and therefore consider this to be an appropriate basis for materiality. \nWe agreed with the board that we would report to them all individual audit differences identified during \nthe course of our audit in excess of £6,000. We also agreed to report differences below these thresholds \nthat, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.  \nOther information \nThe Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the \ninformation included in the annual report and accounts, other than the financial statements and our \nauditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information \nand, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of \nassurance conclusion thereon. \nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other \ninformation and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the \nfinancial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially \nmisstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are \nrequired to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a \nmaterial misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude \nthat there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.  \nWe have nothing to report in this regard. \nOpinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 \nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: \n• \nthe information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for \nwhich the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and \n• \nthe strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable \nlegal requirements."

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that \nan audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it \nexists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the \naggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the \nbasis of these financial statements.  \n \nBecause of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, \nincluding those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with \nregulation. This risk increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the \nevents and transactions reflected in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware \nof instances of non-compliance.  \n  \nThe risk is also greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud \ninvolves intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation."

The name of the Company was changed to Armadale Capital Plc on \n2 July 2013. Its registered office is 1 Arbrook Lane, Esher, Surrey, KT10 9EG. The Company is \ndomiciled in the UK.  \n2. \nAccounting policies \n2.1. Statement of compliance \nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial \nReporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the United Kingdom.  \nThe principal accounting policies are set out below.  \n \n2.2    Going Concern   \n \nThe financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis as, in the opinion of the \nDirectors, there is a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company will continue in \noperational existence for the foreseeable future. \n \nAt 31 December 2022, the Group had cash of £1,046,000 (2021, £886,000) and no debt finance \n(2021, nil). \n \nAt 4 May 2023, the Company had cash of  £737,000 and listed investments with a traded value of  \n£1,245,000. The Directors have prepared a cash flow forecast for the next twelve months which \nshows that the cash in hand together with expected further receipts is sufficient to meet current \ncommitments in respect of exploration expenditure and corporate overheads for a period of at \nleast twelve months, after which further fundraising will be required. \n \nThe Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and to achieve its long term strategy of \ndeveloping its exploration projects is dependent on further fundraising. Against the background \nof the encouraging progress with the Mahenge Liandu graphite project and the Company’s history \nof raising funds through the issue of equity, the Directors consider that there is a reasonable \nexpectation that the required capital will be raised. However, there are currently no binding \nagreements in place. Should the Directors be unable to raise sufficient funds, the Company may \nbe unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. \n \nThese factors indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast doubt over the \nGroup’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not \ninclude the adjustments that would result if the Group or Company were unable to continue as a \ngoing concern."

Basis of consolidation \nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and \nentities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved where the Company has \nthe power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from \nits activities. \nThe results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the \nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income from the effective date of acquisition and up \nto the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. \nWhere necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their \naccounting policies into line with those used by the Group. \nAll intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on \nconsolidation.  \n2.4. Acquisitions of exploration licences \nThe acquisition of the Group’s exploration projects was principally the acquisition of mining \nlicences effected through non-operating corporate structures. As the structures do not represent \nbusinesses, it is considered that the transactions do not meet the definition of business \ncombinations.  Accordingly each transaction is accounted for as the acquisition of an asset. When \nfuture consideration for shares is contingent, the fair value of the contingent shares at the \nacquisition date is recognised as part of the cost of the asset. The probability of the contingent \nevents being satisfied is included in the calculation of the fair value of the contingent shares. The \nfair value of the contingent shares is also recognised in equity as at the acquisition date and is not \nsubsequently revalued. \n \n2.5. Foreign currencies \nThe individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the \nprimary economic environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency). For the \npurpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group \nentity are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the \npresentation currency for the consolidated financial statements. \nTransactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are \nrecognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each \nreporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates \nprevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign \ncurrencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. \nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not \nretranslated. Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they \narise.  On disposal of foreign subsidiaries, accumulated exchange movements arising in the \nrevaluation of overseas assets and liabilities are released from foreign exchange reserve to the \nprofit and loss account."

Foreign currencies (continued) \nFor the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the \nGroup’s foreign operations are expressed in Pounds using exchange rates prevailing at the end of \nthe reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for \nthe period, unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly during that period, in which case the \nexchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are \nrecognised in other comprehensive income. \n2.7. Cash and cash equivalents \nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, with a maturity date of less than \nthree months from inception. \n2.7. Share-based payments \n \nIFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ requires the recognition of equity-settled share-based payments at \nfair value at the date of grant and the recognition of liabilities for cash-settled share based \npayments at the current fair value at each reporting date. \n \nThe Group provides benefits to employees and service providers (including senior executives) of \nthe Group in the form of share based payments, whereby employees render services in exchange \nfor shares or rights over shares (equity-settled transactions).  \n \nWhere the equity-settled transactions are share options their cost is measured by reference to \nthe fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is \ndetermined by using a Black-Scholes model.  \nIn valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other \nthan market conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company, if applicable.  \n \nThe cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in \nequity, over the period in which the performance and/or other service conditions are fulfilled, \nending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (the \nvesting period). \nThe cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until \nvesting date reflects (i) the extent to which the vesting period has expired and (ii) the Group’s \nbest estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. No adjustment is \nmade for the likelihood of market performance conditions being met as the effect of these \nconditions is included in the determination of fair value at grant date. The profit and loss account \ncharge or credit for a period represents the movements in cumulative expense recognised as at \nthe beginning and end of that period."

Share-based payments (continued) \n \nIf an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, \nand any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new \naward is substituted for the cancelled award and designated as a replacement award on the date \nthat it is granted, the cancelled and new award are treated as if they were a modification of the \noriginal award. The dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding options is reflected as additional share \ndilution in the computation of earnings per share. \nShare based payments in respect of third party services are measured by reference to the value \nof services provided and share price at the relevant date. \n2.8. Warrants \nWarrants issued as part of financing transactions in which the holder receives a fixed number of \nshares on exercise of the warrant are fair valued at the date of grant and recorded within the \nwarrant reserve. Fair value is measured by the use of the Black Scholes model. On expiry or \nexercise, the fair value of warrants is credited to reserves as a change in equity. \n \n2.9. Taxation \n \nIncome tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. \nCurrent Tax \nThe tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. The Group’s liability for current \ntax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of \nthe reporting period. \nDeferred tax   \nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and \nliabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of \ntaxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary \ndifferences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences \nto the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those \ndeductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not \nrecognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other \nthan in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither \nthe taxable profit nor the accounting profit. \nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and \nreduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available \nto allow all or part of the asset to be recovered."

Taxation \n \nDeferred tax (continued) \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the \nperiod in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that \nhave been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement \nof deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the \nmanner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the \ncarrying amount of its assets and liabilities.  \nDeferred tax and current tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable \nright to set off when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the \nGroup intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. \nCurrent and deferred tax for the period \nCurrent and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in profit or loss, except when \nthey relate to items that are recognised outside profit or loss (whether in other comprehensive \nincome or directly in equity), in which case the tax is also recognised outside profit or loss, or \nwhere they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business \ncombination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination. \n \n2.10. Exploration and evaluation costs \nOnce an exploration licence or an option to acquire an exploration licence has been obtained, all \ncosts associated with exploration and evaluation are capitalised on a project-by-project basis \npending determination of the feasibility of the project. Costs incurred include appropriate \ntechnical and administrative expenses and a pro-rata share of the Group’s finance costs but not \ngeneral overheads. If a mining property development project is successful, the related \nexpenditures will be amortised over the estimated life of the commercial ore reserves on a unit \nof production basis. Where a licence is relinquished, a project is abandoned, or is considered to \nbe of no further commercial value to the Company, the related costs will be written off to the \nstatement of comprehensive income in the period the impairment is identified. Unevaluated \nmineral properties are assessed at reporting date for impairment in accordance with the policy \nset out below. If commercial reserves are developed, the related deferred development and \nexploration costs are then reclassified as development and production assets within property, \nplant and equipment."

Investments \n \nInvestments in subsidiary companies and joint ventures are stated at cost less any provision for \nimpairment, which is recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income in the \nperiod the impairment is identified.  \n \n \nAll other investments are measured at fair value with changes recognised in the statement of \ncomprehensive income. \n2.12. Impairment of assets  \nAt the end of each reporting period, the Directors review the carrying amounts of assets to \ndetermine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If \nany such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine \nthe extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable \namount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-\ngenerating unit to which the asset belongs.  \nWhere a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also \nallocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest \ngroup of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be \nidentified. \nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value \nin use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax \ndiscount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks \nspecific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.  \nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its \ncarrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its \nrecoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the \nrelevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, whereby impairment is first allocated to the \nrevaluation reserve, to the extent that it has been previously revalued, with any excess taken to \nthe profit or loss. \nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-\ngenerating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the \nincreased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been \ndetermined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in \nprior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately profit or loss, unless the \nrelevant asset is carried at a re-valued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss \nis recognised in other comprehensive income."

Financial assets \nLoans and receivables are recognised when the Company and Group become party to the \ncontractual provisions of the financial instrument. \nTrade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that \nare not quoted in an active market are classified as ‘loans and receivables’.

Use of available information and the application of \njudgement are inherent in the formation of estimates. Actual results in the future could differ \nfrom these estimates which may be material to the annual financial statements. The Directors \nconsider that the significant sources of estimation uncertainty relate to the value of the Group’s \nexploration assets, to share based payment charges and to the accounting treatment of \ncompound financial instruments.  \nThe principal significant estimates and judgements are: \nGoing concern  \nThe financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis as, in the opinion of the \nDirectors, there is a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in operational existence \nfor the foreseeable future, as explained more fully in note 2.2. \nExploration and evaluation assets \nThese represent the accumulated costs, including capitalised finance costs, (calculated as that \nproportion of total finance costs that relates to the funding of exploration activity) and the \nallocation of wages and salaries to the Group exploration projects. Their commercial realisation \nis dependent upon the successful economic development of the graphite deposits and should the \ndevelopment not be achieved, an impairment of these assets would arise. At the year end, the \nDirectors having taken into consideration the progress made on the project in respect of \nenvironmental approval and metallurgical test results, were of the opinion that there were no \nindicators of impairment in respect of the Mahenge project. \nImpairment of investment in and debts owing by subsidiaries  \nInvestments in subsidiaries represent the accumulated costs that the parent Company has \ninvested in its subsidiaries to fund the mineral projects. The recovery of these investments is \ndependent upon the successful economic development of the graphite deposits and should the \ndevelopment not be achieved, an impairment of these investments would arise.   \nManagement has assessed the intercompany loans in line with IFRS 9 with the calculation of \nexpected credit losses considered a key judgement.

The \npolicies on other financial risks are set out below. \n \nFinancial risk factors \n \nThe risk in relation to financial assets is considered to be minimal and is managed on a day-to-day \nbasis.  \n \nThe Group and Company is exposed to liquidity risk, currency risk and capital risk management \narising from the financial instruments it holds. The Company has receivables from its subsidiaries \nas disclosed in note 14. The recovery of these receivables is dependent on whether the mining \nprojects are successful and they are not expected to be recovered in the short term. The risk \nmanagement policies employed by the Group and Company to manage these risks are discussed \nbelow: \n \nLiquidity risk \n Liquidity risk is the risk that arises when the maturity of assets and liabilities does not match. The \nGroup and Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking \nfacilities, by monitoring cash flows and managing the maturity profiles of financial assets and \nliabilities within the bounds of contractual obligations.  \n \nCurrency risk \nCurrency risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in \nforeign exchange rates. Currency risk arises when future commercial transactions and recognised \nassets and liabilities are denominated in a foreign currency that is not the relevant Company’s \nfunctional currency. The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency \nexposures, primarily with respect to the US and Australian Dollar. The Group’s management \nmonitors the exchange rate fluctuations on a continuous basis.  The Group’s loans are \ndenominated in GBP as disclosed in note 15. \n \nCapital risk management \n \nThe Group and Company manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going \nconcern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and \nequity balance. This is done through the monitoring of cash flows. \n \nThe capital structure of the Group and Company consists of cash and cash equivalents, equity \nattributable to equity holders of the parent, (comprising issued capital and reserves less \naccumulated losses) and loan notes."

The \nvalue of the projects is vulnerable to fluctuations in the prevailing market price of this commodity. \nOther market price risk \nThe Group holds some strategic equity investments in other companies as shown in note 12. The \nGroup and Company believe that exposure to market price risk from this activity is acceptable. \nCredit risk \nThe Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its cash balances. This risk is considered limited \nbecause the Group cash is held by reputable institutions. The Group’s total credit risk amounts to \nthe total of the sum of receivables and cash. At the year-end this amount was £1,196,000 (2021 - \n£1,036,000).  \nThe parent Company financial statements include amounts due from subsidiaries as disclosed in \nNote 13.

Financial instruments are initially recognised at fair \nvalue with subsequent measurement depending on classification. Classification of financial \ninstruments depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired or issued, \ntheir characteristics, and the Company’s designation of such instruments. \nThe Group’s and Company’s financial instruments are all subsequently recognised at amortised \ncost, save for listed investments and derivative liabilities which are recognised at fair value."
